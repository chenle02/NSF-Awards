Modern software tends to be service-oriented, long running, and interactive. The
interaction can be external, such as waiting on a user input or a network
package, or internal, where the components that make up the application interact
with one another, often asynchronously. It is important that interactive
applications run fast on commodity multicore hardware, because fast interactions
lead to good user experiences, and multicore processors are the bargain
components of today's hardware technology. Fast interactive parallel
applications can be challenging to develop, however, as the programmer must deal
with multiple non-trivial concerns simultaneously, including asynchrony,
concurrency, and ensuring application responsiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project focuses on developing software infrastructure to enable non-expert
programmers to write parallel interactive applications that run fast on
multicore hardware. The resulting platform provides: (1) a high-level language
abstraction that decouple parallelism and concurrency specifications from
scheduling and encapsulate nondeterminism; (2) a provably and practically
efficient scheduler that achieve various desirable performance criteria; (3) a
well-defined cost model to reason about the performance of the computation; and
(4) a set of efficient tools to debug code written using the abstraction. The
resulting platform enables programmer productivity in developing parallel
interactive applications and efficient utilization of multicore hardware. The
research results from this project is disseminated broadly though top parallel
computing conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
