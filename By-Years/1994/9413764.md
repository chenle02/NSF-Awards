This proposal outlines a request for instrumentation acquisition to support
student/faculty research in molecular analysis of enzyme assembly. The goal of
this project is to build a molecular biology laboratory that will support
research on the assembly and function of the proton- translocating ATPase in the
yeast vacuolar membrane (V- ATPase). This instrumentation request includes 1) a
tabletop ultracentrifuge, 2) an automated low pressure chromatography system, 3)
DNA sequencing equipment, 4) an imaging densitometer, 5) nucleic acid
hybridization equipment, 6) a cell electroporator, and 7) yeast culturing
equipment. Each instrument supports a specific experimental approach that is an
integral part of the research program described in this proposal.
