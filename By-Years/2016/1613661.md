Cognitive radio (CR) is a revolutionary paradigm that releases spectrum and
enables secondary users (SUs) to opportunistically access under-utilized
spectrum. Due to the great economic value of spectrum, CR technology has also
promoted many spectrum-trading designs in cognitive radio networks (CRNs).
Unfortunately, most existing designs rely on the premise that the SUs hand-held
devices have powerful CR capability, which may not be easily embedded into
lightweight small-sized radios of SUs' devices. Besides, existing designs mainly
focus on per-user based spectrum trading for single-hop communications, and lack
deep understanding of multi-hop end-to-end service provision. Moreover, the
prevalent idea of choosing the best band makes secondary services vulnerable to
interruption due to the returns of primary users. Finally, to facilitate
spectrum trading, more accurate information of spectrum availability should be
provided. Motivated by these facts, this project aims to construct a framework
to investigate the spectrum trading in multi-hop CRNs, which includes the study
of (1) designing a novel CRN architecture to facilitate the accessing of SUs
without CR capability, (2) extending spectrum trading for multi-hop CR
communications, (3) harvesting spectrum under spectrum uncertainty, and (4)
constructing a fine-grained mobile spectrum map. The results of this project can
advance the state of the art in spectrum trading designs and enrich the
scientific knowledge of network designs and network economics. The project is
thus crucial to the success of CRNs, which can provide great opportunities for
job creation, greater productivity, and economic growth. This project also
involves research publications/talks, curriculum development, minority student
recruitment, training and mentoring, and outreach to K-12 students.
