The research is a continuation of work begun under a National Institutes of
Health grant to Dr. Lillard to examine young children's understanding of
pretense. This issue has recently become of critical interest in the realm of
early social understanding, as many think pretending might be the venue by which
understanding the mind proceeds. Dr. Lillard's past work suggests that children
do not in fact have a good grasp of the mental underpinnings of pretense,
whereas some very recent work coming from other laboratories suggests perhaps
they do. The four research studies being carried out are designed to address
these discrepancies. The interactive activities include a speaker series
bringing five top women psychologists to the department, and a discussion series
for women graduate students addressing professional development issues pertinent
to women in psychology. Dr. Lillard will also run a graduate level seminar on
pretend play and understanding the mind.
