The US-USSR Agreement on Cooperation in the Field Environmental Protection has
had several sustained Arctic activities since its beginning in 1972. Area V
deals with Biosphere Reserves and specific projects on northern wildlife, marine
resources, and plants. Five projects under Area X, Arctic and Subarctic
Ecosystems, were formally agreed to at the January 1990 US-USSR Joint Committee
meeting in Washington D.C. These include protection of the environment under oil
and gas development, regional planning, ecological and cultural monitoring,
cryospheric processes, and joint activities adjacent to the Bering Sea. This
Interagency Agreement will facilitate exchange of personnel during 1990 under
Areas V and X of the Agreement. These activities deal with Alaska, the Soviet
Far East and Siberia. A Soviet group will visit Alaska in June to exchange
information on environmental and operational practices associated with gas and
oil developments. And several small teams of scientists will participate in
field investigations including visits in the Noatak Biosphere Reserve, Alaska,
and Taimyr Peninsula, Siberia. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will be
responsible for the technical administration of the joint activities. The Arctic
Staff of the Division of Polar Programs co-chairs Area X with the U.S.
Geological Survey. Soviet groups include several Institutes of the Academy of
Science, Gas Ministry, and the State Committee for Nature Protection. The U.S.
interagency cooperation fulfills U.S. Arctic Research Policy developed under the
Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984, to pursue mutually beneficial
international activities. It also fulfills a growing concern to protect the
Arctic environment.
