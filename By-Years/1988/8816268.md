This work is a continuation of earlier efforts on melt migration in a dynamic
earth, with emphasis on the interplay between large scale solid flow and melt
migration. The distribution of partial melting in the mantle wedge above a
subducting slab will be modeled with emphasis on whether a reverse (upward) flow
is possible in this region, transporting hot mantle into the volcanic zone. 3-D
instabilities of the "cylindrical diapirs" along mid-ocean ridges and subduction
zones will be studies, including the heretofore neglected effects of melt
migration.
