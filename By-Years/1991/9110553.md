A one-month time series of high-resolution current profiles in the upper 300 m
in the Western Pacific Warm Pool will be collected with side-looking and down-
looking Doppler sonars. The purpose of the study is to characterize the internal
wave field generated by westerly wind bursts and the effects on mixing and
fluxes near the Ocean-Atmosphere interface. The observations will take place in
late 1992 to early 1993 during the Intensive Observation Period (IOP) of the
Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere's Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Response Experiment
(TOGA COARE). The goal of the experiment is to understand and describe the
oceanic response to Westerly wind bursts and rainfall.
