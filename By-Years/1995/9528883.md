9528883 Fang This award supports the management of the International Symposium
on Environmental Geotechnology to be held in San Diego, California, on June
10-12, 1996. The Symposium's intent is to cover both basic concepts and field
applications in a well-balanced presentation. The purpose of this symposium is
also to promote a significant educational purpose. All educators and their
students will have an opportunity to joint with practical engineers to discuss
the highly interdisciplinary matters presented by environmental geotechnology.
Two unique panel discussions are planned: 1) Geotechnology: the next generation,
and 2) From practice back to theory. Short courses, workshops, and exhibition
displays are also planned to advance the concept of environmental technology and
provide a forum for idea exchange ***
