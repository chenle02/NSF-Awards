This Engineering Research Equipment Grant will aid the principal investigators
work in millimeter wave (MMW) research. This work is supported by NSF in two
major areas: MMW device and circuit analysis and design, and MMW remote sensing
of geophysical media. In the remote sensing area, the major objective is the
development of basic information of the MMW propagation and scattering in random
and inhomogeneous media including snow, vegetation, and ground. Experimental
studies have been conducted using the truck mounted MMW radars. Based on
experimental data, theoretical models for snow, vegetation, and trees have been
developed. However, to understand the fundamental process of MMW interaction
with random media, controlled experiments need to be conducted, but efforts have
been limited by a lack of suitable MMW system. In their study of MMW devices and
circuits, the principal investigators have developed a number of computer codes
which perform a very accurate analysis of a wide variety of planar circuit
elements. These programs will be incorporated into a user friendly CAD package.
In addition, MMW circuits will be fabricated and tested in order to check our
analytical models. The proposed MMW measurement and design system should enhance
the ability to conduct experiments and develop new theoretical models.
