9503624 Hey This renewal will support continued analysis of data collected to
examine the structure of a section of the mid-ocean ridge system which is
spreading at the fastest rates known. The results will provide insight into the
formation of microplates and deformation of ocean crust, and the space-time
evolution of ridge segments. ***
