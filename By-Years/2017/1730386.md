The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to greatly
enhance the effectiveness of cell therapies for diseases such as cancer and
cardiovascular degeneration that accounted for almost half of all US deaths in
2015. Cellular therapies involve implanting cells into a patient with the goal
of treating disease, such as immune cells to target and kill cancer or insulin-
secreting cells for the treatment of diabetes. A major challenge is to monitor
the cells after their introduction, both for continued survival and for
function. This I-Corp project would explore the commercialize potential of a
technology that could be used in current cell therapies and during development
of new ones. This technology could dramatically reduce the multibillion-dollar
therapeutic development costs by providing crucial information regarding how
therapeutic cells function in animals during laboratory tests, and could
significantly improve bio-manufacturing efficiency, a category that accounts for
more than 25% of the cost to produce cell therapies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
I-Corps project aims to develop a technology platform that would allow cells to
report on their function by secreting a small RNA molecule (barcode) into the
bloodstream. Depending on how it is introduced into the genome of the cell, this
barcode could report on the continued persistence of the cells or on whether the
cells are expressing a particular gene and therefore performing a specific
function. Multiple barcodes could be combined to report on cellular persistence
and several functions simultaneously. This technology will allow, for the first
time, the monitoring of function of implanted cells inside animals. In the
future, it may be possible to engineer cancer-fighting immune cells to express a
barcode and implant the cells into mice bearing cancer. This barcode will report
on the increase or decrease of the number of therapeutic cells. It may also be
possible to engineer the cells to report each time a cancer cell is encountered
by secreting a different barcode.
