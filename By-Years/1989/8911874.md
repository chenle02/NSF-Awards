The goal of the project is to integrate high resolution sedimentary records to
assess paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic change in the northeastern Indian
Ocean during the last 3.5 myr. Using the sedimentary section from ODP Site 758
the PI will synthesize records of stable isotopes CaCO3, foraminiferal faunal
assemblages, volume magnetic susceptibility, and terrigenous concentration and
grain size. These data will allow to document: 1) monsoon variability; 2)
spatial gradients in sea-surface temperature and salinity, 3) surface-to-deep
water gradients in nutrient concentration; 4) the regional oceanographic and
climatic effects of glacial/interglacial fluctuations; and 5) terrigenous
accumulation in light of the geologically recent and rapid uplift of the
Himalayan-Tibetan Plateau region. The long-term decrease %CaCO3 and increase in
magnetic susceptibility observed since the Late Miocene in the Bay of Bengal is
tentatively attributed to this uplift.
