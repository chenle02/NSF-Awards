The purpose of this project is to analyze the strategic aspects of international
agreement on the abatement of emissions that cause transboundary pollution. Some
researchers have suggested that the problem of obtaining international
cooperation has the structure of a prisoners' dilemma game in that all parties
would be better off if they cooperated, but any one of them has an incentive to
cheat or break the rules. Two important questions are raised about the
appropriateness of using the this framework for analyzing international
agreements related to pollution problems. One is whether the prisoners' dilemma
construct is appropriate in this context. And the second is whether, even if it
is, a cooperative solution will not be forthcoming. Cooperation is more likely
to occur in a repeated game situations, where the same parties face each other
time after time as is often the case with international relations. This research
will develop a theoretical framework for analyzing the evolution of cooperation
between countries in the area of international abatement control. Such
cooperation can emerge via coalitions in a cooperative framework, or by tacit
agreements that emerge via trigger strategies in repeated games. Both approaches
will be pursued in this project. The notion of a critical coalition is
introduced into the theoretical framework which is a coalition of countries
agreeing to implement an abatement agreement that has certain stability
properties. This project is important because it will produce useful insights
into the process of international negotiation on global change, and provide a
basis for choosing negotiating frameworks and strategies that will lead to
stable and positive outcomes.
