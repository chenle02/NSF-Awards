The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will be to improve product quality in products generated in continuous
extrusion environments. For instance, 2-55% of raw material can be wasted in
plastics extrusion. In aggregate at least $500M raw material is lost each year
in the US alone, creating additional environmental concerns because this waste
plastic is typically not reusable nor recyclable. Manual inspection is
problematic for this process at scale. This project will apply intelligent
systems to automatically detect and act upon imperfections, improving efficiency
and financial performance. The system will initially be applied to plastics
extrusion, and later to a wide range of industries including metals, food and
pharmaceutical production. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project will allow development of novel machine learning
and artificial intelligence technologies to automatically detect output of
substandard quality in continuous manufacturing environments. The research will
generate real-world plastics production data from a range of sensor inputs to
train AI models to classify outputs. New approaches in AI/ML will be applied to
develop robust, adaptable models to infer error states in product output.
Research will also cover the development of technologies to detect failed
product output in changing factory conditions, such as fouling of camera lenses
or unexpected movement of the hardware.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
