Research in electromagnetic nuclear physics will be carried out at a number of
electron accelerator facilities. Most of the near term experimental effort will
make use of the electron accelerator facilities at the University of
Saskatchewan, MIT/Bates, Mainz, and Brookhaven National Lab (the LEGS facility).
Longer term CEBAF projects are under development. Experiments will focus on the
structure of excited baryon resonances, few-nucleon systems, and the dynamics of
photopion production from light nuclei, making use of both real and virtual
photons, polarized and unpolarized. Particular emphasis is placed on development
of Cherenkov detectors for the CEBAF large acceptance spectrometer, which will
be used in the studies of baryon resonances.
