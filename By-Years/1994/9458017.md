9458017 Grey Adsorption sites for monomethylamine and pyridine on acidic
zeolites, and for hydroflourocarbons on basic zeolites, will be probed using
double and triple resonance MAS NMR experiments. Distances between nuclei at
surface sites and on the adsorbed molecules will be measured in order to
determine the structure of the adsorbate/adsorbent complexes. %%% ***
