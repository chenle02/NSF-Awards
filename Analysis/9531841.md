9531841 Loring The abstract properties of curves in Euclidean space defined by
polynomial equations are well-understood. In particular, a finite set of
polynomials is a stable set of equations in commuting unknowns in the following
sense: any approximate solution (a point in Euclidean space where those
polynomials take a small value) will be close to the solution set. The same set
of polynomials can become unstable when applied to operator values. Indeed, they
often become unstable even when only matrix values are allowed in the variables;
there can be tuples of matrices upon which the polynomials take small values and
which are far away from the matrix-valued solution set to the equations. A
primary goal of this project will be to determine computable invariants for
differentiating such "phantom" approximate solutions" from perturbations of true
solutions. These phantom approximate solutions can be misleading in the context
of computer simulations of mathematical models. A numerical linear algebra
package cannot make exact calculations with matrices. Until last year, for
example, there was no way to tell if a matrix which almost satisfied the so-
called normality equation represented an approximation of an actual normal
matrix. This is now known to be true. Since much of the theory, and
applications, of linear algebra must be changed when working with non-normal
matrices, this is an important theoretical advance. It adds to our confidence in
our reliance on computer modeling. By adding to the list of stability results
that can be applied to linear algebra, this project should enhance that
confidence.
