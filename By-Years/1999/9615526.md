9615526 SHULTZ Arthropods (spiders, crabs, insects and their relatives) have a
long and complex history (phylogeny), and the greatest diversity in shape and
form of all the animal groups. In order to better understand how these complex,
and often economically important, animals actually work, it is important to know
how they are put together; it is especially important to know how muscles are
attached to the hardened outer surface (exoskeleton) of each animal, forming
Oskeletomuscular complexesO that permit the animals to move, feed, and
reproduce. Certain skeletomuscular complexes may have occurred only once in the
histories of arthropods; others, which may look alike and function in a similar
way, may have appeared in several different places in the arthropod phylogenetic
tree. However, since not enough information has yet been obtained to determine
the true phylogeny of arthropod groups, it is, at present, difficult to assess
whether particular skeletomuscular complexes appeared once or more than once in
arthropod history. In this study, Jeffrey W. Schultz will examine the details of
skeletomuscular complex structures in a major group of arthropods, the arachnids
(spiders, scorpions, mites and their relatives). He will use skeletomuscular
characters, both alone and with molecular sequence data, to reconstruct the
phylogeny of the arachnids, and will then use the phylogeny to estimate when,
how, and how often particular skeletomuscular complexes appeared in arachnids,
and how these complexes changed, in form and function, throughout the history of
these animals. It is expected that this analysis will solve long-standing
problems in the phylogeny and evolutionary morphology of an important group of
arthropods.
