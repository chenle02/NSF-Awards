Dr. Amy Mullin of Boston University is supported by the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division with a Research Planning Grant to
study the collisional and reactive dynamics of highly vibrationally excited
polyatomic molecules. These species will be prepared by ultraviolet laser
excitation followed by rapid internal conversion to high vibrational levels of
the ground electronic state. Preliminary studies will concentrate on energy
transfer between vibrationally excited pyrazine or pyridine with carbon dioxide
and water. Product state distributions and absolute cross sections will be
measured. Ultimately, experiments will be conducted to investigate the ability
of high levels of internal excitation to drive otherwise unreactive systems over
an activation barrier. Most chemical reactions take place on the ground
electronic states of the reactants. Large activation barriers can prevent
reactions from taking place, even when the systems are at elevated temperatures.
In this project, Professor Mullin will use laser excitation to populate high
vibrational levels of these molecules, corresponding to vibrational temperatures
of 3000K, a temperature which would normally decompose the molecule. This method
of preparation allows a large amount of energy to be present in the reactant
without decomposing it and enhances the reaction by providing enough energy to
overcome the activation barrier.
