The research involves two, complementary aspects of the interactions of
ultracold excited atoms; the formation of weakly bound molecular states formed
from highly excited Rydberg atoms and the collisional process that may destroy
them, such as three-body recombination. The first part of the work exploits the
group properties of these systems and relies heavily on quantum defect theory to
provide some semi-analytic results. The research on recombination employs
modifications of echniques that were pioneered by the PI many years ago in the
context of gas discharge physics.
