A typical elliptic interface problem is cast as piecewise defined elliptic
partial differential equations (PDE) in different regions which are coupled with
interface conditions, such as jumps in the solution and in the flux across the
interface. In many situations, such as when the interface is moving, the
challenge is how to solve such a problem accurately, robustly and efficiently
without generating a body fitted mesh. The key issue is how to capture the
complex geometry of the interface and the jump conditions across the interface
effectively on a fixed mesh while the interface is not aligned with the mesh and
the PDE is not valid across the interface. The PI proposes a non-traditional
finite element method to solve the elliptic and elasticity interface problems.
The following are the proposed projects: 1. solving 3D elliptic interface
problems; 2. solving 3D elasticity interface problems; 3. solving 3D multi-
domain interface problems; 4. solving 2D multi-domain elasticity interface
problems; 5. solving moving interface problems; 6. interdisciplinary
applications.

Interface problems have applications in electromagnetics, material science,
fluid dynamics and other areas. For example, the interface could be the
molecular surface of a protein, the water-oil interface, or similar. Therefore,
by improving numerical techniques used to model interfaces, the proposed
research will have substantial impact on interdisciplinary applications.
Further, although the research requires advanced techniques, the concept of an
interface exists in everyday life, which means that student interest can be
stimulated in applied mathematics seminars.
