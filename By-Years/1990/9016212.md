The goals of the proposed study are: first, to measure components of lifetime
reproductive success (LRS) for individual male baboons, to attribute variance in
LRS to the different components of LRS, and to identify particular traits of
individuals as the sources of this variance. Second, to test the following
hypotheses: (i) likelihood that a male baboon will disperse from groups in which
he has female relatives is a function of the costs of dispersal and the benefits
of avoiding inbreeding depression, (ii) males decrease mortality costs
associated with dispersal by altering dispersal patterns, and (iii) males
increase fecundity by altering dispersal patterns. The subjects are wild male
baboons (Papio cycynocephalus) in Amboseli National Park, Kenya. Their life
histories and dispersal patterns are being investigated in two ways, through a
detailed cross-sectional behavioral study and through analysis of long-term
demographic data. From these two types of data components of LRS will be
estimated.
