9314634 ANDERSON Uranium is removed from the ocean by precipitation in
chemically- reducing sediments. Preliminary results from subantarctic South
Atlantic show high rates of authigenic U deposition in glacial-age sediments.
The observed burial of uranium implies that one of two conditions existed in the
glacial ocean: either greatly-reduced oxygen content of Circumpolar Deep Water
(compared to modern levels in excess of 200 micromolar), or greatly-enhanced
biological productivity of subantarctic surface waters. Either condition would
represent a significant feature of the carbon cycle in the glacial ocean. The
hypothesis that subantarctic sediments hold the key record which will lead to
the long-sought explanation for lower atmospheric CO2 concentrations during the
ice ages will be tested to also derive quantitative information about ice-age
ocean productivity and deep-sea 02 content.
