A workshop on Quantum Electrodynamic Structure Functions is being held at the
University of Michigan. This Workshop will deal with problems whose solution is
crucial to our being able to interpret experimental data on electron-positron
collisions. One of these problems is the precise shape and width of the Z
resonance in these collisions, and the relation of these properties to the
character of the weak interaction, and to the number of neutrinos. The Workshop
will also deal with related problems whose solution is basic to our ability to
utilize data on electron - proton collisions.
