9355372 Groza The propose of this project is to explore the feasibility of a
joint American - Romanian research effort on diffusion measurements to develop
new, lead-free soldering alloy for micro-electronic applications. The focus is
twofold: (a) to explore the feasibility of performing diffusion experiments in a
Romanian laboratory and (b) to improve the complex diffusion programs developed
in Romania by using powerful American computational systems. The completion of
this work will demonstrate our ability to further develop a joint program on
diffusion studies of new soldering alloys. These alloys are critical for
environmentally safe processing and therefore considerably contribute to the
development of new and viable technologies to benefit both countries. We expect
this short term collaboration to strengthen our chances to develop a long term
interaction between scientists in the United States and Eastern Europe on
priority engineering issues. ***
