9322011 Terzian Cornell University will continue the Observational Astronomy
program established in Summer 1989, and further developed from 1990, in which
undergraduate students are involved in the research activities of the astronomy
group at Cornell University. The undergraduate students will work with members
of the Cornell faculty/radar astronomy, and other related topics. The students'
research at Cornell will also provide them the opportunity to participate in
astronomical observations at a facility used by Cornell researchers. The
students will also be encouraged to participate in the Undergraduate Research
Forum, which is held annually at Cornell University, to present and discuss
their various research projects with other students. The Undergraduate Research
in Observational Astronomy program will encourage participation by students who
are women and minorities and whose own institutions do not provide this kind of
research experience for their own undergradautes.
