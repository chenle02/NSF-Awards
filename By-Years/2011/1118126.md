Recent cyber attacks have shown the degree of vulnerability on the individual to
the corporate to national level. Everyone is vulnerable, from the consumer using
a credit card to make an online purchase, to the multi-national corporation
whose systems are hacked, to national infrastructure and defense networks.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent criminal attacks on computing devices and computer
systems allow criminals to access private data without actually breaking the
paradigm of provable-security, by exploiting some alternative and subtle
weaknesses of the implemented systems (for instance through physical attacks
mounted on computing devices or through clever internet-based attacks via
exploiting concurrency of the communication). Examples of such attacks include
measuring the power consumption of a computing device or manipulating its
randomness generation process, or attacking multiple instances of the same
protocol simultaneously on the internet. Moreover, the spread of light-weight
(and extremely cheap) devices such as smart-cards and RFID chips makes evident
that physical leakage of information must be prevented even when criminals are
capable of physical reset of a device as well as manipulating network messages
of computing artifacts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the theory of many of the
above attacks has been recently developed in cryptography, the ongoing research
of security of network attacks and reset attacks so far produced very limited
results. We address challenges posed by such sophisticated criminal attacks with
the goal of making such attacks computationally much harder to perpetrate. Our
objectives include designing stronger security defenses for an important class
of attacks on computational devices, including information-theoretic guarantees
even during reset and network attacks on weak computational devices. The goals
of this research includes obtaining feasibility and impossibility results for
multiple cryptographic tools, and developing novel security techniques that when
combined together, provide much stronger defenses for deployed systems.
