The North Carolina State Museum of Natural Sciences requests $544,390 for the
design and implementation of Freshwater Westlands: Habitats of Beauty and
Function. This project consists of two main components: a 2,800 sq. ft. exhibit
and related education program. The exhibit will communicate ecological
principles and provide visitors of all ages with an appreciation of the
diversity and beauty of freshwater wetlands habitats. The exhibit is comprised
of three main areas: an introductory theater, an immersion diorama, and an
interactive hall. Exhibits are designed to present many aspects of freshwater
wetland habitats, including hydrology, dendrochronology, organism structure, and
function, life- cycle, ecological research, and environmental policy. Through
interactive exhibits on scientific concepts, visitors will gain an appreciation
of both a particular habitat and the process of science and its application to
their lives. The major objectives of the education program are to help teachers
of grades 4-8 to bring the study of freshwater wetlands into their classrooms
and to employ experientially oriented pedagogy. The project will offer a teacher
resource guide, prepared in collaboration with state science curriculum staff, a
satellite workshop for teachers, a freshwater wetlands edition of Wildlife in
North Carolina, a statewide publication prepared in collaboration with the NC
Wildlife Resources Commission, and a classroom program in the museum.
