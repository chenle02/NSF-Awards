9361943 Zhang This Phase I SBIR award has the objective to determine the
feasibility of using a new laser deposition technology (Pulsed Laser Deposition)
to coat metallic knee prosthesis materials with the ceramic ZrO2. The hypothesis
is that the ZrO2 coating will improve the reliability of knee prosthesis through
a unique combination of strength, toughness, and wear resistance, and that a
biocompatibility will be established. ***
