An Automatic Particle Size and Counting System and a modular Automated Colony
Counting Instrument with detachable TV camera for use with a microscope and a
video cassette recorder/player will be purchased. These pieces of equipment will
enhance research activities in biochemical engineering and crystallization areas
by providing both quantitative and qualitative information on particles or cells
and by reducing time devoted to labor-intensive activities such as colony or
plaque counting.
