0313927&lt;br/&gt;Jones&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This U.S.-Chile award will support
Drs. Clive G. Jones and Holly Ewing and Kathleen C. Weathers, Institute of
Ecosystem Studies, New York, , Dr. Todd E. Dawson, University of California,
Berkeley, and Ms.Patricia Vidiella, University of California, Berkeley, for a
planning visit to complete a proposal for a research collaboration with Drs.
Juan J. Armesto, Pablo A. Marquet, and Ms. Olga Barbosa, University of Chile.
The researchers are working on research to understand the role of fog in
ecosystems, the role of species in ecosystem functioning, the scaling up of
ecological processes, the relationships between ecosystem functioning and
biodiversity, and the ecological impacts of global change. Their study site is
the Fray Jorge National Park in Chile. The results of this work will give
insight into proper management of ecosystems such as the coastal redwoods of
California.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
