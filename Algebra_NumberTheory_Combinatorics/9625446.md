This award supports a series of one day meetings on combinatorics and graph
theory. The investigators will hold five meetings per year at Smith College.
These meetings provide a seminar atmosphere for combinatorists and graph
theorists in the northeastern part of the United States. This research is in the
general area of Combinatorics. Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods
to study how discrete collections of objects can be arranged. The behavior of
discrete systems is extremely important to modern communications. For example,
the design of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and
the design of algorithms in computer science deal with discrete sets of objects,
and this makes use of combinatorial research. In addition, the type of
enumerative information being sought in this project has been of use in the
design of geometric algorithms for problems in robotics and motion planning.
