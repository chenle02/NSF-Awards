This travel grant supports the participation of US-based graduate students and
other early career mathematicians in the international conference "Theory and
Application of Syzygies" held in Saarbrucken, Germany on July 1-3, 2015. The
central topic of the conference is the study of syzygies in mathematics, which
involves matrices whose entries are polynomials. These kinds of matrices arise
throughout pure and applied mathematics, and thus research about syzygies can be
applied in many fields, including computational algebra and algebraic geometry.
The meeting will provide an excellent opportunity for junior mathematicians to
learn about major new developments in these fields and to seek new research
problems to explore.

The conference brings together leading experts on syzygies and related topics
across a range of fields, and it will highlight many of the recent breakthroughs
in the study of syzygies. Due to its relatively moderate size, this conference
offers a unique opportunity for this array of top researchers on syzygies to
come together and discuss avenues for new research. In addition, since many
groundbreaking results on syzygies take place at an intersection between
multiple fields, this conference offers a high potential to spur new
collaborations or avenues for research.
