The PIs are proposing an EAGER to assist in the development and study of
WeInvestigate, an application that will run on a mobile device. The application
will help support learners as they engage in artifact construction using
multiple media while two or more learners can be synchronously collaborating
either face-to-face or at a distance. WeInvestigate is leveraging the research
that learning in collaboration with others associated with higher engagement and
learning outcomes. The PIs are investigating the experiences of teachers and
students as they implement WeInvestigate to support their engagement and
learning about scientific phenomena. They are also looking at the value-added of
the support for synchronous collaboration and its impact on student learning.
The WeInvestigate application has the potential to reach a high number of
students since it is likely that more schools have access to mobile devices and
college readiness standards will be looking for collaborative tools such as
WeInvesitgage that integrate collaboration and the reading of complex text. PIs
are partnering with the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) who are
building a platform to support the applications for the Next Generation Science
Standards.
