*** 9661474 Deits This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project to be
carried out by Enzyme Design, Inc. will generate proof-of-principle data for a
new enabling technology in enzyme expression, termed EnzyMatrixTM expression.
EnzyMatrixTM expression adapts the major host microorganism in use in the enzyme
industry, Bacillus subtilis, to create a new platform for enzyme expression. The
product of EnzyMatrixTM expression is a particulate form of the target
heterologous enzyme. The particulate nature of the product facilitates enzyme
recovery, affording the potential to greatly simplify downstream processing.
Since downstream processing costs dominate bioproduct selling prices, these
savings can substantially expand the market for enzyme applications in the
pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries. The particles themselves are heat,
shear and organic chemical resistant, offering a platform for catalysts for use
in a variety of industrial processes. The research objectives of this project
are to express two enzymes with significantly different structures and functions
using EnzyMatrixTM expression and to evaluate the properties of the resulting
expressed enzymes; increase the level of expression on a per-cell and a per-
liter fermenter basis, using one of the expressed enzymes as a model; carry out
strain improvement to improve yield and speed EnzyMatrixTM expression; and
evaluate chemical and genetic methods for stabilizing EnzyMatrixTM enzymes. The
proposed enabling technology, the EnzyMatrixTM expression, will make it possible
for Enzyme Design to offer a biocatalyst with the key advantages of rapid
development and scaleup, uniform product properties and economical production.
Through this technology the nation will realize improved efficiencies of
production including reduced energy costs during processing and high production
specificity, leading to reduction of the waste stream burden. ***
