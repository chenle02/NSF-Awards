9458368 Zhang Research projects include the following: 1) experimentally
simulate and theoretically model explosive volcanic eruptions; 2) examine the
equilibrium and kinetics of the interconversion reaction between OH groups and
water molecules, and apply the data to volcanic glasses; and 3) set up more
experimental facilities, measure "water" solubility and diffusivity in nominally
anhydrous mantle minerals, and study diffusion in silicates. Teaching goals are
to restructure the Earth Sciences curriculum and improve undergraduate interest
and enrollment in Earth Sciences. This P.I. will develop courses for the new
curriculum, including computer- simulation experimental projects for the
classroom.
