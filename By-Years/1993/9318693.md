9318693 Emanuel Advances and product development in power electronics resulted
in increased levels of harmonics in power systems and the associated problems.
Substantial research activities are underway to study harmonics from a systems
point of view, as well as at device levels. To meet the need for exchange of
ideas among researchers in this area, the International Conference on Harmonics
in Power System, ICHPS was established in 1984. ICHPS is a biennial conference.
The sixth conference is scheduled for September 21- 23, 1994 in Bologna, Italy.
This block travel grant will help young faculty and established researchers from
the United States to exchange ideas and present results. ***
