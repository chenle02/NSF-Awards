9416809 Whitelaw This project's objectives fall into three groups: Descriptive
objective: to develop a technically sound, but intuitively accessible, framework
and language for describing and assessing the multiple relationships between a
forested ecosystem and a regional economy that can be applied to different
ecosystems and regional economies. Explanatory objective: to improve
understanding of the factors that influence the multiple relationships between
forested ecosystems and regional economies. Institutional-communicative
objective: to lay the institutional foundation for (1) providing resource
managers, policymakers, and the public with effective tools for describing and
assessing the economic effects of changes in resource-management policy, (2)
undertaking further cross-site research regarding the relationships between
ecosystems and regional economies, and (3) integrating economics research with
the research of other disciplines. The proposed project will pursue these
objectives by implementing, for these six LTER sites.
