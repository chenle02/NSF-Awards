Conference on Risk-Based Decision-Making will take place on October 31-November
6, 1993, in Santa Barbara, CA. The purpose of the conference is to address
issues of public decision-making in which risk analysis plays a prominent role
and will; 1) evaluate current risk assessment issues confronting water resources
planners and pertinent areas of uncertainty; 2) identify the requirements and
procedures currently promoted by the engineering professions which are in use by
Federal and State agencies, 3) review and evaluate decision and analysis
models/methods which can explicitly incorporate risk preferences; and 4) develop
information exchange mechanisms. Proceedings of this conference will be
published and disseminated to the research and practicing engineers, and to
private and public organizations as done in previous occasions. *** x \ P C
