The main goal of this project is to combine a constructivist approach to
teaching with technological tools for learning in order to improve the
undergraduate mathematics and science teacher preparation programs at North
Carolina State University. Revised courses will provide alternative models to
the traditional lecture and chalkboard/overhead method of instruction for
undergraduates who are preparing to become secondary mathematics and science
teachers. Since teachers teach as they have been taught, graduates of the
revised program should be able to use a constructivist approach to teaching in
their own classrooms and enhance that teaching with existing and emerging
technologies. To support this change four mathematicians, three scientists, five
mathematics educators, four science educators, twelve teachers, and several
business executives will work collaboratively on revisions to ten separate
courses. These specialists will be organized into teams responsible for
incorporating the use of appropriate technologies and a constructivist approach
to teaching into three mathematics courses, two introductory science courses,
three mathematics education courses, and two science education courses. The cost
sharing for the project will be 135% of the NSF support.
