NER Proposal0210225 Exploring the Computational Limits Imposed by
Nanotechnologies John E. Savage

This project has four goals: a) to develop realistic models for chips with
nanometer-size dimensions, b) to explore the computational limits that apply
under the physical constraints imposed by nanotechnologies, c) to develop
architectures and algorithms reflecting these constraints, and d) to incorporate
the knowledge acquired in advanced and early graduate instruction.

While computational nanotechnologies exist only in the most primitive forms
today, we have an opportunity to influence their use akin to that which arose
when the VLSI model was developed in the late 1970s. In this model gates are so
small that the area of wires is significant. Efficient use of this technology
required new algorithms whose efficacy was demonstrated through the development
of new complexity-theoretic lower bounds involving chip area and computation
time.

Our approach will be a) to model technologies such as orthogonal arrays
(crossbars) of nanowires and nanotubes and masses of nearly uniform self-
assembled elements, b) to extend existing VLSI theory by incorporating the new
constraints that emerge, c) to explore new architectures that cope with the
complexity-theoretic constraints exhibited by the proposed highly regular
architectures and ways of programming them, and d) to devise lectures and/or
courses to bring nanocomputation to the attention of students.
