This project supports a team of cultural anthropologists (two based on the
mainland US and one in Puerto Rico) studying the effect of cultural background
on people's responses to pain. The investigators will collect qualitative
information through intensive interviews and quantitative information through
questionnaires with 100 native Puerto Rican patients suffering chronic pain, and
compare the results with those from a prior study of Anglo Americans and U.S.
mainland Hispanics (mainly of Puerto Rican descent). The aim of the comparison
is to test the hypothesis that socialization within cultural groups influences
attitudes and attention to pain which then affects the psycho- physiological
processes of pain perception. The study will be attentive to factors influences
intra-cultural variation in pain response also. This study is important because
it will contribute to our knowledge of the ways cultural orientation shapes
human's ability to withstand suffering. At a time when chronic back pain seems
to be common, understanding of this sort can clearly help society cope with the
affliction. One of the researchers is handicapped (with chronic pain) and this
support involves special aids to handicapped researchers.
