A differential scanning calorimeter is being acquired for use in physical
chemistry and instrumental analysis courses in order to introduce thermal
methods of analysis into the chemistry curriculum. Thermal methods are being
used to characterize widely diverse substances such as polymers, oils, clays,
carbohydrates, and soil, and they also are being used to provide enthalpimetric
data which is difficult to obtain by other methods. In addition, an instrument
is being laboratory- constructed to perform thermometric titrations for use in
situations where conventional calorimetric indicators cannot be used. Inclusion
of instruction in thermal methods is expanding the chemistry curriculum into
areas of materials science and is serving as a model for other undergraduate
curricula. The instrumentation also is being used in the undergraduate research
program.
