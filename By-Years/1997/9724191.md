The goal of this proposal from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center is to
request partial funding for the acquisition of an x-ray area detector, along
with a computational workstation and cryo-cooling system, for crystallographic
data collection by a group of four principal investigators and their
laboratories. The requested equipment would greatly facilitate ongoing
collaborative efforts both within the center and with a large number of
molecular biology and biochemistry laboratories throughout the country.
