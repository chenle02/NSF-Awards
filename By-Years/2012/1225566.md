This project team is building on an earlier effort that prepared the groundwork
for an "overhaul" of the traditional three-term calculus course to better serve
the needs of all STEM students, beyond just those in the traditional engineering
and physical sciences track. The central innovation is to move topics and
conceptual coverage needed in upper-level STEM courses into the first two terms
of the traditional three-semester sequence. The PIs hypothesize that such a
tactic has several beneficial consequences: i) Calculus 2 becomes an attractive
"jumping-off" point for students in biology and chemistry; ii) a natural
progression of difficulty throughout the full three-course sequence results; and
iii) there is room in Calculus 3 to complete vector calculus through Stokes
Theorem and the Divergence Theorem. In practice re-sequencing the topics
involves a number of changes, including: 1) an early introduction to
multivariate calculus, vectors, and sequences; 2) a postponement of infinite
series; 3) an early, although brief, treatment of matrices; and 4) the de-
emphasis, deletion, or redistribution of a handful of other topics. Primary
activities of this project include developing supporting course materials and
assessments, large-scale beta-testing of the full three-term sequence and
assessing its effectiveness and impact at a variety of partner institutions,
engaging in further dissemination of project findings and results, and building
support for wider implementation of these ideas.
