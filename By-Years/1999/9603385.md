The goal of this collaboration between the PI and David Blaschke at the
University of Rostock involving senior investigators, postdoctoral fellows, and
students is to study and derive effective models for non-perturbative quantum
chromodynamics at finite temperature and baryon density. This proposal unites
the U.S. group with its expertise in Dyson-Schwinger equations and model field
theories with the German group, who are experts in many-body techniques at
finite temperature. The collaboration produces a group that is ideally suited to
discover those observables that may provide characteristic signatures of quark-
gluon plasma formation. The collaborative exchange visits are designed to
facilitate rapid progress through intensive periods of close interaction. The
education and training of students and postdoctoral fellows is a significant
aspect of this proposal.
