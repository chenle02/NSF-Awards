The IASOA web and data portal have been recognized as a key and evolving
deliverable of the IASOA planning process. The "Data-at-a-Glance" portal, in
particular, adds value above isolated efforts through acting as a single cross-
site gateway to all shared IASOA data. There are currently over 180 links of
this type in the "Data-at-a-Glance" portal of the website, with varying degrees
of functionality, and limited standard metadata. Potentially transformative
insights into long-term and pan-Arctic atmospheric trends reside in this archive
waiting to be harvested. In response to the high priority placed on the IASOA
web and data portal by the steering committee, and in recognition of the value
of interoperable metadata standards for broader data harvesting and use, the PI
will conduct a pilot project to enhance the IASOA data portal through
application of shared ontologies, coordination with other Arctic atmospheric
data archives, standardization of metadata, and outreach to user communities.
