This is an award to create an Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Site at the University
of Delaware (UD) Horn Program in Entrepreneurship. This I-Corps Site will expand
this institution's entrepreneurial ecosystem that includes: training
opportunities based on lean startup methods; improved physical facilities and
service offerings provided by their Venture Development Center; and, an
extensive startup support network of engaged entrepreneurs, investors, business
service providers, community partners and others. This Site will increase the
quantity and velocity of activities aimed at bringing new technologies into the
marketplace. The University of Delaware?s Venture Development Center serves as a
hatchery/incubator for student startups and will do likewise for I-Corps teams.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Site is likely to impact the ecosystem of the
georgraphical region where this institution is located. In the past, Delaware
benefitted from the presence of several large, hi-tech employers But, lingering
effects from the economic downturn reduced the state's social and economic
wellbeing. Consequently, an increase in startup activity, and the associated
creation of new jobs, will serve to improve the economic wellbeing of Delaware
and the surrounding region. Broader impacts resulting from participation in the
I-Corps Program will also include improved educational outcomes and
competitiveness for STEM students, and stronger partnerships between academia
and industry. The possibility of receiving funding and joining an I-Corps team
may incentivize STEM students to learn about innovation and entrepreneurship by
participating in existing training opportunities, thereby improving their
educational outcomes and competitiveness. Stronger partnerships between academia
and industry will result from interactions between I-Corps team members and
prospective industry customers as well as the formation of I-Corps teams that
will attempt to commercialize industry technology.
