Our long term goal is to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the
genetic control of sexual development in Drosophila. Because many of the genes
in the sex determination pathway are regulated by RNA processing, these studies
will also contribute to our understanding of alternative RNA splicing as a means
of gene regulation. Our research is focused on the sans-fille (snf) gene.
Genetic studies suggest that snf plays a key role in the sexual decision making
process in both the germline and the soma. To further our understanding of this
newly identified gene we propose: 1) To determine whether snf is required only
for sex determination or whether it has a more generalized function in
development by analyzing null alleles of the locus. 2) To initiate a detailed
molecular characterization of the snf gene and its products and 3) To place snf
in the regulatory hierarchy of sex determination genes by a combined molecular
and genetic approach. In the fruit fly Drosophila individuals with an X and a Y
chromosome develop into males and those with 2X chromosomes develop into
females. The decision of which developmental pathway to adopt is made during
embryonic life by every cell in the body of the embryo. We have known since the
early years of this century that the cells make their decision by counting the
number of X chromosomes they contain, but it is only over the past decade that
more of the details of the mechanism by which the decision is made have been
elucidated. This is a proposal to study a recently discovered early step in this
mechanism.
