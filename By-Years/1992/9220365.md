This conference on The Biology and Chemistry of Vision is part of an important
series of meetings convened to promote interactions between the top
investigators in the field on topics at the forefront of research on
photoreceptors and the retina of the eye. This particular conference will focus
on interactions between work on the basic biological mechanisms of
photoreception in the eye and the clinical problems related to retinal
degeneration. The conference will lead to new understanding of how the proteins
involved in the biochemistry of vision can be defective, and how those defects
can lead to visual disability. The impact will be on both basic and applied
aspects of visual neuroscience, and the conference will promote interactions
that are likely to have an impact on neuroscience in general.
