Masonry construction comprises a large portion of building construction in the
U.S. and the world. Reinforced masonry construction use is increasing in
moderate to higher seismic zones because of its apparent features of economy,
fire safety, architectural flexibility and ease of construction. The present
state of masonry structural analysis and design and materials and construction
technologies do not enable an accurate prediction of building behavior under
lateral loads such as seismic loads. This research project will examine, using
experimental methods, the seismic response of reinforced masonry walls under
out-of-plane loading. The objective of the project is to provide experimental
data about the hysteretic behavior of reinforced masonry walls to develop
nonlinear analysis techniques for walls under seismic loading. The results will
then be used to establish rational limit state design methodologies for
reinforced masonry construction.
