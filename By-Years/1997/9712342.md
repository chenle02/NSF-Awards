9712342 Rebane A three year activity is being undertaken during which Professor
Rebane will engage in an experimental investigation of filtering, processing and
switching of multi-spectral optical signals, based on the effect of spectral
hole-burning in cryogenically cooled dye-doped polymers. The physical principle
makes use of diffraction by holographic gratings recorded in photon-gated hole-
burning materials. This phenomenon may have significant application in the field
of optical communications, data processing and storage. ***
