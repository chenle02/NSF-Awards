The objective of this research, jointly funded by the Divisions of Materials
Research and Mathematical Sciences, is to develop reliable theoretical methods
for calculating the patterns that result in crystal growth subsequent to
morphological instability and to discover and quantify their unifying aspects.
Morphological instability pertains to spontaneous changes in shape of some
material body under the influence of driving forces such as capillarity,
diffusion, and heat flow. Examples include cellular morphologies in
semiconductor crystals, dendritic solidification of metallic alloys, and shape
changes of phases in composite materials. Research methods include numerical
solution of free boundary problems and phase field equations via supercomputing
and computer simulation using random walk algorithms. %%% The accurate modeling
and physical understanding of patterns which form during the growth of crystals
is an extremely difficult problem. However, the growth of solid bodies from the
melt is common to most fields of materials science. Thus, any progress made in
this field can have broad ramifications. The work is also highly
interdisciplinary and requires research at the boundaries of materials science,
condensed matter physics and applied mathematics. Consequently, this research in
nonlinear science is jointly funded through the Materials Research and
Mathematical Sciences Divisions.
