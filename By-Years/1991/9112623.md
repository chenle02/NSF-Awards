The genus Conopholis belongs to a family of parasitic plants, the
Orobanchaceae. The plants are obligate parasites on other plants, from which
they derive all of their nutrients and water. Possibly as a direct result of
this parasitism these plants have lost the ability to photosynthesize and lack
the characteristic green color conferred by the presence of chlorophyll. The
plastids (the organelle which in green plants houses the photosynthetic
metabolism and has its own circular genome containing about 120 genes, including
some of those involved in photosynthesis) of Conopholis contain a genome only a
third the size of that in green plants and have lost several important
photosynthesis genes. This has occurred through the accumulation of several
large deletions of DNA. The large amount of variation in the plastid genome
detectable between different populations of Conopholis indicate that it is
continuing to evolve at an accelerated rate. DNA sequencing methods will be used
to investigate how these deletions have occurred and what has happened to
plastid genes which have not been deleted. Those that remain intact will be
investigated for non-photosynthetic functions. The evolution of the non-
functional photosynthesis genes remaining in the plastid genome will be compared
with their counterparts in the nuclear genome in order to find out if they have
had different fates as a result of different molecular processes occurring in
these two genomes.
