This proposal requests support for a young investigator and her students who are
working on a series of projects related to the experimental effort to detect
gravitational waves with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory
(LIGO). The proposed activities include;&lt;br/&gt; experimental studies of
vibration isolation systems needed to enable LIGO to reach its ultimate
sensitivity goal for terrestrial based detectors; &lt;br/&gt; development of new
optical sensors needed in feedback systems to control the large LIGO optics and
thereby "lock" the interferometer arms in the presence of background motion;
&lt;br/&gt;development of new diagnostic techniques to measure and evaluate
earth-motion that produces gravitational gradients that may limit the
sensitivity of advanced detectors;&lt;br/&gt; development of analysis techniques
to extract gravitational wave signals from the LIGO data stream in the presence
of background noise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI is a leader in the LIGO
Scientific Collaboration group that is charged with analyzing LIGO data for
evidence of "burst" sources of gravitational waves and setting upper limits on
amplitude and rates of such signals.&lt;br/&gt;
