The Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network will conduct a proposal
development workshop for Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) aimed at
increasing their awareness of opportunities and grantsmanship skills related to
the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program. The workshop will include two-
person faculty teams from 20 MSIs interested in developing a competitive Noyce
proposal. Participants will also engage in a series of post-workshop
individualized sessions that will provide additional proposal guidance.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The QEM workshop and post-workshop interactions will
provide participants feedback on their required project summaries to assist them
in developing their ideas into competitive Noyce proposals. MSIs are uniquely
qualified to address the issue of recruiting, retaining, and developing STEM
teachers for high-need schools. As such, the project's workshops will help
develop stronger MSIs, in general, and teacher preparation programs,
specifically, to meet the nation's needs for a more productive science and
technology workforce.
