Prostate cancer affects over 241,740 U.S. males annually, making it the most
prevalent cancer type and second leading cause of cancer mortality in men. One
frequently utilized method of treating prostate cancer is brachytherapy (BT), or
implantation of radioactive seeds into the prostate. The success of
brachytherapy chiefly depends on the ability to intra-operatively tailor the
radiation dose to the patient's individual anatomy, i.e. adequately cover the
prostate with sufficient radiation while simultaneously avoiding excessive
radiation to surrounding organs. Many of the challenges that limit brachytherapy
can be addressed by incorporating closed-loop feedback in the brachytherapy
implant procedure. That is as seeds are implanted into the prostate, their
actual positions are measured and fed back to the treatment planning system,
which recalculates the dosimetry and re-optimizes the plan.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal leverages prior and ongoing research between
the CISST ERC and Acoustic MedSystems to provide an integrated, commercially-
viable system with following capabilities: (1) precise intra-operative
localization of the implanted radioactive seeds; (2) intra-operative dosimetry
and rapid re-optimization of the brachytherapy implant plan; and (3) the ability
to accurately and efficiently execute the updated implant plan.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major goal of the improved process is to minimize
human errors with a procedure that has a feedback mechanism for accurate and
optimized dosimetry and robotic assistance in the delivery of needles in
accordance with a re-optimized implant as the procedure progresses.
