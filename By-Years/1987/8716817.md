Bees are the most important pollinating agent in the world, and their biology is
of intense interest to agriculturists, the honey industry, behaviorists and
investigators into social structures. Charles Michener is one of the world's
leading authorities on bees, and he has proposed a five-year synthesis of the
classification and ancestor-descendant relationships among the bees of the
world. Michener is uniquely qualified to summarize the present understanding of
the biology and evolution of bees since their probable divergence from wasps in
the Mesozoic Era. In addition to producing a comprehensive classification of
families and tribes, Michener will construct phylogenetic hypotheses using
cladistic methods, and will formulate identification keys for non-specialists.
The proposed project will bring our understanding of bee biology and evolution
to a new level of completeness and clarity. It will serve as a foundation for
pure and applied bee research for generations.
