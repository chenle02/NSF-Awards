0116452&lt;br/&gt;Speitel&lt;br/&gt;This is a proposal to acquire several
instruments to upgrade analytical facilities for environmental engineering
research and education. The research is in the areas of separations, biological
transformations, and chemical transformations. This research requires a diverse
array of analytical measurements ranging from basic analysis of contaminants of
regulatory concern to detailed analysis of particle characteristics, chemical
intermediates, and microbial activity. The research is focussed on developing
new and more efficient processes for in situ and ex situ treatment of water,
soil, and air pollution. Five advanced instruments, field flow fractionation, an
FTIR-Raman spectrophotometer, a zeta potential analyzer, a thermogravimetric
analysis system, and capillary electrophoresis would be used in the area of
surface chemistry research. &lt;br/&gt;
