9213234 Colgate This is the second year funding of a three year continuing
award. This project investigates a hypothesis related to the use of hand tools,
with particular emphasis on the application of any discovered design principles
to bilateral micromanipulators such as those used in microsurgery, with the hope
that these principles would accelerate the evolutionary design and development
of these and other tools. The hypothesis to be tested is that the hand tool
which optimizes performance of a given task is that which optimizes the average
power output from the operator, excepting power that is dissipated in the tool.
Underlying this hypothesis is the notion that a well-designed hand tool serves
to effect an impedance match between the human and the environment, enabling
quick and efficient energy transfer. While this hypothesis does not deny the
importance of information processing, it avoids using a measure of information
transmission, which can be difficult to establish in the unstructured tasks of
typical tool use. The study is performed with a "virtual tool system" consisting
of a real time tool/environment simulation which outputs forces to a graphics
display. A novel computer architecture for simulation is used to achieve real
time rates.
