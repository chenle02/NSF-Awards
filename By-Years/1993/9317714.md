9317714 Anderson This project extends IP networking to 107 cooperative extension
offices throughout Iowa. The state is providing local area networks and computer
equipment at the extension offices. This award covers the networking equipment,
line installation and leasing, and technical and user support for the sites. The
network uses the Novell extended LAN concept, which makes the entire state
cooperative extension service network appear to the user as a LAN. The award
provides partial support for three years. ***
