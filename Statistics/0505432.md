The research aims to combine statistical and computational considerations in
designing new and useful predictive modeling tools and algorithms. Specifically,
the research involves the development of: a) new statistically motivated multi-
class boosting algorithms, based on a family of multi-class loss functions and
forward stagewise additive modeling; b) a family of (loss, penalty) pairs that
give piecewise linear solution paths, and yield modeling tools for both
regression and classification which are robust, adaptable and efficient; c) a
general theory and efficient algorithms for solving an L1 regularized problem in
infinite dimensional predictor space.

With the advent of modern technologies, the needs for predictive modeling tools
have been increasing rapidly. Consequently, many new ideas and methods have been
finding their way into the statistical community in recent years. These are
mainly related to the design and analysis of useful techniques for modeling of
high dimensional, noisy data, and these techniques are now being applied to
bioinformatics, high energy physics, speech recognition, text mining, and a wide
range of other important practical problems. This research aims to push these
developments forward along the line of regularization in predictive modeling,
and is expected to have broader impacts on the practice and education in the
domains of statistics, machine learning and data mining.
