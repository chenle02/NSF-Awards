The overall goal of this research is to determine the developmental sequence of
events that leads to the formation of the theca layer of an ovarian follicle. It
is likely that many of the most pivotal developmental events take place very
early in folliculogenesis. In order to study these events, it is necessary to
have markers that identify different cell types in early stages of development.
The main objective of this proposal is to produce monoclonal antibodies against
thecal differentiation antigens. These antibodies will be used in
immunocytochemical procedures to mark thecal progenitor cells. This methodology
will be applied to the study of three aspects of thecal cell development: 1)
thecal cell ontogeny during the initial period of follicular organization in
newborn rats, 2) thecal cell ontogeny during follicular development in adult
cycling rats, and 3) interactions among granulosa cells, theca cells, and
oocytes in culture. %%% The ovary undergoes dramatic morphological remodeling
throughout life in response to the reproductive status of the individual. The
theca cells are components of the ovarian follicle and are involved in steroid
hormone production. They are key players in the ovulation cycle of mammals.
