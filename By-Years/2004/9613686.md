The investigators will use data from ground-based radio-wave and optical
instruments at the Bear Lake Observatory near Logan, Utah, to address two
problems in atmospheric sciences. The first is a study stratospheric warming
events. Measurements of winds, kinetic and rotational temperatures, and emission
intensities made with Fabry-Perot and Michelson interferometers will be used to
study mid-latitude effects from wintertime stratospheric warming events. These
effects are evidence for dynamic coupling between low and high latitudes. The
second task is to study gravity wave coupling between the neutral atmosphere and
ionosphere. This study will combine observations of mesospheric nightglow
emissions made by the all-sky imager with electron density measurements made by
the digital ionosonde. The results will show if there is a relationship between
mesospheric wave activity and the state of the ionosphere. The project also
includes the installation of a telephone line extender to increase the
phone/modem remote access to observatory instruments.
