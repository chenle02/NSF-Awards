This project is creating collaborations among various partners to address the
shortage of engineering technicians in Southern Maryland. This is a multi-
focused project involving program improvements and technical experiences that
targets students at both the secondary and postsecondary levels. Efforts to
serve those currently underrepresented, women and minorities, are being
emphasized. A recruitment plan that raises awareness and enthusiasm for the
field is being implemented, and innovative project-based learning activities are
being integrated into program requirements in order to improve retention.
Modules developed through the New York State Curriculum for Advanced
Technological Education (NYSCATE) project are being adapted for local programs.
Student portfolios are being used to monitor progress and document their
readiness for employment. Employers are hosting onsite Tech Days, participating
in annual Technology Fairs and participating in the evaluation of students'
portfolios. Employer feedback is being analyzed regarding changes in the
readiness of local graduates for entry-level employment. Project results are
being shared through presentations and professional contacts since they are
transferable to other communities where school systems and postsecondary
institutions share workforce development responsibilities. Statewide
dissemination of the project results is assured through the Maryland State
Department of Education and the Maryland Association of Community Colleges.
