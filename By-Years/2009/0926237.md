Introduction Parallel computing in the form of chip multiprocessors has become
an industry standard. The number of cores on a chip is expected to continue to
increase in an effort to achieve continued performance growth while meeting
thermal and power limits. However, the increasing power-performance scalability
of multi-cores raises two main concerns. First, it is unclear how software will
take advantage of the increasing hardware parallelism, and second, power
consumption and thermal constraints are still a major design limitation.

Intellectual Merit This proposal focuses on a particular existing easy-to-
program and easy-to-teach multi-core architecture, which provides a different
approach to parallel programming, thus targeting the first concern above. The
work intends to demonstrate the programmability of this architecture by
incorporating it into parallel programming education at the college level. To
address the second concern, the work aims to study the power consumption of this
architecture and introduce novel power and thermal enhancements. Today?s
microprocessor industry focuses on a single model for general-purpose
multiprocessor computers. This proposal addresses the energy-efficiency of a new
approach to parallel computing, which targets single task completion time.
Ensuring that the new architecture meets power and thermal constraints will
enable it to serve as a viable alternative approach to parallel computing.

Broader Impacts The broader impact of this work is its potential to expose
students to multicore architectures and parallel computing. This includes
providing undergraduate students with research experience in energy-aware
computer architecture and parallel programming, as well as incorporating these
topics into existing courses and introducing new courses. A main goal of the
proposed activities is to attract young people to engineering, as well as
broaden participation of students in varied scientific areas, including students
from currently underrepresented groups.
