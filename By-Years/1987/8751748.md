The Northern California Science Project-Middle Grades is a cooperative effort
involving eight school districts in Central and Northern California and faculty
and staff at the University of California, Davis. The project will involve
twenty-four teachers (each year for two years) who regularly teach physical
science to 7th and 8th grade students. During years one and two, the project
will concentrate on training the participants in teaching methodologies based on
the constructivist theory of learning. All of the methodologies will be based on
selected topics in physical science. The first two years will see the teachers
involved in a two-day spring workshop and a three-week summer institute. During
the academic year following, the participants will be involved in five
additional day long workshops at each of eight districts sites, and visits by
the program staff to each teachers' classroom. During the second and third
years, emphasis will also be placed on documenting and assessing teachers'
ability to use the teaching model in typical 7th and 8th grade settings and the
effect of its use on the students conceptual understanding of selected physical
science concepts. The University of California, Davis and the school districts
have contributed an amount equal to 25% of the NSF award.
