The focus of this research is the application to organic synthesis of
organosilicon compounds which utilize more than one of the bonds to silicon,
especially organosilicon compounds with a protected internal nucleophile. The
scope, as well as the potential use of rearrangement and cleavage reactions
induced by a gamma-oxidopropyl group on silicon will be investigated, especially
possible applications to asymmetric synthesis. The effect of silicon groups,
compared to hydrogen, on the reactivity of ring opening reactions of expoxides
will be studied. With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting
the research of Dr. Paul F. and Anne M. Hudrlick of the Department of Chemistry
at Howard University. The Hudrliks will focus their work on the utility of
organosilicon compounds as intermediates in organic synthesis to develop new
reactions of general applicability.
