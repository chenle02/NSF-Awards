1266294 Princeton University; Claire Gmachi &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
center, led by Princeton University, will focus on developing the medical
applications of new mid-infrared technologies. The clinical research partner for
the proposed center is the Cleveland Clinic. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
center for MIMES plans to form long-term universityclinicindustry partnerships
dedicated to the research and development of engineering systems employing mid-
infrared photonic technologies for medical applications. As yet un-exploited
opportunities present themselves when using mid-infrared lasers at specific
wavelengths for medical applications. First, biological and physiological
compounds, such as glucose, dissolved blood gases, or proteins and their
malformed cancer-implicated forms have characteristic spectroscopic features in
the mid-infrared spectral range. Next, breath constituents are rapidly gaining
in importance as bio markers for health, disease-control, or drug-use
monitoring; they can be detected rapidly by the only-now becoming available fast
time-resolved mid-infrared sensors. Finally, specific tissue can be coagulated,
ablated, and otherwise manipulated more safely and less damaging to surrounding
tissue with the use of high-power lasers at wavelengths specifically targeting
proteins, lipids, or water. Similarly, the needs are great for new Diagnostics
techniques and technologies that enable new medical research, and develop new,
fast and/or non-invasive diagnostics tools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
center will operate at the intersection of two rapidly advancing, cutting-edge
research fields mid-infrared photonics and bio-medical engineering and
diagnostics and joins them together under the umbrella of long-term
universityclinicindustry partnership. The necessary outcomes are new bio-medical
diagnostics tools, developed so close to industrial reality and understanding to
enable a most speedy translation of the new discoveries, knowledge, and
prototypes into the marketplace and society, providing better healthcare in both
the short and long-term for all. MIMES will conduct research primarily with
graduate students and senior undergraduate students who have clear interests in
industrial R&amp;D and careers in industry. This focus, together with a
comprehensive recruiting and mentoring plan with strong industry involvement
will foster the development of a diverse, superbly trained, and globally
competitive group of graduates for a workforce that is ready to assume
leadership in real-world, applied, bio-medical and photonic engineering.
