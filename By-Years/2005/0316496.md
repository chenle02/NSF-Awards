Fungi, particularly those in the class Euascomycetes, are important decomposers
of large particulate organic matter in freshwater habitats, and hence are
important intermediaries in energy flow and chemical cycles. Despite evidence of
their importance, little information exists regarding their taxonomic identities
and abundance in various types of freshwater habitats throughout North America
and the rest of the world. As part of an ongoing survey of freshwater
eascomycetes along latitudinal gradients, Dr. Carol Shearer of University of
Illinois will collect, identify and isolate freshwater euascomycetes from a
variety of aquatic habitats. Collections will be made in geographical areas rich
in lakes and in tropical areas in Central and northern South America. This
survey is organized around two broad conceptual areas: (1) the relationship
between latitude and species diversity and composition, and species distribution
patterns; and (2) the evolutionary relationships among terrestrial, freshwater
and marine euascomycetes. Collections and cultures will be used to answer the
following questions: (1) What species comprise the freshwater euascomycetes? (2)
What is the relationship between latitude and species distribution patterns,
species richness, and taxonomic composition at the species level and above? (3)
Does species composition differ in lakes and rivers in the same geographical
area? (4) What is the nature and degree of morphological and life cycle
adaptation of freshwater euascomycetes to aquatic habitats? (5) How do the
freshwater euascomycetes differ taxonomically from their terrestrial and marine
counterparts? Products of this study will include: specimens, cultures, and gene
sequences of freshwater euascomycetes; descriptions of new genera and species;
an illustrated species monograph with an interactive key for their
identification available on the WWW; and improved understanding of the
relationships among sexually and asexually reproducing euascomycete species.
Resulting cultures will be screened for production of new, biologically active
chemicals and fungal cultures will be made available to other scientists for
systematic, developmental, physiological, molecular, and ecological studies. A
Colombian postdoctoral scholar will participate in the research, along with
undergraduate students at the University of Illinois.
