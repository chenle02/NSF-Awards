Techniques for Audio, Image, and Video Compression The goal of this research is
to investigate more effective techniques for digital audio, image, and video
data compression. For audio, the intention is to employ more efficient entropy-
constrained, conditional and unconditional, quantization in the coding of the
critical subbands of the MPEG audio standard. The dependence of the subbands is
next exploited using set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) as done
originally in embedded, wavelet, zerotree coding of images. The resulting
embedded coding allows delivery of different qualities of service with a single
compressed bit stream. A newly developed SPIHT procedure, which obtained
probably the best-to-date monochrome, still image results (lossy or lossless)
and with extremely fast encoding and decoding, is utilized for audio and also
for color image and video coding. The extremely fast execution of the SPIHT
coding procedure makes it especially suitable for video, where a requirement of
real-time coding becomes an insurmountable obstacle for other procedures. Both
lossy and lossless coding are investigated, as they fit naturally into the SPIHT
framework. It is expected that the results will surpass those of existing
standard systems, which do not produce naturally embedded code, and are far more
complex operationally and hence slower in execution. Other investigations
involve the use of information theoretic criteria to create optimal adaptive
subband compositions and the use of trellis coded quantization (TCQ) in block
discrete cosine transform (DCT) and lapped orthogonal transform (LOT) coding.
The adaptive subband decompositions pay off in better compression for a given
subband coding technique. TCQ coding brings an efficient, but complex technique
operating on transform blocks, which preserve regional characteristics of the
image. Finally, the SPIHT coding algorithm pr ovokes several theoretical
questions which are addressed. Among them are the minimal information rates to
determine octave ranges of random variables and convey subset partition numbers
and element numbers, and the mutual information between significant bits of
dependent random variables and between their respective residual bits.
Satisfactory answers to these questions will lead to more efficient coding
techniques with decreased complexity.
