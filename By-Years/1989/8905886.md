The Science Workbench is a computational environment that support a philosophy
of data management and group research. The environment consists of tools that
broadly support data management and manipulation; statistics, graphics, and
numerical analysis; and development and analysis of technical text. The
Workbench is currently functional and supporting both individual research and
group demonstrations and workshops. This project will allow continued
development of the Science Workbench. Specifically, the prototyping code needs
to be rewritten, and further integration of the archives and relational
environments with the statistics and graphics environments needs to be done. In
addition, methods will be developed for dealing with mapping perspective and
warping.
