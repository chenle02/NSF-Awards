This research concerns continuation of precise astronomical measurements related
to solar variability, the relation between solar activity and planetary weather,
and variations in the transparency of the Earth's atmosphere. New evidence for a
relationship between solar output and planetary "weather" comes from the planet
Neptune, whose global albedo has indicated cyclic variations associated with
solar cycle. Telescopic and Voyager spacecraft images combined with photometry
relate the brightness variations to transiting stratospheric clouds of frozen
methane. This work will include further multispectral continuum and methane-band
photometry and collaborative infrared imaging of Neptune, plus comparative
measurements of Titan and Uranus which also vary in brightness during solar max
91, to test competing solar-weather theories involving UV driven photochemistry
and cosmic-ray induced nucleation. A series of indirect solar brightness
measurements derived from photometry of the Galilean satellites of Jupiter will
also be completed. The 1976-1992 photometry encloses the 1980-1989 era of
precise solar radiometry by the Solar Maximum Mission (SMM) and will test the
veracity of a reported 0.4% solar brightness increase between 1976 and 1978.
Finally, using multicolor nighttime stellar and daytime solar photometry, a long
series of aerosol and ozone extinction measurements will be made to look for
systematic trends and diurnal variations.
