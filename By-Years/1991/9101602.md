This applicant will study the physiological function and related activities of
insulin degrading enzyme (a metalloendoprotease) in chinese hamster ovary cells.
Specifically, the work will focus on the enzyme's suspected activities,
including insulin degradation and muscle differentiation, by disrupting the
appropriate gene in ovary cells and characterizing the resultant cell line. The
work is planned to take place in the laboratory of Dr. Richard Roth and Stanford
University.
