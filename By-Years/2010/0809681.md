In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Prof. Gilbert Nathanson of the University of Wisconsin-
Madison will conduct a research program to study collisions and reactions of
gases at the surfaces of cold salty water and hot alkali carbonates. The long-
term objective of this research is to develop a molecular picture of gas-liquid
interfaces by exploring the interfacial analogues of collisional energy
transfer, bulk solvation, hydrogen bonding, the "like dissolves like" rule, and
acid-base and oxidation-reduction reactions. The present work has three specific
goals: 1) to investigate the interfacial dissociation of hydrogen chloride gas
in water and the ways in which dissolved ions enhance or suppress dissociation
of this common acid; 2) to explore exothermic gas-liquid reactions, such as the
halogen atom exchange F2(g) + I- =&gt; F- + IF(g), which may lead to non-thermal
ejection of the IF product into the gas phase, and 3) to learn how molten
carbonate solutions capture sulfur dioxide gas in order to model flue gas
desulfurization in coal-burning power plants. Graduate and undergraduate
students, both women and men, will participate in this
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
