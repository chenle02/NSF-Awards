The statistical problems of ranking and selection, hypothesis testing,
estimation and prediction in two-way and higher-way layout experiments will be
investigated from a Bayesian perspective. Hierarchical Bayesian procedures may
be implemented for everyday use through the realization that only low-
dimensional numerical integration is needed for many commonly used models and
that the efficient computational methods to evaluate these integrals are
available. The goals of this research are to characterize the multi-way
classification problems, to provide hierarchical Bayesian solution for the
models identified in the characterization, and to develop efficient algorithms
to compute the required integrals needed to implement the Bayesian methodology.
