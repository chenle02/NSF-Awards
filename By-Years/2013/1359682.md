Productivity in many crops is limited by CO2 availability and water use. The
CAPP project aims to overcome those limitations by transferring a performance-
enhancing Carbon Concentrating Mechanism (CCM) from green algae to higher
plants. This project will yield significant advances in our understanding in the
function of CCMs, which remain mysterious even though nearly all algae use them
to assimilate CO2. If successful, the project will be a key step towards
significant increases in crop productivity. More generally, this project
represents one of the first attempts at transplanting a complex system from one
organism to another, and thus will present many opportunities for learning
general principles that will be useful as mankind increasingly attempts to
engineer biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAPP2 will focus on understanding the
pyrenoid, an organelle at the core of the algal CCM, and re-creating its key
features in the C3 plant Arabidopsis. Structure, assembly and regulation of the
pyrenoid will be studied in the green alga Chlamydomonas, using mutants, light
and electron microscopy, and biochemistry. Components will be introduced into
Arabidopsis, and the impact on productivity will be modeled and measured.
Additionally, a FÃ¶rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) nanosensor will be
developed to measure concentrations of bicarbonate with sub-cellular resolution
in vivo; the sensor will be applied to characterize the CCM in both
Chlamydomonas and Arabidopsis.
