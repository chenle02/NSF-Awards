This action funds David Carson Jinkins of Penn State University to conduct a
research project, entitled "Quantifying the extent that Chinese consumers signal
well-being with consumption decisions," during the summer of 2012 at Peking
University in Beijing, China. The host scientist is Dr. Yaohui Zhao.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is in measuring the extent that
consumers buy goods to show others how well-off they are. Previous research has
uncovered broad trends in American consumption data which are consistent with a
simple signaling model. This project uses a more fully specified model to
measure the importance of signaling to both American and Chinese consumers. This
approach allows the measurement of welfare losses due to signaling, to estimate
welfare gains from excise taxes, and to compare the importance of signaling in
the United States and China.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
