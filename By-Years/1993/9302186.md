9302186 Michener This project will finish a comprehensive book length work on
the phylogeny and systematics of bees of the world, with supplementary
information on nesting and mating behavior, flower preferences and the like.
Using parsimony programs, the phylogeny of higher taxa (tribes to families) will
be investigated and presented. Keys for identification to the level of subgenus
will be produced. This work will be a contribution to the knowledge of bee
evolution and systematics. In addition, because bees are essential pollinators
of many plants and honey bees often are poor pollinators, studies of all bees
need to be facilitated for agricultural and conservation purposes. This work
will make possible bee identification (to the subgenus level) by ecologists,
botanists, and those concerned with biodiversity (that may be limited by loss of
pollinators) and will make possible improved understanding of bees as a group.
Moreover, the study of bees has had a major impact on the conceptual bases of
various evolutionarily important phenomena (e.g. altruism and sociality). A
comprehensive phylogenetic and systematic treatment will provide a framework on
which to evaluate such matters, both past work and future studies. %%% Because
