This project investigates how the capacity to remember past personal experiences
contributes to the emergence and maintenance of the sense of time. Individuals
with episodic amnesia, that is, amnesia for vivid personal past experiences, are
modeled in both science and the popular media as trapped in time. This core
metaphor shapes our understanding both of what episodic memory is (mental time
travel) and of its role in our lives as people (anchoring us in time). Amnesia
is seen accordingly as a pathology affecting an individual’s entire subjective
temporality, one that undermines their decisions about the future and scuttles
all possibility of autonomous living. Our work shows that amnesic individuals
are not trapped in time; they are capable of more as moral and practical agents
than the trapped-in-time model would lead one to predict.

We study temporal cognition in individuals with episodic amnesia to learn how
episodic memory is involved in cognition about time. Do individuals with amnesia
develop and maintain concepts of the past, present, and future? Do they
understand time’s irreversible order or that events can be sequenced earlier to
later? Do they care about the difference between the future and the past? Do
they discount the value of future rewards, make impulsive choices, or exhibit
presentist bias in their practical and moral decisions? Research in our and
other labs increasingly reveals that individuals with amnesia are not trapped in
time but understand time and its implications well. These findings are
transformative for humanists interested in the value of memory in human life,
philosophers interested in the source of our knowledge of time, scientists
struggling to understand what memory is and how it contributes to our lives as
persons, and, finally, to clinicians trying to help people with memory loss live
fuller human lives.
