This research will investigate the structure of semisimple Hopf algebras, of
Hopf algebra orders in group algebras, and of semisimple Hopf algebras which are
semi-direct products. The research will focus on the structure of finite-
dimensional semisimple Hopf algebras and the classification of such Hopf
algebras in low dimension. In particular, a resolution of the Kaplansky
conjecture will be sought. This research is in the general area of
noncommutative ring theory. The research is concerned with the structure of Hopf
algebras. An improved understanding of cosemisimple Hopf algebras could be of
fundamental importance not just in Hopf algebra theory but in other fields as
well. This an extremely difficult area but new techniques which have recently
been introduced indicate that substantial progress can be expected.
