The research will study biochemical messengers in the insect (grasshopper)
grazer digestive tract and test the hypothesis that as a result of herbivory,
plants respond to these messengers with altered plant growth responses and
productivity. The work will identify these putative messengers and to test them
in plant bioassays, utilizing coleoptile responses, sorghum seedling and whole
plant responses, and a grazing-sensitive grass, Pancium coloratum. The study
will test whether "Epidermal Growth Factor" (EGF), a peptidal growth factor in
mammals and recently identified in grasshoppers is the messenger and whether
plants have specific cell receptors to EGF. This work will provide important new
information for ecological work on the relationships between plants and animals
in natural and agricultural ecosystems.
