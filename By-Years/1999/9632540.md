9632540 DAVIS As part of the U.S. GLOBEC Northwest Atlantic Field Studies Phase
2 program, a modeling effort will investigate how physical processes interact
with population dynamics to control the distributions of dominant copepod
species (Calanus finmarchicus, Pseudocalanus newmani and P. moultoni,
Centropages typicus, and Centropages hamatus) in the Georges Bank/Gulf of Maine
region. The study will provide: 1) new insights into the functioning of a
mesopelagic component of a pelagic ecosystem, 2) novel information on the
dynamics of the prey field of larval fish, and 3) basic data on the potential
effects that climate change can exert on species distributions in temperate
shelf areas. ***
