This project introduces bold changes to the introductory- level computer
science course at this institution, a course patterned on the recommendations of
the ACM Curriculum '78 guidelines. Unlike traditional courses that concentrate
almost entirely on the teaching of a third generation programming language, the
new course first has the students solve complex problems using fourth-generation
application specific languages. They then progress through database and graphics
concepts utilizing a real- time data acquisition laboratory experience. The
course includes the teaching of a third generation programming language but
comprehensive user-friendly tools drastically shorten the time needed for
students to achieve a high level of programming proficiency. The laboratory
environment that supports this project includes: MAC II workstations, connected
by AppleTalk local area network software and hardware, a dedicated MAC II
fileserver, an Imagewriter LQ printer, and, instrument interfaces to connect the
configuration to digitizers, A/D-D/A converters, graphic printers and plotters.
Students in this course achieve a broader understanding of the capabilities of
computers and gain valuable experience in exercising these insights on problems
of a more useful and realistic scale than is possible in most introductory
courses. This award is being matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
