Travel support will be provided for 8 young researchers from US institutions to
attend the 2008 Conference on Stochastic Networks. Priority for support will be
given to researchers who have received their PhD within the last five years and
to graduate students in the last year of their PhD programs.

Stochastic network models have played a fundamental role in the development of
modern manufacturing, telecommunications, and computer systems. Interest in
these models cuts across many scientific disciplines including operations
research, computer science, engineering, mathematics, and statistics.
Frequently, important problems are attacked from very different points of view,
and there is great benefit to bringing together researchers with a wide variety
of perspectives. In order to address these problems, we need new mathematical
models and analysis techniques. The primary goal of the conference is to
identify such models and the requisite analytic and computational methodologies
that will help in basic understanding of system behavior and in the design and
control of these networks. The cross-fertilization of ideas from diverse areas
of application is one of the major contributions of these conferences.
