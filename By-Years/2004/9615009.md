ABSTRACT CTS-9615009 The proposed project deals with an important problem in
modeling radiative heat transfer. One factor that makes accurate prediction of
the radiative heat fluxes in combustion systems difficult is the lack of
accurate spectral properties of radiating gases. Existing property data for
gases such as carbon dioxide and water vapor have an average uncertainty as
large as 70%. These data were obtained more than 30 years ago. Since that time,
the accuracy of detection equipment has improved tremendously. The PI proposes
to use an FTIR-spectrometer and an isothermal high-temperature gas column to
obtain spectral absorption data of radiating gases.
