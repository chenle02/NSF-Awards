Professor Klein is the leader of a strong group of mathematical physicists at
University of California at Irvine. His recent work has been in the study of
disordered systems. This is the study of properties of materials in the presence
of impurities. For example, the motion of electrons in a crystal with impurities
is described quantum mechanically by a random potential. The most striking and
exceedingly important development with wide technological implications, is the
remarkable change in conductivity of the material due to impurities. The science
of composite materials, especially semiconductors, is undergoing a major
evolution in this regard. The mathematical study of disordered systems, from
many perspectives, is especially important, as instabilities often interfere
with the natural physical intuition. In this proposal, Professor Klein will
continue his productive study of random Schrodinger operators and spin glasses,
with particular emphasis on the weak disorder limit and the properties of the
density of states for random Schrodinger operators.
