&lt;br/&gt;Los Angeles County, the largest urban manufacturing area in the
United States, currently has a labor crisis in durable manufacturing that
threatens to inhibit the growth of the local economy. At a time when the metal
manufacturing industry is experiencing a growing demand for skilled employees,
industrial and technical education in the state is in crisis due to lack of
qualified instructors and support from districts. Well-educated machinists are
critical to the continued success of manufacturing in the region. To address
these issues, Los Angeles Trade-Technical College and the Small Manufacturers'
Association in collaboration with the National Institute for Metalworking Skills
are in the planning stages of establishing a Regional Center for Manufacturing
Education with the goal of developing a model for the systemic reform of
industrial education. Validating skills through nationally accepted standards is
at the core of the mission and is facilitating articulation along a career
pathway to stimulate the development of a well educated workforce. The ultimate
goal is to support the growth of durable manufacturing in the southern
California region. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
