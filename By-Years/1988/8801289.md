This conference on Kac-Moody algebras will be held December 13 - 17, 1988 at
North Carolina State University. It is for experts in the field as well as
researchers in related areas of mathematics and mathematical physics. The
conference is partly expository in nature, with Professors Kac and Moody giving
a series of lectures on the mathematical aspects of Kac-Moody algebras. In
addition, David Olive will lecture on the physical application of Kac-Moody
algebras, and there will be technical lectures by other participants. The theory
of Kac-Moody algebras began twenty years ago with the seminal work of Kac and
Moody, and has connections with diverse areas of mathematics, including number
theory, combinatorics, topology, completely integral systems, and particle
physics.
