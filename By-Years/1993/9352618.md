This project is improving the existing laboratory for the "Computer Systems" and
"Computer Communication & Networks" courses at San Francisco State University by
equipping the laboratory with new design and analysis tools. To reinforce the
material learned in the classroom, undergraduates are using software and design
tools based on advanced queueing models and digital circuit models to simulate
the networks and computer systems that they design for their homework
assignments and laboratory projects. Students are first learning the theoretical
basis of computer systems, then designing various aspects of these components
and systems, and finally testing their designs using computer simulations. In
the newly structured courses, students are conducting actual simulations of
their designs and are able to discover errors that are very difficult, if not
impossible, to detect in a paper-and-pencil design. Students are uncovering
their own mistakes in logic as they systematically check their own circuit
designs and are increasing their understanding of the theoretical concepts used
in their designs.
