This project is improving the undergraduate computer science curriculum through
the development of the new Experimental Computer Science Laboratory (ECSL),
which is dedicated to experimental work in the systems design area. The project
is developing laboratory experiments for three undergraduate courses in computer
architecture, operating systems/systems programming, and network security. The
ECSL is an experimental facility where students can get practical experience
with performance measurement and the analysis of computer hardware, system
software, and networks. Students can also experiment with software monitors,
workload tracers and generators, benchmarks, and advanced simulation and
visualization tools. Students are gaining experience with dynamic phenomena such
as page faults, system and networks saturation, pipeline stalls, system
bottlenecks, and cache thrashing. The new laboratory is enhancing activities
that have previously been severely restricted because of a laboratory timeshare
with courses in the software design area. The project is establishing the ECSL
as an isolated independent subnet with eight Sun Sparc 5 workstations, a Sparc
server, and a DEC Alpha server. *
