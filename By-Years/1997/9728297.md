9728297 Finkelstein The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) regulates many aspects
of plant growth and development affecting crop productivity, including
embryogenesis, water relations and tolerance of a variety of environmental
stresses. Our long term goal is to study the function and interaction of
elements involved in responses to ABA. Dr. Finkelstein has recently cloned a
gene required for seed responses to ABA, AB14, and found it to encode a protein
with homology to a class of transcription factors. The experiments outlined in
this proposal will characterize the location and timing of AB14 synthesis within
the plant, its biochemical function, and investigate its interactions with other
gene products in coordinating seed development. Our hypothesis is that AB14 is a
seed-specific member of a small family of transcription factors, at least one of
which (AB14) participates in seed- and/or ABA-regulation of gene expression,
possibly in combination with other transcription factors. The PI expects these
studies to have general relevance to understanding the activities of the other
members of this gene family. Furthermore, they may have practical significance
for potential manipulation of seed nutritional and storage qualities.
