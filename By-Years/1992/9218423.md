This research explores the effects of absorbed hydrogen atoms on phase changes
in metal alloys. Dissolved hydrogen appears to enhance metal atom mobility and
allows phase separation not normally observed at lower temperatures. Hydrogen-
induced lattice mobility, (HILM) is, therefore, the subject of this program.
Using the palladium-rhodium alloy system as a model, phase boundary compositions
are determined as a function of hydrogen content. Hydrogen is introduced under
high pressures (up to 2000 atmospheres). Phase segregation studies incorporating
HILM are extended to the palladium-platinum and nickel-copper alloy systems.
HILM-induced ordering of intermetallic phases is examined in selected
intermetallics in these alloy systems. Analytical techniques such as electron
microprobe analysis and scanning transmission electron microscopy are employed
to characterize the phases and related changes that occur. Mechanisms of HILM
are considered based on the experimental data developed. %%% Results from this
research should clarify how HILM can be used effectively in such areas as phase
diagram determination, materials synthesis, and micro-alloying.
