The Department of Mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania will purchase
computer equipment which will be dedicated to support research in the
Mathematical Sciences. The equipment will be used for several research projects,
including in particular that of Jim Lipton on automated deduction and
realizability, Eugene Lerman on some problems in symplectic geometry, that of
various junior faculty on projects in number theory, Lie algebras,
combinatorics, differential geometry, and partial differential equations, and
that of various graduate students on research projects on similar topics.
