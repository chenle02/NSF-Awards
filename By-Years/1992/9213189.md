Dynamic changes in the molecules that form the internal skeleton of nerve cells
are related to nerve cell form and function. Development of the nervous system
requires that the neuronal cytoskeleton be endowed the seemingly incompatible
properties of morphological stability and plasticity. Morphological stability is
critical for maintenance and proper function of neuronal circuits, while
plasticity is required for cell growth and remodeling of cell processes during
response to environmental stimuli or injury. The assembly or disassembly
kinetics of microtubules will be studied using the powerful techniques of
microinjection, laser-induced photobleaching and photoactivation. Previous
studies using these techniques have led to controversial results regarding the
site of assembly of microtubules in neuronal processes. Novel experiments will
be performed to resolve this controversy and to evaluate the potentially
powerful photobleaching laser technology as applied to living nerve cells. This
award will provide the PI with the laser equipment necessary for these
experiments.
