This award provides support for participants in the Midwest Partial Differential
Equations Seminars, a series of semi-annual meetings on recent developments in
partial differential equations. Partial differential equations (PDE) have
numerous connections and applications in fields as diverse as geometry,
analysis, mathematical physics, fluid dynamics, and mathematical biology. The
Midwest PDE Seminar series bridges these scientific areas and brings together
several generations of researchers. The 74th seminar (fall 2014 seminar) will be
held at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, during October 18-19, 2014.
The spring 2015 (75th) seminar will be held at the University of Minnesota.

The Seminars provide rapid communication of problems, methods, and results in
partial differential equations, and also enhance interactions among the
researchers in the Midwest working in PDE and related fields. Junior researchers
and graduate students are given special priority when both speakers and funded
participants are selected. Announcements of the upcoming Midwest PDE seminars
are routinely widely distributed via a mailing list, and the programs and
history of the Seminar are available at the web site
