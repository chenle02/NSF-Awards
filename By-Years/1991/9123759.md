This project involves combined experimental and analytical studies of knee
joints. Approximately twenty knee joint specimens will be designed, constructed,
and subjected to simulated earthquake loadings. The primary parameters of the
testing program will be the type of loading (monotonic or cyclic), the amount of
orientation of joint confining steel, and the length and type of reinforcing bar
anchorage. The analytical studies will involve the modification of a mechanical
model developed for interior joints for application to knee joints. The model to
be developed for such joints will be based on satisfying both equilibrium and
compatibility requirements at any state of response. The studies undertaken will
identify problem areas for joints designed to meet current ACI-ASCE Committee
352 recommendations and provide valuable data for the development of joint
models and design specifications.
