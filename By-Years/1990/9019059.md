The influence of human activities on Antarctic ecosystems is an important issue
in this pristine and fragile environment. In particular, the release of
untreated sewage from McMurdo Station has drawn considerable attention from
envirnomental groups. At the same time, very little is known about the
persistence of enteric indicator and pathogenic bacteria in the Antarctic marine
environment. McFeters proposes to address key questions that relate to the
potential public health and environmental impact of releasing untreated sewage
into Antarctic sea water. Moreover, it is hypothesized that the sewage plume
does not extend to the area of the potable water intake for McMurdo Station.
This hypothesis remains untested in view of the extended persistence of enteric
bacteria and currents in McMurdo Sound. McFeters will describe the extent of the
sewage plume under maximal occupancy circumstances at McMurdo Station and the
potential health as well as environmental consequences of the present sewage
disposal practices. Such information will be applicable to other polar regions
where increasing human activity poses a threat to the local ecosystem.
