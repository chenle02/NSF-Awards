This award supports studies of the Ferrar magma system in the McMurdo Dry
Valleys of Antarctica. Its goal is to understand magma transport and
differentiation, the primary processes by which continental crust and volcanic
magmas form, as well as a key way that planets and meteorite parent bodies
differentiate. The old model envisions straws and chambers of molten liquid that
pond and differentiate through a rain of crystals. This view has been challenged
by the Dry Valleys, where deeply incised valleys produced by tens of millions of
years of erosion crosscut an enormous magma body. Deep recesses of the magma
body expose stacked, crystal-laden sills that indicate much more complex
magmatic processing than previously thought. This project is deciphering the
complex processes recorded in these sills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
impacts of this work include undergraduate and graduate student education,
contributions to museum exhibits, lectures for the broader public, and
dissemination of the results in a book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
