This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) project is to explore the
development of a unified mechanics model for prediction of chatter during high-
speed milling; in particular, for systems with flexible tools and flexible
workpieces. The developed model will include time-delay effects and loss of
contact effects, and it will allow for features such as partial engagement of a
tool with the workpiece. Stability information will be obtained by using tools
from the nonlinear dynamics area. This model will be analytically and
numerically studied to determine stability charts in terms of parameters such as
spindle speed and axial depth of cut and the sensitivity of these charts to feed
rate and feed direction will be examined. Experiments will be conducted to
validate the model predictions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A potential risk involved
in the development of the model is due to the lack of readily available cutting
force data for high-speed milling operations. If successful, the development of
this model will have a tremendous impact on simulating workpiece-tool
interactions, selecting machining parameters, and redesigning tools for
important industrial problems such as the machining of T-shaped stiffeners and
return flanges with long end mills and the machining of difficult-to-machine
materials.
