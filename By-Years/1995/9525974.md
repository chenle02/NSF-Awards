The focus of this research will be the development of synthetic methodology
using chiral allenylmetallic reagents of tin, boron, titanium, chromium and
palladium. Particular attention will be placed on electrophilic substitution
additions to aldehydes as a route to enantioenriched propargylic and allenic
carbinols. Elaboration of the carbinols will permit the synthesis of subunits of
molecules that have important biological properties. With this renewal award,
the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. James A.
Marshall of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Virginia. Professor
Marshall will focus his work on the development of methods for the preparation
of alcohols, specifically allenylcarbinols and homopropargylic alcohols, that
can serve as subunits for the construction of molecules having interesting
biological properties.
