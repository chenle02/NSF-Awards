The Department of Environmental Studies is acquiring an inductively coupled
plasma atomic emission spectrometer for use in the analysis of environmentally
important materials by students in both lower and upper division courses. The
instrument is being used by undergraduates to analyze: magazine inks for toxic
metals such as cadmium; both essential and non- essential metals in shellfish
and other aquatic organisms; and, the content of various metals in soils, fuels,
and landfill leachates. The instrument is being used extensively in
undergraduate research projects.
