9522984 Landis This is a joint research project between the University of Maine
and Northwestern University. The objective of the research is to observe the
three dimensional growth of internal microcracks in small cement and mortar
specimens loaded in uniaxial compression. The microcracking will be measured
using synchrotron x-ray microtomography combined with a 3-D image analysis
technique. The research work represents the first time that quantitative
measurements of internal cracking of cement-based materials have been possible
at micron resolution. A clearer understanding of fracture mechanisms are
critical for the development of materials which are both stronger and tougher.
Recently, using the concepts of microfine particle packing in the range of
submicron millimeter, concrete with a compressive strength of up to 800 Mpa has
been developed. The influence of particle size distribution (reactive and non-
reactive particles) on fracture toughness is to be investigated.
