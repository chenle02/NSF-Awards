The project will (1) investigate novel approaches to providing extremely
efficient communication between protected domains running on the same machine,
(2) develop tools for helping programmers tune the performance of applications
limited by cache and virtual memory behavior, (3) develop new approaches to
building ATM network switches to make them both easy to implement yet capable of
delivering high performance, (4) investigate file system designs to improve
scalability and to reduce power consumption, and (5) produce software for
teaching undergraduate operating systems.
