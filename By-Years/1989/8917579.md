The workshop on Research Issues in the Integration of Heterogenous Database
Systems will bring together a small group of approximately forty participants
including both designers and users of large heterogenous systems that require
integration. The objective of the workshop is to provide new perspectives on
theoretical and experimental issues on this timely topic and to identify the
basic research needed before the next generation of distributed heterogenous
database systems is built. The workshop will examine the technical issues that
arise in designing multidatabase or federated database systems where the
individual systems have various degrees of autonomy and different capabilities.
Some of the topics to be discussed are semantic heterogeneity and schema
integration, transaction processing, and query processing.
