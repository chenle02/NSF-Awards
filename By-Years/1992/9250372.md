Cooper Union's Mechanical Engineering Department will establish an enhanced
undergraduate Acoustics Laboratory. Acoustics and vibration control is
increasing in prominence among the engineering disciplines. Cooper Union's
enhanced and expanded acoustics/vibrations lab will permit undergraduate hands-
on experience with sound intensity probes and force hammers, as well as a
greater understanding of the implications of random and sine sweeps of vibration
generated by a shaker . Also, the concept of modal analysis of a structure
undergoing vibration is clarified by the use of an accompanying modal analysis
computer program. An expanded acoustics/vibrations laboratory of this type
provides undergraduate engineering students with deeper insight into the nature
of the effects of oscillatory inputs, the means of measuring them and minimizing
their negative consequences .
