The project proposed is addressed to an analysis of the crossover distribution
in tomato plant anther cells by mapping the distribution of recombination
nodules associated with the synaptonemal complexes at late pachytene stage of
meiosis. This will be done using a hypotonic bursting technique developed by the
Investigator. The recombination nodule map will then be converted to a physical
map of recombination along each synaptonemal complex, correlated with available
gene linkage maps. Subsequently the information will be transferred to pachytene
chromosomes. The project should provide accurate mapping of genes and provide
further insight into chromosome crossover. The project has the potential to
yield important information in the area of cytogenetics that will be of use to
plant breeders.
