This project continues the principal investigator's work on contracting and
control issues in firms and corporations. Its aim is to gain a better
understanding of several critical unanswered questions: (1) What determines the
structure of securities in corporations and the allocation of voting rights
across these securities? For example, why do shareholders typically have votes,
while bondholders do not except when a firm is in financial distress? (2) How do
friendly mergers and hostile takeovers differ as mechanisms for achieving
changes in corporate control? (3) What determines the nature and extent of a
firm? Still other questions must be addressed before a full-blown theory of the
firm can be achieved. But that prospect, and the successes to date, provide a
powerful spur for persisting on the present course.
