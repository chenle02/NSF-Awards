Algebraic geometry, one of the oldest and most central fields of mathematics,
studies the geometric properties of solutions to systems of polynomial equations
in several variables. It has connections with many other fields of mathematics,
ranging from number theory to topology, algebra, and complex analysis. Algebraic
geometry has found important applications to problems in such diverse areas as
coding theory, theoretical physics and the mathematics of computation. The main
problems on which the PI will work involve recently introduced measures of the
complexity of algebraic varieties. The idea is to understand quantitatively to
what extent a given algebraic locus fails to be describable by coordinates that
satisfy no polynomial relations. This provides a new way of distinguishing
geometrically between different sorts of solution sets. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The PI will work on a number of problems in algebraic geometry. The
first series of questions concerns measures of irrationality for algebraic
varieties. While it is classical to study which varieties are rational or nearly
so, there has been recent interest in the problem of measuring and controlling
"how irrational" a given non-rational variety is. The PI will continue his work
with Ein and others on several invariants in this direction, including the least
degree of a rational covering of projective space, and the least gonality of a
covering family of curves. In a different direction, the PI will explore the
geometric meaning of some new cohomology groups defined by applying Wahl-type
maps to the vector spaces of Koszul cycles on an algebraic curve.
