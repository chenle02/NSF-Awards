A computer laboratory is being developed for students in third semester calculus
and differential equations. The laboratory is based upon Mathematica and makes
use of NEXT Computers. Students attend three lectures a week and then a two hour
"closed" laboratory. The computer laboratories are a means of enriching the
ideas presented in lectures and provide an opportunity for students to study at
length the implications and possibilities of these ideas since the tedious time
consuming calculations are relegated to the computer.
