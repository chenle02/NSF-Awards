The goal of this research effort is to successfully deposit copper by a
technique using a laser. The incentives to master this methodology relate to
fabrication of micron and submicron features on chips for electronics
applications. Other researchers are also expected to use the new system in their
studies on vapor deposition, eutectic microstructures, and substrate system
fabrication. The equipment to be used for the research project includes a
detection system, rapid scan spectrometer and an interfacing computer system.
