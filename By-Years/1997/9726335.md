This two-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research on
studies of changes in the strength of the earth's magnetic field during the
Cretaceous period. The collaboration involves the research groups of H. Paul
Johnson at the University of Washington and Carlos Laj at the Center for
Radioactive Intensity Studies, Gif-sur- Yvette, France. The investigators will
perform paleointensity experiments on unaltered Cretaceous volcanic rock from
the Pacific Northwest. In the French laboratory, the rocks will be tested for
geomagnetic field intensity and correlations between intensity and polarity
reversal rates. The US investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in
geophysics. This is complemented by French expertise in experiments in
paleointensity. The project's focus on long-term changes in geomagnetic field
strength will advance understanding of function of the geodynamo and
interactions between the liquid core and earth's lower mantle.
