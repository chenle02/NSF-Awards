9310624 Ereshefsky Linneaus developed his system of classifying animals and
plants to accord with the biological theory of his day, namely a theory based on
creationism and essentialism. Linneaus assumed that God created an initial pair
of organisms for each species and after God's original creation no new species
could arise. Contemporary biology, of course, does not contain such tenets. The
source of species is not God but evolution through natural selection and various
other biological processes. Despite the abandonment of Linneaus' biological
assumptions, the Linnaean System is still the preferred framework for
constructing classifications of the organic world. However, with the advent of
evolutionary theory, the Linnaean System faces numerous problems that undermine
its effectiveness. The Linnaean System has lost its theoretical basis and has
become both cumbersome and ontologically vacuous. Yet, there is currently no
thorough study of the problems confronting the Linnaean System. Dr. Ereshefsky,
under this grant, is providing just such a study. Another aim for Dr. Ereshefsky
is to investigate an alternative taxonomic system, namely Willi Hennig's 1969
numerical system. Preliminary work indicates that Hennig's system can overcome
many of the problems facing the Linnaean System. ***
