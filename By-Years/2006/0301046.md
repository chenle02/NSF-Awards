ABSTRACT: EIA 0301046, CRA, Lori Pollock, PI&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award to
the Computing Research Association provides funds for travel grants for
participants and speakers, and support for the workshop keynote dinner for the
CRA-W 2003 Career Mentoring Workshop. The workshop has the objectives of 1)
providing undergraduate women with exposure to computing research, 2)
establishing and nurturing multi-institution and interdisciplinary research
collaborations, 3) strengthening one's decision making power and coping ability
with regard to the job and 4) providing support for teaching, advising, and
service components of an academic career. The project incorporates a special
keynote dinner with an inspirational woman speaker and opportunities to form and
nurture relationships with potential mentors and colleagues. These workshops
have been very successful in the past and this project will continue with
similar results.&lt;br/&gt;
