Mechanistic studies of potentials and interactions at biosurfaces for directly
sensing the antigen-antibody reaction in a biosensor and significantly enhance
the separation resolution in capillary electrophersis will be carried out.
Research will also be carried out on the use of capillary electrophoresis for
carbohydrate characterization of glycoproteins and for the studies of
carbohydrate-protein interactions in molecular and cell recognition.
