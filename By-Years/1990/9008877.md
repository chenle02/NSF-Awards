This Research Opportunities for Women Career Advancement Award is in the general
area of organic chemistry. Dr. Margaret V. Merritt of the Chemistry Department
at Wellesley College will develop methods for using electric dipole moment
measurements to examine the association and structure of chiral ion pairs. The
interionic geometry of ion pairs in particular solvents may be correlated with
the electric dipole moment. In this study, both of the ions will have an
asymmetric center: the cation will be a quaternary amine and the anion will be
the salt of mandelic acid. The capacitance and conductance measurements will be
made with the advice of Dr. Ernest Grunwald, emeritus professor of Brandeis
University, who has experience in this field. A postdoctoral worker and an
undergraduate student will participate in the project. This award will enable
Dr. Merritt to establish a new capability that is complementary to kinetic
studies she has carried out previously. It is anticipated that undergraduate
students will be able to participate readily in these new projects. Future
student projects will involve the preparation and characterization of novel
chiral ion pairs and determination of the solvent dependence of the dipole
moment of a single ion pair. Infrared and proton nmr spectroscopy and X-ray
structure characterization will also be utilized.
