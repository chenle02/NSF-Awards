This project is designed to enhance the capabilities of mathematics teachers
from the rural Northwest Educational Region of North Carolina. Sixty teachers in
grades 9-12 will be served through five courses, two offered each of three
summers. These courses are aimed at helping teachers work with mathematical
concepts, materials, and methods that begin with what they now know and teach.
The courses will cover problems in remedial mathematics, computing, problem
solving, discrete mathematics, and concepts of calculus. In addition to the
summer course work, there will be a one-day follow-up workshop in the fall for
summer participants and a follow-up visit by the faculty to each participant's
classroom in the spring. The project is specifically designed to strengthen the
backgrounds of mathematics teachers from this geographic area who are
particularly weak and insecure in their content preparation and teaching. The
project aims to attract these teachers to the program through videotaped
publicity about the courses broadcast throughout the region. The project seeks
to improve not only the teachers' content preparation but also their self-esteem
and appreciation for teaching. Project evaluation will focus both on changes in
content presentation and in teachers' attitudes.
