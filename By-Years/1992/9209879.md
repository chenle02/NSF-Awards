This is a renewal grant for theoretical study of electronic transport phenomena
in disordered systems having strong electron- electron interactions. Effective
field theoretic models will be developed, and studied using perturbative
techniques and the renormalization group. Specifically, this research will
center on two problems in superconductivity and three problems involving metal-
insulator and related problems in normal systems. The issues in
superconductivity are the supression of conventional superconductivity by strong
disorder and the possibility of exotic superconductivity in two-dimensional
electron systems. The work in normal conductors is aimed at enhancing current
understanding of zero temperature phase transitions in doped semiconductors. %%%
This ongoing research project will study transport of electric current in
several types of materials. The unifying theme is that the interactions between
the charge carriers is strong. Such materials are potentially among the
brightest opportunities for new practical application, and are little understood
at the present time. This project will investigate fundamental issues of this
class of materials which will form much of the intellectual infrastructure for
their future application.
