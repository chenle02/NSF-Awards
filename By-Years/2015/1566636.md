In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms
program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Jingsong Zhang of the University of
California at Riverside investigates the photodissociation dynamics of
polyatomic free radicals. Free radicals are important reactive intermediates in
many reactive chemical environments. The fundamental knowledge (spectroscopy,
energetics, reaction mechanisms, etc.) from this work is valuable to the
combustion, atmospheric chemistry, and organic chemistry communities, as well as
the theoretical chemistry and physics communities. The broader impacts of this
work also include advancing education and training of graduate students,
promoting undergraduate research experience of women and underrepresented
minority at the University of California at Riverside. The project also includes
outreach to a diversified student population of the Riverside and San Bernardino
community colleges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to provide
quantitative understanding of the photo-chemical reactivity of prototypical
polyatomic radicals and their nonadiabatic dynamics and competitive pathways at
quantum accuracy. The project focuses on several benchmark systems, such as the
methyl, ethynyl, and HCO radicals. The H-atom photoproducts of these systems are
characterized using the high-resolution, high-sensitivity high-n Rydberg atom
time-of-flight (HRTOF) technique as the main experimental tool. This technique
provides state-resolved or even state-to-state product energy and angular
distributions. These experiments aim to render high-quality data and benchmarks
to test high-level quantum mechanical theories of the excited open-shell
species.
