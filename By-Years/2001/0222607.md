This project is developing methods for studying the organic composition of
clouds and fogs and the efficiency with which clouds and fogs scavenge
carbonaceous aerosol particles. The project includes a laboratory development
effort to improve capabilities for measuring concentrations of the diverse
organic species suspected to be present in cloud and fog drops and a series of
field experiments to collect samples suitable for application of the developed
suite of organic analytical techniques. The field campaigns are being used to
collect samples of cloud/fog types that are seasonally important in three
distinct environments: winter radiation fogs in the California's Central Valley,
spring stratus clouds intercepting the coastal hills of Southern California, and
summer orographic clouds intercepting the western slope of the Rocky Mountains.
