The goal of this project is to seek a quantitative molecular level description
of the mechanical aspects of the biofunctionality of glycosaminoglycans and
their higher structures. A comprehensive series of laser light scattering and
spectropolarimetric experiments will be carried out under varying conditions of
solute concentration, pH, ionic strength and temperature. The data will provide
a detailed picture of glycosaminoglycan behavior in terms of conformational,
hydrodynamic, secondary structural and intermolecular phenomena. This
description will in turn form the basis for a macromolecular thermodynamic
formulation of glycosaminoglycan polyelectrolyte behavior. Acidic
polysaccharides known as glycosaminoglycans are highly charged polyelectrolytes
found in many different forms in virtually all connective tissue. Among their
major physiological roles in connective tissue and extracellular matrix are the
production of swelling pressure and compressive stiffness, the production of
streaming potentials and the micro-porous control of solute transport.
