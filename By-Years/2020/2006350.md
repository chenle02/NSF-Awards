Queuing models provide important methods for studying customer flow in many
service industries. Patient flow in hospitals and calls to large-scale call
centers provide examples of systems where waiting time in queue and service time
may exhibit a complicated dependance structure not typically accounted for in
existing models. This project will provide fundamental new theoretical
understanding as well as efficient computational approaches for queueing systems
where service requirements may exhibit certain types of dependance with waiting
times in the queue. The project will specifically seek better models and
policies for critical care service systems, for example, in hospital emergency
departments where patient health can deteriorate significantly while waiting for
service. This research will support graduate students in developing new
quantitative skills and to use these to solve challenging operational
problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dependence of the service times on the delay
in queue (endogenous dependence) or the patience distribution (exogenous
dependence) gives rise to substantial empirical and mathematical difficulties
due to the fact that the queue processes do not admit a (finite-dimensional)
Markov representation. Even limiting approximations for infinite-dimensional
Markov (measure-valued) representations require new techniques, because existing
techniques rely heavily on the service times being independent of other
primitive distributions. This project will develop rigorous new tools to
overcome these difficulties. In particular, novel stochastic-process
approximations and limiting techniques will be employed in order to provide
effective approximations for the complex queueing dynamics, and in turn, to
optimize operations. To facilitate the implementation of the project's models in
practice, the empirical challenges will be addressed as well, in order to
appropriately fit the models to real-world systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
