Abstract ATM-9709095 Jacoby, Gordon C. Columbia University Title: Long-Term,
High Resolution Paleoclimate in the Wrangell Mountain Range in Alaska This award
supports a study to develop the high-resolution, multi- proxy paleoclimate
potential of the Wrangell Mountain region of Alaska. The region contains proven
paleoclimatic resources documenting natural climate variability through much of
the late Holocene. The tree-ring and glacial resources make this a promising
area where high-resolution, multi-proxy climate histories may be developed.
Subfossil spruce preserved in glacial, alluvial and volcanic deposits (much
above or near modern tree line) could potentially extend the tree-ring record
back through the past three millennia. With both ring-width and density
parameters from the trees and sampling dry as well as wet sites, annual and
seasonal information will be developed that will be directly comparable to
glacial fluctuations. The generation of dendroclimatic data and reconstructions
together with high-resolution, tree-ring dating of glacial fluctuations and
geomorphic changes will lead to a better characterization of the natural climate
variability.
