This is an award to support research on reducing the content of methane in
exhaust gases from vehicles using methane as a fuel. The objective of this
project is to determine the feasibility of combining the methane-activating
function of partial oxidation catalysts and the strong chemisorptive properties
of deep oxidation catalysts into catalysts that will be active for deep methane
oxidation at temperatures significantly lower than now necessary to be used with
currently used platinum catalysts. Exhaust gases from combustion of methane in
vehicles utilizing methane as a fuel contain significant amounts of methane.
This is likely to impede movement toward acceptability of vehicles that utilize
methane for a fuel. Results of this project are expected to determine whether
the passage of exhaust gases through the catalysts synthesized in this project
will reduce the emissions of methane from vehicles using it as a fuel. The
proposal leading to this award was submitted in response to NSF 92-30, Small
Business Innovation Research under Topic No. 25d, Environmental Systems.
