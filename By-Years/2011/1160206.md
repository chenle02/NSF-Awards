The project covers a wide range of aspects in algebra such as algebraic groups,
algebraic geometry, and motivic cohomology. The PI proposes to use the theory of
algebraic cycles, algebraic cobordisms, algebraic stacks and motivic cohomology
in algebraic geometry to study the essential dimension of algebraic objects and
the rationality property of classifying spaces of algebraic groups. Both topics
are related via the notion of cohomological invariants of algebraic groups. The
first topic that the PI proposes to investigate is the essential dimension of
various algebraic objects. The essential dimension measures the complexity of a
given class of algebraic objects. In particular, the PI proposes to compute the
essential dimension of certain classes of algebraic groups and give applications
in the theory of simple algebras and quadratic forms. The second topic is the
study of cohomological invariants of algebraic groups and their applications to
the classical problem of stable rationality of classifying spaces of algebraic
groups. The PI proposes to study cohomological invariants of maximal algebraic
tori of semisimple groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of
mathematics is to provide an approximation to the picture of the physical world.
This project develops methods from the essential dimension that studies the
complexity of algebraic objects and algebraic geometry concerning geometric
objects coming from graphing polynomial equations that are called algebraic
varieties. This project is devoted to the study of certain fundamental problems
in algebra using methods of invariants of algebraic groups. Results obtained
from this approach may provide enlightening examples related to difficult
conjectures in the rationality problem of algebraic varieties. The new areas of
algebra that will hopefully evolve from the work on the project will create new
research opportunities for graduate students and junior faculty and provide
material for graduate courses.
