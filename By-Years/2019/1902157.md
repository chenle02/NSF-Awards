The award supports research in algebraic geometry, a central branch of
mathematics which aims to understand, both practically and conceptually,
solutions of systems of polynomial equations in many variables. Algebraic
geometry has important applications to other fields of mathematics, such as
number theory, topology, and analysis, as well as to physics, biology,
cryptography, and engineering. Young researchers including graduate students
will be involved in this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will work on a
variety of topics centered around degenerations of algebraic varieties and
functorial, geometrically meaningful compactifications of their moduli spaces.
The central part of the project is the study of functorial compactifications of
moduli spaces of K-trivial varieties, such as K3 surfaces, hyperkahler
varieties, Calabi-Yau varieties, and abelian varieties, including both explicit
descriptions of these compactifications, as well as their properties such as
Kodaira dimension and canonical models. A separate project is on the volumes of
log surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
