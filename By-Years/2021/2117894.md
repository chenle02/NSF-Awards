The current established cosmological model for a theory of the Big Bang still
leaves open a question how the entire observable Universe being spawned in a
dramatic, exponential "inflation" from a sub-nuclear, microscopical volume to
the current macro-scale volume of spacetime. The extraordinarily sensitive
measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation (temperature and
polarization of the mm/sub-mm sky) are traditionally associated with large CMB
surveys, but the ultra-deep sky maps will play a vital role in exploiting the
full power of new cosmological observables and provide groundbreaking
constraints on the duration and timing of the Epoch of Reionization.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the design and construction of a 100
mK dilution refrigerator cryostat that will be used to develop and test
prototype Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detector (MKID) arrays, multiplexed
readout, and low-loss optics. When this cryostat is outfitted with a full
complement of detector arrays, readout, and optics, it will comprise a new
camera with unique capabilities not provided by any existing or planned
millimeter/submillimeter (mm/sub-mm) experiments. Observations with this camera
on the 10-meter South Pole Telescope (SPT) will lead to major advances in our
quest to understand the evolution of the Universe and the underlying physics
that governs its expansion. This proposal leverages significant investment in
the production of prototype MKID arrays and readout and will benefit from the
NSF's investments in the SPT construction and operation, thus enabling rapid
deployment of this camera and realization of the groundbreaking new scientific
program. This work builds on the experience and scientific successes of the SPT
team that which has fielded three cameras on the SPT and used the resulting data
to produce world-leading studies of the early
Universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
