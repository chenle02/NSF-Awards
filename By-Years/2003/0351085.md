The PIs will build the Dual Pressure Temperature Tapered Probe (DPTTP) for
deployment in the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program under this award. This tool
will be used to estimate in situ pore pressure, permeability, and temperature of
subseafloor sedimentary rocks. The tool extends the capability of the current
ODP pressure probe, the DVTP-P, because it will have a narrower geometry (more
rapid dissipation) and it will use a new dual pressure sensor technology wherein
pressures from two sensors are cross-correlated to interpret in-situ pressure
and permeability from partial dissipation records. The DPTTP will have a modular
configuration with 1) a Mechanical Delivery Unit, 2) a Data Acquisition and
Storage Assembly, and 3) a Tapered Probe. The Delivery Unit will be the existing
ODP colleted system. The Data Acquisition Unit will be a new multi-channel
system for general remote application: future geotechnical tools can be attached
like the Tapered Probe to the 1st two units. The DPTTP will be land field tested
in Year 2 to optimize design. A final field test will be on land or a cruise of
opportunity. Theoretical analyses will be pursued concurrently with DPTTP
development.
