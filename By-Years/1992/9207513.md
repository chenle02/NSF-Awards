This research focuses on the use of organophosphorus chemistry related to the
Wittig olefin synthesis to develop practical reagents for the conversion of
aldehydes into E-alkenes. The origin of solvent effects on ester-stabilized
ylides will be studied and probes for detecting electron transfer pathways in
the Wittig process will be developed. The potential for use of chiral phosphines
as nucleophilic catalysts for entioselective transformations will also be
tested. In other areas, Dr. Vedejs will explore the thermodynamic advantage of
1,3-dienes relative to allenes as a driver for the Cope rearrangement and
studies will focus on understanding the role of heteroatoms on the
stereochemistry of alkene osmylation and epoxidation reactions. %%% With this
Accomplishment Based renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting
the research of Dr. Edwin Vedejs of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Wisconsin, Madison. Professor Vedejs will focus his work on
mechanistic and preparative studies of the Wittig reaction, a widely-used route
to the preparation of alkenes which are straight chain compounds with double
bonds, an extremely important class of organic compounds.
