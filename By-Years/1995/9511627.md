New York University Understanding Atmosphere-Soil Interactions - A Pilot Study
of Historic Russian Soils Archived samples of soils located at the Russian
Academy of Forestry in St. Petersburg are well documented and in exceptionally
good condition after a century of storage. US and Russian investigators will
identify samples from the collection and corresponding sites for future studies
on soil dynamics in relation to post-industrial atmosphere-soil interactions.
Atmosphere-soil interactions targeted for study include carbon cycling, acid
rain deposition and effects on buffering capacities of soils, and atmospheric
contaminants of the post-industrial era. The approach is to establish a suite of
samples and corresponding collection sites along a climate/soil gradient that
can be revisited in 1996/1997. Selecting samples along a gradient enhances
understanding of processes that control atmosphere-soil interactions such as how
rates of carbon turnover vary along a precipitation gradient. This pilot project
will ascertain the condition of selected samples, availability of documentation
on corresponding sites from which the samples are believed to have been taken,
and the condition of the corresponding sites.
