9603376 Burton This proposal describes an evaluation effort to determine whether
the introduction of network-based computing supporting education reform and
whether that correlates positively with increases in community-school
interaction, and teacher training modelled after Statewide Systemic Initiatives
(SSI). We seek to determine the extent to which networking facilitates community
involvement and increases support for education reform, as well as those factors
that affect organizational change that supports or inhibits reform. In order to
allocate human and capital resources optimally for education reform, we need
rich, generalizable evidence of the circumstances under which reforms achieve
maximum effectiveness. Currently, little is known from more than an anecdotal
perspective, about the effectiveness of network applications, including
community-school interactions, in combination with constructivist teaching
styles and strategies. To evaluate these combined effects, we will conduct
structured interviews, surveys, and focus groups with teachers, students,
administrators and community members at three school districts in Virginia. The
participating sites are selected on the basis of their commitment to the
Statewide Systemic Initiative (SSI) in Virginia, VQuest, and to networking
applications in the classroom and with the community, as well as overall project
goals. ***
