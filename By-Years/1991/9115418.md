The shape of small metal clusters is determined by forces intermediate between
those of the isolated molecule and the extended solid. Particle shape plays an
important role in surface interactions and catalytic behavior. This project will
apply microwave-optical double resonance spectroscopy to determine the nature
and extent of Jahn-Teller distortions in the vibronic spectra of small metal
clusters. These experimental measurements will be a rigorous benchmark against
which present theoretical calculations will be evaluated. This project is
jointly supported by the Physics and Chemistry Divisions of NSF.
