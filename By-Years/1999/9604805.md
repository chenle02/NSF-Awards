This is a proposal to purchase an optical biosensor instrument for research in
molecular and cellular biology. The proposed instrument uses a cuvette-based
design to measure, in real-time, the interaction between different molecules.
The technology is based on an optical biosensor which detects macromolecular
binding due to changes in refractive index at the boundary of the biosensor
surface. This instrument permits real-time, analysis of molecular interactions.
A variety of molecular interactions will be studied. These include both kinetic
and thermodynamic analyses of hormone-receptor, enzyme-substrate, receptor-
cell, DNA-DNA, DNA-protein, and protein-protein interactions. These interactions
are central to processes in molecular and cellular biology such as cell
motility, genetic recombination, protein transport, RNA transcription, and
signal transduction. These interactions can now be studied in real time over a
wide dynamic range of size and concentration, and without the need for
radioisotopic, or other, labeling. Application of this new technology will
greatly facilitate fundamental research on cellular function and will contribute
to the training of future biological scientists.
