This project concerns the applicability of the classical theory of choice under
subjective uncertainty to individuals. Two distinct behavioral properties are
implied in the classical paradigm. The first is the property of probabilistic
sophistication, i.e., acts are evaluated solely on the basis of their implied
subjective probability distributions to an individual over outcomes. The second
property, expected utility maximization, maintains that these implied
probability distributions over outcomes are ranked by means of a von Neumann-
Morganstern utility function and concerns only the individual's attitudes toward
risk. This research looks at individuals who are not probabilistically
sophisticated in that their choice behavior is neither derived from nor
observationally consistent with the existence of an underlying subjective
probability distribution over uncertain events. Two distinct but compatible
analytical approaches to this problem are studied. The first characterizes
probabilistic sophistication in the absence of the expected utility hypothesis.
The second develops the notions of a local probability distribution and local
risk preferences and examines the extent to which these concepts can be used to
characterize the global properties of non- probabilistically sophisticated
preferences. These analytical tools will then be used to explore the general
robustness of the concepts and results of the classical paradigm to departures
from probabilistic sophistication, and to study cases of induced violations of
probabilistic sophistication. For example, group decision making with
heterogeneous beliefs and behavior under incomplete information such as the
problems of moral hazard and adverse selection will be investigated. This
research is very important because it tackles problems in an area central to
theoretical and practical research in economics and management science.
