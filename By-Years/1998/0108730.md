A contentious issue in biology is whether speciation, the splitting of one
species into two, can occur when no geographic barrier separates the incipient
species. Speciation without geographic isolation has been hypothesized to occur
in plant-feeding insects that use the host as a rendezvous for mating: if a
population diverges into two populations that feed on different hosts, the
resulting populations will no longer encounter each other. The proposed work
will investigate whether divergence in host preference and consequent mating
isolation can occur in a laboratory population of the common fruit fly,
Drosophila melanogaster. In each generation, unmated flies will be allowed to
choose between two hosts that require different fly attributes for successful
breeding. Mating will take place only between flies that chose the same host.
The extent to which the experimental population splits into two populations with
different host preferences will be monitored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results
will aid biologists' understanding of the mechanisms of species formation in
plant-feeding insects, one of the most diverse groups of organisms on earth. The
results will also shed light on the mechanisms by which insect species that feed
on non-crop species can form new races on crop species.&lt;br/&gt;
