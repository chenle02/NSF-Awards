The objective of this research program is to investigate evidence for the time-
dependent nonlinear behavior of soil resulting from earthquake-induced strong
ground shaking. The evidence is being sought in the accelerograms recorded
during the 1979 Imperial Valley earthquake. During this earthquake, accelerogram
records were obtained of the strong ground motion at the Differential Array
station and at the Array No.1 free-field location. These records are being
analyzed in detail to determine the time-dependent character of the apparent
stiffness reduction of the underlying soil during this event. The analysis
consists of: (1) Dividing each of the two accelerograms into several time
windows representing (a) the weak motion prior to the S-wave arrival, (b) the
initial portion of strong shaking beginning with S- wave arrival, (c) the middle
and latter portions of strong shaking, and (d) the weaker motions at the ends of
the records; (2) computing the Fourier Amplitude Spectra of each time segment in
each accelerogram; (3) calculating the ratio (transfer function) of the
Differential Array and Array No.1 Fourier Amplitude Spectra for each time
segment; (4) noting any changes in the frequency at which the first prominent
peak in the transfer function occurs; (5) estimating the associated shear-
modulus reductions implied by the frequency changes; and (6) estimating the
soil-shearing strain from the integrated accelerograms and shear- wave velocity
profile of the underlying soil. The results of this analysis will indicate the
presence of any time-dependent nonlinear behavior; and, if present, it will
suggest whether this behavior occurred gradually or suddenly; and whether during
the end of the shaking the shear-modulus of the soil returned to its initial
state prior to the strong ground shaking. These effects are very relevant to
earthquake hazard mitigation.
