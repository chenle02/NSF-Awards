Mathematical descriptors of physical characteristics of point processes arising
in communication engineering will be studied. Discrete and continuous time
models for packetized data streams will be considered. The mathematical
descriptors will be used in studying approximating point processes, in examining
queueing behavior and as a tool in the empirical study of performance
characteristics. This research will significantly enhance knowledge and
understanding of packet communications.
