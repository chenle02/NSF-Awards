The purpose of this proposal is to develop an immobilized enzyme system for ATP
regeneration using polyphosphate kinase from Escherichia coli. The objectives
are fourfold. The first is to increase the cost-effectiveness of the enzyme
purification process by improving its speed, capacity and yield. The second is
to immobilize polyphosphate kinase on different insoluble supports so as to
identify the most viable enzyme conjugates. The third is to construct packed bed
reactors and determine the performance parameters in continuous-flow systems.
The fourth objective is to determine kinetically the optimal operating
parameters for the regeneration process. The work provides an excellent
opportunity for undergraduates to gain hands on experience in the development of
a process that may become economically important in biotechnological operations.
