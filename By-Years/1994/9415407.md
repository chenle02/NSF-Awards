Under this award, Dr. Barcilon will continue research aimed at understanding
the interaction between the largest (planetary scale) atmospheric wave patterns
and "weather system" (synoptic scale) waves. It is primarily the energy
transfers between these waves that governs the evolution of weather regimes in
the midlatitudes. The principal investigator will employ a simple, two-layer
model to explore the effects of topography and horizontal wind shear on the
flow. Better understanding of these dynamical processes is essential if
improvements are to be realized in medium and extended range prediction.
