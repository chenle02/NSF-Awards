Abstract Narrative Professor Jones will gather information on income and
expenditure patterns in 25 cities and towns in east-central Mexico. Information
will be obtained from households, businesses, and local government officials.
Particular attention will be devoted to gathering data on remittances received
from workers employed in the United States, as such payments are a major source
of the income in the region. The purpose of the research is to determine how
migration to the United States, in conjunction with other external sources of
income (for example, government investments), generate economic growth or
decline in small towns in the region, and by extension, in non-metropolitan
areas in third world nations generally. There is considerable disagreement in
the social science literature over whether international migration produces
beneficial or adverse effects in the regions migrants leave. Professor Jones's
research will help resolve such disagreements.
