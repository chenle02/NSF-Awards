The design of forming processes, particularly those involving aluminum alloys,
is the focus of the research of this collaborative project between the
University and industry. The work will attempt to utilize the complementary
aspects of backward-tracing algorithms and the ideal forming theory based on the
minimum plastic work path concepts. The design sensitivity calculations will be
used as the vehicle for relating one to the other. A unified manufacturing
design strategy that attempts to optimize simultaneously the geometric and
material specifications for the preform, as well as the temporal and spatial
characteristics of the process parameters, is the immediate goal of this
research. The design strategy will be applied to the design of real-life forming
processes, and the results will be experimentally verified. The design strategy
will eventually be extended to include issues of product design as well. This
will allow the realization of an long-term goal of concurrent, rather than
sequential, design of formed products and forming processes.
