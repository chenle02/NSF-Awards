Pinsky The 26th Midwest Probability Colloquium will be held at Northwestern
University, on October 15-16, 2004. This is a regional meeting with a limited
number of talks and plenty of opportunity for interaction among the researchers.
It has a strong tradition of encouraging graduate students and other young
investigators to attend and interact with specialists. This year's speakers are
Persi Diaconis, Z.-Q. Chen, and Francesco Russo.
