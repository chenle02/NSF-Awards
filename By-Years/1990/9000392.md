The Moss Landing Marine Laboratory of San Jose State University will acquire
several items of oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared
use equipment. This equipment is maintained for use on or in association with
the R/V POINT SUR, a research vessel owned by the NSF and operated by the
University. A substantial part of the ship's operating schedule during 1990 is
in support of NSF-sponsored research projects. The instrumentation will also
increase the capabilities of the ship and of the institution to support research
and engineering activities. The instrumentation includes: -A precision
salinometer for determining the salinity of seawater and calibrating shipboard
instrumentation. -Fluorometer and transmissometer for measuring chlorophyll and
other optical properties in the water column, -Precision acoustic pinger for
determining position of an instrument package relative to the surface or
seafloor, and -Hydrodynamic wire depressor for maintaining the proper depth of
towed instruments. The instrumentation described above will increase the
capability of the organization to support NSF-sponsored research and engineering
projects.
