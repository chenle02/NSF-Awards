The project aims to deliver an innovative introductory astronomy course for non-
science majors at a non-selective state university. The main thrust of the
project is to design a course that focuses on the process of science by
identifying and linking essential astronomical concepts with a minimum of
supporting information. Within a large lecture course, new delivery technologies
are being tested to increase interaction and communications so that students
will play an active role to engage them with the new material. The integrated,
tested package should be readily transported to other state university
environments.
