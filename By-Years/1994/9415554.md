ABSTRACT Detailed spatial information is needed at several scales to aid in
modeling fluxes of greenhouse gases from arctic systems as part of the Land-
Atmosphere-Ice Interactions (LAII) component of the Arctic System Science
(ARCSS) Flux Study. A hierarchic geographic information system (HGIS) has been
made for the Flux Study research sites at Toolik Lake and Imnavait Creek, Alaska
and it is now essential to make this information easily available to ARCSS
researchers and other scientists. The proposed project consists of two parts:
(1) preparation and publication of a geobotanical atlas of the Toolik Lake and
Imnavait Creek region, and (2) an upgrade of the existing GIS facility at the
Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research in order to accomplish the first
objective. The atlas will focus on research areas at Toolik Lake and Imnavait
Creek. The atlas would contain the maps and supporting information in two forms,
hard copy color maps, and digital format on a CD-ROM.
