This is an observational project to map out the 21-cm emission line of atomic
hydrogen in the circumstellar envelopes of nearby Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB)
and Cepheid variable stars in order to better understand stellar mass loss and
late stages of stellar evolution. The PI will use data from the Very Large Array
(VLA) to provide better estimates of the total mass, extent and chemistry of
circumstellar envelopes, new insights into the duration and geometry of mass-
loss during the late stages of stellar evolution and new constraints on the
occurrence of mass loss on the Cepheid instability strip, as well as better
understanding of how evolved stars interact with the surrounding interstellar
medium.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include training undergraduate
students through the Research Experiences for Undergraduates program, producing
an educational podcast on so-called radio stars, making data and data products
publicly available, and incorporating research into public lectures.
