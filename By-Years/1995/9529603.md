9529603 Holloway This grant provides funds to design, develop, construct and
test an artificial fumarole to be used for testing gas sensors, kinetic studies
and high temperature gas flow studies at Arizona State University. The PI's have
already developed a prototype artificial fumarole which has reached sustainable
temperatures of 450 C while the proposed instrument would be designed to reach
temperatures of up to 900 C. The experiment proposed should allow improvement in
present fumarole monitoring capabilities and may enhance our knowledge of
fumarole gas compositional changes directly preceding explosive volcanic
eruptions. ***
