Soil-structure interaction (SSI) is one of the major challenges that faces the
civil engineering community; partly because SSI requires multidisciplinary
research efforts and partly because of the lack of advanced sensors specifically
designed for research purposes. SSI significantly affects the nation?s
infrastructure including bridges, underground structures, retaining systems,
tunnels, and offshore platforms. This award is to acquire equipment to establish
a state-of-the-art soil-structure interaction facility at Lafayette College.
&lt;br/&gt;The key to better understanding SSI is accurately measuring the
contact pressure and movement at the interface between a structure and the
surrounding soil. The instrumentation to be purchased through this award,
especially the advanced pressure and deformation sensors, offer the advantages
of minimum intrusion resulting in accurate pressure and deformation
measurements. These measurements significantly enhance our understanding of the
behavior of structures that depend on SSI. In addition to the advanced sensors,
the award will fund two flexibly designed soil boxes, a data acquisition system,
load and pressure sensors, soil compactors, soil quality control and
characterization equipment, and analysis tools. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts
of this award include developing new upper level undergraduate elective courses
that focus on design, analysis, instrumentation, and measurements of SSI
systems. The facility, with video conferencing and web broadcasting
capabilities, allow faculty at other institutions to use the facility in their
research and teaching. &lt;br/&gt;
