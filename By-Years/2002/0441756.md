The Antarctic Submillimeter Telescope and Remote Observatory (AST/RO) is a 1.7 m
diameter single-dish instrument, which is fully operational at Amundsen-Scott
South Pole Station in several Terahertz, submillimeter-wave, and millimeter-wave
bands. AST/RO is one of only two Terahertz observatories in the world, and has
two Terahertz instruments, the Terahertz Receiver with NbN HEB Device (TREND)
and the South Pole Imaging Fabry-Perot Interferometer (SPIFI), currently
operational on the telescope. AST/RO has recently completed two key observatory
projects which demonstrate its unique capabilities for mapping the dominant
cooling lines of molecular material in the Milky Way. AST/RO has observed these
lines with arcminute resolution over regions of sky which are several degrees in
size. Radiative transfer models based on these measurements can determine the
internal thermodynamic properties of molecular clouds, providing insights about
the star formation process and the dynamics of cloud formation and destruction
in the Galactic environment. For example, the Galactic Center key project data
show that the smooth ring of molecular material 150 parsecs from the Galactic
Center is on the verge of coagulating into a single, massive molecular cloud
like the one surrounding Sgr B2, and will undergo a burst of star formation. The
AST/RO project has observed, reduced, published and publicly released on the
Internet a large fraction of all spectral line observations in the frequency
octave from 450 to 900 GHz. The proven capabilities of AST/RO will provide
critical collaborative observations for the newly-launched Spitzer Space
Telescope (SST, see http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu).&lt;br/&gt;
