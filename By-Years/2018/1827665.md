The broader impact/commercial potential of this PFI project lies in improved
understanding of development of smart systems and in potentially significant
resource savings. Irrigation with saline water is a complex problem requiring
consideration of many factors such as irrigation water quality, soil conditions,
plant tolerance thresholds, and weather forecasts. This project will develop a
prototype wireless sensor network and a control system that consider sensor
inputs, user-defined thresholds and weather forecasts to determine when and
where to irrigate. From an economic perspective, implementation of even a single
soil moisture sensor in home lawns can significantly reduce water consumption
and produce a return on investment within a few months. Cities stand to save
millions of dollars by implementing efficient irrigation technology to reduce
water use. The proposed adaptive system for irrigation with reclaimed water thus
represents a tremendous potential market for more efficient water
use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project offers a transformative approach
for landscape irrigation based on closed-loop control. Landscape irrigation
accounts for a majority of urban summer domestic water use; irrigating with
reclaimed water has the potential to substantially extend water resources but
may pose hazards to environmental and plant health. Existing ?smart? irrigation
control systems have proved water-efficient but have limitations and have not
been widely adopted. The proposed system is unique in its combination of
wireless water and soil quality sensors into an advanced network capable of
controlling several critical agronomic variables, while welcoming but limiting
the need for human inputs. A team of domain experts in academia and industry
will work together to understand the practical challenges and to design such an
adaptive irrigation system to address widespread water resource issues. Key
contributions of the proposed research are (1) realizing a truly self-organizing
ad-hoc wireless irrigation sensor and actuator network that integrates
traditional monitoring and stakeholder input for adaptive irrigation control;
and (2) testing the efficient and protective delivery of saline irrigation water
using the network. Such fundamental and applied knowledge will provide the basis
to ultimately realize significant water savings while protecting human and plant
health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
