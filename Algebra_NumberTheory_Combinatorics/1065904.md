Some of the most interesting and important open questions in number theory and
arithmetic algebraic geometry involve special values of L-functions and their
connections with arithmetic. These questions include Stark's conjecture in the
case of L-functions of number fields, and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer
conjecture in the case of elliptic curves and abelian varieties. In this project
the investigator and his colleagues plan to use many different techniques,
including algebraic, p-adic, and analytic tools, to study various aspects of
these questions. Particular questions to be studied include the distribution of
Selmer ranks in families of quadratic twists of elliptic curves, refined class
number formulas over number fields, and higher rank Kolyvagin systems. In
previous work of the investigator Kolyvagin systems have proved to be a very
useful tool for relating L-values and arithmetic.

Elliptic curves and abelian varieties play a central role in many parts of
mathematics including its most applied areas. For example, elliptic curves are
used in algorithms to encrypt data for transmission, and for efficient digital
signatures. In its most basic form, an elliptic curve is a special kind of
polynomial equation in two variables. Historically number theorists are
interested in finding solutions of these equations in which the variables take
values which are either whole numbers, or fractions. The rank of an elliptic
curve is a basic invariant which measures the size of the set of solutions. The
investigator and his coworkers study ranks of elliptic curves and their
interrelations with other mathematical objects and concepts.
