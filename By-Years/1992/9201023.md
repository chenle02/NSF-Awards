With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Jochim and his colleagues will
initiate a long term archaeological study of a 40 x 100 kilometer region which
extends from the Danube River to the Alps in Southern Germany. In this first
phase they will conduct three projects. First, they will synthesize the
available site data for the period extending from the Aurignacian, ca. 35,000
years ago, through the Neolithic period when agriculture and stock raising was
introduced. Material will be collated from museum collections and archaeological
site reports. Secondly, the team will develop a GIS data bank which includes
information on geomorphology and vegetation. It will also incorporate data on
archeological sites. Finally, the group will conduct an archaeological survey of
plowed fields in a subregion within this broader area. The results should
provide detailed information on both the archaeological sequence and the density
of sites. Archaeological work to date indicates that this region in Southern
Germany contains a wealth of archaeological data with sites which extend from
the early Upper Paleolithic through the Mesolithic and into Neolithic times.
Therefore, this region provides insight into how humans at a hunting and
gathering level of subsistence adapted to a harsh and highly variable Ice Age
environment. It also documents the change at the end of the Ice Age to more
temperate conditions as well as the succeeding shift to a more settled Neolithic
way of life. However, the data are spotty and have never been analyzed within a
single dichronic environmental perspective. Therefore, it is difficult to
understand the processes which underlay the human adaptation and change. In this
the first stage of a long term project, Dr. Jochim and his colleagues will
establish the framework to make such a comprehensive analysis possible. This
research is important for several reasons. It will provide data of interest to a
large number of archaeologists. It will also increase our understanding of how
humans adapt at a simple level of technology.
