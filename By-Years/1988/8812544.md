The goal of this research is to understand the conditions within organizations
that lead to crises so that preemptive actions can be taken to avert them.
Although industrial crises (e.g., Bhopal, Three Mile Island) have received
increasing attention over the past decade, much of the evidence collected to
date is based on anecdotal accounts. As a result, there is no overall
theoretical framework in which to place the present understanding of
organizational crises, and little that can be said in terms of empirically-based
recommendations for promoting behaviors designed to avoid the next catastrophe.
The proposed research plan involves a longitudinal study that will compare the
decision making processes of four organizations in the chemical and electric
power industries. Two of these organizations will have experienced major crises
and exhibit poor safety records, whereas the other two will have much better
safety records and no experience of a major crisis. An in-depth analysis of
organizational strategies and decision processes that have affected the
performance of these companies over a ten-year period, based on both available
secondary data sources and personal interviews, is proposed; variables to be
considered include the degree of competitiveness within an industry, the rate of
diversification within a firm, and the degree to which decision-making authority
is centralized. The researchers emphasize that the proposed work constitutes a
pilot study, designed to test research methods while developing an initial data
base. However, the results should provide important theoretical insights into
the nature of industrial crises and serve to establish preliminary guidelines
for further studies in the field.
