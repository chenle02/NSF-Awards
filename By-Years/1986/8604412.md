Equipment is obtained for a seven-layer, broadband local area network (LAN)
testbed. The testbed will be used for real-time experimental verificatio of
network control algorithms and communication protocols that have been
theoretically developed and/or analyzed by simulation studies. The testbed is
intended to support both experimental and theoretical research in the field of
integrated data communications and inter-personnel information processing (i.e.,
integrated data, voice, video, graphics, and facsimile) as applied to all levels
of the automated factory. The testbed will also support similar research
activities for local and long-haul networks in both private and government
sectors.
