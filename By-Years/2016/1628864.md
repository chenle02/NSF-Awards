Many electricity markets, both in the U.S. and around the world, use auctions to
procure power and these auctions are complex strategic environments. Firms that
participate in these auctions to sell power can vary in their level of strategic
sophistication which impacts not only the firms' profitability but the overall
efficiency of the market. For this reason, understanding how heterogeneity in
strategic sophistication affects efficiency is a primary concern for market
design and public policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the PIs develop
a model of bidding behavior that builds on game theoretic models from auction
theory and bounded rationality models, to provide a rigorous framework to
analyze strategic sophistication in auction settings. The PIs apply the model to
real-world data, using detailed firm-level data from the Texas electricity
market to categorize bidders' strategic behavior. The analysis estimates the
increase in the cost of electricity production that results from some firms
bidding with lower levels of strategic sophistication, and it quantifies the
profit gains of using alternative bidding strategies. To do so, the PIs develop
an algorithm to compute equilibrium using a set of firms, their characteristics,
and marginal costs. Using this algorithm, the project will document the extent
to which mergers that increase strategic sophistication can improve the
efficiency of the market even if the mergers increase market concentration.
