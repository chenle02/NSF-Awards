This project is renewing the Dean-in-Residence Program (DIR) at the National
Science Foundation. This program has been run twice before in the early 21rst
Century. The DIR program is a cooperative activity between the Council of
Graduate Schools (CGS) and the Division of Graduate Education. It is designed to
improve communication and understanding about issues in graduate STEM education
through a partnership between the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the
graduate community represented by the Council of Graduate School, which is the
only U.S. organization dedicated solely to the advancement of graduate education
and research, with a membership of over 500 institutions of higher education.
The core purpose of the DIR Program is to improve substantive ongoing
communications between senior university leaders of graduate education and the
NSF. This partnership can contribute significantly to the NSF portfolio in
graduate education and result in the improvement of graduate education in the
U.S. The program renews the DIR each year through the joint selection of a new
dean by NSF and CGS. The selected individual is in residence at the NSF at least
60% of the time and as much as 80%, with the remaining work time spent at CGS.
In recent years, the CGS has undertaken large scale projects and increased
analyses that are useful to the NSF in assessing the effectiveness of their
programs to support graduate students. An example is the Doctoral Completion
project - a long term effort to measure accurately what fraction of students
admitted to PhD programs complete their degrees in a certain amount of time, how
completion rates differ by key variables (e.g. field of degree), and how to
improve completion. In general the analyses and data provided by CGS are
valuable to NSF program planning and evaluation.
