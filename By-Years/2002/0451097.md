This paper explores the complexity of the privacy problem. In particular the
computational complexity properties of the privacy problem are examined. Prior
work in this area explored the recursion theoretic properties and viewed the
privacy problem as a form of the inference problem. This work showed that the
privacy problem in general was unsolvable. The PIs follow up on this prior work
and propose to explore the more important aspects of the privacy problem and
that is the complexity of the privacy problem. They also view the privacy
problem as a form of inference problem in databases and subsequently propose to
develop a complexity theory for privacy problem based on deductive databases and
then prove some properties of the problem.

Privacy is becoming a very important research area and we are funding a number
of efforts on privacy. It is critical that the complexity aspects of the privacy
problem be examined. The PIs are top researchers in complexity theory and
databases. They are highly qualified to do this research. They have published in
top journals such as the Journal of the ACM and Journal of Computer and Systems
Sciences. This research could produce some breakthrough results.
