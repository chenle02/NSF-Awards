The PI and his collaborators will construct exoplanet atmospheric models that
focus on the upper atmospheres. The models will include ion chemistry and track
the distribution of ions and metals in the upper atmosphere to processes that
occur in the lower atmosphere. They also plan to include the first calculations
of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) heating efficiencies for highly irradiated planets
(such as most Hot Jupiters). They also plan to include the calculations of
extreme ultraviolet (EUV) heating efficiencies for highly irradiated planets
(such as most Hot Jupiters). Thiss will have broader impacts in that it will
train a graduate student and postdoctoral associate in research techniques, and
they will communicate results through peer-reviewed articles, public lectures
and articles to popular magazines.
