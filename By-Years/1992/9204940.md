The investigator intends to consider ramifications and applications of a result
he has recently proved, namely that a K- theory can be defined for any
triangulated category in such a way that the K-theory of the bounded derived
category of an abelian category A agrees with the K-theory of A. Although this
project is highly algebraic, one motivation lies in its potential for reducing
geometric information to a subject for calculation by perfecting one of the
principal algebraic tools used for this purpose. The nature of the geometric
information involved is the crux of the difficulty. While questions about
lengths, areas, angles, volumes, and so forth virtually cry out to be reduced to
calculations, it is far different with what are known as topological properties
of geometric objects. These are properties such as connectedness (being all in
one piece), knottedness, having no holes, and so forth. All systematic study of
such properties, for example, how to tell whether two geometric objects really
differ in respect to one of these properties or are only superficially
different, or how to classify the variety of differences that can occur, all
these have only truly been comprehended and mastered when they have been reduced
to matters of calculation. Algebraic K-theory has been developed into a major
tool for this purpose, and the interplay between the algebra and the topology
involved remains a fascinating subject.
