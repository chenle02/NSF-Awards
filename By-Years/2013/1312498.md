This work will conduct theoretical analysis and numerical simulations to study
the inner solar system orbital dynamics that were affected by giant planet
migration during the early solar system. The PI and her team will investigate
the non-uniform distribution of the angular orbital elements of Near-Earth-
Objects (NEOs), calculate the secular dynamics of the inner solar system with
different orbital architectures, carry out numerical simulations of the
stability of such architectures under the effects of giant planet migration, and
calculate the loss rates from the pre-LHB asteroid reservoirs and estimates of
the flux of large impacts on the planets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts
of the work include applications to extrasolar planetary systems, debris disks
and the Earth's climate history. This works has implications for the formation
and development of the early solar system, is relevant to understanding the
population of NEOs, some of which may be hazardous to Earth, and to modeling the
planetary systems around other stars. The work will be involved in a Ph.D.
dissertation and the PI will produce a slide presentation on this work for
public audiences, made available for free.
