The strong chemical reactivity of graphite in oxidizing environments at
elevated temperatures requires that graphite surfaces be protected in use as a
structural material. Techniques will be investigated for modifying the surface
chemistry of graphite, for developing new approaches for the impregnation of
graphite, and for coating graphite parts with protective ceramic coating layers.
New electrochemically-based processes which take advantage of the high
electrical conductivity of graphite will be developed.
