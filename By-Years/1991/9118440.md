Pangrle This research is focused on two problems of high level synthesis,
control and datapath synthesis, and how the tradeoffs between the two affect
layout and performance of VLSI designs. First is finding control/datapath
tradeoffs based on high-level transformations performed on the control/data flow
graph. Second is incorporation of layout considerations into the generation of
the datapath connectivity. A new data path generation scheme that aims at
producing datapaths with better performance and layout characteristics is being
developed. This research is being performed within the basic framework of the
Keystone System which automatically synthesizes and simulates all of the
datapath components, the control logic, and the routing.
