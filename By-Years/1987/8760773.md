The primary objective of this research is the design, construction and
evaluation of a novel Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) for routine surface
microtopographical analysis. This prototype instrument is designed to cover an
extensive magnification range form 2500X to 100X. Since the entire STM unit is
small enough to be mounted on a 6-in conflat flange, it can be readily installed
to operate in both vacuum and ambient air environments. Furthermore, the STM
design will not only be user-friendly to the operator but will also incorporate
features allowing ease of manufacture and maintenance. The high/low
magnification STM promises to fulfill most of the requirements of surface
microscopy in an non-destructive fashion with few of the disadvantages
encountered in conventional forms of microscopic imaging.
