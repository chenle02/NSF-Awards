Conventional techniques for accelerometers yield micromechanical structures
whose sensitive axis is perpendicular to the surface of the wafer. There is a
need for new micromechanical designs and new transduction techniques which allow
the sensitive axis of the microstructures to lie in the plane of the wafer in
order to measure six degrees of freedom. A new optical transduction technique
and a new micromechanical design are illustrated which allow the sensitive axis
to lie in the plane of the wafer and which eliminate cross-talk. This has the
advantage that several structures can be integrated monolithically in the same
wafer with multidegrees-of-freedom measurement capability. The sensor
incorporates a polymer waveguide and is fabricated with the use of laser
ablation of materials. The major task is to develop a fabrication process which
is compatible with the characteristics of all the materials utilized. A
comprehensive study of all the pertinent process parameters affecting the
performance of the polymer waveguide will be conducted.
