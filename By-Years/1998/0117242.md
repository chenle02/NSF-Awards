Modeling of geologic features is considerably assisted by an extensive data set
that quantifies an adequate number of descriptive parameters of the feature in
question. Such studies on normal faults have prompted a significant step forward
in understanding extensional tectonics, but no such population studies exist for
thrust faults, which are common features in convergent tectonic settings. This
project will generate an extensive data set quantifying geometric parameters,
displacement length scaling, population statistics, displacement transfer and
similar items. It is expected that this research will provide a robust
statistical foundation for description of the geometric properties of thrust
faults, and thus such research should under pin a significantly improved
understanding of thrust faults and convergent tectonics.
