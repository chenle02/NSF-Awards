The college is awarding 84 scholarships to 48 academically talented, financially
needy, full-time students in the A.S. in Engineering, A.S. in Computer Science,
and A.S. in Physical and Natural Sciences (SciTE Scholars) Programs. The project
goal is to increase the number and success of full-time science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students at the college. Core objectives are
to recruit eligible students and achieve an 85 percent rate of advancement by
SciTE Scholars. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project builds on a prior award, which
met the core objectives of the project by recruiting qualified students to fill
all scholarship spots, achieving a 92 percent advancement rate for the
scholarship students, and increasing enrollment of underrepresented groups to
nearly 30 percent minority ethnicity and over 26 percent female.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the program lies in the
combination of elements that research shows contribute to student success such
as completing the first two years of college with no loan debt, attending full
time, taking summer courses, and reducing the need to work long hours after
class. The broader impact is advancing more STEM graduates to four-year
institutions, including an increased number of traditionally underrepresented
student groups. Employers benefit from a more qualified workforce and society
from increased competitiveness and productivity of the American workforce in
STEM fields.
