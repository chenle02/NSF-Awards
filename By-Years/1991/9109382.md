Exocytosis, a regulatory mechanism of eukaryotic cells, is a cellular process
by which internal membrane-bound vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane to
release substances into the external medium. It is hypothesized that the process
of secretion occurs by exocytosis. The objective of this Research Planning Grant
for Women Scientists and Engineers, is to test the hypothesis by taking a
physiological approach to study the role of post- translational modification in
vesicle release. Dr. Jay will employ electrophysiological techniques,
specifically whole cell patch clamping, to measure cell capacitance in two
neuronal systems, PC12 cells and synaptosomes. The effects on exocytosis should
be accompanied by a change in capacitance. Results from this research will
provide additional information on this mechanism of neuronal secretion.
