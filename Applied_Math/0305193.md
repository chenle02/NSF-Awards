The Principal Investigators will study several related asymptotic limits of
nonlinear partial differential equations arising in fluid mechanics. Interest is
focused on how solutions behave in limits where certain terms in the equations
become increasingly negligible. For the situations in view here, these terms
correspond to the physical effects of dissipation and dispersion. It is planned
to work at two levels of complexity. The first, and easier level is that of
model equations for wave propagation where nonlinear, dispersive and dissipative
effects are all present. Both qualitative and quantitative information will be
sought. The information obtained will yield information helpful to modelling
near-shore zone processes. At a more complex level, it is planned to investigate
various limits of the Navier-Stokes equations including the inviscid limit for
the Navier-Stokes equations in bounded domains with fixed boundaries, and for
statistical solutions with periodic boundary conditions (or in all of space). It
is also intended to investigate how well the Navier-Stokes equations posed in a
channel are modelled by dissipative nonlinear wave equations.

The present award will support research on several interesting and important
asymptotic limits for mathematical models. The kind of limits under
consideration here arise in various areas of physics, mechanics, oceanography,
materials science, biology, and elsewhere when partial differential equations
are used as models. The problems considered here derive principally from fluid
mechanics, but in so far as we are successful in our program, there is a broader
implied scope. The zero-limits under study are those associated with dissipation
and dispersion in fluid motion. In various modeling situations, one or the other
of these effects may be ignored. The question then arises whether or not such
approximations are justified and, if so, under what flow conditions and over
what time scales. These questions are of theoretical and practical importance
since the approximating equations are often easier to use. This award will
support work that aims to address issues including fundamental points and
aspects that arise in the use of these equations as descriptions of real
phenomena.
