This award is a structured technique for measuring the improvement that design
tools (systematic design methods, expert systems, design histories, etc.) make
on the design process. This research will improve the way design tools are
presently evaluated by pursuing three objectives: (1) structuring the selection
of evaluation criteria, (2) developing measures for these criteria and (3)
testing these measures.
