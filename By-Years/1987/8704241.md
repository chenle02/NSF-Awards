The development of a complex organ such as a leaf depends on the integrated
differentiation of multiple cell types. The alterations in gene expression which
contribute to the differentiation of the two interacting photosynthetic cell
types in maize leaves (bundle sheath and mesophyll) are most dramatic among the
genes for enzymes which interact in C4 carbon fixation. Each C4 enzyme is
specific to one cell type, and accumulates in a fixed spatial pattern within the
leaf. The means by which expression of each photosynthetic C4 gene occurs
specifically in one of the two leaf cell types during development are unknown.
Several of the C4 enzymes are members of small multigene families which also
contribute enzyme isoforms which perform housekeeping functions and are
regulated in drastically differing manner from the photosynthetic forms. This
project seeks to extend previous studies of C4 enzyme genes and patterns of
cellular development in leaves by directly comparing genes for the
photosynthetic and non- photosynthetic isoforms. The gene cloning, sequencing
and comparative studies will also provide gene-specific probes to aid in
subsequent analysis of cell-specific and organ-specific gene expression.
