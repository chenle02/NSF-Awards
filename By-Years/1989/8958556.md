This Presidential Young Investigator proposes to use his PYI award to
investigate new methods to analyze the performance of communication protocols by
looking for methods that aggregate or decompose states of a protocol (along
boundaries that arise form its structure and analyze the dynamics between the
resulting subsets of states. In addition, he is studying dynamic routing of
information in deterministic network models, scheduling conversation between
communication stations, and the topology of design of networks. He is also
studying local search optimization algorithms such as simulated annealing.
