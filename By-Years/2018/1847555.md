This CAREER agenda looks at the role of the transportation sector in world
trade. Using novel data sources, the research addresses questions on the role of
geography, tariffs and trade barriers, improvements in ship fuel efficiency and
new infrastructure developments on transportation prices and trade flows. The
research looks at the efficiency of transportation sector and how social welfare
can be improved through appropriate policies. The research also considers the
impact of a centralizing platform, like Uber.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project
develops a spatial model that centers on the interaction of the market for
(oceanic) transportation services and the market for world trade in goods. The
model delivers equilibrium trade flows, as well as equilibrium trade costs. This
setup is then used to demonstrate that the transportation sector (i) implies
that net exporters (importers) face higher (lower) trade costs leading to
misallocation of productive activities across countries; (ii) creates network
effects in trade costs; and (iii) dampens the impact of shocks on trade flows.
These three mechanisms reveal a new role for geography in international trade.
Next, the research explores both theoretically and empirically the efficiency
properties of equilibria in decentralized transportation markets and suggest
appropriate policies for the improvement of world welfare. The research also
introduces a micro-founded trade cost in the canonical trade model in order to
examine its welfare properties. The project then will investigate the role of
(maritime) infrastructure on growth and world trade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
