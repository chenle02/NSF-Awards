The proposed research is a molecular genetic study of the Y chromosome in
mammals. A study of the Y chromosome is of special interest because, unlike
other chromosome, it is inherited only from father to son. For this reason, the
Y chromosome may be useful in tracing paternal lineages through mammalian
populations and species. The primary objective of the proposed research is to
investigate how DNA sequences on the Y chromosome provide information about
relatedness among mammalian species. A genetic locus from the Y chromosome will
be studied in species of "Old World" mice from Africa, Asia Australia and
Europe. Relationships among these mice will be determined by comparing variation
in the DNA sequence of this genetic locus; the greater the similarity in DNA,
the more closely related the species. The results from this study will be
compared to relationships among these same mice determined using genetic markers
that trace maternal (mother to daughter) lineages. The proposed research
represents a novel approach to increasing our understanding of the relationships
and diversity of mammalian species. The PI is well qualified to conduct this
research and the university of Michigan is an excellent institution for the
research.
