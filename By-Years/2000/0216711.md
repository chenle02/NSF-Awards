This IMR award supports an instrument development of an electrostatic force
based Single Electron Scanning Tunneling Microscope. In previous work, single
electron tunneling events from a special scanning probe tip have been clearly
detected by electrostatic force. However, no surface imaging with the single
electrons has yet been achieved. This research program focuses upon developing
the methods needed to image individual, electrically isolated electron states at
or near surfaces with atomic scale spatial resolution. The methodology will
include understanding the mechanical behavior of oscillating atomic force
microscope (AFM) cantilevers under large force gradients, exploring the effects
of charge transfer and voltage dependence, optimizing and developing a force
detection system for the single electron measurements and developing a method
for height control while imaging with single electrons. The ability to image and
characterize electrically isolated, localized, electronic states near surfaces
(undetectable with the standard Scanning Tunneling Microscope) is a fundamental,
new capability. The approach is to provide a detailed understanding of the
atomic scale electronic properties of electrically insulating materials and
isolated nanometer scale systems.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This IMR award
