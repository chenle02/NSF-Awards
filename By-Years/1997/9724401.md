Acquisition of Two Microscopes with Image Processing and Analysis
Instrumentation, for Biological Research at St. Joseph's University The Biology
Department at St. Joseph's University proposes to acquire: 1) a research
microscope with epifluorescence, phase contrast and Differential Interference
Contrast (DIC) capability; 2) a research- quality inverted microscope to be used
for microinjection of cells and 3) hardware and software to facilitate
capturing, analyzing, and documenting microscopic images. This instrumentation,
along with equipment already in the department, will constitute an image
analysis facility for all Biology faculty and student researchers. The equipment
will be located in adjacent research labs shared by the primary users, who will
also share management duties.
