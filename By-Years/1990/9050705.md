This project gives engineering students better insight into design procedures
through early exposure at the freshman level and again by looking at fresh ideas
in design during the senior year. Freshman engineers design and draw a part on a
personal computer then send the part data through a network to a computer
numerically controlled (CNC) machine for fabrication. This firmly establishes
the relationship between concept, graphic presentation, and resultant product.
It also serves to heighten excitement among freshman about engineering as a
career. In addition, senior teams experiment with the various aspects of design
including conceptualization, detailing, checking, analyzing, assembling of
details, and CNC machining of parts through the use of local area networks.
Innovative design procedures are developed for future use in the industrial work
place. The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal
investigator's institution.
