The purpose of this project is to investigate the structure of ellipsis from the
point of view of theoretical syntax and online sentence processing.
Specifically, the project emphasizes the view that a detailed study in the
theoretical syntax of ellipsis provides invaluable insight into the mechanism of
the structure building process in online sentence processing. The particular
type of ellipsis that will be examined in this project is known as 'sluicing'
(e.g., "John said Mary was reading in the garden, but he didn't say
what").&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous studies of ellipsis have used sluicing as
an argument against the position that the grammar supports the unpronounced
abstract syntactic structure. (e.g., because sluicing does not always respect
syntactic island constraints). Dr. Yoshida will investigate whether ellipsis
sites in sluicing are associated with a full-fledged syntactic structure and, if
so, what the syntactic properties of those sites are. In addition, the
experimental studies of how sluicing constructions are processed on line will
investigate: (i) When the parser identifies the ellipsis; (ii) What
representation the parser builds in the ellipsis site during online processing;
and (iii) What constraint the online structure building process
obeys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to advancing our understanding of the
syntax of natural language and how humans identify and process the structure of
sentences in the course of language comprehension, this project will also
provide valuable training opportunities for graduate students in linguistics and
psycholinguistics.
