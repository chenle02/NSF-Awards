This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project proposes to
develop a cell free protein synthesis procedure for the manufacture of IGF-1
(insulin-like growth factor-1).

The commercial application of this project will be in the area of bio-
pharmaceuticals. The proposed work is expected to result in reduced production
costs and time for a number of protein drug candidates.
