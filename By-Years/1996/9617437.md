The purpose of this project is to improve our understanding of investment
behavior by documenting and explaining the reallocation of physical capital
across economic sectors. The project will address issues such as: How specific
is capital to a particular firm or economic sector? How costly is it to move
physical capital from one use to another? and How might such investment behavior
influence the business cycle? A new data set on the sale of individual items of
equipment will be created and analyzed. These data will be used to study the
cross-industry flow of used capital and the economic depreciation resulting from
such flows. How economic depreciation rates depend on whether capital stays
within an industry or flows across industries will analyzed in order to quantify
the specificity of capital. Preliminary work suggests that capital loses much of
its value when it is moved across industries. In addition, the gross flows of
capital using firm-level accounting data will be analyzed. These data will be
used to analyze the relationship between gross additions and gross subtractions
to firms' capital. These data will also be used to estimate the length of time
taken by firms to decide to discontinue operations. These decision lags might be
quantitatively important. Indeed, the decision lag owing to uncertainty could be
longer than the lag in selling and reinstalling the capital once the decision
has been made. Finally, a general equilibrium simulation model will be used to
analyze the aggregate effects of allocative shocks under costly capital
mobility. The specification and parameterization of this model will derive from
the empirical findings of this research. This model will help quantify the role
of capital reallocation in the business cycle. Given the potentially high costs
and long lags for reallocating capital, the business-cycle effects may be
substantial.
