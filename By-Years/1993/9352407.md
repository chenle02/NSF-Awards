9352407 Rubinson The project will purchase a gas chromatography/mass
spectrometry instrumentation for use in their undergraduate courses. These
include the courses taught in the organic sequence, intermediate analytical
chemistry, instrumental analysis, biochemistry and undergraduate research. There
will also be cooperative sessions with one of the local technical colleges in
their science technology curriculum. The instrument will allow students to
acquire an appreciation of the possibilities for use and the limitations of
GC/MS instrumentation. The proposed project work will result in a series of new
experiments to be used in the undergraduate curriculum. ***
