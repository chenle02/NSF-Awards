This project is planning, designing, and developing an undergraduate curriculum
unit consisting of two new and innovative courses in global climate change. The
two courses for the general undergraduate community are a science course
entitled "Oceans, Atmosphere and Global Change" and a social science course on
the role of science in policy and law entitled "Law, Policy, and the Global
Environment". The science course has been offered once on an experimental basis
to a limited number of students. As a result it is being assessed and evaluated
as part of a transformation to a large course. The social science course is a
completely new development and is offered to students generally following the
science course.
