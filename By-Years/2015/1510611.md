Abstract

Award: DMS 1510611, Principal Investigator: Dmitri Burago

This research project takes its origin at the concept of length of curves and
goes on to develop familiar and important ideas for physical or dynamical
systems under limited hypotheses. Among those ideas are notions of stability,
instability, and entropy that address the variations of larger geometric
properties as a metric is subjected to small perturbations. The project has a
component related to discrete forms of geometric data and the Laplace operator
on metric measure spaces. Two graduate students of the principal investigator
will be working on experimental measurements of frequencies of vibrating bodies
of unusual shapes.

It is known that the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami
operator on a Riemannian manifold are approximated by eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of a (suitably weighted) graph Laplace operator of a proximity
graph on an epsilon-net. One of these projects seeks to extend that result to
the Laplacian on differential forms and to get better estimates for the
Laplacian on metric measure spaces, including stability results. It would be
very interesting to understand which spaces with bounded geometry can be
approximated to an additive error by graphs with uniform bounds on degrees of
vertices and lengths of edges. So far, we can do that only for the 2-plane and
not even for 3-space, but we do not know a single counterexample to the main
conjecture in this area. One project aims to prove Michel's Conjecture on
boundary rigidity under reasonable hypotheses. Another project will study
dynamical systems with positive entropy in which entropy is generated locally,
that is, positive entropy is generated in arbitrarily small tubes around one
trajectory. Another goal is to prove ellipticity of the Busemann surface area.
