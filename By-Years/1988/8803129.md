This project compresses a series of subprojects from several areas of computer
science including software engineering, compiler development, database design
and artificial intelligence. Students will have the opportunity to participate
in system design, analysis and implementation studies. Our intent is that the
student participants gain expertise in a given area, have the experience of
carrying out independent scholarly research, and enjoy the stimulus of working
in a research environment. Emphasis will be placed on recruiting women and
minority students as participants in the program. A redirection of student
sights towards graduate study and enhanced career development is a major aim of
this program.
