This project aims to equip an archaeology laboratory for undergraduate teaching
at Carleton College. 50 students will use this laboratory each year, in two
archaeology classes, in conjunction with field programs, and for independent
student research in association with a new interdisciplinary archaeology
program. A space for the laboratory has already been approved and many pieces of
equipment either have been donated to the laboratory or can be borrowed from
existing programs at Carleton. The major equipment requested in this grant
include the materials necessary to build two artificial archaeological sites in
the lab and the computer equipment and software needed by students to analyze
archaeological materials and sites. By using the modern computer-assisted-design
(CAD) capabilities of the computer and its accessories, as well as other
software, students can integrate all facets of practical archaeology, from
curating and drawing artifacts, to generating site plans, topographic maps, and
sections, to interpreting patterns of ancient settlements. There are no
comparable facilities on the Carleton campus for these purposes.
