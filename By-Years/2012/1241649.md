The CyberCorps: Scholarship for Service (SFS) program at Towson University (TU)
provides full, two-year scholarships to up to thirty undergraduate Computer
Science students in the Security Track, during the five-year period of the
project. TU works with its partners, Anne Arundel Community College, Community
College of Baltimore County, Harford Community College and other Maryland
Alliance in Information Security and Assurance (MAISA) institutions, to recruit
highly-qualified computing students with particular attention to groups
underrepresented in cybersecurity. This program leverages TU's established
collaborations with, and proximity to, military and state/federal agencies to
facilitate internships and job placements. In addition to a strong cybersecurity
curriculum with an extensive hands-on component, this program provides
scholarship recipients with security-related research projects, monthly seminars
on security-related topics, and participation in a computer security student
club and cyber defense competitions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project directly
impacts the development of qualified computer security professionals with strong
technical skills who will be joining the state and federal workforce to secure
our national information infrastructure. TU has been a Center of Academic
Excellence in Information Assurance Education since 2002 and was one of the
first institutions offered an undergraduate Computer Security track in its ABET-
accredited Computer Science program.
