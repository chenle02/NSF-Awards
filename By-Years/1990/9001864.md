This award will help fund a conference in singularity theory. This conference
will be held from August 6 to 10, 1990 on the campus of the University of
Hawaii, Manoa. This conference will be concerned with all branches of
singularity theory, but with emphasis on the following: (1) singularities of
mappings (real or complex), (2) singularities of real varieties, (3)
foundational properties: differential analysis, subanalytic sets, etc., and (4)
applications, e.g., to differential geometry.
