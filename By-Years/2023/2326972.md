The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is addressing an
unmet need for effective prophylactics to reduce the risk of diseases associated
with the microbiome. Growing evidence has associated specific bacteria in the
microbiome with both acute conditions and chronic illnesses, but current
technologies to mitigate specific microbial threats in the microbiome are
extremely limited and underdeveloped. The total addressable market in the US for
screening and therapeutics for microbiome-associated diseases exceeds 18 billion
USD and the space for targeted prophylactics has remained virtually empty. This
approach is both low-cost and scalable and presents an example of the utility of
targeted interventions in the microbiome to give agency to patients and
physicians for better management of the risk of diseases associated with the
microbiome. This I-Corps project is based on the development of a novel approach
for massively parallel engineering of bacteriophages to target specific bacteria
in complex microbial communities. This pipeline determines which mutations drive
activity and specificity in phages and uses a new high throughput method to
incorporate curated mutations in complex phage cocktails with thousands of user-
designed variants to precisely eliminate targeted bacteria. Compared to
traditional approaches for developing phage cocktails, this approach represents
increased throughput by nearly four orders of magnitude. This approach has been
leveraged to create phage cocktails that eliminate bacteria in the gut
microbiome strongly associated with the development of different diseases.
Targeting and removing these bacteria presents an elegant solution to manage
risk and move the gut microbiome towards a healthy state.
