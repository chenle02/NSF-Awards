The proposed research concerns the fabrication of two-terminal millimeter-wave
diode structures and incorporation of those devices into monolithic millimeter-
wave circuits in the frequency ranges 40-60 GHz and 90-100 GHz. The focus of the
research will concern primarily the circuit design aspects and will begin by
measuring and characterizing a single gallium arsenide (GaAs) Schottky diode
mounted in a 40-60 GHz finline test fixture. After de-embedding the measurements
to a reference plane at the diode chip, an accurate circuit model will be
developed to permit the design of an integrated Schottky diode phase modulator
fabricated in a finline environment on GaAs. Characterization of the resulting
circuit will allow appropriate matching structures to be designed and
incorporated into the circuit. An experimental scaling of the design to 90-100
GHz will form the second half of the project; the 90-100 GHz design procedure
will parallel the approach used in the 40-60 GHz band. This research will form a
basis for more sophisticated two- and three-terminal integrated-circuit design
at higher millimeter-wave and submillimeter- wave frequencies.
