9406332 Boyajian PI will use a quantitative method to assess the completeness of
stratigraphic ranges of fossil families over the Phanerozoic, using J.
Sepkoski's database of over 34,000 genera and 4,000 families. By this method PI
can evaluate what periods of geologic time have been effectively sampled by
paleontologists and what periods of time need more sampling, and can
quantitatively assess how much the record might improve by collecting more data.
