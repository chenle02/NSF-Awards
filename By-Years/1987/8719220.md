Butterflies make extensive use of color vision in mating, food finding and egg
deposition. Their natural history and genetics have been studied extensively.
For these reasons they are an excellent organism from which to learn general
principles related to color vision. Dr. Bernard has developed methods by which
it is possible to measure the sensitivity of butterfly photoreceptors to light
of different wavelengths in living animals. He has demonstrated that there is
great diversity between butterfly species in this regard. In this project he is
exploring this matter further, correlating the spectral sensitivities with the
colors of host plants and of butterflies of the opposite sex and of other
species. These studies should contribute much to our understanding of the
relationship of color vision to specific behaviors.
