This research will focus on the study of differential operators on algebraic
varieties and the connections with primitive ideals in the enveloping algebra of
a semi-simple Lie algebra. Given a curve, there is a finite dimensional algebra
(a certain factor ring of the ring of differential operators) associated to each
singular point of the curve. A general problem is to understand the precise
relation between the local geometry at a singular point, and the structure of
the ring of differential operators. This research is in the general area of
noncommutative ring theory. The rings considered in this project are of great
interest in many parts of mathematics. Given a curve, one of these rings can be
associated with certain points on the curve. A better understanding of these
rings and this association will be useful in determing the geometry of a given
curve.
