This award provides partial participant support for the Smoky Great Plains
Geometry Conference, held August 18-12, 2016, in Townsend, Tennessee. The
conference centers on modern developments in geometric analysis and metric
geometry. These two closely related fields have played a large role in recent
years in advancing several areas of mathematics. Those contributions include the
solutions of a number of very famous unsolved problems in mathematics, not only
in geometry but also in number theory, topology, and other areas. For example,
recent solution of the 100-year-old Poincar√© Conjecture relied heavily on
methods from geometric analysis and metric geometry. This area of mathematics
also has applications to physics, chemistry, engineering, and big data analysis.
The conference encourages and supports participation by members of groups
underrepresented in mathematics.

The technical areas represented in the conference are global and comparison
Riemannian geometry, special Riemannian metrics (Einstein, Ricci solitons, and
generalizations), isometric group actions, positive curvature, metric geometry,
and Alexandrov geometry. The conference features eight plenary speakers and
approximately ten shorter talks by early-career mathematicians. The conference
activities will bring together leading experts and young researchers and
students, facilitating the dissemination of recent research progress and
discussion of future directions and open problems. These interactions are
expected to lead to cross-fertilization between the more specialized topics
presented at the conference and to future progress in both geometric analysis
and metric geometry. The conference webpage is available at
