A model will be developed to predict development of pits in contacting surfaces,
such as gear teeth. The model will be based on fundamentals and will replace a
currently used, empirically based approach. The model will incorporate
inclusions and other microstructural factors in the pit initiation stage and
fracture mechanics and asperity contact dynamics in the crack propagation stage.
