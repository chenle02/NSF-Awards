Mathematical Sciences (21)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is developing a web-
based assessment tool around WebStat statistical software. The resulting web
site, DoStat.com, allows instructors to easily develop data analysis exercises
and administer the resulting assessments to their students. The student takes
the assessment in a format that seamlessly integrates the data set to be
analyzed with the software to analyze it. The project is effectively solving the
problems associated with delivering important data analysis exercises to
introductory statistics students.&lt;br/&gt;
