This grant provides logistical support and travel funds to operate a Extreme Low
and Very Low Frequency (ELF/VLF) radiometer at the radio-quiet Site of Special
Scientific Interest (SSSI Arrival Heights, Antarctica. The radiometer is one of
seven nearly identical which Stanford University operates at different site
around the world, including two other high geomagnetic latitude sites (Thule and
Sondrestromfjord, Greenland). It is the purpose of the measurement to develop a
long-term climatology of naturally occurring radio noise in the 5 Hz to 30 kHz
range. There are, of course, practical reasons to measure the natural
background, for it sets limits on the usefulness of this frequency range for
communications. These investigators are leaders in the measurement and
interpretation of ELF/VLF radio waves. The Office of Naval Research provides
funds for the research activities of this group while NSF provides logistical
support and travel funds for the Antarctic portion of the project.
