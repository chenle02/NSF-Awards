As part of an overall curriculum revision and capital equipment improvement
program to enhance laboratory experiences with modern methodologies, new
equipment is being integrated into all levels of the curriculum. An
ultracentrifuge and liquid scintillation counter will be purchased to be used in
both introductory and upper division laboratory courses and in student research.
These instruments will enable the students to perform experiments not now
possible, and to have hands-on experience with the tools of molecular and
cellular biology in a wide variety of courses. The college will provide 50%
matching funds.
