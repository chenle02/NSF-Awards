9711267 Carlyle The PI is organizing a Gordon Research Conference on Atmospheric
Chemistry in Newport, RI on June 15-19, 1997. This Gordon Research Conference is
one of the major meetings in this field. This year, the conference will cover a
broad range of areas in atmospheric chemistry, including chemistry and climate,
stratospheric chemistry, global tropospheric chemistry, biosphere-atmosphere
exchange, marine air chemistry, regional air quality, and new frontiers in
atmospheric measurements. The meeting will be attended by both established
researchers and young scientists, among them the participants of the preceding
Atmospheric Chemistry Colloquium for Emerging Senior Scientists (ACCESS).
