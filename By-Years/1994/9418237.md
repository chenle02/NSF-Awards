9418237 Hodges The objectives of this study are to ascertain whether excess
40-Ar is situated in fluid inclusions in silicates, to document the release
characteristics of Ar from fluid inclusions using the various methods of gas
extraction, and to evaluate if it is possible to obtain noble gas information
from samples containing multiple types of fluid inclusions. Well-characterized,
hydrothermally treated samples will be used in the experiments. A frequency-
quadrupled Nd:YAG laser will be used for the laser microprobe studies of samples
containing multiple types of fluid inclusions.
