The Engineering Biology Research Consortium (EBRC) aims to bringing together the
US synthetic biology community to develop the future vision for synthetic
biology, catalyze leading-edge research and education programs, and promote
dialogue about synthetic biology among policy-makers and public stakeholders.
Biology is emerging as an important manufacturing platform for the 21st century;
the market for genetically engineered products already exceeds the global
semiconductor market. EBRC will conduct meetings, programs and workshops that
strengthen the research and education communities; articulate compelling
research visions and goals aligned with pressing national and global challenges;
and engage the research and education communities, and government, industry and
public stakeholders to develop and communicate ideas. EBRC will establish a
forward-thinking forum at the nexus of these groups through a new non-profit
organization and take on a new set of leadership challenges as synthetic biology
moves from concept to reality.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;NSF funding during EBRC's
initial two years will support: (1) the development of two consecutive annual
engineering biology community roadmaps; (2) the development of key white papers
addressing needs outlined in the recent National Academies' Industrialization of
Biology report; and (3) communication activities coordinated with NSF and other
US government agencies to communicate the vision and content of the roadmap and
white papers.
