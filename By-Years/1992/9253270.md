This proposal seeks to enhance the scientific skills of middle school science
teachers in New York City. In cooperation with New York Community School
Districts 5, 8, 9, 11, 29, and 32 the City College of New York CUNY proposes the
Aerospace Space Leadership Institute. The program is for three years and focuses
on the training of 48 certified middle school science teachers (grades 5-8) to
become peer leaders in their districts. Using resources from Learning Link, the
NASA Resource Center at City College, the Intrepid Air and Space Museum, and the
Young Astronaut Program, the college will provide participants with content,
technology, and leadership skills which will enable them to become effective
educators of teachers equipped to help their colleagues integrate science and
technology in their classrooms. Opportunities will be provided for the
development of aerospace science and interdisciplinary curriculum projects that
will be shared on the Learning Link electronic network. Cost sharing is
equivalent to 37% of the NSF award.
