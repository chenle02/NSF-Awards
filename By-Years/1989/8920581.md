Between 1920 and 1948, American agricultural research and practice was
revolutionized through the creation and use of new scientific and technological
innovations. While some historians have studied particular innovations, no one
has yet considered the nature of this change, or located it within the
agricultural-scientific elite of the state and federal agricultural system.
Further, no one has considered the paradoxical situation in which these
innovations, which generally increased crop and livestock yields, were developed
and promoted at a time when overproduction of commodities was generating a
serious economic crisis for farmers. In this project, Dr. Fitzgerald is
investigating these issues by considering the role of Henry A. Wallace in his
capacities as editor of Wallaces' Farmer, president of Pioneer Hybrids, and
Secretary of Agriculture. As arguably the most influential farm leader of this
period, and one who held a progressivist faith in science and technology,
Wallace was a pivotal figure in the attempted resolution of scientific abundance
with farm parity. Dr. Fitzgerald argues that Wallace redefined farm problems in
ways that rendered them "solvable" with scientific and technical expertise. That
the farm problems remained nonetheless reflects not Wallace's naivete, but
rather the inability of science and technology of the period to solve what were
fundamentally social and economic ills. In order to carry out this research
project, Dr. Fitzgerald will examine, among other things, the 165 microfilm
reels of Wallace correspondence, published primary and secondary agricultural
literature including farm papers such as Wallaces' Farmer and Prairie Farmers,
trade publications, and government documents and administrative records of the
USDA and its Bureaus.
