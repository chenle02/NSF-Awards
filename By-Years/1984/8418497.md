This research involves a fundamental investigation of heat transfer in porous
media. The focus is on phase change processes such as condensation and
evaporation. The study has high relevance in engineering technology, since these
processes occur in geothermal reservoirs and heat pipes, during thermally
enhanced petroleum recovery, ;itin situ;ro processing of oil shale and tar
sands, and in underground nuclear waste repositories. In the study, special
attention is paid to film condensation in porous media. Since the film is likely
to be two-phase, it is necessary to measure both saturation and temperature in
the film to develop a better understanding of the transport mechanism.
