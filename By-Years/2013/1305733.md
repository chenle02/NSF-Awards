The Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program supports the collaboration of
Profs. Daniel Burden and Lisa Keranen Burden at Wheaton College (IL) to
investigate novel modifications of single protein nanopores. The research
systematically explores a series of chemical additions to alpha hemolysin, a
nanopore-forming protein with potential applications in ion and small molecule
sensing, polymer characterization, DNA sequencing, and biomedical analyses. The
interdisciplinary work gains broad impact by addressing fundamental questions in
single-nanopore transport theory, membrane protein structure and dynamics,
synthetic biochemistry, and protein purification. A host of biophysical
techniques, including atomic force microscopy, single-molecule fluorescence
microscopy, single ion-channel electrophysiology, Langmuir trough monolayer
measurements, and cell lysis assays are employed to characterize the structure
and function of the nanopore constructs. Computer modeling tools are used to
generate a theoretical understanding of novel nanopore design
principles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because certain proteins form small holes or
pores in cell membranes, scientists have recently begun devising ways to detect
various chemicals as they pass through the pore interior. This project advances
the field of nanopore sensing by investigating the relationship between
structural changes to the nanopore and molecule transport. Beyond contributions
to nanopore science and engineering, the program enables high quality
undergraduate research education by creating a unique environment that fosters
integration among students and faculty from different scientific disciplines,
including chemistry, biology, physics and computer science. The work has
potential commercial relevance for biomedical sensing and involves under-
represented minorities from the greater Chicago area. Aspects of the program
will be incorporated into the undergraduate curriculum, including courses in
biochemistry, advanced analytical chemistry, and the general biology laboratory.
