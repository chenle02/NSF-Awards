9255836 Eubanks Typically students are assessed in chemistry on their ability to
provide answers to short questions. These tests measure neither the materials
instructors feel students should learn nor the level of student understanding of
concepts or student mastery of a particular concept. Only in the laboratory have
assessments been made on the basis of integrated activities, but laboratories
come under attack for other reasons. This project develops, validates and tests
eight computer-based scenarios, based on Chem Com, in which parameters can be
carried to provide different outcomes. The scenarios assess student knowledge of
chemistry content, level of student understanding, and ability to make science-
based decisions on societal issues. Resources are available to students to
address the chemical issues raised in the scenario. Help can be given
electronically. The student outcome can be electronically scored in relation to
the reasoning described and the help given. The assessments can be used to
inform instruction and also to provide objective, bias-free measures useful in
high stakes testing. The computer-based objective assessment tasks (Com-BOATS)
are designed by project personnel with experience in developing examinations at
the American Chemical Society (ACS) Examinations Institute using Authorware Pro
shells. The tasks are pilot and field tested nationally in classrooms. The
results are interpreted by third party evaluators. Dissemination is through the
ACS. ***
