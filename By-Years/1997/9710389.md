This research will measure (1) high-resolution, high- and room-temperature
photoabsorption cross sections of molecular nitrogen and oxygen in the extreme
ultraviolet region, and (2) temperature-dependent fluorescence cross sections
for producing (a) neutral nitrogen emissions through photodissociative
excitation of molecular nitrogen, and (b) ionized nitrogen 1085 and 916 angstrom
emissions through dissociative photoionization excitation of molecular nitrogen.
This work will utilize existing instrumentation, including windowless high
temperature absorption cells and a high temperature effusive gas cell.
