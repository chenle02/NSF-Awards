PI: Anvari, Bahman&lt;br/&gt;Proposal No.: 1509218&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
unique contribution of this proposed work is the ability to engineer
nanoparticles that can be made using the patient's own erythrocytes to extend
the circulation time and minimize biocompatibility issues so that these
nanoparticles can interact with tumors. Light energy can then be used with the
nanoparticles to generate heat and provide localized hyperthermia at the tumor
to destroy it or augment chemo or radiotherapy. Personalized medicine has great
potential and this work can make important contributions to this
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Effective treatment with a minimum of side effects
of various malignant tumors remains an important problem in modern medicine.
Personalized medicine gives the opportunity to direct and optimize such
treatment to individual patients based upon their genetic and immunological
makeup. This proposal will develop ghost erythrocytes loaded with fluorescent
dyes as theranostic agents to image cancer cells by fluorescence and also to
induce photothermal killing damage. The erythrocytes will be functionalized with
an antibody to target tumors in vivo in xenograft mouse models. The PI has had
many under-represented students in his lab. Aspects of the work will be
incorporated into a new class.
