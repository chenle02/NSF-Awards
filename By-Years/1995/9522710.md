ABSTRACT Eli Ruckenstein CTS-9522710 SUNY Buffalo The stability of foams and
concentrated liquid-liquid emulsions is a necessary prerequisite for their
utilization in any practical application. Gravity driven drainage of the
continuous phase which takes place primarily through an interconnected network
of Plateau border channels (formed between adjacent bubbles) plays a pivotal
role in determining their stability since there is considerable interplay
between drainage and collapse. A systematic study of drainage is therefore
important in understanding the instability in these systems. A unified
theoretical treatment of drainage is proposed which takes into account the
separation of the continuous and dispersed phases. The problem will be treated
in two ways: a conventional macroscopic approach in which balances are
formulated over bulk differential elements containing a large number of bubbles
and a microscopic approach in which the dispersed phase droplets are represented
by Voronoi polyhedral and detailed balances are written over each Plateau border
channel in the complex network. The latter approach will enable us to clearly
identify the effect of the polydispersivity of the dispersed phase on the
drainage process. An attempt will be made to relate the results from the two
approaches to formulate a corrected macroscopic model which is computationally
more tractable. Inspection of the equations suggests that it is possible to
determine based on the initial state of concentrated emulsion which phase
separates out before a drainage equilibrium, which corresponds to a balance
between the Plateau border suction and gravity, is established. It should be
emphasized that this equilibrium is not thermodynamic; liquid-liquid
concentrated emulsions are, however, expected to remain in this mechanical
equilibrium for a long time. An attempt will be made to establish a phase
diagram based on the initial state of the system. Simple experiments are
proposed to verify the theoretical predicti ons.
