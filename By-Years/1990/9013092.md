This research is using the combinatorial optimization capabilities of neural
networks to devise algorithms for solving repair problems in IC chips. Two
classes of array repair problems are being examined. The first is repair by
replacement of rows and columns (as in memory arrays). The second is repair by
replacement of individual cells (as in systolic arrays and iterative logic).
Theoretical models of array repair problems are being analyzed and simulated to
measure the performance of neural repair algorithms. Electronic neural networks
that will execute the neural repair algorithms for memory, systolic and
iterative arrays are being designed and fabricated.
