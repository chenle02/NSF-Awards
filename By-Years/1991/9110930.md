This research is aimed at a precise understanding of the micro- and
macromechanical descriptions of large strain deformation and failure of ductile
heterophase microstructures. Emphasis is on deformation processes at, or near,
interfaces and on the failure of interfaces in composite materials. Specific
objectives include (1) development of large strain, strain-rate dependent theory
and predictive models for composite structures; (2) application of the models to
the deformation and failure of the microstructures; (3) experimental studies of
deformation and failure in metal-matrix composite materials; (4) experimental
studies of deformation at bi- material interfaces and analysis of their fracture
resistance; (5) related effects of residual stresses developed during the
processing on deformation and failure mechanisms. %%% This research relates to
structural metal alloys and composites that employ interfaces to control
mechanical behavior and/or surface coatings to create improved properties.
