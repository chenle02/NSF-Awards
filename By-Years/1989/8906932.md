Research is on physical design and synthesis of IC's, and on reliable IC
designs. Theory of VLSI design model and methodologies is being used to
understand layout problems for complex IC designs. Research problems being
addressed include: multi-layer routing, pin assignment, placement of flexible
modules, module orientation, and placement of standard cells. Two approaches to
reliable designs are being investigated. The first is to identify minimal sets
of redundant elements that are needed to replace defective elements in both
homogeneous and non-homogeneous arrays. The minimal sets are called minimum
covering sets. Second is an effort to develop a general model for fault coverage
problems in reconfigurable chips. The model is capable of capturing a large
class of possible relationships between redundant elements and defective
elements.
