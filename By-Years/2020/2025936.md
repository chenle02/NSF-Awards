The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project is to rectify long-standing issues impeding the promise of genomic data
to revolutionize human biomedicine and animal health. The genomic services
industry is projected to reach $2.7 billion by 2024 (CAGR 16%) in the USA. The
proposed project is a cloud-based platform consisting of a database and a suite
of software analytical tools to enable rapid and accurate assessment of the
impact of gene variants on biological function or trait, as well as disease.
This will enable researchers to advance treatment across a broad spectrum of
issues within human biomedicine, such as cancer; diabetes; neurological,
cardiac, and developmental diseases, and many others. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
SBIR Phase II project will address long-standing deficiencies in research
challenges leading to higher costs, prolonged delays, and failure to advance
scientific discovery. The technical objectives of the SBIR Phase II project
include: 1) extend methods to generate, validate, and annotate high-quality DNA
sequence data for a precisely organized central database; 2) assemble and
implement software content, unique supplemental databases and powerful
applications for the end user; 3) engineer the software, architecture and
performance of the cloud platform for optimal ease of use and accessibility for
the end user. The solution will transform current applications in targeted
genomics through the rapid, accurate assessment of the impact of gene variants
on biological function, phenotypic trait or disease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
