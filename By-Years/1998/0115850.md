Subject: Elgar/Herbers/Guza abstract&lt;br/&gt;Funds are provided for
development, testing, and improvement of circulation models driven by wave
propagation and wave-breaking in the presence of abrupt nearshore topography.
These will be tested using data collected from a California field site with two
offshore canyons. Specific objectives include: determining how surface gravity
waves propagate across a complex inner shelf topography, determining how
bathymetrically-induced alongshore variations of the wave field affect shoaling,
breaking, and nearshore circulation, and determining the characteristics of mass
exchange between the surf zone and the inner shelf in the presence of abrupt
topography. Four waverider buoys over the outer and mid shelf will provide
offshore wave boundary conditions for the models and characterize the refraction
over the outer shelf. Pressure cells at mid shelf will identify reflected waves
from Scripps Canyon. PUVs (pressure and velocity sensors) and acoustic doppler
current profilers (ADCPs) over the inner shelf will characterize inner shelf and
surf zone circulation and wave fields. Drifters will be deployed and tracked.
Moderate wave and low wave situations will be compared in an attempt to isolate
flows induced by the canyon in the absence of wave forcing. The buoys, pressure
cells, and PUVs will provide estimates of the evolution of the directional wave
spectrum for comparison with model output. Various inner shelf models, including
the NOPP community model, will be compared to the field
data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
