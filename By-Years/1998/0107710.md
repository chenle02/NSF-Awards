The Advanced Materials Program in the Division of Chemistry and the Experimental
Program to Stimulate Competitive Research in the Office of EPSCoR make this
award to New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology. With the award,
Professor Tanja Pietrass will study the adsorption of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrous
oxide and ammonia by carbon nanotubes using in situ solid-state NMR
spectroscopy, exploiting the full complement of dipolar and quadrupolar coupling
studies, chemical shifts and relaxation time measurements. Gas dynamics will be
probed using two-dimensional exchange spectroscopy under variable temperature
and gas density conditions. Results from these studies will be beneficial to
understand the storage capacity, electronic structure and binding kinetics of
different gases by carbon nanotubes. New Mexico Institute of Mining and
Technology has a large underrepresented minority student body, mainly Hispanics
and Native Americans, and this award will help in their research training and
education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Absorption kinetics of different gases by
carbon nanotubes will be studied using solid-state NMR spectroscopy, exploiting
the full complement of dipolar and quadrupolar coupling studies, chemical shifts
and relaxation time measurements. These studies will provide fundamental
information about storage capacity, electronic structure and binding kinetics of
carbon nanotubes. Results from this research could find applications in gas
storage, e.g. hydrogen gas for fuel cells, gas separations, and as gas sensor
materials. In addition, the research program will provide multidisciplinary
education and training opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students in
material and surface chemistries, and large number of under represented
minorities attending the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology will
benefit from these research activities.
