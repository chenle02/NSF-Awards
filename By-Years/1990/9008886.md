This project takes advantage of new developments in photography and image
analysis software to advance field studies in environmental science. The
dynamics of ecological processes as well as impacts from disturbance often are
measured by changes in vegetation. Traditional methods of vegetation analysis
are labor intensive, slow, and as a result, they often are confined to small-
scale measurements. Many current research topics (i.e. climate change) require
analysis over very large areas, and although remote sensing from space is
providing unprecedented information, validation of satellite imagery with large-
scale vegetation analysis is lacking. A new, ground-based methodology has been
developed by an interdisciplinary group at the University of New Mexico that is
significantly increasing the ability of scientists to study environmental
dynamics across a range of scales and allow integration with reflectance
measurements from satellite instruments. The new technology requires image
analysis algorithm research and development and the integration of new image
acquisition hardware. The resulting system will provide near ground level
acquisition of stereo images and detailed analysis of three dimensional
information on a computer workstation. Three dimensional information from
reflectance imagery is currently not available from any source, yet this
information can lead to improved species identification and quantification of
volumes (biomass) instead of just surface areas. It represents a major advance
in image analysis technology for ecological studies. A highly qualified team of
investigators will address the problem. Institutional facilities for image
analysis and remote sensing are excellent. The new research is further
strengthened by association with the Long-Term Ecological Research project
centered on the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge.
