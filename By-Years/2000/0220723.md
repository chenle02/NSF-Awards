Over a four-year period, this project provides scholarships to 20 economically
disadvantaged, first-generation students who are pursuing a B.S. in Computer
Information Science, and an A.S. in Computer Science. Participants are selected
largely from the rural, and economically distressed area of Vermont. Scholarship
recipients are full-time undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need,
academic potential, and a desire to enter the fields of Computer Science or
Interactive Digital Media. Throughout their participation in the CSEMS project,
participants have access to a full array of academic support services designed
to ensure their success. They participate in activities geared to preparing them
for careers in the CIS or IDM fields. These activities include career
counseling, upper-class and professional mentors, workshops on study skills and
time management, brown bag lunch seminars to discuss career options, visits to
job sites, internships and attendance at occasional professional conferences.
