Though much research has sought to better understand the process of language
acquisition, many fundamental questions regarding how infants complete the
enormous task of learning a language within just a few years remain without a
definitive answer. So far, researchers have compiled a basic timeline for the
acquisition of linguistic knowledge, and proposed two learning mechanisms: a
bias leading infants to pay more attention to speech sounds that are easier to
produce, and general statistical induction skills that are used to process
various kinds of sensory input. Which mechanism is operative remains a
continuing and fundamental debate from both theoretical and experimental
perspectives.

Surprising results from a recent pilot study indicate that infants make use of
certain information regarding sound sequencing as early as 4.5 months, 4 months
earlier than the previously established age. The revised findings appear to be
the result of using experiments that present words to infants in phonetically
controlled comparisons, rather than as a random selection. The dissertation
seeks not only to confirm the pilot findings, but also to uncover further
evidence regarding which of the two proposed learning mechanisms primarily
facilitates acquisition of this early knowledge.

The research will employ the well-established Head-turn Preference paradigm, in
which words are played to an infant on a speaker, accompanied by a blinking
light. The infant's attention to the words is indicated by turning toward the
light. The experiment monitors the amount of time that infants attend to
different kinds of stimuli, demonstrating the distinctions that are evident to
them at that particular age. The innovation in this study lies in the stimuli
the infants hear: the forms presented contrast specific sound patterns, in
particular the distinction of voicing between fricative sounds (such as f, s,
and sh versus v, z, and zh). This new approach allows for further exploration of
fundamental questions regarding how infants learn language, a crucial aspect of
human interaction.
