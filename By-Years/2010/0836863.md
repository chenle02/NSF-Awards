Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this
proposal is to address these issues with innovative pedagogical and
technological contributions. The project objectives are threefold:
&lt;br/&gt;(1) To provide students with short-duration online courseware to
support unsupervised learning of the C language through state of the art peer
learning, active learning and cognitive apprenticeship approaches;
&lt;br/&gt;(2) To integrate this online material in a virtual package which will
also offer a remotely accessible development environment leveraging open source
software tools which have been developed to address the specific pedagogical
hindrances of the C language (e.g. clarification of compiler error messages,
detection of common novice programmer bugs, validation against test-harnesses,
etc.); &lt;br/&gt;(3) To facilitate adoption by packaging the solution as a
downloadable, portable, VMware image running on a Windows or Linux host allowing
students to access to the above-mentioned development environment and allowing
the instructor to collect data on students' activity to assess student learning.
&lt;br/&gt;The dissemination effort is includes running workshops both locally
and in national computing education conferences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader impact on educational practices is meant to reach a national level. From
a qualitative perspective, C is not only key to system-oriented upper-level
courses but also to develop students' understanding of the link between the
programs they write and computer systems as a whole as well as strengthening
their coding discipline. This project improves retention and performance of
students in mid- and upper-level computing classes.
