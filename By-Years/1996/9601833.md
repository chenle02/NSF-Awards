9601833 Petty A combined Doppler anemometer (PDA) and digital particle image
velocimetry (PIV) system will be purchased with the dedicated HP workstations
for supporting the ongoing basic and applied research of four faculty and their
students. The measurement facility would (1) enhance the professional
interactions of MSU researchers with their national and international
colleagues; (2) provide new understanding of process equipment performance in
terms of underlying flow phenomenon; and, (3) increase the knowledge base needed
to validate multiphase flow models, turbulent closure theories, and rheological
constitutive models for viscoelastic fluids. The specific research problems
proposed for study during the three-year acquisition period two-and three-
dimensional involve the-phase flows, reverse flows, secondary flows, flow
transitions, and unsteady flows. Thus, the PDA/PIV system should yield new
understanding of specific flow structures encountered in hydrocyclones, in
automotive cooling fans, in piston/cylinder engines, and in reaction injection
molding processes. ***
