IBN: 9722704 PI: BOK Vision is a topic of major interest in neuroscience. The
FASEB Summer Conference on the Biology &amp; Chemistry of vision has become a
regular event every two years, and this year the emphasis is on the structure,
function and development of photoreceptors and the pigment epithelium of the
retina. This emphasis also brings in discussions of the latest technologies that
have led to novel advances in the field. A variety of speakers will cover this
range of topics, and the conference remains small enough to promote vigorous
exchanges of ideas in informal as well as formal settings. The NSF partial
support will assist younger investigators from diverse backgrounds to
participate in this conference. This conference will have an impact across many
areas of visual neuroscience, on the careers of young investigators by allowing
them a chance to interact readily with highly regarded senior investigators, and
will extend to interactions with physician/scientists by enhancing their
understanding of basic mechanisms that underlie retinal disease.
