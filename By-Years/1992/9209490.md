This research is concerned with investigating how the brain recognizes objects
in the environment using the somatosensory tactile system. Results obtained will
further our understanding of how computations are carried out in complex,
cortical information- processing systems, and will contribute to the growing
body of knowledge about how the brain is organized to process sensory
information. The techniques used are behavioral testing, computer- assisted
motion analysis and electrical recordings from single brain cells in order to
investigate how mammals acquire, process and use sensory information from facial
vibrissae. Previous studies have demonstrated that important similarities exist
between this tactile system and use of the fingertips by humans, when they are
actively touching textured surfaces.
