"Active Physics," previously funded by NSF, has proven to be a widely used high
school physics text, meeting the needs of diverse groups of students in urban
areas and increasing the number of ninth graders taking physics. The goals of
that development were to introduce physics instruction to a wider audience, to
provide for a real-world approach to physics and to create materials that
reflect what was known about how students learn. Now "Active Physics" is to be
revised into a single volume emphasizing the organizing principles of physics.
The content is restructured and content added for teaching physics to ninth
graders as the first part of a three-course science sequence. Additional
materials extend the content for advanced students and increase the use of
mathematics. The materials address the need for professional development of
physics teachers and of science teachers in other fields to teach physics to
ninth graders. An extensive evaluation explores student performance.
