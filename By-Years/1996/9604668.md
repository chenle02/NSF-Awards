PI: Gibson IBN: 9604668 This project will investigate the relationship between
social behavior and genetic relatedness in lek-breeding bird, the Sage grouse
(Centrocercus urophasianus). This species serves as a model system for the
analysis of mate choice (sexual selection) in animals because breeding takes
place at easily-observed leks , spatially-predictable groups of males visited by
females for mating. The study will isolate polymorphic DNA markers from sag
grouse blood that can be used to measure paternity and relatedness, and use
these markers to (I) test inferences about paternity of broods derived from
behavioral observations, and (II) survey patterns of genetic relatedness within
and among natural social groups. This research involves a combination of
observational field studies and genetic analysis in the laboratory. The results
will address fundamental questions about the biological basis of choice behavior
in animals.
