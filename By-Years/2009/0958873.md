This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds from the Major Research
Instrumentation-Recovery and Reinvestment (MRI-R2) program were used to support
the acquisition of a tabletop scanning electron microscope and associated
equipment at the Missouri Botanical Gardens (MBG). An automated microscopy
system was also acquired to facilitate the digitization of specimen slides. The
instrumentation provides expanded research opportunities for a wide range of MBG
curators, students, and visitors in research areas such as plant taxonomy,
ecology, evolution, biogeography, pollen biology, ethnobotany, GIS and
conservation. Research at MBG promotes the study and conservation of plants all
over the world, from biodiversity tropical hotspots to native plants and
habitats in Missouri, involving people from diverse cultures, occupations, age
groups and ethnicity. Scientific study of plants provides the knowledge needed
for rational management and conservation of plant resources. The acquired
instrumentation expands the MBG laboratory capacity and allows botanists and
students to extend their investigations, discovery, and propagation of
knowledge. Use of the instruments is promoted through demonstrations in the
garden's K-12 education programs, teacher training, special workshops and
undergraduate research programs. The knowledge gained from the use of this
instrumentation is widely disseminated through popular and technical
publications, seminars, meetings, and building tours.
