ABSTRACT OPP-9703127 CURRY, JUDITH UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO This research project
is a key component of a large, coordinated, multi-investigator program, Surface
Heat Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) Ocean. The research program will be conducted
for 14 months from a ship frozen into the ice pack. These investigators will
measure atmospheric conditions of the permanent ice cap of the Arctic Ocean from
a scientifically instrumented C-130 aircraft during the Spring and Fall in
conjunction with a NASA research program jointly conducted at the site. These
researchers will determine the flux of incoming heat radiating onto the ice floe
as a function of changing cloud conditions. Their results will help determine
how atmospheric heating is coupled to adsorption of heat by the ice. These
measurements are critical to understanding how heat is reflected or absorbed by
the ice as it melts in the summer and thickens in the winter in response to
seasonal variations in climate. The aircraft measurement program makes an
essential contribution to the SHEBA team of researchers who will measure
atmospheric variables with a large array of instruments on the ice floe and
aircraft flying above as well as ice and ocean property measurements made on and
below the ice floe. The combined set of measurements in SHEBA will allow
refinement of climate models for the Arctic region. Those improved models will
lead to better predictions of the climate and the permanence of the Arctic ice
cap under a proposed global warming that could occur if atmospheric carbon
dioxide levels are increased above present levels.
