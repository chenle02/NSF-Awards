ABSTRACT: EIA 0243337, ACM, Barbara Ryder, PI &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
to the Association Computing Machinery (ACM) ) provides funds for "Travel Grants
for Faculty at Minority/Female Institutions to attend FCRC'03". The project
supports faculty actively involved with the education of women and minorities to
attend the constituent conferences of FCRC 2003, the primary technical
conference incorporating the interests of many of the ACM special interest
groups. The project incorporates a special panel and discussion session for the
travel grant recipients on the issue of recruiting and retaining women and
minorities in computer-related fields. Targeted schools include primarily
undergraduate institutions, including HBCUs, women's colleges, and other
colleges with large minority enrollments. An additional set of faculty is being
similarly supported by the ACM SIG Project Fund as part of the overall effort.
