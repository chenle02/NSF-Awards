This Conference on the Neural Control of Behavior will be held at UCLA. It
addresses technical innovations that are now being applied to unconventional
model organisms. Participants in this program possess expertise in behavioral
neuroscience, neuroendocrinology, endocrinology, animal behavior, and
developmental biology. The conference will engage both senior and junior ranked
scientists and students in discussions regarding ways that investigators can
take their research in new directions. Travel funds will allow participants to
attend the meeting. The impact of this will extend to numerous fields of study,
as mentioned above. In addition, the meeting will foster scientific education by
training graduate and undergraduate students to participate in comparative
biological research armed with a clear understanding of novel sophisticated
technology placed in the framework of behavioral questions. Assessment tools
will be utilized to develop strategies for organizing next years meeting..
