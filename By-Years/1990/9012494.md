The proposed planning grant is aimed at developing a research proposal in the
area of Ordered Geometry. The planning stage will allow the investigator to get
a deeper understanding of infinite planes and how the notions Archimedean
ordered in the sense of Killgrove and in the sense of Priess-Cromps are
developed in an ordered affine plane. Ultimately, the investigator is interested
in pursuing the question: Do the Cauchy sequence and Archimedean ordered notions
imply the Heine-Borel result? The investigation of ordered geometry will be
further pursued by considering ordered planes when universally parabolic regions
are convex. This will be the preliminary stage to the question: Which Desargues
configuration arise? Finally, the investigator will consider the Prenowitz
approach to geometry.
