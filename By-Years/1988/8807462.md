Research in the area of small groups is important if we are to understand how
classrooms, therapy groups, families, committees, and friendship groups operate
and how these groups can become more productive. Much of the current group
research uses theories and models developed for the study of individual
behavior. This individual focus is, in part, due to the current limitation in
the available statistical tools. Commonly used analytic methods either ignore or
treat as a nuisance the fact that persons interact and influence one another.
Five different areas of investigation are proposed. First, models will be
developed and tested to explain the process by which members of the same group
become more similar to one another than members of different groups. Second,
methods to determine the ways in which a person's behavior changes when he or
she leaves one group and enters another will be developed. Third, we will model
the extent to which the norms of a group change when the one member leaves the
group and a new person enters the group. Fourth, methods to study how family
members perceive one another will be explored. Fifth, methods to measure the
extent to which competing groups develop antagonistic norms will be developed.
For each area, procedures for data collection and statistical analysis as well
as computer software will be developed. For each area, data will be analyzed to
illustrate the new analytic method. Upon completion of this research, there will
be a set of tools that can be used to measure the process by which group members
create norms and the extent to which these norms influence the group members.
The techniques can be applied in social psychology, organizational behavior,
family studies, sociology and educational psychology.
