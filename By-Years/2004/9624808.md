9624808 Lacks This CAREER grant supports the work of a young assistant professor
at Tulane University, chemical engineering department. The PI has been trained
in molecular simulation methods as applied to a study of polymers. The work
proposed here focuses on the vibrational properties of polymeric glasses and
their influence, on the one hand on the dynamical relaxation in glasses and on
the other, on the thermodynamic properties. The essential educational component
consists of a revision of the chemical engineering curriculum to include more
moleculap theory and computer simulation. %%% This is a CAREER grant to a young

grant contains a research component consisting of a computer simulation study of
the vibrational properties of polymeric glasses (plastics). In the educational
component, the PI is proposing revision of the chemical engineering curriculum
to include more molecular theory and also computer simulation. ***
