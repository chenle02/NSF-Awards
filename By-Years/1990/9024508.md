The surface science techniques of Auger electron spectroscopy, low energy
electron diffraction, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, alkali ion
scattering spectroscopy and forward focusing angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy will be used to examine ultrathin films and monolayers. The systems
to be studied include palladium films. Studies will be carried out of the effect
of various gases, including carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide,
ethylene and acetylene, on the film properties using primarily high resolution
electron energy loss spectroscopy and temperature programmed desorption. Kinetic
studies will be performed and some catalytic reactions will be examined. The
analytical probes used have the ability to probe subtle changes in the geometric
and electronic structure of the materials studied, and should enable a better
understanding of chemisorption and reactivity to be obtained. %%% The research,
in the general area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry, focuses on surface
science studies of monolayers and ultrathin films of palladium on early
transition metal single crystal substrates. The study aims to correlate these
studies with the chemisorption and reaction properties of the films. The work
promises to lead to a greater understanding of the properties of thin metal
films which will have a wide range of important applications in materials
science and catalysis.
