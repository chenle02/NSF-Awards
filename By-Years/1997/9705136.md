w:\awards\awards97\budnick05136.doc 9705136 Budnick This is a renewal project
to study the effect of gas-phase- element interstitial modification of Sm2Fe17
and related structures. Such modification is showing promise for the development
of in a new class of magnetic materials with properties potentially suitable for
permanent magnet applications. In the proposed research, general questions
concerning both interstitial R2Fe17(N,C,H)x (R = rare-earth element) and
substitutional Sm2Fe17-yTy (T = Ga, Al, and Si), as well as the related
R(Fe,T)12, R3(Fe,T)29, and R2Fe14B rare-earth systems, will be addressed. The
local atomic, electronic, and magnetic structures, and the related macroscopic
magnetic properties will be explored by nuclear magnetic resonance, Mssbauer
effect, x-ray absorption fine structure, neutron diffraction, and muon spin
rotation. The goals are to understand the specific local aspects leading to
changes in magnetic anisotropy and individual sublattice magnetization as well
as to determine the specific site moment dependence on local environment and
lattice expansion. %%% This is a renewal project to study the effect of gas-

Permanent magnetic magnets are vital for both national security as well as
commercial industries. For example, an automobile contains more than 100
magnetic components. The total market for permanent magnets is currently more
than $10 billion per year, and growing rapidly. This application requires
materials with high performance, high working temperature, and low cost. Since
the 1980s, the search for permanent magnetic materials (to replace cobalt) has
concentrated on iron-based compounds because iron is abundant, inexpensive, and
has relatively high magneti c moment. Recently, it has been discovered that when
gaseous elements such as nitrogen are diffused into selected iron compounds, the
magnetic properties are greatly enhanced. Our research program utilizes
microscopic experimental techniques such as magnetic resonance to study the role
that such inserted elements play in improving not only the magnetic properties,
but the general physical properties of materials. ***
