For accurate automated translation of text-to-spoken-word or spoken-word-to-
text, it is necessary to understand the prosodic patterning of speech since
prosody, i.e. stress, rhythm, and pauses between phrases, is central in
conveying meaning and structuring discourse. In addition, many languages use
tone to change the meaning of words but little is known about how prosodic
features interact with tone. Since tone and prosody are conveyed by using some
of the same acoustic dimensions (pitch, duration, voice quality), one must know
how these two systems interact for automatic speech recognition and translation.

To investigate and test hypotheses about the relationship of tone and prosody,
Christian Di Canio, along with an interdisciplinary team, will create a database
of 30 hours of transcribed narratives from Itunyoso Trique and expand an
existing similar database in Yoloxóchitl Mixtec, both both Mixtecan languages
from eastern central Mexico. These transcribed narratives will then be parsed
into smaller units applying a 'forced alignment' tool used in automatic speech
recognition. Important results from the project will include the testing and
improvement of the forced alignment tool; new corpora and expanded dictionaries
for and Yoloxóchitl Mixtec; and an analysis of tone and prosody interactions in
these two languages. The resulting prosodically segmented and tagged corpora
will be a first of its kind for an endangered language that will be of use to
the speaker-community and the broader scientific community.
