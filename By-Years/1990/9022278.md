Protein kinase C (PKC) is an enzyme involved in mediating and regulating the
actions of many neurotransmitters, hormones and growth factors. Ubiquitously
located in the body and mainly concentrated in the brain, protein kinase C is
activated by second messengers, Ca2+ and diacylglycerol. The activity of protein
kinase C has been implicated in a number of neurological functions such as
neurite extension, regulation of ionic conductances and neurotransmitter
release. PKC exerts its effects on neuronal activity by attaching phosphate
groups to substrate proteins. The goal of this research project is to examine
the mechanisms by which the enzyme regulates cell activity at the molecular
level. Three in vivo substrates will be characterized and identified by studying
the pathway of PKC activation. Dr. Scholz will utilize glutamate receptors to
stimulate PKC phosphorylation. Results from this study will provide additional
information on the function of PKC in neuronal development.
