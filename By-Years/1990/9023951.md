The primary objective of this US-Poland research project between Dr. Richard
Aron of Kent State University and Dr. Alexander Pelczynski of the Institute opf
Mathematics, Polish Academy of Sciences, is to undertake joint research on both
function, matrix and operator algebras, and polynomials on finite and infinite
dimensional spaces. The researchers intend to concentrate on Banach space
concepts and questions in classical analysis, particularly questions about
inequalities. The groups involved are amongst the leaders in this field and have
cooperated in the past. Continued collaboration should yield increased research
activity and output in the three general areas of function algebras, operator
ideals and polynomials. Any progress in this area would represent a significant
contribution to mathematical research and enable contacts between the US and
Poland to be substantially strengthened. This project in mathematical research
fulfills the program objectives of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling
leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary
talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and
competence.
