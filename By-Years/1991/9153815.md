The purpose of this "Student Watershed Research Project" is to promote
collaboration between science teachers and cooperating scientists to involve
students in significant scientific research as an integral part of science
instruction during the regular school day. The 3-year program will develop and
disseminate training, instructional materials, and support enabling student
collection, interpretation, and communication of scientific data in a local
watershed. Middle/high school teachers will participate in aquatic research, and
develop instructional plans to involve their students. Reliable, replicable data
collection procedures for use with students will be developed or adapted from
existing sources and validated in cooperation with scientists from universities
and government agencies. Under the guidance of their teacher, students will
collect and analyze physical, chemical, and biological data from a local
watershed. Through a project-developed computer conferencing system, students
will contribute their data to a regional data base and discuss their findings
across school and municipal boundaries. Teachers will receive information and
support electronically to continue collaboration with peers and cooperating
scientists. Students will interact with the scientists for questions and
discussion. Student data will be contributed to public agencies and university
research projects. Teachers and students will present findings, discuss issues,
and attend additional training workshops at a regional convention involving all
project participants. Project-developed training, materials, and methodologies
will be packaged for dissemination to any district interested in adopting the
program. The project runs from September 1, 1991 to September 30, 1994. The cost
sharing by the institution is 34% of the amount requested from NSF.
