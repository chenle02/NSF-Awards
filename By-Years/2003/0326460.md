This medium ITR project will develop a framework to facilitate
science&lt;br/&gt;research and education on the semantic web, and will implement
and&lt;br/&gt;evaluate prototype tools and applications for use in the
biocomplexity&lt;br/&gt;and biodiversity domains. These capabilities include the
ability to&lt;br/&gt;collaborate and convey meaning through the automatic
and&lt;br/&gt;semi-automatic semantic annotation of web documents; to
improve&lt;br/&gt;information retrieval using background knowledge and
inference; and to&lt;br/&gt;extract and fuse information from multiple,
heterogeneous sources in&lt;br/&gt;response to a query. A testbed for
prototyping these capabilities will&lt;br/&gt;be the web portal of the National
Biological Information&lt;br/&gt;Infrastructure (http://www.nbii.org/). The
framework will include&lt;br/&gt;specifications for ontologies, protocols,
agents, and tools for&lt;br/&gt;authoring, automated ingest, and annotation.
These tools will leverage&lt;br/&gt;collaboratively constructed ontologies to
bring diverse communities&lt;br/&gt;together and enable community construction
of scientific&lt;br/&gt;knowledge. Additional domain-independent, general
purpose ontologies&lt;br/&gt;will be developed to enable metadata about the
contents and structure&lt;br/&gt;of databases and other knowledge repositories
to be expressed in&lt;br/&gt;emerging knowledge markup languages such as RDF and
OWL. This will&lt;br/&gt;enable agents to both access and index the hidden web,
and will also&lt;br/&gt;support the data mining of diverse and distributed
databases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
