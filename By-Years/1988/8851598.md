The merits of computer-aided design and computer-aided engineering are now taken
for granted in industry. The ability to conceptualize a product, to analyze its
performance, and to expedite its arrival to market have revolutionized the
engineering design profession. Unfortunately, the sophisticated hardware and
software necessary to achieve these gains have not penetrated into the academic
environment due to their prohibitive costs. As a result, current engineering
graduates receive little exposure to contemporary methods of true computer-aided
design and analysis. A Computer Aided Engineering Laboratory consisting of a
local area network of high performance engineering workstations will be
established. This facility will expose its undergraduate students to
contemporary design and analysis methods including drafting, solid modeling,
mechanism analysis, finite element analysis, and computer graphics.
