Stefanich 9355783 This project will conduct a conference on effective science
education for students with disabilities. The conference will be held for two
days just prior to the 1994 National Science Teachers Association Annual
Convention in Anaheim, California. The conference will include invited papers,
panels, and working groups to evaluate current practices and future directions
in science education for students with disabilities. The major purpose of the
conference is to educate science teacher educators, science teachers, and
professionals providing services and/or equipment to persons with disabilities
as to what resources and strategies are effective in providing science education
for persons with disabilities. Recommendations for improved practice will be
shared and responded to by participants. Information in areas of career
concerns, teacher education, methods, materials/programs, dissemination,
evaluation and assessment, and educational organizations and agencies will be
compiled and prepared into a document for conference participants. A publication
will be developed following the conference, and become available to interested
individuals and agencies at a nominal cost. ***
