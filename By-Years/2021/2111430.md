The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project is reduced emissions for conventional engines. Engine emissions directly
impact the environment, public health, and wildlife. Improved engine design can
operate in parallel with other energy-efficient measures with minimal need for
new infrastructure. The proposed project advances a new engine architecture
designed for efficiency and reduced emissions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small
Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will yield a new engine
technology for a low-cost, high-power density, environmentally-friendly two-
stroke engine. The proposed system will: address shortcomings of a traditional
two-stroke engine, eliminate oil from the combustion process, offer durability,
and control combustion and emissions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
