ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0344094&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
transport of momentum, heat and salt by mesoscale eddies is an important
component of the large-scale ocean circulation. General circulation models often
do not resolve eddies directly but have to rely on turbulence closure
parameterizations. One particular weakness of common parameterizations is that
they do not allow up-gradient fluxes, where eddy fluxes feed into the large-
scale gradients rather than erode them. This study will explore a novel approach
to circumvent this limitation by representing the non-resolved eddy effects in
terms of random forces. First, solutions of a hierarchy of ocean models of
increasing complexity and realism will be analyzed. Here, a new dynamical
decomposition of the&lt;br/&gt;oceanic turbulence into the eddy- and large-scale
components will be applied. The large-scale/eddy&lt;br/&gt;interactions, that
is, components of the eddy fluxes and their divergences, will be
systematically&lt;br/&gt;analyzed. Second, the performance of the random model
of the eddy forces will be systematically evaluated and compared against several
existing parameterization schemes. The broader impacts of the&lt;br/&gt;proposed
work is that it will aid in the general circulation and climate system modeling,
in the&lt;br/&gt;interpretation of observational data sets, and in the planning
of future observational strategies&lt;br/&gt;aimed at estimating the key eddy
fluxes. Also, the ideas pursued are likely to have an impact on&lt;br/&gt;other
areas of turbulence, where modeling subgrid-scale processes is an important
issue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
