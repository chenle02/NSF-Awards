9413879 Wendler This project is an internationally collaborative (U.S.-French-
Australian) study of katabatic winds along the coast of East Antarctica, based
on two lines of automatic weather stations, one from the French station inland
to Dome C, the other along the coast. The coastal array includes stations at
Cape Denison and Port Martin, which have recorded the highest average surface
wind speeds on the globe. These winds drive the sea ice offshore, and are
responsible for extremely high heat fluxes from the ocean to the atmosphere.
Satellite-based active microwave imagery (Synthetic Aperture Radar) will be
combined with the observed meteorological data to analyze the formation
persistence and size of offshore polynyas as a function of wind speed. The
coastal array of weather stations will be augmented by three additional
instruments, and the University of Alaska receiving station for Synthetic
Aperture Radar data will be utilized to downlink images of East Antarctica.
These images will be supplemented with images from the Australian receiving
station in Hobart, and, when it becomes operational, from the Radarsat receiving
station at McMurdo. ***
