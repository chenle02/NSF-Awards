The Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander LSAMP Development project, hosted by
Chaminade&lt;br/&gt;University with the University of Hawaii system, seeks to
gather parties from 19 different&lt;br/&gt;Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander
serving institutions across the Pacific, for the&lt;br/&gt;purpose of developing
a Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP).
The&lt;br/&gt;development of a successful LSAMP Alliance will be able to reach
at least 18,000 Native&lt;br/&gt;Hawaiian and Pacific Islander students among
the Alliance partners.&lt;br/&gt;The INTELLECTUAL MERIT of the project resides
in the fact that the University of Hawaii at&lt;br/&gt;Manoa, a Research I
institution, will provide the scientific and intellectual
leadership&lt;br/&gt;in the Alliance.&lt;br/&gt;The BROADER IMPACTS of the
proposed activities are the increase in Native Hawaiian and&lt;br/&gt;Pacific
Islander academic institution and student participation in STEM disciplines.
