The concept behind proposed research can be characterized as the study of
mathematical aspects of symmetry properties in quantum theory and statistical
mechanics. The first part of the project is focused on the objects which appear
in the analysis of models of quantum field theory in two-dimensional space time
with special conditions on the boundary. In the second part the PI will study
the reasons why some mechanical systems can be solved exactly analytically and
the symmetry arguments that go with this. The third and the fifth parts are
related to questions involving statistical aspects of symmetry. The fourth part
of the project is to connect quantum mechanics and a special two dimensional
quantum field theory. This part is expected to bring new insight into now
relatively the old subject of quantum mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the
first part of the project the PI proposes to investigate Harish-Chandra series
in a broad setting of finite dimensional simple Lie groups, affine Lie groups
and their quantum counterparts. The second part can be viewed as a classical
counterpart of the first part. It appears that a classical Hamiltonian
counterpart of Harish-Chandra theory is a superintegrable system. The third and
the fifth parts outline projects at the interface of representation theory and
statistical mechanics. One of the specific directions here is the study of of
limit shapes in integrable models of statistical mechanics. The fourth part of
the project is built of prior results of the PI and the main goal is to give a
description of a full semiclassical asymptotic of eigenfunctions of integrable
systems in terms of Feynman diagrams for the corresponding Poisson sigma
model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
