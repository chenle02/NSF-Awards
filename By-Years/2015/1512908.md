This project develops the rigorous theory of statistical mechanics, the study of
mathematical models, often random in nature and involving many tiny particles or
other bodies, that idealize and exemplify physically interesting phenomena such
as the transitions in microscopic structure undergone by a cube of ice as it
melts into water. The notion of universality plays a fundamental role: certain
mathematical structures emerge from many different random systems when these
systems are viewed on an appropriately large scale in space and time. We will
develop the theory of randomly growing interfaces, where a one-dimensional
surface is growing in a local fashion at random rates while also being subject
to restoring forces such as surface tension.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this
context, the right notion of universality is specified by a stochastic partial
differential equation, the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation. Its late-time and
large-scale behavior models universal aspects of many randomly growing
interfaces. The construction of line ensembles having a natural Gibbs resampling
property whose lowest indexed curve is the fundamental solution of the KPZ
equation is a technique developed in collaboration with Ivan Corwin that marries
integrable systems approaches to probabilistic ideas. The proposal plans to
exploit this new perspective to investigate several phenomena in models in the
KPZ universality class, including aging and decorrelation in Brownian last
passage percolation, and polymer coalescence and tree structure in the Airy
sheet.
