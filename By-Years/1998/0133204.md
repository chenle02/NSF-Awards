This award will be used to compile and analyze a series of annually dated ice
core records and to produce a unique data set capable of yielding sub-annual
snow accumulation records from Greenland. The data set will include multi-
century and multi-decadal records from a variety of sites in Greenland as well
as records from Danish archives and other historical coring
efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following database development, the researchers
will employ multiple statistical and time series analyses techniques to
investigate spatial and temporal relationships in the long-term variability of
annual (and subannual) accumulation from individual sites across the Greenland
Ice Sheet.
