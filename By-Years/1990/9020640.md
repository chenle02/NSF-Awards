The University of North Carolina Educational Computing Service (UNC-ECS)
provides computing and networking services for over forty small educational
institutions including the nineteen institutions participating in this proposal.
The nineteen include thirteen campuses of the University of North Carolina, four
private colleges or universities, the North Carolina School of Science and
Mathematics (a State-funded high school for outstanding students), and the
National Humanities Center. The UNC campuses include five minority institutions.
The UNC-ECS runs a data network which connects through the mid-level network
SURANET to NSFNET. The proposal requests funds to upgrade the network
connections of nine institutions, and provide "NSF recognition" to eight others
to enable them to qualify for reduced annual dues to SURANET. Wake Forest
University and the National Humanities Center, included in the nineteen, do not
participate financially in the proposal. Access to NSFNET provides the faculty
and students with access to supercomputers, data archives, a variety of network
gateways, automated library catalogs, and a wide range of software. Primary
applications include file transfers, electronic mail communication between local
and remote researchers, and remote login to and use of supercomputers and other
research facilities.
