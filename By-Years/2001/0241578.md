This is a renewal of studies of volcanological phenomena at a superfast
spreading mid-ocean ridge, with data from the southern East Pacific Rise.
Mapping and sampling of seven lava flow sequences have been completed and has
revealed that their size, along-axis continuity, internal chemical
heteorgeneity, and relation to other lava sequences within individual ridge
segments has implications for magmatic processes occurring in sub-axial magma
chambers. The processes underlying the production of chemical heterogeneity in
erupted lavas can now be studied, as well as the how the various magmatic
processes operate on inter- and intra-eruption timescales.&lt;br/&gt;
