The Bermuda Biological Station for Research, Inc. is one of the oldest U.S.
marine laboratories. It has had a traditional role of serving U.S. scientists
who could effectively utilize the advantages afforded by its combination of
marine environments, research facilities and accessibility from the U.S. The
resident science programs at the Biolgical Station are currently in a period of
research expansion, such that the availability of laboratory space for visiting
scientists will soon become critically short. The National Science Foundation
funded the construction of the Conklin Laboratory, the main research complex at
the Station, during the 1960's. At the time, the building was designed for the
eventual addition of a third floor of laboratories. This project will provide
cost-shared funding for the construction of this third floor. This floor will
alleviate the space problem which will result from the increasing space
requirements of projects funded by NSF and other agencies.
