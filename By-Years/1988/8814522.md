The great volume and depth of scientific knowledge contained in the published
literature is rapidly becoming available in machine-readable (computerized)
form. This research addresses the issue of how to give a scientist, a biologist,
rapid access to this knowledge through a computer system that behaves very much
like a well-informed colleague, a "Scientist's Assistant". The Assistant answers
questions by returning appropriate text and diagrams, not a list of documents.
Though the approach is comprehensive, two topics are emphasized. Analog
Reasoning which assumes that human knowledge and reasoning is essentially analog
and encyclopedic rather than discrete and formal, and Diagram Understanding
which treats diagrammatic material as a conveyer of information which
complements language in crucial ways. The research uses and develops tools in
artificial intelligence, computer vision, natural language understanding, and
related fields.
