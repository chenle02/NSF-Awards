This three-year project seeks to improve the teaching of geometry in
kindergarten through grade 8 by increasing the quantity and quality of the
geometry that is taught. Each summer, forty teachers from the Baltimore area
will participate in a four-week workshop that integrates instruction in
mathematical content and methodology, especially the use of manipulatives and
educational software. Follow-up activities include four meetings during the
academic year and visits by the project staff to the participants' classrooms.
The evaluation will assess the project's effect on the participants' knowledge
of and attitudes towards geometry and on their teaching practices. The emphasis
on manipulative activities and concrete applications, as well as the focus on
lower grade levels, makes this project especially beneficial for teachers of
minority students. The project represents a collaborative effort by a university
research mathematician, an independent school, and the Baltimore Public Schools.
A majority of the participants will be teachers from schools with large minority
enrollments. The Abell Foundation and the Baltimore Public Schools are
contributing in cost-sharing an amount equal to 19% of the NSF award.
