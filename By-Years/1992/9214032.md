When environmental regulations are proposed by the EPA or other federal
regulatory agencies, both the regulator and regulated, and sometimes third
parties, prepare estimates of the cost of compliance. The purpose of this
research is to analyze the differences between the initial cost estimates before
compliance and the actual costs of compliance. The first part of the project
will analyze the use of cost estimates by the various parties from a theoretical
perspective. The second part, which is the major emphasis of the research,
involves a number of case studies of EPA regulations. In these case studies the
estimated compliance cost made by different parties will be systematically
compared to the actual compliance costs, and any divergence between actual and
estimated costs will be analyzed. This research is important because it should
help to shed light on the suspicion that regulated firms frequently overestimate
cost estimates in an effort to effect regulatory outcomes, while regulatory
agencies and third parties tend to underestimate them.
