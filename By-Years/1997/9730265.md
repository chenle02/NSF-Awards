The central objective of this study is to evaluate the relationship between
childhood economic deprivation and several early adult outcomes, including (1)
the timing and sequencing of family formation, (2) school completion and
socioeconomic attainment, and (3) avoiding antisocial and self-destructive
behaviors and practicing prosocial behaviors. The proposed study uses recent
young adult supplements of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY).
These data will be linked to records from earlier NLSY samples including mother
and family records, adults' assessments of childhood development, and
neighborhood indicators specially created from zip-code addresses provided by
the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the first time. There are three specific
objectives: to use these data to describe and model the economic trajectories of
`at risk` young adults during childhood; to estimate the deleterious effects of
family income trajectories during childhood on critical indicators of successful
adjustment in late adolescence and early adulthood; to evaluate the causal
mechanisms underlying these connections, as well as identify the moderating
influences of neighborhood and family context on successful early adult
transitions. The overriding objective is to bring together several disparate
literatures in a unified theoretical and analytical framework. The study will
provide a unique opportunity to examine the first generation of `at risk` adults
who grew up with the major social and economic upheavals of the past two
decades.
