The modeling, analysis, and design of large flexible space structures with
nonlinear joints will be investigated. Preliminary work performed on sleeve
joints will be extended and pin joint models will be developed. Next, efficient
and accurate analysis methods will be developed based on extensions to the
Galerkin/Newton-Raphson frequency domain method. Finally, the design of
connecting joints for improved damping characteristics will be studied. Both
passive and active design strategies will be explored.
