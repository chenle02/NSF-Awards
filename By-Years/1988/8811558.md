The plan is to develop a fuzzy controller with learning capabilities. The
controller is to be able to upgrade its performance by using non-fuzzy
techniques. The research is to develop a new control technology-fuzzy logic
control. Fuzzy logic and learning theory are used in controlling complex dynamic
processes. The process in this research is a fluidized bed combustion system.
The plan of the research follows: l) develop simple computer model of fluidized
bed combustor (FBC), 2) formulate control policy by interviewing FBC operator,
3) simulate fuzzy logic controller on digital computer, 4) implement fuzzy logic
controller on existing small- scale FBC, 5) compare implementation with
simulation, 6) apply learning control algorithms and conduct tests with new
controller, and 7) compare old controller with new controller.
