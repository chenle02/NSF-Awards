Support is sought to purchase a UNIX-based server to provide storage and
computational support for the Earth Science Laboratory (EESL) within the
Department of Geosciences at Northeastern University (NLU). The EESL is a modern
teaching and research facility which allows users to integrate meteorological,
geological, and geographical data using UNIDATA and geographic information
systems (GIS) software. This request is one of three proposals to establish the
ESSL. In addition to the UNIDATA program, proposals were sent to the State of
Louisiana, private donators and the NSF ILI program. The other (non-UNIDATA)
proposals have been successful. The PIs consider the UNIDATA request as the
final phase of their effort. The server will allow the ESSL to operate
efficiently and be connected to the internet. Using the requested equipment, NLU
plans to act as a second level node to distribute real time data to the UNIDATA
community.
