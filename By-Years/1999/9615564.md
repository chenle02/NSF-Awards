This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at Brandeis University to acquire a 400
MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
including the following: (1) rational design of enzyme inhibitors and studies of
enzyme mechanisms, (2) synthesis and mechanistic studies of biologically active
natural products, (3) structure/function studies of trypsin and mechanistic
studies of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, (4) short syntheses of major
natural products and development of new synthetic reactions, (5) protein
dynamics by NMR and ion pair structure and dynamics, and (6) total synthesis of
biologically active natural products. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation
of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances,
characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-
art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier
research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such as
polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
