Qualitative modeling and simulation methods provide the ability to express
incomplete knowledge of the structure and initial state of a mechanism, and to
derive useful predictions about its possible behaviors. This capability is of
major significance for model.based reasoning in diagnosis, design, and
decision.making. The proposed work builds on the investigator's prior
development of the QSIM representation and algorithm for qualitative simulation.
In the model.simulation area, the new work focuses on these problems: (1) the
interpretation of quantitative data in terms of qualitative predictions; (2)
representing qualitative behaviors as trajectories in a qualitative phase space,
allowing application of more powerful mathematical methods; and (3) hierarchical
structuring methods, such as abstraction of mechanisms by relative time.scale,
to deal with complex mechanisms. In the model.building area, the investigation
concerns automatic methods for building qualitative models, focusing on two
major issues: (1) the selection, from potentially vast library of tangentially
relevant descriptions, of a small set of descriptions to incorporate into a
useful model; and (2) reasoning with the limits of the model, to know when it is
useful, and combining conclusions from multiple models.
