An Advanced Computer Graphics Laboratory equipped with fast, large memoried,
high resolution graphics computers is used for a variety of undergraduate
courses. Recent developments in remote sensing involve techniques of digital
image processing. These techniques require instrumentation which has a
reasonably large data storage capacity, and is capable of performing large
numbers of computations relatively rapidly. Database systems can incorporate
images into text files which can be constructed for visual search routines. Such
files are used for teaching in the fields of biology and criminal justice,
particularly for endemic Chihuahuan Desert insect species and fingerprint
analysis. Social, political, and other classes employ statistical techniques
which require rapid analysis of large volumes of data. The grantee provides
funds for this project that are an equal match for the NSF award.
