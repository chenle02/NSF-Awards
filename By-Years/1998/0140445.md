The investigator studies the theory of algebraic cobordism, recently constructed
by the investigor and F. Morel, as well as generalized cohomology theories for
algebraic varieties and schemes, the relation of rational equivalence in the
Morel-Voevodsky algebraic-homotopy category, and a refinement of Asakura's
arithmetic Hodge cohomology. The investigator attempts to construct a theory of
higher algebraic cobordism, along the lines of Bloch's higher Chow groups,
examines the category of cobordism motives, and tries to give a theory of
algebraic higher elliptic genera. In addition, the investigator examines the
generalization of the motivic cohomology to K-theory spectral sequence to other
cohomology theories on algebraic varieties, and considers the relationship of
this spectral sequence to the slice spectral sequence of Voevodsky, using the
notion of rational equivalence in the algebraic homotopy category. Finally the
investigator defines a variation of Asakura's arithmetic Hodge cohomology and
uses this to construct an infinite sequence of cohomology theories which
conjecturely give a better and better approximation to motivic cohomology.

The investigator's research involves a mixture of algebraic geometry and
algebraic topology. Algebraic geometry is the study of solutions of equations
using both algebra and geometry. For example, one can study a circle by
examining its equation, or by looking at its geometric properties. Algebraic
topology studies spaces by attaching algebraic invariants to them, invariants
which can often be computed explicitly. The investigator takes methods and
constructions in algebraic topology, and then modifies and refines them so that
they can be used to define algebraic versions of the topological invariants.
These new algebraic invariants are then applicable for studying subtle
properties of solutions of equations.
