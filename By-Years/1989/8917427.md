Denitrification is a key process in the nitrogen cycle, which controls the
amount of nitrogen available for plant growth. It is estimated that up to 30% of
fertilizer nitrogen is lost via denitrification. The pathway by which nitrate is
reduced to gaseous nitrogen is still not known in detail, but nitrite and
nitrous oxide have been identified as free intermediates, and there appear to be
two routes from NO2 - to N2O, one direct and the other via NO. The object of the
proposed research is to elucidate the pathway(s) by which NO2 - is converted to
N2O. The major questions to be answered are how NO2 - is reduced by the heme cd1
and copper-containing nitrite reductases, how NO is reduced to N2O by nitric
oxide reductase, and what factors control the relative flux via the two routes
from NO2 - to N2O in vivo. A multifaceted approach to the problem is described,
combining chemical and biological studies, and focussing on the mechanism by
which the N-N bond of N2O is formed. Specific techniques to be employed include
isotopic labelling experiments; kinetics studies; cryoenzymological and
spectroscopic studies of the purified enzymes; and electron microscopy. Specific
systems to be examined include whole cells and cell-free extracts of selected
wild-type denitrifying bacteria and appropriate mutants, as well as purified
nitrite reductase and crude nitric oxide reductase preparations.
