The instrumentation requested will strengthen experimental approaches to
environmental biology. The automated toxicity bioassay using bioluminescent
bacteria and the computer controlled respirometer requested will bring recent
advances in environmental research capability into the undergraduate laboratory.
Introductory biology students will operate in small research groups and play an
active role designing the experimental approach used to answer meaningful
scientific questions and thus gain a larger sense of what it means to do modern
science. Once introduced to advanced instruments as freshman, students can
employ them with increasing sophistication in intermediate and advanced courses.
Toxicity tests on heavy metals provide the context for examination of general
dose response curves and synergistic effects of other environmental variables on
toxicity. Respiration measurements will allow freshmen to explore the effects of
temperature on metabolism. Advanced students will conduct an intensive
investigation into physiological responses of estuarine animals to hypoxia and
anoxia, simulating low oxygen levels typically found in the Chesapeake Bay.
