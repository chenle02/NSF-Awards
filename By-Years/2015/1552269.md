This project will use an 8-year data set from the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter
Radar (PFISR) to investigate the climatology and variability of high-latitude
lower thermospheric winds. The analysis will address questions of the relative
contribution of energy and momentum transfer from different sources. A long-term
database of wind profiles will be developed and made available to the community
to be used for testing of complex models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will
advance the understanding of ion-neutral coupling and energy, mass and momentum
transfer between the magnetosphere, thermosphere, and atmosphere, and will
investigate auroral effects on lower thermospheric winds. Case studies will be
used to examine events of strong atmospheric or auroral forcing. The long-term
data base will provide information about trends in lower thermospheric winds and
which forcing mechanisms are most responsible for long-term variability.
