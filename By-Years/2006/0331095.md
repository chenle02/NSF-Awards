A grant has been awarded to Dr. Derek Taylor and Dr. William Piel at the State
University of New York at Buffalo to study and train new scientists in the
biology, classification, and evolution of two families of water fleas (daphniids
and bosminids). Although water fleas are model organisms in ecology and
toxicology, the biodiversity of these crustaceans is poorly known. Also,
scientists are often unable to identify accurately the species under study
because of poor literature and a shortage of living experts. To remedy this
situation, the PI's aim to apply their expertise in water flea biology,
morphology, DNA analysis, and bioinformatics to produce modern taxonomic studies
of water fleas and train new experts. Hypotheses for understanding processes
that affect species and genetic diversity, such as the transfer of genes among
species by hybridization, will also be tested. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's
expect that an improved detailed biological framework for water fleas will have
broad use in industry, education, government, and scientific research. These
crustaceans are some of the most important subjects for freshwater toxicology
and for understanding the environmental effects of human activities on lakes and
wetlands. Indeed, filter-feeding water fleas are among the only known animals
that can clear pollution-caused algal blooms in lakes. Moreover, water fleas are
a critical part of freshwater ecosystems as most freshwater fish species and
many bird species depend on water fleas as a significant source of food. In
addition to the above goals, the PI's will produce a web site targeting high
school students so as to cultivate interest in the biology of water fleas. Two
graduate students will be trained in the systematics and taxonomy of these
crustaceans. Finally, international collaborations will be fostered and at least
one expert from an under-represented group will be trained. &lt;br/&gt;
