With the advice and recommendations of its Business Advisory Council, the
Convergence Technology Center determined the knowledge and skills required by
technicians who work with systems that combine voice, video, data, and images
over one secure network. The Center forecasted the hiring needs of regional and
local industry and created awareness of the career opportunities and developed
curriculum to educate over 400 faculty and 2000 students. The Center began to
mentor other community colleges developing convergence technology programs. The
Center now extends its work to reach 18 other community colleges. The new
activities include recruiting and retaining especially Hispanic students
presently underrepresented in the technology workforce. The curriculum and
professional development is expanded to include Green information technology
especially as it relates to decreasing the energy consumption of technology. The
evaluation conducted by an external evaluator investigates the effectiveness of
the curriculum, including hybrid courses, the impact of the professional
development, the increase in the minority students in the program, and the
changes in the mentored colleges.
