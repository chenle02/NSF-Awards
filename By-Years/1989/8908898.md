Technological and economic changes are making it practical to configure computer
systems with larger and larger main memories. The availability of large memories
will affect the design of applications running on these systems. This project
focuses on one common and important application, namely transaction processing
systems. A preliminary version of System M, a testbed transaction processing
system designed from scratch for a large memory environment has been
implemented. Currently, System M assumes that a complete copy of the database
resides in volatile main memory. This assumption will be modified and System M
enhanced to take advantage of the complete storage environment that can be
expected for future transaction processing systems. This environment will
include large amounts of main memory, non-volatile main memory, and slower non-
volatile media such as magnetic and optical disks. The techniques envisioned for
System M are intended to maximize the system's performance (given a particular
storage environment) by dynamically placing data on storage media appropriate to
their use. System M will be used to demonstrate empirically the usefulness of
these techniques. In addition, System M will be useful for empirical studies of
other aspects of transaction processing (e.g., concurrency controls) on large
memories, and as a tool for validation of performance models.
