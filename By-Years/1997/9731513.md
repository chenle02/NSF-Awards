9731513 Mulchandani This project is to develop a novel approach for the
biodegradation of organophosphorous nerve agents based on the application of
"live" biocatalysts with organophosphorous hydrolase (OPH) and cellulose binding
domain protein (CPD) displayed onto the cell surface in immobilized cell
bioreactors, and to demonstrate the feasibility of using this technology for
large-scale detoxification of nerve agents. Specific objectives are to: 1)
Illustrate that the coexpression of OPH and CPD onto the cell surface affords
very tight binding of the live biocatalysts to cellulosic materials; 2)
Determine the optimal ratio of surface-displayed OPH and CPD for detoxification
and immobilization; 3) Select the appropriate cellulose immobiliztion matrix for
immobilizing large numbers of OPH expressing cells tightly and for use in a flow
through immobilized cell biorector; and 4) Develop batch and continuous
immobilized cell bioreactorsbaed on the optimized "live" biocatalysts and
selected cellulose immobilization supports for detoxification of organophosphate
nerve agents. ***
