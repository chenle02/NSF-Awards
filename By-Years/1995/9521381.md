9521381 Locke This project is on research to develop and characterize new, nano-
structured porous media for improved separations of biological macromolecules by
electrophoresis or chromatography. Hydrogels with tailored internal channels or
pores having defined diameters in the range from approximately 2 to several
nanometers will be created by using semi-rigid rod-like polyions or amphiphiles
(surfactants) that form lyotropic liquid crystalline phases to template the
internal structure. Both isotropic and anisotropic channelized (hence nano-
structured) media will be prepared. The specific aims of this research include:
(1) synthesis of several classes of nano-structured hydrogels; (2) development
and application of new methods for characterizing the internal pore structures
of hydrogels; (3) measurement of size exclusion limits and transport properties
(electrophoretic and diffusive) of molecules within structured and conventional
hydrogels; and (4) modeling molecular transport in conventional and structured
gels. ***
