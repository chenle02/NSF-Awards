This proposal concerns linear programming in a broad sense. The long- term
objectives of this proposal are a better understanding of the computational
characteristics of existing linear programming methodology, improvement of the
methodology, and extension of its applicability. The proposal has several
immediate objectives: further development of work on the abstract foundations of
linear programming and linear programming duality theory; the study of specially
structured classes of linear programming problems, including the development and
analysis of efficient algorithms for their solution; the exploitation of linear
programming methodology in the solution, or approximate solution, of large
instances of hard combinatorial optimization problems.
