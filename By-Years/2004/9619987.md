This award provides partial support for a two-day workshop on record linkage in
Washington, D.C. on 20-21 March 1997. The workshop is sponsored by the Committee
on Applied and Theoretical Statistics of the National Academy of Sciences, the
Washington Statistical Society, the Bureau of the Census, the National
Agricultural Statistical Service, and the National Center for Health Statistics.
The whole concept of data sharing is broad-based and pervasive; consequently,
many different governmental agencies as well as the private sector will benefit
from this workshop. Since the only previous major U.S. record linkage workshop
(in 1985), much has been accomplished, especially in recent years, and new areas
of related research have arisen. A sampling of these which the conference will
spotlight includes the increased privacy concerns due to record linkage, the
growing importance of more efficient use of statistical resources by using
record linkage, heightened interest in linkage technology due to debates such as
health care reform, issues in physical security of data, and the measurement of
nondisclosure and reidentification risks in public use microdata files.
Proceedings of the conference will capture the invited presentations as well as
summarize discussions and suggest research challenges for the next decade.
