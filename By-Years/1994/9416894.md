9416894 Carton In this project, the PI will continue studies of interannual
changes in the upper thermocline waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Previous work has
focused on determining the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) in the tropical
Atlantic, including effects of rainfall and runoff. In this follow-on, the PI
will focus on the role of wind stress and other surface forcing parameters, on
SST, with particular emphasis on the tropics for the three decades of the 1960's
through the 1980's, using a primitive equation model. An important question is
to include effects of upper ocean salinity. Results will further clarify issues
of both modeling and air temperature and precipitation over both Africa and
Brazil. The assimilation package to be developed will be a useful contribution
to the field of ocean modeling. ***
