9613588 Sweeney Streamside Reforestation: An analysis of ecological benefits and
societal perceptions. Streamside forests are recommended as a land use practice
to protect aquatic ecosystems by removing inputs of nutrients, sediments, and
toxic contaminants. This project views streamside forests as the primary
regulator of stream width: small forested streams are wider than meadow reaches.
The alteration of stream width that results from deforestation profoundly
influences the stream ecosystem, both locally and downstream through effects on
habitat and water quality. Policies to restore streamside forests will require
both documentation of ecological benefits and an understanding of societal
factors affecting their implementation. Objectives are to: (I) understand the
relationship between forest buffers, width, and stream ecosystem condition; (ii)
develop data bases that can help guide forest restoration policies; and (iii)
quantify social and economic issues affecting streamside forest restoration. The
ultimate goal is to bring natural and social science components into focus for
decision makers.
