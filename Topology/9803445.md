9803445 Bonahon The leading theme of this project is the study of rigidity
problems for hyperbolic structures on 3-manifolds. In particular, it aims at
proving that the geometry of a 3-dimensional hyperbolic convex hull is
completely determined by partial data on the geometry of its boundary. The
project also involves several connected problems on hyperbolic and euclidean
cone manifolds, and on a generalization of curves on a surface called geodesic
laminations. These problems are of interest by themselves, but they are also a
laboratory for developing and testing new technical tools for application to a
wider range of problems in low-dimensional geometry. It is anticipated that a
solution to these problems will deepen our understanding of hyperbolic geometry
in low dimensions and have applications to other branches of mathematics as
well. The project will study several geometric problems on 3-manifolds, namely
on spaces of dimension 3. Twenty years ago, revolutionary developments in the
field of low-dimensional topology showed that hyperbolic (non-euclidean)
geometry was a very powerful tool to analyze the topology of 3-manifolds. This
breakthrough also led to the establishment of unexpected connections between
low-dimensional topology and other branches of mathematics, such as differential
geometry, complex analysis and dynamical systems. ***
