This proposal supports participation of doctoral students from U.S. universities
in the ninth SIGART/AAAI Doctoral Consortium to be held July 25-26, 2004 in San
Jose, CA., in conjunction with the 19th National Conference on Artificial
Intelligence (AAAI-04), July, 25-29, 2004. The Doctoral Consortium aims to: (1)
provide a setting for feedback on participants' current research and guidance on
future research directions; (2) develop a supportive community of scholars and a
spirit of collaborative research; (3) support a new generation of researchers;
and (4) contribute to the conference through interaction with other researchers
at the conference. The Doctoral Consortium will aim to recruit and include
students from under-represented groups (e.g., women and under-represented
minorities) and smaller schools or schools with less established programs in
artificial intelligence. Each student will give a 25-minute presentation to be
followed by 20 minutes of discussion lead by a faculty participant. In addition,
each student will have a one-on-one meeting with the faculty participant. There
will also be a panel to discuss career issues in both academic and other career
pathways.
