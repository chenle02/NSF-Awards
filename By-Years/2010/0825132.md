OISE-0825132&lt;br/&gt;Searson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A high quality international
research experience is a key component in training multidisciplinary scientists
and engineers for the global economy. This International Research Experience for
Students (IRES) program teams Johns Hopkins University (JHU) with the Inter-
university MicroElectronics Centre (IMEC) in Belgium. JHU undergraduate and
graduate students will have the opportunity to work at IMEC?s world class
microfabrication facilities. A central feature of this IRES program is the focus
on multidisciplinary, collaborative nano-bio research projects involving JHU and
IMEC researchers.
