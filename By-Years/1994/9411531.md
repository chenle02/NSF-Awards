The Rochester group will pursue a program of research related to improving the
sensitivity of acoustic gravitational wave detectors. They will concentrate on
improving electromechanical transducers to extract signals from antennas. They
will also explore technology needed for greatly improved detectors of the
future. This work will contribute to the ongoing efforts around the world to
seek gravitational waves predicted by Einstein to come from cataclysmic
astronomical events throughout the universe.
