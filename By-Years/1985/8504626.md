This research deals with the codes currently used to perform neutronic analysis
of the nuclear reactor core and the use of enhanced vectorization capabilities
of the supercomputer to the analysis. The first phase of the work is to
determine the most efficient manner of solving the core neutronics problem using
the supercomputer. Specifically, computer code SIMULATE is used as a means of
investigating and developing the necessary vectorized algorithms for the core
neutronic problem. Optimization techniques follow. Models are developed to solve
the reactor assembly assignment and control the poison distribution problem.
