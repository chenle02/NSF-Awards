A thorough investigation of componene-oriented programming
languages&lt;br/&gt;is undertaken that entails (a) designing a component-
oriented language,&lt;br/&gt;(b) implementing it efficiently on modern computer
architectures, and&lt;br/&gt;(c) ensuring its applicability through case
studies.&lt;br/&gt;Design of the new language entails evaluating the suitability
of&lt;br/&gt;existing programming-language concepts for component-
oriented&lt;br/&gt;programming, specifying and evaluating new programming-
language&lt;br/&gt;features, and integrating the new and the old into a coherent
new&lt;br/&gt;language. Implementation involves assessing existing
compiler&lt;br/&gt;technology, proposing, building, and evaluating new
compiler&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms, and merging them into an efficient compiler and
runtime&lt;br/&gt;system. Finally, to ensure the language's applicability, a
variety of&lt;br/&gt;case studies are designed and implemented and the resulting
systems&lt;br/&gt;compared to more traditional solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
