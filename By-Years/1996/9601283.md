9601283 Kolesar A high-vacuum, thin-film deposition system and a microelectronic
integrated circuit (IC) photolithographic mask aligner with a sub-micron
resolution capability will be purchased. Both instruments are fundamental to the
well established technology of microelectronic device fabrication and the
emerging field of microelectromechanical sensors and actuators. The acquisition
of these two instruments will facilitate accomplishing a long-term micosensor
research thrust by the principal investigator, three senior faculty research
personnel, and a team of engineering students who master their functionality in
a related microelectronic device fabrication research oriented laboratory
experience. The scientific and engineering goal of this research project is to
synergistically integrate the well-established technology of integrated circuit
microelectronics with the emerging field of micromachining to design, fabricate,
characterize, and optimize the performance of a complete microdynamical chemical
analysis gas chromatography + dielectric and ion mobility spectroscopy
(GC+D&amp;IMS) system that is the microscale derivative of its conventional,
large-scale, analytical chemistry, laboratory counterpart. Successful
accomplishment of this research will significantly advance the comprehensive
goal of using autonomous microsensors to selectively detect and monitor the
concentrations of a host of atmospheric environmental pollutants. By leveraging
the inherent cost-effective advantages of IC fabrication techniques, the
micromachined GC system will emerge as an advanced analytical chemistry tool
with numerous applications in environmental, commercial and military settings.
