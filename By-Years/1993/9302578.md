9302578 Diebold A multichannel seismic survey of two areas in the Caribbean will
be carried out to study the structure and the genesis and tectonic development
of the Carribean Plate. The deep structure of the Venezuela Basin contains clues
necessary to understand the tectonic evolution and the structure of the Beata
Ridge is important for the understanding of how the Caribbean has accomodated
the stresses that have resulted in differential strain and plate movements. High
resolution, deep-penetrating multichannel seismic data will be collected to
resolve these issues. ***
