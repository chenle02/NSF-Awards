Photochemical syntheses and treatment technologies have the potential to replace
traditional chemical methods which suffer from high environmental cost. However,
a fundamental problem in the use of light energy for chemical processing
concerns excitation inhomogeneity. High reaction rates at the reactor/light
source interface can lead to filming, secondary photolysis, chain termination,
and low yields. A new type of photochemical reactor, the Photo-Spray Reactor, is
proposed to provide a major advance in photochemical technology. This innovation
achieves `walless` excitation, optical homogeneity, and excellent mass transfer
rates at gas/liquid interfaces. This Phase I feasibility program tests a bench-
scale Photo-Spray reactor on two processes: VUV photodegradation of aqueous
pollutants, and cyclo-addition of diphenylacetylene to benzothiophene. It will
ultimately address the prospects of using the Photo-Spray reactor concept for
previously unattainable photochemical conversions.
