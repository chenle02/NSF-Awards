This award will support collaborative research in singularity theory and
bifurcation theory between Dr. James Damon, University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill and Dr. I. N. Stewart, Mathematics Institute, University of Warwick,
Coventry, England. The mathematics required for the understanding of nonlinear
problems has undergone an enormous development in the past twenty years. A key
ingredient in this progress has been the introduction of the ideas and
techniques of singularity theory in analyzing nonlinear problems in various
areas of mathematics, as well as physics and chemistry. In recognition of this
development, the Mathematical Institute of the University of Warwick is
sponsoring, during the 1988-89 academic year, a special year on "Singularity
Theory and Bifurcation Theory". Dr. Damon is a leading researcher in the
important area of analysis of singularities of mappings. This award will allow
Dr. Damon to spend the 1988-1989 academic year at the University of Warwick,
carrying out collaborative work on topological properties of bifurcation
problems, finite map germs and nonlinear problems.
