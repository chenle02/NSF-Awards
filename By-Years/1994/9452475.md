9452475 Poston This proposal is to enhance the laboratory experience for
undergraduate students in Biology and Biochemistry, utilizing the BioQUEST
Library of computer simulation/modeling and tools including text and hypertext
modules. BioQUEST modules are structured within a framework that focuses science
education on collaborative, open-ended inquiry. The problem-posing, problem-
solving, and peer persuasion approach will permit students in the undergraduate
Evolution, Ecology and Biochemistry courses to investigate problems, construct
experiments and test potential solutions using simulation models. These courses
are currently taught without a laboratory experience or, in the case of Ecology,
a limited field/laboratory component. Neither the Biology or Biochemistry
department has the computer equipment to integrate the BioQUEST Library into the
instructional process. Howard University is the leading minority institution in
this country and a high percentage of its students are female. Given the
projected needs for much higher minority and female workers in scientific and
technical fields, support of this project could have a significant impact in
helping to supply the needs of the job market in coming decades, while assisting
minority and women students in attaining their careers goals.
