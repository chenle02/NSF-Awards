ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;09 August 2011&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
1119817&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences&lt;br/&gt;PI:
N. Bates&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: R. Harelstad&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal
requests five Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) items for the R/V
ATLANTIC EXPLORER operated by the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS);
namely hydraulic system evaluations, an engine monitoring and alarm system, an
oily water separator, a digital power meter, and RVSS Appendix B analysis of the
stern A-frame and deck bolting pattern. These items will either improve safety
or enhance the vessel?s science support capabilities.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The R/V ATLANTIC EXPLORER supports
federally funded scientific research throughout the Atlantic basin to expand
human knowledge of the ocean environment. The vessel also conducts the routine
servicing of the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) moorings. During
operations, graduate and undergraduate students are routinely exposed to
seagoing oceanography through real-time satellite connectivity from ship to
shore, and open house events. All told, the ATLANTIC EXPLORER is scheduled to
complete 155 NSF sponsored days in 2011.
