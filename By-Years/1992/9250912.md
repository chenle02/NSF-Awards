Two new interdisciplinary courses which make use of a fluorescence
spectrophotometer are being developed. One of these is a year-long laboratory
course designed to provide students with experience in biochemistry, molecular
biology, and cell biology; the second is a biophysical measurements course
designed to encourage student understanding of instrumental methods of measuring
the molecular parameters governing all biological processes. The fluorometer is
also being used for experiments involving organic, analytical, natural products,
physical measurements, and instrumental analysis. Undergraduate research
projects involving the study of the structure and function of myosin, a
contractile protein, and other multidisciplinary undergraduate research projects
involving faculty from the chemistry and biology departments, make use of the
fluorometer.
