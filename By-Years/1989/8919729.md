The objective of this research is to understand the principles which regulate
the regeneration of mammalian brain cells, specifically hypothalamic
neurosecretory neurons. Intact neural pituitary lobes of donor animals will be
transplanted into surgically interrupted hypothalamic-pituitary tracts of a
group of experimental host animals. Another group of host animals, used as
controls, will receive transplants of damaged pituitary glands. Differences
between the results obtained in the two groups, analyzed with morphological and
biochemical techniques, should lead to the isolation of substances which are
unique for the functional regeneration of neurosecretory neurons.
