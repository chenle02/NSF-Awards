Abstract (0422278) - Sims&lt;br/&gt;Currently there are very few U-series data
from slow-spread spreading ridges and such data are critical to better
understanding the global systematics of 238U- 230Th disequilibria and other
isotopic systems in mid-ocean ridge basalts. The goal of this research is to
measure (and compile) Nd, Sr, Pb and Hf isotopic compositions and U-Th-Ra and
U-Pa disequilibria in a suite of samples from the shallow, slow-spreading
Kolbeinsey ridge and from the Tjorne Fracture Zone, north of Iceland. Samples to
be analyzed have already been collected and have been previously characterized
for major- and trace element compositions by others. It is anticipated that the
combined U-series, major and trace-element and isotopic data will allow us to
better understand melt generation and transport processes beneath the Kolbeinsey
Ridge and other slow-spreading mid-ocean ridges, and to assess the extent to
which U-series disequilibria (and other trace-element fractionations) are
controlled by melting processes and/or source heterogeneities. Data from slow
spreading ridges will be compared with those from the fast spreading East
Pacific Rise and others mid-ocean ridge systems to evaluate: (1) whether U-Th
disequilibria is correlated with axial depth as has been observed for deep and
intermediate depth ridges; (2) if data from individual ridge segments show a
relationship between axial spreading rate and their slope on Th isochron plots
and, it so, does the relationship require mixing of enriched and depleted mantle
sources; and (3) whether the Iceland Plume influence the Kolbeinsey
Ridge&lt;br/&gt; Broader impacts of the proposed study are the support of a
female PhD student, international collaboration with three overseas
laboratories, collaboration between modelers and analytical geochemists, and
improved measurement techniques and better-calibrated Th isotopic standards
which are critical for many solid Earth and oceanographic applications that use
238U-230Th disequilibria data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
