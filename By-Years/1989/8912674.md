In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Physical Chemistry Program
of the Chemistry Division, Professor Ermler will study relativistic effects on
the bonding and spectroscopic properties of molecules and clusters containing
heavy elements. Relativistic effective core potentials will be derived for
lanthanide and actinide elements using computer programs that incorporate two-
component atomic spinor basis sets and intermediate angular momentum coupling
with configuration interaction. Defects, vacancies, electronic states,
geometries, energies, and surface properties of Group IIA elements and of
semiconductor clusters containing Pb, Bi, and I will be studied. The work will
be coordinated with experimental scanning tunnelling microscopy and optical
absorption spectroscopy of evaporated colloidal suspensions.
