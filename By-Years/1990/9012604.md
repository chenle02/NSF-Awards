In this project, the P.I. will study the nonlinear dynamics of the ocean general
circulation, using an approach suggested from the theory of equilibrium
statistical mechanics. The study will directly address the role of inertial
aspects of the circulation. Focus will be on extending the model of barotropic
circulation to include baroclinic effects, and carrying out a theoretical and
numerical study of the baroclinic case.
