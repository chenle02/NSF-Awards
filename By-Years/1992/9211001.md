The engineering community needs efficient algorithms for solving global
optimization problems in design. Global optimization problems require minimizing
a function possessing multiple local minima. A practical example is finding the
optimal design of a composite laminated stiffened panel used in aircraft
structures. This research has three objectives. The first is to develop a random
search algorithm that includes both integer and continuous variables. A
simulated annealing algorithm for mixed integer/continuous global optimization
will be developed, because simulated annealing has already demonstrated some
effectiveness in both the integer domain and the continuous domain. The second
is to take advantage of estimates of a Lipschitz constant in the optimization
algorithm. The third is to decrease an algorithm's probability of getting
trapped in a local minimum that is not the global minimum. Together these
objectives will improve algorithms in a manner that will make formulating and
solving global optimization problems more practical and accessible to engineers.
The results will be applicable to aspects of design in all engineering
disciplines.
