9450018 Steinfeld Women in the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences,
SUNY- Stony Brook, together with colleagues throughout the University, local
industry, Brookhaven National Laboratory and three large Suffolk County School
districts will work together on this project. In a multi-pronged effort to
demonstrably affect 100 6th and 7th grade middle school students activities
include: year-round, campus, local school and community-based components, led by
trained EPWG Clud Advisors; linking distinguished scientists, mathematicians and
engineers with clubs through an "Adopt-a-Club" modality; offering a
mentor/mentee semester-long experience; teacher-training and curriculum
enhancement for middle school staff; and parent empowerment through an EPWG
Parent Advisory Council. Broad goals are: to foster a positive climate of "women
to women" to sustain the young women's interest, curiosity and achievement in
order that they might pursue viable careers in SEM; to utilize a multi-
disciplinary approach that integrates science, math and technology; to affect
curriculum development and enhancement, as well as teacher-training; to harness
community, industry, school district and University interest to successfully
intervene with young women to present a model for dissemination through
journals, associations, a video presentation and other publicity. ***
