This research project will investigate the effects of security threats and
death-related thoughts on our decision-making processes. Specifically, the
following research questions will be addressed: (1) how do events that threaten
our security and remind us of our mortality affect perceptions of the fairness
of policies that diminish civil liberties; and (2) how do security threats and
death-related thoughts affect the relationship between one's fairness
perceptions and later judgments about policies, authorities, and institutions?
These questions are particularly important in light of the recent trend
following 9/11, whereby Americans appear more willing to defer without
reservation to authorities' imposition of severe restrictions on civil
liberties, with very little opportunity for public comment and discussion. This
trend runs counter to numerous psychological social justice studies, which show
that individuals consider it fairer and are more satisfied when they are allowed
meaningful input into policies that affect them. In addition, these judgments of
fairness and satisfaction have important implications for citizens' commitment
to and perceptions of the legitimacy of institutions and authorities. On the
other hand, this trend is consistent with studies of terror management, which
show that when individuals are forced to contemplate their own mortality, they
embrace others whom they perceive to be defenders of their cultural worldview
and place greater emphasis on core values such as national
security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A series of studies will examine factors that
influence individuals' willingness to defer to authorities and tolerate policies
that limit individual rights and freedoms under experimental conditions where
half of the participants are forced to contemplate their own death. University
students will be administered questionnaires and asked to indicate (1) their
reactions to university policy changes that limit rights and freedoms in
response to a major or minor security threat, (2) their evaluations of the
institutional authorities who impose those changes, and (3) their commitment to
the institution. Participants confronted with their own mortality are expected
to be more tolerant of policies, more positive in their evaluations of
authorities and more committed to institutions, as well as less concerned about
the opportunity for public comment and discussion than those who are not
confronted with thoughts about their own death, especially in response to a
major security threat.
