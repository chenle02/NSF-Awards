This project will support research in the area of nonlinear dispersive systems,
in particular, the nonlinear Schrodinger equation and the Zakharov equation. The
research will be focused in four areas: (1) nonlinear scattering and stability,
(2) singularity formation and nucleation for the nonlinear Schrodinger equation
and Zakharov systems, (3) dispersion of low energy solutions of equations
arising in the mathematical description of the propagation of long waves, and
(4) parametric resonance in Hamiltonian systems and the effect of dissipation.
Nonlinear wave phenomena arise in physical systems ranging from the quantum
level to the large scale motion of fluids in oceans. Problems in nonlinear waves
can be studied using various techniques: analytical, formal asymptotics, and
computer simulations.
