Computers permeate all socio-economic activities of our times. The limitations
of our present silicon-based computational power are no longer residing in the
far future. The topic of this award is one that is relevant to finding new
directions for future computation, while at the same time enlarging our
understanding of physical systems suitable for quantum computing. The research
will address fundamental science questions, such as whether topological states
of matter can store, at non-zero temperatures, quantum (qubit) or classical
(bit) elements of information. The research activities will be accompanied by
educational efforts at three different levels: The PIs will provide solid
education and training to graduate students in the field of quantum information;
they will develop undergraduate courses at the interface between physics and
computer science; and they will use their expertise to help develop the "Future
of Information" module for techCAMP, a program directed towards middle-school
and high-school teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Encoding information in
topological states of certain many-particle systems has been proposed as robust
way to store quantum information. In these systems, the ground state is not
unique and its multiplicity is not altered by local perturbations. As a result,
when used to encode information, topological qubits are less susceptible to
errors than standard qubits. Although protected from static perturbations, it is
still uncertain how effective topological quantum memories are in the presence
of dynamical perturbations. The proposed research addresses two important
aspects of this issue. The first concerns the study of loss of coherence in
realistic setups, where both equilibrium and non-equilibrium noise must be
considered. The second is whether topological quantum memories in the presence
of thermal fluctuations are attainable in physically realizable systems.
Building on these investigations, the goal is to find ways to improve fault
tolerance in topological quantum information processing.
