The determination of the bulk transport properties of composite and porous media
is studied using both theoretical and computer-simulation techniques. Properties
of interest include the diffusion coefficient associated with flow past fixed
inclusions, thermal conductivity of composite and porous media, and the fluid
permeability of porous media. Moreover, many of the general techniques and
results employed here apply as well to the related problem of determining the
elastic moduli of composite and porous media. It is desired to predict the
effective properties for a broad class of microstructures and for a wide range
of phase property values and volume fractions.
