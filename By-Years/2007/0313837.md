This project creates a computer forensics course and supporting laboratory,
which enables undergraduate and graduate students at Iowa State University to
obtain knowledge and skills in this important area. Further, the laboratory
supports graduate and faculty research and provide a test-bed facility in which
new tools and forensic procedures can be tested. The information assurance
faculty at Iowa State currently support about 12 regularly offered graduate
courses in network and systems security, however we do not offer studies in
forensics. The need for such a course and laboratory coupled with recent hires
of faculty in this area, has motivated this proposal. All course materials, lab
experiments, and lessons learned will be shared with faculty from any interested
University.
