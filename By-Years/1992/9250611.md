The Department of Mathematics, Physical and Computer Sciences is acquiring work
stations, each including a 80486 based computer and data acquisition equipment.
The laboratory is to be located in a specially configured room using the
standard model of a science exploratorium and incorporating into it a strong
mathematics component. This exploratorium permits the offering of some paired
sections of physics and calculus where the emphasis is on the study of physical
phenomena. The facility provides faculty the tools to present models and have
students participate in making modifications thereto. When used as an open lab,
it gives students an area in close proximity to mentors and the necessary
equipment for their work on independent projects and assignments. The
configuration of the room enables an instructor to see all displays from the
front and provides each student with individual computer space and work space.
Further, the exploratorium provides a place in which to demonstrate the on-going
curriculum changes to full time department members and to the numerous adjunct
faculty.
