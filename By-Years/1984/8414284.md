There is an increasing need for a methodology for safety and performance
evaluation of critical structures in which loads combinations effects are
important. In many cases, dynamic loads to which a structure is subjected are
stochastic in time and space. Their individual and combined effects on the
reliability of structures are not easy to assess. This project investigates the
probabilistic methods for load combination analysis and design. The study will
emphasize the application of the methodologies developed to design. The major
research tasks include: development of methods for design based on structural
optimization, development of computationally efficient first and higher order
methods for nonlinear combination problems, and evaluation of current design
methods and development of alternative design formula.
