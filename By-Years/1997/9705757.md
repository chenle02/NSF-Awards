Verbistky will investigate systematically an important class of superlinear
integral and partial differential equations which serve as model problems in
nonlinear analysis and also are common in applications. Verbitsky will combine a
number of analytic techniques including discrete (wavelet-type) decompositions
of linear and nonlinear operators, weighted norm inequalities with iterated
weights and good control of the imbedding constants, quasi-metrics associated
with Green's kernels, refined 3G-inequalities and nonlinear potential theory. An
expected new development is that arbitrary nonnegative coefficients at the lower
order terms and data can be handled without any a priori regularity assumptions.
Essential to this approach is an introduction of new function spaces
intrinsically associated with nonlinear problems, identification of their
preduals and establishing basic imbedding theorems. Exact pointwise estimates of
solutions and their gradients up to the boundary could be extremely valuable in
applied problems. The proposed research develops new applications for modern
methods of harmonic analysis and potential theory which previously were used
extensively in linear analysis. Nonlinear techniques lead to more accurate
mathematical models and numerical estimates for differential and integral
equations with singular coefficients and data. They describe many environmental
and technological phenomena with nonlinear sources, and are widely used in the
studies of heat transfer, fluid flow, control theory, and stochastic processes.
