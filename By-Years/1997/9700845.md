9700845 Wang The objective of this study is to quantify the boundary layer cloud
and turbulence processes that affect the evolution of atmospheric aerosols and
precursors using aircraft observations. The project is part of the North
Atlantic Regional Aerosol Characterization Experiment (ACE-2) which will be
conducted in June and July, 1997, over the subtropical Northeastern Atlantic
Ocean as an international collaborative effort. The main objectives of ACE-2 are
to study the properties of atmospheric aerosols relevant to radiative forcing
and climate using aircraft, ship-board, and ground-based measurements. The
Pelican, an aircraft from the Center for Interdisciplinary Remotely-Piloted
Aircraft Studies (CIRPAS), Naval Postgraduate School, will be the major
measurement platform for this project. The aircraft is equipped with instruments
measuring meteorological parameters, radiation, aerosol properties, and some
chemical constituents. The UK Meteorological Research Flight C-130 will be the
other aircraft participating in the Lagrangian experiments, where nearly
continuous measurements will be made following a tagged air column for two to
three days. A special circular flight pattern, tested during ACE-1, will be
implemented for the Pelican measurements in ACE-2 to obtain accurate entrainment
velocity and representative turbulence statistics that characterize aerosol
transport in the boundary layer and between the boundary layer and the free
troposphere. This study will emphasize the boundary layer and cloud evolution
during the Lagrangian measurements and how the evolution affects aerosol
dynamics and chemistry. The specific focus will be on entrainment measurements
and analysis, transport of moisture and cloud nucleating particles in the
decoupled boundary layers, the role of small cumulus and the organized mesoscale
flow associated with penetrating cumulus in aerosol evolution. Cloud
microphysics and aerosol characteristics will be studied in relation to the
above boundary layer dyna mical processes.
