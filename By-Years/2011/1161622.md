This mathematics research project develops methods of potential theory and
harmonic analysis that are applicable to the study of geometric integral
inequalities, existence and regularity problems, and estimates of solutions for
important classes of fully nonlinear and quasilinear equations and inequalities
with singular coefficients and singular data. Significant extensions of Hessian
Sobolev and Poincare inequalities of Trudinger and Wang, estimates of solutions
in terms of Wolff's potentials, as well as sharp estimates of kernels of Neumann
series will be obtained for integral operators, Green's functions and the
conditional gauge associated with fractional Schrodinger operators. Among the
tools employed will be dyadic models, maximal and singular integral operators on
non-homogeneous spaces, non-standard duality, and weighted norm inequalities
with indefinite weights, along with diverse techniques from the theory of
partial differential equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This mathematics
research project will bring a deeper understanding of fundamental nonlinear and
fractal phenomena for complex systems governed by nonlinear laws and nonlocal
forces arising in applied sciences and engineering, with potential applications
to mathematical modeling of non-Newtonian fluids, heat transfer, elasticity,
control theory. The techniques to be employed will bridge several areas of
mathematics, such as differential geometry, mathematical physics and conformal
geometry. The resulting synergies will enrich the arsenal of analytical tools
and available techniques, and will attract more students and young researchers
to this dynamic area of mathematics and its applications.
