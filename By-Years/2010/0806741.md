Through its Benjamin Banneker Scholars program, Central State University (CSU)
is strengthening its STEM programs and broadening the STEM workforce by offering
scholarships, in conjunction with academic and other student support, to high-
achieving high school seniors and current CSU freshmen or transfer students.
CSU, one of the nation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities and the
only public one in Ohio, promotes matriculation and retention of its students
through their participation in learning communities and a common first year
seminar, support through a Center for Student Opportunities, and opportunities
to excel in an Honors Program. In addition to their scholarships, each Banneker
Scholar - &lt;br/&gt; (a) participates in a STEM Learning Community in which
he/she lives in close proximity to other Scholars in the same residence hall
while taking the same core set of rigorous courses;&lt;br/&gt; (b) receives
advising and mentoring by a faculty member whose expertise is in the scholar's
interest area;&lt;br/&gt; (c) is tutored when assistance is needed with an
academic area; &lt;br/&gt; (d) has access to other support services, as needed,
including professional development, study skills, and counseling;&lt;br/&gt; (e)
is encouraged into STEM-related internships in industries, governmental agencies
and research institutions; and &lt;br/&gt; (f) is provided assistance in
placement into careers and/or graduate or professional
school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CSU Banneker Scholar program promotes academic
excellence and the cross-fertilization of ideas among STEM fields. A cycle of
year-round mentoring by experienced faculty mentors, interaction with peer and
professional role models, and research training provides the inspiration for
Banneker Scholars to compete in graduate school and professional careers in STEM
fields.
