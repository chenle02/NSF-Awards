Professor R. Jensen is one of the leading researchers in the world regarding
the classical and quantum descriptions of chaotic systems. By studying the
experimental results for the microwave ionization of highly excited hydrogen
atoms, he plans to explore the problem of quantum chaos. In particular, he wants
to study the connection between classical chaos and quantum chaos. In addition,
he hopes to gain new insight into the strong interaction of radiation with
matter and the interaction of strongly coupled many-body systems. Professor
Jensen is the most active and versatile young physics theorist interested in the
fundamental problem of the relation between classical and quantum chaos. He
proposes to study this problem by focussing on the coupling of microwave
radiation with atomic hydrogen. This work provides one of the best opportunities
to explore the apparent inconsistency between quantum mechanics and
deterministic chaos. There is a strong coupling between theory and experiments
in the proposed work, which also involves the study of the behavior of atoms
under the influence of intense external fields. This research will eventually
lead to a greater understanding of the value of semiclassical methods in quantum
dynamics.
