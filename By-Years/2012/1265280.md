Cognitive wireless systems are a collection of wireless network entities that
are able to adapt intelligently to the environment through observation,
exploration and learning. This project designs methods for cognitive radio
systems to compete for inhomogeneous spectrum resources and to establish,
without explicit coordination, a spectrum etiquette. Each system's resource
utilization strategy must be decided with only imperfect information of other
systems' actions, and the resulting adaptations must discourage any one system
from manipulating the agreed spectrum etiquette. The framework of dynamic games
with imperfect private monitoring is adopted to design coexistence mechanisms
for cognitive radio systems sharing inhomogeneous resources and to analyze the
stability, robustness, complexity, and convergence of these mechanisms. This
work directly impacts the development and standardization of frequency agile
wireless systems that can more efficiently use the available spectrum to support
increasing demand for ubiquitous wireless connectivity at high data rates. The
project is a collaborative effort between researchers in the US (at Virginia
Tech and the University of Houston) and Finland (at the University of Oulu).
This work will extend the state of the art in cognitive system adaptations by
incorporating the ability to: efficiently adapt under imperfect information;
fairly share inhomogeneous resources; and discourage manipulation of resource
use by selfish adversaries. Results will be disseminated in high impact journals
and conferences; the designed coexistence mechanisms will also be presented to
industry and regulators in the US and Europe.
