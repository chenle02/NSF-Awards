The aquatic sciences program at Grand Valley State has had a far reaching impact
on the regional knowledge of aquatic resources, and science in general. To
improve the educational level of students majoring in biology, with an emphasis
in aquatic science, new equipment for hands-on investigation is essential The
equipment requested in this proposal is for use in laboratory and student
research projects designed to develop logical thinking skills. Students will
take a very active role in data collection, analysis, and interpretation. K-12
students and teachers and lay persons in the community will also benefit from
the use of this equipment.
