The workshop reviews the aircraft design decision making process, including
technological, economic, market and manufacturing considerations, and provides
participants with the opportunity to work on a design project of their own. The
workshop will also include discussion on how to incorporate the design process
into the undergraduate aeronautical engineering curriculum, hence improving the
design and the design-teaching skills of engineering faculty.
