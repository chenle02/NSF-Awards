This project will investigate the interactions between the syntax and phonology
of languages of the Makassar group from South Sulawesi, Indonesia. The Makassar
languages, which with the increasing influence of Bahasa Indonesia are in
serious danger of becoming extinct within the next few generations, have a rich
inventory of affixes and clitics that signal, among other things, subject and
object agreement, definiteness, possession, and plurality, and various aspects
of derivational morphology. They are a fertile ground for testing hypotheses
concerning the relationships between syntactic and prosodic structure. The aims
of the project are (i) to provide a detailed description of the affixal system
of these languages; (ii) to ground this description in careful analysis of both
the syntax and the phonology of the languages; (iii) to investigate the general
principles governing the mapping between the syntactic, morphological, and
prosodic structure of the languages; and (iv) to place these results in the
wider context of a comparative approach to grammatical theory; and (iv) to
prepare and make widely available a database which will serve as a resource for
researchers interested in Indonesian languages and/or in any of the grammatical
areas covered in the project. The project has the potential to contribute to the
further development of our understanding of the structure of human language by
providing a thorough documentation of parts of the syntax, morphology, and
phonology of a little known group of uncommonly studied languages, and extensive
investigation of the implications of the data for the theory of grammar.
