This project incorporates experiments that illustrate chemical principles with a
new strategy and a new format for conducting the experiments. The strategy
involves switching from "traditional" experiments, in which students follow
detailed directions, to an inquiry philosophy, in which students are given more
freedom in conducting experiments and analyzing data. The new format requires
computers at each laboratory station for data collection, manipulation,
analysis, and display and incorporates computerized experiments. This merger of
current computer technology and the inquiry approach frees the student from
tedious data collection and engages students in the observations, analysis, and
interpretation of data. The changes in the general chemistry laboratory are
linked to changes in an advanced laboratory interfacing course that emphasizes
the construction and testing of simple circuits and sensors used for data
acquisition in the general chemistry laboratory. Additionally, the advanced
students develop new general chemistry experiments using these circuits and
sensors. The new experiments are further tested when they are incorporated into
the general chemistry laboratory. This symbiotic relationship provides a source
for continual feedback and evaluation of the entire project.
