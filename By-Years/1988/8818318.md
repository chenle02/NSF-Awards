This project will trace the impact of modernizing consumer goods channels upon
the economic and cultural character of a town community in West Germany. The
distribution of mass consumer goods is increasingly performed by vertically
integrated market channels dominated by marketing oriented enterprises which
take control of retail activities. This project will study this phenomenon in a
medium sized commercial town in northern Bavaria. It will trace the history of
marketing in the town; identify the causes of market channel integration; and
study the impact of progressive market integration on the economic and cultural
life of the town and its urban-rural relations. The PI will live in the town for
12 months and conduct ethnographic fieldwork. The project will increase our
understanding of the socio-cultural context of trade under expansionary economic
conditions. This research is important because the vertical integration of mass
marketing channels is a major fact of the modern world, occurring in both
developing and developed societies. This analysis, by an experienced scholar of
this process in the underdeveloped world, will add an important case and help us
understand the similar developments in the developing world.
