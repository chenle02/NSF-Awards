ABSTRACT CTS-9413259 J. Zemel and J. Santiago-Aviles University of Pennsylvania
will organize "coalition" of universities to promote joint research and
educational projects between U.S. universities and institutions from Latin
America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico). The research topics will cover
water quality control, flow measurements, biosensors and actuators, and
turbulent flow studies. A network of six universities has been created, and
other universities will be contacted for their collaboration after the coalition
will be active. The co-P.I.s plan to apply the "sandwich" program for graduate
students, where the students conduct research in two universities and receive
joint degrees. The research topics were selected to be suitable for the group of
Latin American countries involved. A main benefit of the proposed coalition is
the student and faculty exchange program. Secondary benefits of this experiment
are networking of researchers from different countries, and the generation of
common data bases to serve the community at large. The development of joint
educational and research projects with Latin America is of importance for the U.
S. community. If successful, the proposed educational/research coalition may
provide useful results in research and human resources in several countries, as
well as a reference for future collaborative projects. ***
