As parallel computing is becoming a cost effective way to achieve large
performance gains, these high performance computing systems are changing the
nature of research and development across all areas of science and engineering.
However, skilled scientists are needed to exploit the opportunities that
parallelism presents, which mandates that the university modify its cur- riculum
to teach computer science, engineering, and other science students to use this
new technology effectively. This grant enables the university to establish a
parallel computing laboratory in the Department of Computer and Information
Sciences. The project focuses on building a farm and a dedicated cluster of
isolated workstation-class microprocessors, which enable students to exploit
various paradigms of parallel computing and provide accurate performance
feedback. This laboratory creates the necessary environment for a sophomore-
level foundations course in parallel computing. It also allows for the
integration of parallelism into existing core, and advanced, computer science
courses, as well as other science and engineering courses.
