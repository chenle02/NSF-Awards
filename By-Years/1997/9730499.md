University of Pittsburgh The proposed research will focus on the general topic
of market integration in established market economies using the example of
Russia. The specific objectives are to: compare and interpret spatial pricing
patterns observed in Russia with other market economies and to analyze the
characteristics of cities which thrive, stagnate or fall behind during this
period of rapid change. A unique data set, already compiled, on retail prices,
price controls, spreads between state and market prices, speed of locally
initiated privatization, formal and informal trade patterns and costs of
subsistence food baskets will be utilized and analyzed in an econometric
modeling procedure. The matter of internal borders that separate highly
integrated cities from outside cities will be examined. A case study analysis of
nine Russian cities will be undertaken. The results will provide general
information on the impact of liberalization efforts in economies in the process
of transition.
