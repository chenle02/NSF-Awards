The Committee on Applied and Theoretical Statistics (CATS) organizes studies and
workshops that provide top-quality statistical science advice to help guide
major government programs. Some of those programs support the statistical
science community, but others do not yet have strong ties to it. CATS activities
are carried out by specially appointed committees of experts tailored for each
particular activity and in general survey existing research frontiers and
recommend best steps for strengthening or applying them; review federal programs
and recommend improvements; and/or provide strategic advice to federal programs
that depend on the mathematical sciences community.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall, the mission of CATS is to manage and reduce
uncertainty in national decision-making through the use of modern statistical
thinking and to nurture a vibrant statistical sciences research enterprise. The
latter goal calls for a statistical sciences discipline that is well-connected
with other fields of science, engineering, and medicine; absorbs challenges from
those other fields; and maintains a robust core. CATS works to strengthen these
attributes of the community.
