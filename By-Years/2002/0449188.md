This CAREER development project will establish the foundation for integration
of research and education at the Department of Bioengineering of the University
of Toledo towards developing cures for alleviating skeletal fragility. The
proposal seeks to attain the following specific objectives: (1) to understand
the molecular and supramolecular level deformation and fracture mechanisms in
healthy bone, (2) to determine whether bone's mechanical function can be
improved by modulating the size and the geometry of mineral nanocrystals, (3) to
integrate this nanobiomechanical perspective with the existing undergraduate-
and graduate-level biomechanics curricula, and (4) to realize the participation
of undergraduates and high-school students from under-served populations in
these research activities.
