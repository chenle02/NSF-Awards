This award will establish a new NSF sponsored user facility for neutron
scattering at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cold
Neutron Guide Hall Facility. The instruments are well suited to the needs of the
multidisciplinary neutron scattering community, and offer a well-balanced cross
section of modern neutron scattering instrumentation for high resolution studies
of the micro-structure and dynamics of virtually all classes of materials. They
include (1) a high resolution Small Angle Scattering Spectrometer (SANS) with
polarized beam capability, and (2) a Spin Polarized Inelastic Neutron Scattering
Spectrometer (SPINS) using supermirror polarizers and a "Drabkin" flipper. The
latter instrument is being cost shared 50/50 between the NSF and NIST funding.
The SANS instrument is of particular appeal to investigators in the fields of
Materials Science, Condensed Matter Physics and Chemical Physics, Materials
Chemistry, and Polymers Science. The proposed instruments are state of the art
facilities and are unequaled in this country and will be competitive with the
best facilities worldwide. They will be operated as a user facility with
experiments allocated by an outside Program Advisory Committee.
