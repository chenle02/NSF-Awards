This research is focused in the area of wideband sensor array signal processing.
The primary thrust of this phase is on the emphasis on the further development
of the Coherent Signal-subspace Method with emphasis on real-time adaptive
structures for wideband array focussing, integration of processors and the
implementation of the adaptive algorithms on an ultrasonic array testbed. The
intention is to fully explore the practical utility of the estimators that have
been developed within the framework of hardware implementation. The theoretical
investigation of the statistical properties of the proposed detectors and
estimators is also being pursued. Dr. Kaveh continues to conduct high quality
research and produce significant research results. Support is highly
recommended.
