Abstract ATM-0220842 Marshall, Thomas C. University of Mississippi Title:
Studies of the Evolution of Thunderstorm Electricity and Lightning

This project continues the analysis of data collected in the summer of 1999 at
Langmuir Laboratory of New Mexico Tech as part of the SEET project (Study of
Electrical Evolution of Thunderstorms). The data consist of thunderstorm
observations by two research radars, a surface network of electric-field
measurements, the precise locations and times of lightning flashes measured by
the Lightning Mapping Array, and balloon-soundings of the electric field in the
storms. The objective is to synthesize the data to produce a coherent picture of
thunderstorm electrical evolution. The locations of the main charge regions are
inferred from the balloon soundings of the electric field. The locations and
magnitudes of the charges measured in sequential soundings are then compared to
study the electrical evolution of the cloud. The locations of the charged
regions are also compared with the lightning paths and the radar-observed
precipitation patterns to learn how these quantities are related. The work
advances the understanding of charge generation and lightning production by
thunderstorms, explores the relations between the radar structure of storms and
the lightning they produce, and lays groundwork for better predictions of the
electrical hazards that accompany thunderstorms.
