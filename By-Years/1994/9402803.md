9402803 Duncan This project will continue development of using Ar isotopes to
determine the ages of very young oceanic rocks. The PI is the only person in the
world who is attempting this technically challenging technique. Preliminary
results have been successful, and he proposes to continue refining and testing
his method by applying it to several sets of rocks which have other age control.
In particular, he will compare the results of his method with those obtained
from U series dating.
