This research program continues the exploration of control of quantum systems
driven by strong fields. The research will be performed with undergraduate
students at Colby College. The experiments will be performed in Rydberg atoms,
which allows the study of control in a system where the final state distribution
is easily measured, in a frequency range where the shaped electromagnetic pulses
can have exceptional fidelity and are straightforward to produce, and where
uniform, strong, interactions are achievable with modest laboratory fields. The
research to be performed is driven by two overriding questions. The first
question is to what extent can strong interactions compensate for spectral
bandwidth in driving population transfer. The second question is how to control
systems where individual transitions are not independently addressable by their
frequencies. The broader impact involves the education of undergraduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
