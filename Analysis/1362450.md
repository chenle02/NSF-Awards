This project is in the area of complex and harmonic analysis. It is concerned
with the set of problems in harmonic analysis that fall under the heading of the
Uncertainty Principle, a relative of the principle of the same name that arises
in quantum mechanics. Stemming from the work of Norbert Wiener in mathematics
and Werner Heisenberg in physics, the area of the Uncertainty Principle still
presents many mathematical challenges, and the field has numerous applications
to adjacent fields. Several classical problems associated with the Uncertainty
Principle, problems posed decades ago by such prominent mathematicians as Norman
Levinson, Andrei Kolmogorov, and Norbert Wiener, remain open. Certain of those
problems will be studied in this project. Modern methods of complex and harmonic
analysis that appeared in the last thirty years suggest new approaches to the
classical challenges of the Uncertainty Principle. Two such problems, the so-
called gap and type problems, have recently been solved by the principal
investigator. These problems have a number of important applications in
approximation theory, prediction theory, spectral theory of differential
operators, and mathematical physics.

A new approach in the area of the Uncertainty Principle was developed in recent
papers of Nikolai Makarov and the principal investigator. One of the main
ingredients of the new approach is the use of Toeplitz operators, which explains
the title of the project. Indeed, the next stage of the application of the
Toeplitz approach in harmonic analysis and spectral theory is the focal point of
this project. It contains several classical open problems. Among the topics of
research to be pursued are the following: general completeness problems, which
will expand the results on the "type" problem mentioned earlier; spectral
problems for Schroedinger and Dirac operators; and a Toeplitz operator version
of the so-called Krein-de Branges theory, which was designed to connect complex
and spectral analysis. Successful completion of this research will create a new
and systematic view of the large variety of problems in the area of the
Uncertainty Principle. A part of this project will be done in collaboration with
the principal investigator's graduate students at Texas A&M University. Several
mini-courses on the Toeplitz approach to the Uncertainty Principle were recently
given by the principal investigator at U.S. and international research centers.
All of the courses are oriented towards young researchers and graduate students.
Together with Nikolai Makarov and Mikhail Sodin, the principal investigator is
working on a book that will contain a modern account of the Krein-de Branges
theory and other topics related to the Uncertainty Principle.
