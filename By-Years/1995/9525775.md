9525775 Hedges The biodiversity of the West Indies is the most fragile in the
New World because of rapid deforestation, very low levels of forest cover, and a
high human population density. In many areas, natural forests essentially have
disappeared except for small patches of secondary forest in which numerous
species, including some not yet named, still exist. There is an urgent need to
document the existing biological diversity on these islands befoer it
disappears. The information gained will be valuable in efforts to identify hot
spots of high species diversity and set priorities for those areas in greatest
need of protection. This project involves surveys and inventories of amphibians,
reptiles, ans some invertebrate groups in poorely known and remote regions of
the Greater Antilles. Host country scientists and students are involved in the
survey and inventory work, including collaborative taxonomic studies. Tissue
samples are collected and maintained for genetic studies of relationships, new
species are described, and checklists, keys, and field guides are produced. A
comprehensive electornic database is being developed for the internet that
contains information on many aspects of West Indain amphibians and reptiles.
