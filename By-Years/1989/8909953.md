A great variety of problems involving parallel interconnection networks can be
cast formally as questions about graphs. By bringing the tools of mathematics to
bear on these questions, theoretical computer scientists now understand a great
deal about VLSI layout of circuits on computer chips, fault-tolerance of
networks, aspects of communication in networks, methods for comparing the
relative strengths and weaknesses of networks, and other issues. A rich theory
has emerged, but many interesting open questions in the above areas remain. The
project examines a number of these questions.
