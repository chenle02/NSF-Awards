Bacteria colonize diverse environments, and the various traits that allow them
to survive in these different environments are of wide ecological, medical and
agricultural relevance. There is thus considerable interest in determining the
genetic changes that allow specific strains to flourish in some environments
while perishing in others. This project will identify the genes that allow the
plant bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae to spread in different
environments. The proposed study pairs the comparison of bacterial genomes with
comparative functional genetics to identify the specific genes that render P.
syringae strains acute pathogens in crop populations and natural plant
populations and allow P. syringae to proliferate in soil.&lt;br/&gt;An
understanding of the genetic changes that allow bacteria to survive in different
environments has important implications because slight genetic changes in a
bacterial strain can result in the decimation of entire plant populations or the
death of a patient. The cross-disciplinary nature of the project supports the
training of undergraduate and graduate students. The project includes outreach
and education of K-12 students, including students from underrepresented
groups.&lt;br/&gt;
