This project provides support for the U. S. National Commission on Mathematics
Instruction (USNC/MI), a primary means for ensuring U.S. participation in
mathematics education at the international level. The project will facilitate
periodic contact and interaction with mathematicians and mathematics educators
from around the world as issues about instructional practices are addressed. The
participation of representatives of USNC/MI on the international stage opens
venues for collaborative research and opportunities to learn about successful
practices from other countries. The USNC/MI regularly communicates with many
professional organizations in mathematics education throughout the United States
with reports and updates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major function of ICMI is to
authorize studies on issues of current international concern in mathematics
education, and the next topic to be addressed will be instruction related to
number in the primary grades. Another thrust of the USNC/MI is to be represented
at the International Congress in Mathematics Education that is scheduled every
four years. The ICME-12 meeting will be held in July 2012 in Seoul, Korea and
USNC/MI will be organizing several events and hosting a major exhibit throughout
the week long meeting.
