The study of compact irreducible 3-manifolds splits naturally into cases of
finite fundamental groups and infinite fundamental groups. In the case of
infinite fundamental groups, the virtual Haken conjecture of Waldhausen has been
serving as a guiding open problem, because virtual Haken 3-manifolds possess
similar nice properties as Haken 3-manifolds, such as topological rigidity,
residually finite fundamental groups and geometric decomposition in Thurston's
sense. Concerning 3-manifolds with finite fundamental groups, the Poincare
conjecture is perhaps the most fundamental open problem. The well known
Property-P conjecture may be considered as a special case of the Poincare
conjecture. Xingru Zhang proposes to continue his investigation of the virtual
Haken conjecture and the Property-P conjecture, along with some closely related
problems, such as embedded or immersed essential surfaces in 3-manifolds,
various exceptional Dehn surgeries on hyperbolic knots, and representations of
3-manifold groups.

Three dimensional manifold topology, including the knot theory, has been one of
the most active research areas in topology over the last twenty-five years. This
is a rich, beautiful and challenging area where topology meshes up harmonically
with algebra and geometry. For instance, if a compact 3-manifold without
boundary admits a complete hyperbolic metric, then the topology, the fundamental
group and the hyperbolic metric of the manifold mutually determine each other.
In general, it is fundamental to know that to what extent the topology of a
compact 3-manifold is determined by the fundamental group of the manifold, and
that whether the interior of a compact 3-manifold admits one of the eight
standard complete metrics under the condition that the manifold contains no
essential 2-spheres or 2-tori. In this proposal the PI plans to continue his
investigation in this direction.
