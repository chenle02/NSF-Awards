Models for emplacement of large thrust sheets make simplifying assumptions
regarding fault properties and presence of simultaneous slip over the entire
fault surface. In an actual thrust system fault characteristics vary from fault
to fault and from one place to the next along and across strike, reflecting
changes in mechanics of the fault system and variations of conditions within
individual fault zones. This research will address the complexities of fault
deformation in the Mountain City Window of Tennessee, and the along-strike
variations of fault zones and how these variations in fault behavior have
influenced the overall geometry of the thrust system. Results will contribute to
developing more realistic models for thrust development.
