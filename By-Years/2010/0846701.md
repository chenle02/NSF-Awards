Garegin Papoian of the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill is supported by
a CAREER award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to carry
out research on the development of a physico-chemical modeling technique for
filipodia initiation and dynamics. The physical chemistry of these mesoscopic
organelles is not well understood. In this research, Papoian and his group are
elucidating the mechanism of the temporally-controlled self-assembly of actin-
filament bundles that is driven by coupling among spatially-localized mechanical
and chemical interactions. Models of filopodia growth-retraction dynamics are
being developed which take into account the spatial localization of regulatory
proteins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work is having a broad impact through its
connection to basic biological science, but also through several outreach
initiatives to high school students and under-represented minorities that
Papoian is developing. He is also developing an online CyberBacteria project
which will allow young students to experience the excitement of cutting-edge
research problems.
