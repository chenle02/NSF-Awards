To address today's environment of constant security challenges and cyber-
threats, the Hardware-Assisted Lightweight Capability Optimization (HALCYON)
research explores novel techniques to make the performance of more secure system
designs acceptable to users. Conventional system designs have achieved
acceptable performance, but have evolved from hardware and software designs that
carry forward compromises in security that made sense in the past, but not with
modern hardware resources in today's security climate. HALCYON uses an approach,
called "capabilities", that provides better control of information sharing and
protection in computer systems than today's architectures. Capability access
control is preferred by many security experts, but conventional wisdom holds
that it is too slow to be used in practice. If HALCYON is successful, a new
generation of fundamentally more secure software systems will be enabled, at
little to no cost in performance.

HALCYON research explores hardware acceleration of selected operations in the
use of per-object access controls in an object-oriented programmer-controlled
protection model based on capabilities. The measurement and data driven
exploration is based on understanding the quantitative benefits of hardware
acceleration on microkernels such as L4 that are used in mobile phones and other
devices. Examples of hardware accelerations include lightweight support for fat
pointers ("low-fat pointers"), object pointers with associated access control
specifications. Such fat pointers, which have been designed, validated and
implemented, can protect units as small as individual memory words. As an
initial example, the project is using measurements to identify the impact of
this hardware acceleration. Measurement data from the quantitative exploration
allows the researchers to identify both worthwhile hardware accelerations and
opportunities for operating system restructuring that exploit those
accelerations.
