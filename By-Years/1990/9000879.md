Professor Gary W. Small and other members of the Chemistry Department of the
University of Iowa are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1990-92, eleven (11)
undergraduate students will spend eight (8) weeks each summer actively engaged
in a variety of research projects. Projects range from characterization of
fungal metabolites and inhibitors of cholesterol esterase to improvement of
instrumentation for trace metal or sugar detection. Students and faculty
advisors will meet together weekly for informal seminars.
