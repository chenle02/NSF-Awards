A supercompiler is a program transformer of a certain type. It traces the
possible generalized histories of computation by the original program, and
compiles an equivalent program, reducing in the process the redundancy that
could be present in the original program. This may lead to a deep restructuring
of the program and a great increase in its efficiency. A single supercompiler
program can serve as a powerful partial evaluator; as a converter of multi-pass
scanning algorithms into one-pass algorithms; as a means of program verification
and theorem proving. The underlying language used is Refal. The tracing of
computation histories is done by operations over the graph of states and
transitions of the abstract Refal machine. The states are configurations of the
Refal machine. In the current supercompiler a configuration is a combination of
nested function calls with the values of free variables restricted by a Refal
equivalent of certain inequalities. These restrictions are, however,
nonrecursive. This work will upgrade the system so as to allow arbitrary
recursive predicates as restrictions on configuration variables. The
supercompiler so improved will be then used for a wide range of practical and
theoretical problems, such as partial evaluation, automatic construction of
compilers, functional inversion, and theorem proving.
