Liu The objective of this research is to develop efficient signal processing
algorithms and architectures based on a new numerical matrix decomposition
called the URV decomposition. The major advantage of the URV decomposition is
that it provides as much information as the singular value decomposition but
with much less computational complexity. Using this new numerical tool, signal
processing algorithms that currently employ either the singular value or QR
decompositions can be reformulated, leading to more efficient and robust
implementations. Analysis and development of efficient URV-based signal
processing algorithms will be conducted with applications to adaptive array
processing, reduced rank signal processing, signal compression, multi-
dimensional filter design, and image processing. VLSI architectures and parallel
processor implementations will also be considered for high-performance signal
processing using the URV decomposition.
