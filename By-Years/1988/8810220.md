This grant primarily supports the experimental study of nuclear charge-exchange
reactions induced by protons and neutrons at intermediate energies. Isovector
giant resonances and Gamow- Teller transition strengths will be probed. The
measurements will be carried out using the newly developed White Neutron Source
and Neutron Time of Flight (NTOF) facilities at LAMPF. In addition, charge-
exchange measurements will be made at the Indiana University Cyclotron Facility,
and other neutron-induced reactions studied at low energies at Ohio University.
