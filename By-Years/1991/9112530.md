With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Billups will expand the
recently developed vacuum gas solid reaction technique (VGSR) to the synthesis
of highly unstable compounds under conditions where structural studies can be
performed. Particular emphasis will be placed upon the use of solid alkalai
fluoride to effect the elimination of beta-halosilanes to yield highly strained
intermediates. In addition, bifunctional cycloproparenes will be polymerized
with silver ion to produce a series of new aromatic materials. Finally, the
organic and organometallic chemistry of C-60 "Buckminsterfullerene" will be
studied. %%% A major focus of Dr. Billups' research program in recent years has
been the development of a vacuum gas phase procedure for synthesizing small ring
compounds. This approach, which is utilized in only one other laboratory in the
United States, allows the reactive species to be isolated at low temperature for
subsequent chemical and structural studies. In other work, Dr. Billups will
study some aspects of the chemistry of a new allotrope of carbon,
"Buckminsterfullerene", which contains a cluster of sixty carbon atoms. This
novel, all-carbon cluster is of considerable interest from a theoretical
standpoint and also for its potential materials applications.
