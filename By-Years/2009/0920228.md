The goal of this research is to explain why states with larger proportions of
religious conservatives have higher divorce rates than states with lower
proportions of religious conservatives. This project will examine whether the
earlier ages at marriage and first birth observed among religious conservatives
contribute to this paradox, while attending to other plausible explanations.
These include higher rates of marriage itself in religiously conservative
states, and lower proportions of single or cohabiting adults whose relationship
breakups are never counted. Higher rates of crime and other social problems
associated with economic decline produce may also produce both higher divorce
rates and greater popularity of conservative churches. To investigate regional
variation in divorce, county-level demographic information from all 50 states
will be combined from a variety of public data sources, including the U.S.
Census and county court records on marital dissolutions. Statistical models will
assess whether the proportion of religious conservatives in a county affects the
incidence of divorce and, if so, how this influence occurs.

Divorce has attracted the attention of policymakers and scholars because of its
negative consequences for the health and economic well-being of single parents
and their children. The growth of conservative religious denominations and their
concentration in particular geographic regions represent an opportunity to
understand how community norms regarding sexuality, birth control and abortion,
as well as efforts to restrict sexual activity to marriage, might affect both
the popularity of marriage and future divorce risk. Understanding how religious
beliefs can both encourage marriage and weaken its stability can help inform
policies designed to strengthen marriage.
