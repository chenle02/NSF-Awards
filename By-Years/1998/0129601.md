Primates include all living prosimians, monkeys, apes, and humans. Much is known
of the evolutionary history of this group but its origins remain obscure. The
earliest recognized fossil primates appear suddenly on northern continents at
the beginning of the Eocene, about 55 million years ago, but their place of
origin and their relationships with other fossil mammal groups remains an
unresolved question. Tree shrews, dermopterans (flying lemurs), and chiropterans
(bats) all have been suggested as the closest living relatives of primates.
Among fossil mammals, a Paleocene group called Plesiadapiformes has most often
been cited as possible primate ancestors, based on shared tooth structures.
Alternatively, plesiadapiforms have been linked by skull and limited skeletal
evidence to flying lemurs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, exceptionally well-
preserved plesiadapiform skeletons have been found in Paleocene and Eocene
freshwater limestones in the Clarks Fork Basin of Wyoming. These skeletons are
remarkable for their completeness and their preservation of even the most
delicate of anatomical structures. These skeletons represent four different
families of plesiadapiforms including Carpolestidae, Micromomyidae,
Paromomyidae, and Plesiadapidae. Analysis of these skeletons will allow for: (1)
new functional interpretations of the positional behavior and locomotor pattern
of Plesiadapiformes, (2), a test of the hypothesized plesiadapiform-dermopteran
link and (3) a re-analysis of plesiadapiform-primate relationships. Initial
results indicate that a diversity of unique positional behaviors is represented
in the four plesiadapiform families represented. All groups appear to have been
arboreal and their skeletons show a variety of adaptations for above-branch
walking, vertical clinging, climbing, grasping, leaping, and suspension. These
diverse skeletal attributes parallel the wide variety of dental specializations
developed in plesiadapiforms. New data from these specimens will be used to
reconstruct a model of the skeletal anatomy of primitive Primates.&lt;br/&gt;
