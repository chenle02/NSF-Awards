Founded in 1800, Middlebury College, located in western Vermont, has committed
itself to academic excellence in all disciplines, including the sciences.
Research by undergraduate students, working in close collaboration with faculty
mentors, is the centerpiece of science education at Middlebury. Nowhere is this
more evident than in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. The
commitment of faculty, in carrying out significant research in the setting of an
undergraduate institution, has increased of the number of students pursuing
chemistry, biochemistry and molecular biology. Success has come in spite of
antiquated facilities for research and research training. Recognizing this need
the college will renovate laboratory space in the Science Center for chemical
and biochemical research with support from the Academic Research Infrastructure
Program. Present conditions of research space dedicated to the department are
inappropriate and poorly configured to support research activities. Renovations
will include consolidating research space that is currently dispersed throughout
the building. Instrumentation rooms will be created for all major analytical
instruments. New fume hoods and ventilated storage cabinets will be located in
all laboratories, improving laboratory safety. The renovated laboratories will
provide access to modern research space for more undergraduate students and will
substantially improve the environment for student-faculty research. These
modifications will facilitate the substantial flow of scientific results from
Middlebury faculty and students, and will contribute to the recruitment and
training of future scientists.
