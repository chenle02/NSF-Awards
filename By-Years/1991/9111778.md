This research, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the
Division of Chemistry, seeks to expand the use of Magnetic Resonance
Spectroscopy to elucidate the handedness or chirality of two important types of
molecules: cyclodextrins (molecules with cavities that can selectively sequester
other molecules of specific size and shape) and 3,5-dinitrobenzoylamino acid
esters (derivatives of amino acids useful in separating molecules of different
chirality). Lanthanide ions will be bound to chiral species. Proximity of
lanthanides to probed molecules shifts their magnetic resonance spectra;
quantification of the shifts will lead to the methods for assigning chirality.
%%% This research, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in
the Division of Chemistry, seeks to expand the use of lanthanide NMR shift
reagents for probing chirality. Both cyclodextrins and 3,5-dinitrobenzoylamino
aicd esters will be studied with complexed or covalently bound lanthanides as
paramagnetic shift species. Assignment of absolute configuration and study of
chiral interactions are primary goals of this research.
