9308486 Laursen The purpose of this research initiation award (RIA) is to
conduct research on the application of finite element methods to problems
involving frictional mechanical contact of bodies undergoing large inelastic
deformations. This investigation will explore the efficient implementation
within finite element codes of physically motivated constitutive models for
friction in order to realistically simulate such events of interest as forming,
cutting and machining processes, the behavior of orthopedic joint replacements,
plate tectonics and fault slippage. ***
