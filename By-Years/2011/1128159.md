This RAPID project, PI Doug Whalen, is perhaps the "last chance" to record
critical phonological data on the world's only known, spoken, 3-way consonant
harmony language, Tahltan. Tahltan, is a heritage language with only a few
remaining speakers living (estimated 35, &gt;67ya) on the North West Coast of
Canada. Tahltan is a Northern Athabaskan language and as such closely related to
the Athabaskan languages spoken in the circumpolar north. Using an ultrasound,
of the same kind used in hospitals, the PI will record Tahltan speakers reading
a set list of Tahltan words that will elicit consonant harmony speech situations
in order to test the hypothesis put forward - that this unique 3-way consonant
harmony is the result of a specific groove formation in the tongue for the three
classes of consonants. This project has potential implications for a broader
debate about the relationship between brain/body interactions. In addition, the
proposed research will be documenting aspects of a language soon to be extinct;
the project includes the participation of a university student and will provide
valuable field training to the student as he/she pursues his/her science
education. The project is also in cooperation with Dr. Patricia Shaw, who has
worked collaboratively with the Tahltan people in documenting their language and
brings those community relationships to this project.
