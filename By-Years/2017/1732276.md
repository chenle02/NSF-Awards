The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to deliver a
low cost mastering technology to enable the cost-effective pattering of polymer
and other surfaces to impart function without the use of chemical additives. The
masters will be used in microreplication, injection molding and embossing to
impart structural color, antimicrobial activity, anti-counterfeiting marks,
light collection for solar energy and other surface functionality with high
yield and high throughput, impacting consumer products and technology companies
alike. The use of surface patterns as opposed to chemical additives to achieve
function offers environmental and consumer safety advantages and is resource and
energy efficient.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project employs a
fundamentally new approach to the fabrication of master molds for patterning
polymer surfaces via microreplication and nanoreplication technologies including
injection molding, nanoimprint lithography, and embossing. Master molds are
typically produced via optical lithography and etching of rigid substrates
including silicon wafers, stainless steel and quartz, which is expensive as well
as time and resource intensive. This is a novel process for direct imprinting of
dimensionally stable crystalline metal oxide nanostructures that are fabricated
using soft lithography with inks comprised of crystalline nanoparticles. Via
this process it is possible to create a soft daughter mold from a single parent
master and use that soft mold to create successive generations of high fidelity,
robust masters in crystalline zirconia and other metal oxides, substantially
reducing cost. In addition the use of zirconia patterns on thermally robust
master substrates enables pattern transfer at temperatures far above those
accessible using conventional masters.
