*** Ranade 9401880 This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will
investigate the gas phase synthesis of alumina powder in turbulent jet aerosol
reactors. During Phase I, it was demonstrated that particles in the size range
of 40-100 nm could be produced at outputs of 2 gm/hour. During Phase II, the
goal will be to modify the reactor setup and operating conditions to obtain
particles in the 10-40 nm size range at outputs of up to 200 gm/hour. The
computer model developed during Phase I will be extended to include particle and
turbulent flow dynamics. Infrared measurements will be made to obtain the global
kinetic rates for aluminum chloride reaction with oxygen. While the focus will
be on alumina synthesis, during Phase II an effort will be made to demonstrate
the versatility of this technique for other oxide and non-oxide materials such
as zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, silicon nitride and multicomponents. High
purity and doped oxides and non-oxide materials in the nanometer size range find
extensive application in high temperature ceramics, catalysis and
photonics/electronics. Nanosized alumina, specifically, will have potential
commercial applications as a high surface area stable catalyst support, super
tough envelope for advanced lamps, and as a crack resistant structural material.
