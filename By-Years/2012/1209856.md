This action funds Benjamin William Krueger of the University of Washington to
conduct a research project, entitled "Controlling conduction at the interface of
transparent thin films," during the summer of 2012 at the National Institute for
Materials Science (NIMS) in Tsukuba, Japan. The host scientist is Dr. Toyohiro
Chikyow, principal investigator of the Nano-Electronics Materials Unit at NIMS.

The Intellectual Merit of this research project is twofold: first, to understand
the role of aluminum and indium dopants on the electrical, structural and
optical properties of gallium oxide, a transparent semiconductor that exhibits
marked n-type conductivity, in order to create custom-tailored semiconducting
thin films with tunable band gap energy and conductivity; and second, to study
conduction and electron accumulation at the interface between two dissimilar
gallium oxide films as the doping level is varied. This research promises to
enable the successful design of transparent high-electron mobility transistors
(HEMT), to complement the commercially successful aluminum gallium arsenide
HEMTs ubiquitous in modern high-frequency devices.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of Japan; and an orientation to the
society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for
international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers,
and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.
