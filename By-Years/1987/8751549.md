The purpose of this proposal is to establish a consortium to carry out, on an
interim basis for the 1990 assessment, the kind of consensus planning process
that will be necessary for state- by-state administration of the National
Assessment of Educational Process (NAEP). The purpose of this consortium is to
establish a steering committee consisting of a representative of each consortium
member which will develop and direct a process leading to a series of
recommendations to the Center for Education Statistics concerning the conduct of
a state-level assessment in 1990. On May 4, a planning meeting convened by the
Council of Chief State School Officers determined on a preliminary basis that it
is feasible to conduct a state-by-state assessment on a limited scale in 1990.
The group recommended attempting to conduct a consensus planning process to
prepare for state-by-state assessment and to identify operational procedures for
such an assessment. The group concluded that limiting the assessment to
mathematics at the high school (17-year olds) level would be desirable. The
consortium will: 1) Develop and propose a policy statement on the purposes of
state-level assessment. 2) Recommend the scope of the 1990 assessment that
should be done on a state-by- state basis--confirm the subject (mathematics) and
grade levels to be assessed and the extent of participation to be sought. 3)
Determine commonalities of opinion and important sources of differences within
and among major educational constituencies concerning the subject to be
assessed. 4) Recommend the knowledge and skills that should be assessed in the
subject. 5) Recommend additional information that should be collected in
conjunction with achievement data on a state-by-state basis. 6) Recommend the
format that should be used to report state-level assessment and background data.
