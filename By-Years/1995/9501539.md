9501539 Lander This action is to support an international workshop to explore a
wide range of questions related to the collection, availability, standards and
the use of tsunami and other related data. Recent tsunamis in Nicaragua, Japan,
Indonesia, the Kurile Islands and the Phillipines have been destructive and were
investigated by international teams of engineers and scientists. The experiences
from these efforts may be useful in designing future field investigations.
Changes in instrumentation -- including remotely-accessible digital recording
marigraphs (tide gauges) and ocean bottom pressure gauges -- can cause problems,
as well as offer new opportunities. Fear of a possible large tsunami off the
Washington-Oregon coast has generated a demand for predicted runup data and
inundation mapping. Improved computer modeling capabilities give the possibility
of improving the accuracy of runup predictions and of using models to generate
this information in real time, so as to generate customized predictions for each
community when a tsunami warning is issued. Topics to be discussed include
instrumentation, field investigations and observations, ancillary data, current
tsunami data collection, and user needs. The workshop is to be held in Estes
Park, Colorado, June 1995. ***
