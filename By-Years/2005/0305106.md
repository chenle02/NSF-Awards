This experimental research is directed at the response of noncohesive granular
materials to applied forces. Strong forcing can create smooth hydrodynamic-like
flow, but with microscopic fluctuations and inelastic grain-grain collisions
that limit the speed of flow. Weak forcing can lead to intermittent avalanche-
like flow or no flow at all. Similar behavior occurs in other materials, like
foams or dense colloids or supercooled liquids; the detailed phenomenology and
extent of analogy are at the forefront of condensed matter physics, under the
name of jamming. Here the grain-scale fluctuations will be measured by high-
speed video and by a new quasielastic laser light scattering method we call
"speckle-visibility spectroscopy". One thust is to explore the extent to which
the microscopic dynamics are quantitatively analogous to fluctuations in a
thermal equilibrium system. Another thrust is to relate the fluctuations to
dissipation, particularly in the context of impact cratering. The graduate and
undergraduate students involved in this research will be trained in cutting-edge
experimental technology; this will prepare them for a range of careers in
academia, industry or government. %%% This research is aimed at fundamental
puzzles in how granular systems, like sand, respond to applied forces. Modern
society relies on handling all sorts of granular materials, ranging from foods
to building supplies to pharmaceuticals and more. Yet actual equipment is
surprisingly prone to sudden failure, like clogging or jamming or demixing.
Ultimately, this is because we still don't know how applied forces on large
systems cause relative motion between neighboring grains, which is how energy is
dissipated. Here the proposed work will break new ground by combining high-speed
video with a newly invented laser light scattering method. This will allow study
of grain motion and energy dissipation at short enough scales to capture the
crucial physics, which was not possible with prior means. Students in this
program receive rigorous training in experimental methods involving modern
electronic and optical physics, and can pursue careers in academic or industrial
science or engineering. ***
