The proposed research will lead to improvements in deterministic fracture
mapping methods by evaluating their effectiveness. Rock samples containing
fractures will be mapped and internal fracture network projections will be made
using standard industrial methods. The samples will be sectioned while their
structure is recorded at each slice. The maps will then be compared to the
revealed structure. The ability of the standard mapping techniques to
effectively determine the internal structure will be evaluated. Improvements to
the standard mapping techniques will be proposed.
