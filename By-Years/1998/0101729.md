This project is establishing a comprehensive program in chemical technology over
a three-year period. The county where this community college is located is home
to a large number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and the region
faces a shortage of well-qualified chemical technicians, especially those
trained in instrumental analytical techniques relevant to those encountered in
local industry. Recent funding from NSF's Course, Curriculum, and Laboratory
Improvement (CCLI) program has enabled purchase of sophisticated, modern
instrumentation which forms the foundation upon which the chemical technology
program is being built. The new curriculum incorporates the Voluntary Industry
Standards (VIS) of the American Chemical Society. With this institution having
an ethnic minority enrollment that exceeds 80%, a significant impact on the
employment of technicians from underrepresented groups is expected.
