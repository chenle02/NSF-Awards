This award will provide partial support to the IVth Conference on the
Intersections between Particle and Nuclear Physics, Tucson, Arizona, 5/23-29/91.
The conference will bring together particle and nuclear physicists to discuss
the entire range of topics in the energy domain of 1 to 100 GeV. The discussions
will include heavy ion physics as component of particle physics, electrons as
probes of particle physics within the nucleus, rare decays of mesons, deep
inelastic scattering of muons. The conference will serve to improve the
communication among people working on similar projects and enhance the
exploitation of present and future facilities.
