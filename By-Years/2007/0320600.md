With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Western Kentucky University will acquire a 400 MHz
NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out research
on a) synthesis of phosphines and phosphine macrocycles; b) cesium based
promoted chemoselective N-alkylations; c) template synthesis of dendrimer
spheres using monolayer-protected clusters; d) characterization of Cobalt (III)
complexes; e) metalation in hydrocarbon solvents; and f) complexation between
cisplatin and methionine and guanine. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for
the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out
frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in
synthetic organic chemistry and physical biochemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
