The phenomenon of microparticle motion induced by chemical signals has far-
reaching implications in a number of chemical and biological transport processes
as well as potential application in analytical and separation techniques. The
theoretical analysis of this gradient-driven particle motion is a topic of
considerable current interest. Experiments will be performed to demonstrate the
applicability and limitations of the present theory.11/01/84; $63,335; 12
