9414209 Pollak Fundamental research directed toward improved understanding of
growth and processing of semiconductors, and the electronic properties of
heterostructures through the development and use of advanced modulation
spectroscopy, particularly photore flectance and electrore flectance, for an
effective screening tool in the characterization of semiconductor device
structures will be conducted. The research base established will serve to
improve materials parameters such as alloy composition, Schottky barrier
heights, interfacial quality, and well width in quantum well structures and
superlattices. %%% This research is expected to provide deeper fundamental
understanding of semiconductor growth and processing, and the fundamental
electronic properties of heterostructures. A major advantage of the methods
being developed is that they can be used in situ and in real time for effective
improvement in the control of advanced semiconductor growth and subsequent
processing as well as providing fundamental information on the basic electronic
properties of these materials. ***
