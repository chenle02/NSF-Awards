DEB-0121050 - Karban&lt;br/&gt;Over the past two decades ecologists have come to
recognize that indirect effects are widespread and important in many
communities. Induced resistance represents one type of indirect effect that has
received a lot of study, although ecologists are very skeptical about plant-
plant communication as a mechanism for induced resistance. In fact, most
ecologists discount the possibility of communication between plants because
early reports of this phenomenon were not convincing. However, my recent
fieldwork suggests that wild tobacco plants "eavesdrop" on clipped sagebrush
neighbors and induce higher levels of resistance to their shared herbivores.
This communication appears to be mediated by an airborne cue released by
sagebrush, perhaps methyl jasmonate. This proposal asks two questions: 1) How
general is eavesdropping? 2) Is methyl jasmonate the airborne cue? If
eavesdropping proves to be widespread then the spectrum of interactions within
plant communities may be much richer than we now appreciate. Widespread
eavesdropping suggests a much greater role for associational resistance and
susceptibility, and for spatial structure in general.
