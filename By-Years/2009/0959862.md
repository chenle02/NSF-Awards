This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award from the Major Research
Instrumentation (MRI) program Professor Brian F. Woodfield and colleagues
Juliana Boerio-Goates, Branton J. Campbell and Roger G. Harrison from the
Department of Chemistry at Brigham Young University will acquire a powder X-ray
diffractometer capable of carrying out routine phase identification and advanced
structural analysis including phase identification of synthetic products,
nanoparticle-size determination, and Rietveld structural analysis. Specific
applications are: 1) studies of products of nanoparticle and catalyst syntheses;
2) nanocrystal growth kinetics; 3) relationships between nanoparticle and bulk
structure; 4) semiconductor nanoparticle chemistry; 5) bioinorganic nanoparticle
chemistry; and 6) materials physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An X-ray
diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three
dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and
provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule
relative to neighboring molecules. A powder diffractometer allows diffraction
studies in powdered crystalline materials. The data provide information on
particle sizes, phase identification and sample purity. The studies described
here will impact a number of areas, including chemistry and materials chemistry.
This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.
