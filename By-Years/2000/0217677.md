The electric utility industry is in the transition from operating in a
monopolistic environment to one that is regulated as a competitive marketplace.
At this point in time, over eight markets have failed. The objective of this
research is to analyze this new emerging electricity marketplace from the
viewpoint of including reliability as a product dffferentiator as solved by
adaptive agents. Reliability is a key feature of electric energy delivery and
has provided national economic growth for almost a century. This research is
interested in how a company would compete effectively for long term growth
potential and for continuous financial performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is
a computer simulation of the portfolio analysis of various electric contracts
with various levels of reliability. All players must use complex decision making
to properly bid and to make a positive profit. This effort proposes to use
classical optimization techniques in conjunction with decision analysis for the
buyers and sellers of electricity in such an electric marketplace. This project
will investigate the steady state results for the application of forecasting and
decision methods to determine if price discovery occurs using various learning
algorithms. Previous research by this author and others has lead to new
algorithms based on real option analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This effort
proposes computer-learning algorithms (Modified Roth-Erev, genetic algorithm,
genetic programming, and neural networks). Agents will be implemented with these
techniques to generate a sustainable profit from the various energy markets. The
long-term goal is to develop adaptive agents to assist humans who play the
electric marketplace.&lt;br/&gt;
