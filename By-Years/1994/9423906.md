Dr. Albert J. Fry and other members of the Chemistry Department of Wesleyan
University are being supported to establish a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 1995-97, six
undergraduate minority students will spend ten weeks each summer actively
engaged in a variety of research projects drawn from the traditional areas of
chemistry. A unique feature of this program is that students will be recruited
primarily from eleven historically black colleges and universities with which
Wesleyan has established working relationships.
