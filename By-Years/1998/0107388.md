Mogilner&lt;br/&gt;0107388&lt;br/&gt; Mathematical and theoretical biology is a
vital and rapidly&lt;br/&gt;growing subject that complements empirical work and
provides&lt;br/&gt;model systems for study and manipulation. Such model systems
can&lt;br/&gt;sometime suggest shortcuts when the experimetal work
is&lt;br/&gt;difficult. More often, the models provide novel tools to
disect&lt;br/&gt;complex biological phenomena in addition to
traditional&lt;br/&gt;techniques. The current challenge in the field is to
make&lt;br/&gt;quantitative modeling, on the one hand, a part of the process
of&lt;br/&gt;fundamental biological discovery, and, on the other
hand,&lt;br/&gt;applicable in biomedical and biotechnological situations.
This&lt;br/&gt;requires researchers with biological skills and
mathematical&lt;br/&gt;insight and facility. At this time such individuals are
rare.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator and his colleagues organize an
International&lt;br/&gt;Conference on Mathematical and Theoretical Biology at
Hilo,&lt;br/&gt;Hawaii on July 15--19, 2001. The goals of the meeting are
to&lt;br/&gt;highlight current top-level research, to provide a perspective
on&lt;br/&gt;future research areas, to provide opportunities for
career&lt;br/&gt;development to junior researchers and underrepresented
categories&lt;br/&gt;of researchers, to foster interactions between
established&lt;br/&gt;researchers and junior researchers and between theorists
and&lt;br/&gt;experimentalists. The meeting highlights exciting
traditional&lt;br/&gt;and new areas of rapid growth in mathematical biology,
such as&lt;br/&gt;theoretical ecology and evolution, quantitative cell
biology,&lt;br/&gt;proteomics, mathematical modeling in medicine and
mathematical&lt;br/&gt;physiology and immunology. Plenary speakers both give a
broad&lt;br/&gt;overview of their field and focus on areas for future
research.&lt;br/&gt;Additional contributed and poster sessions are organized to
give&lt;br/&gt;junior researchers the chance to be heard.&lt;br/&gt;
Mathematical and theoretical biology is a young&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary
field of science that provides quantitative&lt;br/&gt;models in biology. These
models provide novel tools to disect&lt;br/&gt;complex biological phenomena. The
current challenge in the field&lt;br/&gt;is to train researchers with biological
skills and mathematical&lt;br/&gt;insight and facility. The conference helps to
highlight current&lt;br/&gt;top-level research and provides opportunities for
career&lt;br/&gt;development to junior researchers and underrepresented
categories&lt;br/&gt;of researchers.&lt;br/&gt;
