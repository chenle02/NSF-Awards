With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Oregon Eugene will acquire a CCD
X-ray diffractometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
including the following: a) studies of organic molecules of biological and
technological relevance; b) inorganic catalysts important in the energy field;
c) nanoclusters for use in electronic devices; d) molecules that can be used as
non-biological molecular motors; and e) new solid-state materials.

The X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full
three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles,
and it provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of the
molecule relative to the neighboring molecules. These studies will have an
impact in a number of areas, including materials chemistry, preparation of more
efficient catalysts, and biotechnology.
