The objective of this research is to determine if an integrated circuit sensor
can combine the benefits of fluorescence intensity imagers and fluorescence
lifetime sensors. The approach is to compare three competing technologies for
high-speed photon detection (traditional pixels, photomixing pixels, and single
photon avalanche diodes) at the pixel, imager, and application level.
Intellectual Merit The inclusion of fluorescence lifetime data in fluorescence
intensity measurements can improve the signal-to-noise ratio, increase the
number of imaging channels, and even allow the development of low-cost
fluorescence imagers that do not require filters. This fluorescence lifetime
data is only rarely collected because existing sensors are expensive and slow.
The work proposed here will either demonstrate that integrated circuit detectors
can overcome these hurdles or point the way to research on integrated circuit
detectors to reach that goal. Broader Impacts Fluorescence instruments are
critical in medical diagnosis, drug discovery, and pathogen detection. This
project will enable creation of new instruments that are more sensitive, more
portable, faster, and cheaper. The development of these sensors is also an
opportunity to train students in the classic area of circuit design and the
emerging area of bioelectronics. In particular, a graduate student will be
prepared for a career in mixed-signal circuit design and a team of
undergraduates will gain experience in interdisciplinary engineering developing
the systems for testing these integrated circuits with realistic fluorescence
assays.
