9729837&lt;br/&gt;Sussmann&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
support the participation of researchers from the United States at the
International Conference on Variational Methods, Optimal Control, and Related
Topics to be held at the Technion in Haifa, Israel from March 25 - 31, 1998. The
conference will focus on two main areas of research: (a) critical point theory
(with applications to differential equations) and (b) optimal control
(existence, relaxation, optimality conditions, structure of optimal trajectories
and optimal synthesis). In both areas there has been much recent progress both
in the development of new mathematical theories and in numerous applications to
physics, mechanics, engineering, and economics. The conference will bring
together researchers from the U.S., Israel, a number of European research
centers, and the former Soviet Union.&lt;br/&gt;
