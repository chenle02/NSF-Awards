In general, the overall effects of seismically induced damage to lifeline
systems continues for several months following the earthquake. A methodology to
assess such damages to lifeline systems is currently not available. A data base
is not available at the present time to verify the analysis of time-dependent
post-earthquake damage to buried pipeline systems. This study provides a method
to assess the post-earthquake damage to buried pipeline systems. This research
will develop an objective measure of earthquake damage to underground pipeline
systems based on field data from the 1983 Coalinga earthquake and the 1979
Imperial Valley earthquake.
