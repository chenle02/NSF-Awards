This project identifies scientists and organizations and their topical
interests, enabling the tracking of past productivity and impact. By linking
scholarly literature and grants, this project creates a unified dataset that
captures diverse scientific disciplines and federal grant award types. A web-
based levels the playing field for scientists lacking knowledge about research
and funding programs. Users are expected to spend less time searching the
literature and more time evaluating significance and impact.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project consolidates disparate repositories of
publications and grants, disambiguates and enriches information about scientists
and organizations, and builds a web-based tool to help navigate this
information. This project solves many of these issues by modeling the
relationship approximately 2.6 million grants from the Federal RePORTER, and a
consolidated, multi-source dataset of millions of articles from Microsoft
Academic Graph (83 M), MEDLINE (25 M), PubMed Open Access Subset (1 M), ArXiv
(0.6 M), and the National Bureau of Economic Research [NBER] (14K). The project
creates a web-based tool that generates instantaneous reports about
publications, grants, scientists, and organizations related to users' interests.
The unified dataset and web tool could revolutionize how Program Officers
evaluate proposals and how researchers find fundable ideas, making science
faster, more accurate, and less biased.
