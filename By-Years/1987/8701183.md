The lack of detailed geophysical constraints on the structure of mid-ocean
ridges has severely limited efforts to develop a comprehensive understanding of
the processes forming the oceanic crust. The generation of new oceanic crust and
lithosphere at accretionary plate boundaries is fundamental to plate tectonic
theory. Current geological models for the crustal generation process include the
existence of shallow crustal magma chamgers. Despite the growing support for the
models, data defining both the existence and geometry of axial magma chambers
remain controversial. This project is a multichannel seismic investigation
between two well-studied segments of the East Pacific Rise at 9 degrees north
and 13 degrees north. The volcanic petrology has been examined through a series
of dredging and ALVIN dive programs. The tectonic and structural fabric has been
examined with side scan sonar and multibeam bathymetry. Existing seismic
refraction data indicate the presence of an axial low velocity zone, presumably
associated with a magma chamber beneath the rise crest. The objective of the
present award is to complete the analysis and interpretation of this unique data
set. Specific problems to be addressed include: 1) The physical properties of
the material below the magma chamber reflector; 2) the shape of the magma
chamber walls and floor; 3) the development of ocean crustal structure during
its first few million years; 4) the effect of basement morphology of recorded
seismic reflections; and 5) variations in magma chamber characteristics along
the rise axis.
