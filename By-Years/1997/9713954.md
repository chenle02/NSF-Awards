9713954 Mullen The objective is to develop a series of liquid crystalline (LC)
stress chromic coatings for rapid identification of over-stress conditions in
the components of the infrastructure, such as highway bridges. These coatings
change color when subjected to stress/strain. The material can be formulated to
return to the original color once the stress/strain is removed, or the color
change can remain for weeks. Diacetylene liquid crystalline polymers are the
materials of choice because of their stress chromic properties. The development
of this coating will allow the easy visual detection of stress levels in a
material and allow a more accurate identification of flaws (cracks) in
structures. Early detection should reduce the cost of maintenance and repair and
ensure safe structures. ***
