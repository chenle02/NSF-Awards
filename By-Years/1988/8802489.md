This project is concerned with a variety of problems in the area of infinite
dimensional Lie algebras. The principal investigator will study infinite-
dimensional groups associated to Kac-Moody algebras, representations of the
Virasoro algebra, exceptional hierarchies of soliton equations, superintegrable
systems, and moduli spaces. The research conducted under this award concerns the
topological and algebra-geometric structure of infinite dimensional groups
attached to Kac-Moody algebras and their flag varieties. The study of these Kac-
Moody algebras have applications throughout mathematics and mathematical
physics.
