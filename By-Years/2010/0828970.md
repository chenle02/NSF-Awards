Intellectual merit

Studying ion channels at the single molecule level commonly requires in vitro
reconstitution of a lipid bilayer, a delicate process requiring specialized
apparatus and expertise. Once formed, the bilayers are fragile and cannot be
moved, necessitating their formation at the time and point of use. Because of
these factors, specialists are the only practitioners of this technique. This is
unfortunate because membrane and ion channel measurements are often simple to
execute and interpret. Laboratory access to these systems by students typically
occurs in upper level undergraduate or graduate major courses, an unnecessary
limitation in the view of the Principal Investigator (PI). Recently, the PI has
developed a high freezing point membrane composition enabling bilayer
selfassembly to be reversibly interrupted. When frozen before bilayer formation
is complete, the bilayer precursor is sufficiently robust to enable shipping.
The subsequently thawed membranes resemble conventionally formed membranes in
every way and can also support measurements of ion channels at the single
molecule level. The PI plans to further develop this frozen membrane technology,
find optimal solution conditions and substrate materials that maximize yield and
minimize formation time.

Broader impacts

This project has a very large broader impact component. For the work on the
project itself, the research and training of one graduate and one undergraduate
student will be supported. The results of the project will be published and
presented publicly at scientific meetings. The most significant component of the
impact lies in the creation of an inexpensive and easy to use a tool for ion
channel experimentation that will be accessible by high school students not only
with respect to their background and experience but also because the apparatus
and supplies have very low cost. The PI thinks that this technology has the
potential to make a very large impact on high school science curricula as it
will add capabilities that were not possible before from an expertise and cost
perspective.
