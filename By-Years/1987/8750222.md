Undergraduate Biology students enrolled in a course entitled Microtechnique and
Its Applications are using the appropriate state-of- the-art instrumentation to
enable them to successfully cut semithin (0.5-2.0 micrometer) plastic histologic
sections. An LKB HistoRange Microknife Maker is being used to make glass Ralph
Knives, which in turn are being used to cut tissue specimens in an LKB
HistoRange Microtome. These instruments enable the students to cut semithin
sections of plastic-embedded tissue specimens. The processing of plastic
sections is an important advance in modern technical histology. Stained,
semithin preparations provide better detail of histologic structure than can be
obtained by other methods. It is important, therefore, that undergraduates learn
and practice the methodologies involved in order to keep abreast of current
advances in the field.
