The purpose of this fundamental bioengineering research is to provide the
experimental and theoretical basis for explaining the process of ablation of
tissue when using a laser. Such a model is important and necessary in order to
fully utilize this important surgical technique. The PI will initiate a research
program designed to illuminate the dynamics of the ablation process.
