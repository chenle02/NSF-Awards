9420102 Abele Many questions about phylogeny or relationships remain unresolved
for the large arthropod invertebrate group Crustacea despite years of study of
the morphology of both living and well-preserved fossil taxa. A molecular
phylogenetic approach using sequencing of 18S rDNA has resolved questions for
some groups and this award will support continued DNA sequencing work toward
developing a phylogeny or pattern of relationship for all major crustacean
groups. The molecular phylogeny will then be used to address questions of
morphological change in crustacean lineages, including whether certain suites of
characters are correlated and have changed together as functional units. %%%
Knowledge of phylogenetic relationships in this very diverse group of
invertebrate organisms will contribute to our understanding of invertebrate
biodiversity. Crustacea are especially important ecologically as they fill
several roles. In both fresh water and marine systems minute crustacea are a
major component of foodwebs. Larger crustacea include our own food resources of
lobsters, shrimp, and their relatives. And barnacles are a negatively
economically important group causing major shipping and recreational maintenance
costs each year. ***
