9422461 Novick This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) project
investigates extending the Mosaic hypermedia browser to include spoken language
as an input via interaction with a remote server with speech-capable documents
and the recognition systems needed for their use. The investigation involves the
access to a set of speech-capable documents in a server in the laboratory via
hot-links with spoken language resources, thus providing a single platform
recognizer as a potential uniform test-bed rather than differentiated
recognizers for a variety of platforms and performances. Spoken language
interactive applications are developed for server platforms providing maximum
transportability. The project extends the accessibility to browsing in a
multimedia environment while serving as a data collection and experimentation
tool as well as a realization of the usefulness of spoken language interfaces.
