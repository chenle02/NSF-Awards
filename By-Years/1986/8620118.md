Research in a variety of phenomenological and theoretical topics in elementary
particle physics will be carried out. Two projects involving heavy quarkonium
decays are planned. First, motivated by the large QCD one-loop corrections to
the decay into a Higgs boson, it is planned to calculate the one-loop
corrections due to Higgs bosons to this process in two-Higgs doublet models (as
required, for example, in all supersymmetric theories). Secondly, it is proposed
that heavy quarkonium decays into Z and ZH final states be reexamined for all S-
and P-states. It is also planned that the study of W and Z pair- production in
high-energy e e collisions in the context of a strongly-interacting electroweak
sector be udertaken. Limits on the masses and couplings of leptoquark bosons
derivable from ultrahigh-energy cosmic ray neutrino interactions will be
investigated as will the phenomenology of superstring-motivated models derived
from E . On the more theoretical side, building on previous studies (of this
author and collaborators), continued work on the effects of a finite-temperature
heat bath on the stability of spacetime is planned. Finally, two projects
involving properties of theories with unbroken supersymmetry are also proposed.
One is the investigation of sum rules in supersymmetric quantum mechanics and
their relation to special function theory in mathematics. The other will involve
one-loop calculations of various cross-sections to test for the existence of
amplitude zeros beyond tree level in supersymmetric theories. This work, by a
very highly-regarded young theoretical physicist, will add to our understanding
of the physics of certain elementary particles that, while so-far undiscovered,
are widely believed to exist, and are central to our picture of the basic forces
of nature.
