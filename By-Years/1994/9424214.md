9424214 Shah This project represents a continuation of a Research Experience for
Undergraduates site which has operated successfully for the past seven years.
Over sixty undergraduate students from a half dozen institutions in Florida have
participate in this program. The key distinctive elements of the approach at
this institution are (1) to have a full calendar year experience planned for the
participants, so that they have time to follow a substantial project of their
own through to completion, (2) to present each participant with several possible
project to topics, so that they can feel they have chosen a project which is
most interesting to them, (3) to immerse the participants in the general
research environment almost as if they were graduate students, by having them
meet with the faculty member once each week to discuss their project,
participate in the weekly research group meetings, attend research presentations
and meet with visiting researchers, and (4) to follow through over the year by
working with the students to write a technical report on their project, to study
for the GRE's and to apply to graduate programs. In past years, a large fraction
of the participants in this program have been able to prepare a paper for
submission to a conference, have the paper accepted and then attend the
conference to present the paper. Several past participants have even
accomplished substantial enough research to also result in journal publications.
Many of the past participants are now pursuing graduate studies at various
institutions. ***
