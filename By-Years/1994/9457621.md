The research explores techniques for the coordination and control of dynamic
systems, both natural and human-made. Techniques will be developing that allow
the development of robots and simulated creatures with many degrees of freedom
that can control their actions in unpredictable environments. In particular,
algorithms will be developed for dynamic error recovery in legged robots and for
the simulation of human motion.
