The sensory tissues of the nose contain cells that have microsopic hairlike
processes called cilia. The membranes of these sensory cilia are unlike those of
cilia from areas that are not sensory, in showing higher densities of
ultramicroscopic particles. It is believed that these particles seen in the
electron microscope represent large molecular species such as proteins involved
in binding important odorant molecules, or involved in control of excitation of
the cell membrane in response to odorant binding. This work will utilize unusual
high-resolution electron microscopical techniques to explore the nature of these
particles. Specific molecular probes will be used that are known to bind to
certain kinds of proteins. The localization of the bound probe molecules will be
used to infer the identity of the membrane components, and study their
distribution. These morphological properties will be compared data from
biochemical and physiological studies, to clarify how chemosensory signals are
produced in response to the presence of odors. This issue of transduction, where
an stimulus is converted into a nerve signal to the brain, is fundamental to the
operation of sensory systems. The very demanding techniques in the hands of
these particularly skilled investigators promise advances in understanding such
transduction processes.
