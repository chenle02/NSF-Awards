The Department of Natural Science and Mathematics is purchasing a UV/VIS
spectrophotometer, a fluorescence spectrophotometer, and a refrigerated
centrifuge including two rotors. This equipment markedly improves the
department's capacity to teach the methodological, quantitative, and data
analysis capabilities necessary to understand and practice modern chemistry and
molecular biology. In addition to providing the opportunity to pursue more
sophisticated and relevant laboratory exercises in the affected courses, it also
offers the opportunity to establish significant faculty and student research
programs and projects. Serving a predominantly female student population,
Trinity College offers baccalaureate majors in several natural science
disciplines, and provides approximately 10% of the elementary and secondary
school teachers entering the profession in the State of Vermont.
