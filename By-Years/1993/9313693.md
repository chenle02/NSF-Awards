Ulrich 9313693 This U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science Award supports travel
expenses of B. Ulrich, Univ. of Michigan, to Salvador (Bahia), Brazil. Dr.
Ulrich will pursue research in algebra/algebraic geometry, in collaboration with
A. Simis, the top Brazilian researcher in the field. Because the research
involves a fair amount of computations, and computational facilities at the
Univ. of Bahia are poor or non-existent, the award also covers funds for the
purchase of a McIntosh Powerbook, with the capability for running sophisticated
mathematical software. The research relates to the properties of tangent cones.
