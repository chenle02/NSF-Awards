The proposed research concerns investigations into the Kleinian group aspect of
the topology and geometry of hyperbolic structures on 3-manifolds and the
geometry of related Teichmueller spaces. This is part of a US/Russia
collaborative project with A. Tetenov (Novosibirsk Institute-Russian Academy of
Sciences).
