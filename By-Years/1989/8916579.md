This award provides funds for one-half the cost of acquiring a time-resolved
laser Raman spectrometer system that will be installed and operated in the
Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Washington. The
University of Washington is committed to providing the remaining half required.
The instrument system will be used to study the microscopic mechanism and
dynamics of solid-state phase transitions and of melting in silicates at
temperatures up to 3000K. Localized heating of the sample will involve radiation
by a continuous- power CO2 laser, with the silicate crystals or glass acting as
its own crucible container. Intense black-body radiation from the sample at
high-temperature will be suppressed using a synchronous detection technique that
involves pulsed-excitation and gated-array detection. The sample temperature
will be determined from Raman intensities by Stokes/antiStokes ratioing and by
means of a two color optical pyrometer. The high- temperature Raman spectra will
be interpreted by molecular dynamics simulations. The molecular level structures
of silicates at high-temperature are vital data for interpreting the nature of
melting and other phase transitions inside the Earth.
