Macromolecules are frequently analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography. Small
molecules are retained in the pores of a stationary medium, while larger
molecules directly are eluted. Prof. Dubin, in a program supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, is studying
additional factors which effect separations based on the size-exclusion
principle. Once a molecule enters a pore, it interacts with the surface of the
pore in a manner sufficiently complex that current theory cannot explain the
nature of the separation process. The work to be carried out under this grant
will investigate a variety of physical and chemical interaction mechanisms
between macromolecules and the surface of common porous media, thus providing a
rational basis for the design of size-exclusion separations of macromolecular
mixtures.
