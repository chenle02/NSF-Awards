Polynomial systems arise very frequently in various fields of science and
engineering, such as formula construction, geometric intersection, inverse
kinematics, robotics, vision, and the computation of equilibrium states of
chemical reaction equations. Algorithms for solving such systems numerically are
therefore highly in demand.

Over the years, practical evidence has been given that homotopy continuation
methods are efficient, reliable, and powerful in solving polynomial systems
numerically. Recently, a major computational breakthrough called the polyhedral
homotopy method emerged, making the method considerably more efficient and
powerful. Based on this new method, the software package HOM4PS-2.0 developed by
the PI has produced marvelous performance on solving a large collection of
polynomial systems and has led all the other existing codes in efficiency and
storage requirement by a huge margin.

The essence of the proposed project is the further development in all aspects of
the solver HOM4PS-2.0 as well as its parallelized version HOM4PS-2.0para, based
on the conduction of further research to greatly enlarge the scope of the
applications, especially applications to very large systems. The ultimate goal
of the project is more-complete high-quality black-box software which will
provide the general scientific community a reliable source for solving
polynomial systems on a wide variety of advanced architectures.
