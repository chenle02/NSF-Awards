&lt;br/&gt;0210365&lt;br/&gt;Jun&lt;br/&gt;This proposal was received in
response to the Nanoscale Science and Engineering Initiative NSF 01-157,
category NER.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of this research is the
optical and mechanical characterization of the&lt;br/&gt;nanoengineered collagen
tissues produced by a novel electrospinning technique&lt;br/&gt;developed at the
Virginia Commonwealth University. The prospect of using a person's&lt;br/&gt;own
cells (keratocytes) as a vehicle for development of a new cornea will also
be&lt;br/&gt;investigated by culturing corneal cells in the engineered collagen
matrix.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
