This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Alexander Meyerovich,
University of Rhode Island, and Professor F. Laloe, Laboratoire de Spectroscopie
Hertzienne, Ecole Normale Superieure, Paris, France. The objective of the
project is to provide a reliable general kinetic description of coherent
transverse effects in spin-polarized quantum systems and systems of particles
with other internal degrees of freedom. The investigators plan to l) work on a
derivation of a reliable low-temperature equation for polarized systems, 2) re-
derive the analogous equation for low-temperature and degenerate polarized
ensembles, 3) generalize the results obtained thus far to include systems with
arbitrary non- Abelian internal degrees of freedom, and 4) investigate relevant
applications. Dr. Meyerovich and Laloe are both internationally known for their
work in spin-polarized quantum systems, and this project will benefit from their
complementary expertise. The results of this research will be applicable to
ultra-cold atomic and molecular beams and ensembles, multi-state solid-state
quasi-particles and to spin dynamics in ultra-low temperature spin-polarized
quantum systems.
