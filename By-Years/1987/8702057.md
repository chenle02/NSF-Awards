In this proposal the PI will address physiolgical and structural questions
concerning the contribution of calcium (Ca) to three specific plant systems: 1)
cytokinin-induced bud formation in Funaria, 2) phytochrome-stimulated spore
germination in Onoclea, and 3) germination and pollen tube growth in
Tradescantia and Nicotiana. In the physiolgical studies he will determine if the
intracellular free Ca changes in response to a stimulus. The kinetics of Ca
changes will be examined micro- spectrophotometrically in target cells of
Funaria that have been microinjected with the absorbant Ca-indicator dye
arsenazo-III. Particular attention will also be given to the role of the
phosphatidyl inositol (PI) cycle in mediating development. Pharmacological
agents that enhance or inhibit portions of the PI cycle will be tested for their
effect on development. Structural studies will focus on cytoskeletal and
membrane components. The ability of fluxes in Ca to modify these components will
be analyzed at the light microscope level using fluorescent stains and
antibodies, and at the electron microscope level using material that has been
prepared by a rapid freeze fixation method, in which cytoplasmic structure is
preserved with exceptional fidelity. Calcium ions act as intracellular
messengers in many organisms. They are thought to couple the stimulus to the
response and thus to mediate or trigger many important developmental events. The
role of calcium ions as intracellular messengers has not been as well studied in
plants. These studies will contribute to an understanding of the role of Ca in
stimulus/response coupling in plants.
