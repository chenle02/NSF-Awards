The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to advance energy sustainability, especially
regarding estimation, understanding, and optimization of real-time grid carbon
emissions. Decarbonizing the grid means reducing its carbon emissions by
decreasing the emissions per unit of electricity generated. In-depth, accurate
knowledge of real-time grid emissions will facilitate various grid
decarbonization use cases and applications ranging from corporate carbon
accounting, carbon-aware energy management, and new emission tracking standards
to future electricity and carbon market design. More broadly, the prposed
platform may demonstrate that achieving near-optimal carbon emissions reductions
via co-optimization for costs and carbon is possible and provide a commercially
viable, scalable path for policy makers, regulators, and corporations to meet
their ambitious sustainability commitments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small
Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop novel and
practical approaches to estimate, learn, and optimize real-time grid emissions.
The Phase II project will optimize carbon estimation and forecast models,
develop decision-making algorithms, implement the proposed methods as software,
and validate the software platform through pilots. The team seeks to will build
a user-friendly, cloud-based software platform with multiple applications that
will enable climate regulators and sustainability directors to meet their public
commitments and stay compliant with new regulations. Integrating real-time
carbon emissions with energy and sustainability management is a critical
challenge. Little is known about real-time carbon signals from the grid and the
proposed project aims to demystify grid emissions to enable accurate,
actionable, and transparent carbon tracking, reporting, and
management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
