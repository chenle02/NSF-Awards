Recent advances in technology have created new methodologies in documenting
endangered languages. This project will provide an overview of these advances in
video format and will be presented by experts in field. The purpose of the
project is to support production of the highest quality of documentary
linguistic products and stimulate research in these areas. The primary audience
for these outreach videos are linguists or language experts from minority
communities who may engage in language documentation but do not have access to
state-of-the-art instruction. Over the long term, greater participation in
documenting endangered languages will contribute new knowledge of a wider array
of under-documented endangered languages each of which provide unique
information on human language and cognition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The videos
will be uploaded as YouTube videos and will be freely available online. They
will include information on tools for language analysis (transcription,
interlinear gloss creation, and acoustic analysis) and linguistic analysis
needed for dictionary, grammar, and corpus creation. Experts will also review
current standards in metadata creation and archiving, and funding mechanisms for
documentary linguistic research.
