This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program
entitled, "NUE: Introducing Nanotechnology into the Thermal and Fluids
Curricula: A Multi-Department, Modular Laboratory", at Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute (RPI) under the direction of Dr. Diana A. Borca-Tasciuc, has as its
goal to expose undergraduate students to nanoscale science and technology
aspects relevant to thermal and fluids engineering via a formal class
environment using an experiential-learning approach. Four experimental
laboratory modules will be developed to be included in two existing courses
within the Mechanical, Aerospace and Nuclear Engineering Department and the
Chemical and Biological Engineering Department. These modules will be focused on
visual demonstrations and hands-on activities focused around the study of heat
transfer, fluid flow, and capillary properties of nanofluids. By introducing the
experimental study of nanofluids into the undergraduate curriculum both missions
of promoting teaching and learning while advancing discovery and understanding
are accomplished. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will affect
approximately 250 undergraduate students annually, which represents 100% of the
undergraduate student population in Chemical Engineering and Mechanical
Engineering. Furthermore, since two of the proposed experiments employ direct
visualization of the phenomena under study, they may also be used as a simple
yet powerful demonstration of nanotechnology to a high school audience during
"Design you future day" a workshop organized annually at RPI to encourage women
to pursue engineering careers.
