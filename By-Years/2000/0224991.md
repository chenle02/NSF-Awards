This project applies state-of-the-art techniques of materials processing and
characterization to the study of piezoelectric oxide materials, to establish
quantitative links between domain orientation and the various mechanisms of
poling. Monotonic and cyclic poling via electrical, mechanical and
electromechanical processes are investigated, to determine their effects on the
polycrystalline texture and domain orientation within the materials. The texture
information, in turn, will be correlated to the piezoelectric response of the
material, providing a fundamental understanding of the interrelationships
between the processing, structure and properties of these materials. We will
also study the degradation of the materials under service conditions, attempting
to mitigate the process of piezoelectric
fatigue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Piezoelectric materials are increasingly important
as the active components of a wide range of devices, including various types of
strain sensor, linear actuators and non-magnetic electrical microtransformers
for high-frequency applications such as cell-phones. In all of these
applications, the performance of the material is strongly linked to the manner
in which it is processed. Since most pieozoelectric materials respond to stress
(or conversely to electric fields) only in a single direction, related to their
crystallography, it makes sense to design devices in which the desired response
direction is related to the crystal structure of the material. If, however, the
material is comprised of randomly-oriented crystals, with randomly-oriented
piezoelectric response directions, there is no opportunity to achieve such an
efficient device design. We seek, in this program, to find practical, low-cost
methods of developing crystalline alignment that allows for optimized device
performance, in applications such as vibration sensors and active vibration
damping systems.&lt;br/&gt;
