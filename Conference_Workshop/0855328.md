Abstract Dykema

Partial participant support is requested for the Seventh East Coast Operator
Algebras Symposium (ECOAS), to be held at Texas A&M University in College
Station, Texas, during a weekend1 in late September or October, 2009. It is
expected that the conference will host 50?80 participants, including 40?50
graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. This will be the seventh annual
meeting in the East Coast Operator Algebra Symposium series. The first meeting
in the series was held at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, in the fall of
2003, and since then meetings have been held each fall. The focus of the
meetings is on operator algebras and non-commutative geometry, with applications
to a wide range of areas from number theory to quantum physics. In addition to
facilitating interaction between researchers in the field, the East Coast
Operator Algebra Symposia are forums in which young researchers, graduate
students and postdoctoral fellows in the eastern region of the United States can
acquaint hemselves with current issues at the forefront of research, present
their own work, and interact with senior mathematicians in the field.
