This project is designed to further develop a prototype for a chemical method
for making a thin film solar cell material. The team has developed a deposition
process using raw materials composed of highly abundant and non-toxic elements
to produce an environmentally-friendly and low-cost solar cell. Prototype
development will involve flow-through reactors where several processes happen
simultaneously and synergistically. The team will be looking to further
understand the heat flow, chemical diffusion, reaction kinetics, surface
nucleation, viscosity effects and reaction byproducts of the
method.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successfully developed, this technology could
facilitate adoption of solar energy production by significantly reducing solar
cell production costs. Broad adoption of solar is a key element in the global
effort to reduce the negative effects of climate change and this technology
could play a prominent role in leveraging solar energy to reduce dependence on
fossil fuel sources.
