This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research in chemical
engineering between John F. Brady of the California Institute of Technology and
Georges Bossis of the University of Nice. The objectives of their research are
to demonstrate that short-term range repulsion does not change the rheological
behavior of hard-sphere suspensions, and to determine the minimum size of a
particle which can be used in electrorheological fluids without melting the
chemical chains. The research involves the use of Stokesian dynamics. The will
work on a third, but related project, a monograph on suspension of dynamics. The
U.S. and French investigators have a long-standing collaboration and are co-
inventors of Stokesian dynamics. The U.S. investigator and his group will carry
out the electrorheological fluid simulations. This will be complemented by
French investigators work on the simulations of short-term range repulsions. The
project will advance our understanding of the physics of suspensions and their
role in the engineering of new materials.
