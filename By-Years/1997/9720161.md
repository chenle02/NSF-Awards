9720161 SCAMEHORN This award will support continuation of a collaborative
research project involving faculty at the University of Oklahoma and Tulsa
University and Kimberly-Clark Corporation, an industry partner based in Addison,
Wisconsin. Parallel research efforts will address means of removing printed inks
from plastic films used in packaging along with development of alternative and
more readily removable inks (both research thrusts relate to production of
clear, recyclable plastic film). Other industries have evidenced interest in
this developing technology. The Advisory Board of the University of Oklahoma s
Institute for Applied Surfactant Research will be asked to provide technology
transfer advice in this new area, at present, and the investigators are
contemplating establishment of a new Center for Deinking Studies that would
pursue both federal and industrial support to sustain research leading to
commercialization of environmentally safe processes/products. Development of
environmentally benign processes for reducing environmental degradation (i.e.
plastics in landfills) is timely, of national and international interest, and
highly relevant for the packaging industry. Prospects exist for technology
transfer and contributions to economic growth and development in Oklahoma.
