DMS-9500794 PI: Koranyi Koranyi will continue his investigation of
quasiconformal maps in the context of Cauchy-Riemann manifolds. Part of the
project is the study of Poisson transforms on vector bundles and their
interaction with homogeneous differential operators. A second direction will be
the study of boundary behavior for harmonic functions. A third direction will be
the use of the harmonic analysis of the symmetric space of positive definite
matrices to obtain methods of best estimation of a Gaussain distribution in the
presence of some prior information. The analysis involved in this research rests
on the theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian mathematician
Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in twentieth century mathematics.
As the mathematical vehicle for exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system,
the representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact upon
mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number theory, and upon
theoretical physics, especially quantum mechanics and elementary particle
physics.
