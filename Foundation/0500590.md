In this project the principal investigator will apply methods from computability
theory and other branches of logic and theoretical computer science to study the
effective content and proof-theoretic strength of various areas of mathematics.
In particular, he will concentrate on effective randomness, computable model
theory, and reverse mathematics and effectiveness of combinatorial principles.
He will study the relative randomness of reals, using methods from computability
theory and algorithmic information theory, concentrating in particular on the
K-trivial reals, a natural class of reals that are far from random with with
many compelling properties and applications. In computable model theory, he will
continue the development of methods to address issues raised by effectivizing
model-theoretic notions, including the relationships between the different ways
that a given structure may be effectivized; the relationships between the degree
of effectivity of different models of theories with few models; and the degrees
of special models, such as prime, homogeneous, and saturated models, of complete
decidable theories. He will also study computability-theoretic and proof-
theoretic aspects of combinatorial principles such as versions of Ramsey's
Theorem and principles related to partial and linear orderings, exploiting the
connections between effective mathematics and the reverse mathematics program.

The study of the effective content of mathematics has received increasing
attention in the last few decades. It is a natural outgrowth of the efforts to
understand and formalize the notions of algorithm and computable function
undertaken in the early part of the twentieth century. It is of both pure
mathematical and foundational interest, and has important connections with
computer science. This project aims to further our understanding of how
structure affects computability, and how computability interacts with other
fundamental notions of modern mathematics and foundations of mathematics, such
as randomness and proof-theoretic strength. Computability theorists have
developed a highly successful theory of relative computational complexity of
sets of numbers, which, in addition to its intrinsic mathematical interest, has
been influential in theoretical computer science. One of the goals of this
project is to continue the development of an emerging parallel theory of
relative algorithmic randomness, which can act as a theoretical framework in
which to consider questions such as: When should we say that an infinite set is
more random than another, and what consequences does the relative randomness of
sets have for their relative computational complexity?
