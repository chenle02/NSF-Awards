The set of all possible configurations of a physical system generally has the
structure of a symplectic manifold. When one restricts to configurations with a
fixed energy, one typically obtains a contact manifold. Understanding the
geometry of symplectic manifolds and contact manifolds is thus important to
understanding the dynamics of physical systems. The following two geometric
questions about such manifolds are of particular interest. First, one would like
to understand Reeb orbits on contact manifolds, which correspond to physical
behavior which repeats over time. Second, one would like to understand when one
symplectic manifold can be symplectically embedded into another, in order to
better understand the relations between different symplectic manifolds. Contact
homology is a powerful tool, currently under development, which can be applied
to both of these questions.

The project will develop the foundations, computation, and applications of
various kinds of contact homology. In particular, embedded contact homology
(ECH) will be extended to a functor on three-dimensional contact manifolds and
four-dimensional strong symplectic cobordisms. The foundations of ECH and other
kinds of contact homology will be constructed directly in terms of holomorphic
curves when possible, in order to more closely relate them to geometry. ECH
capacities (quantitative invariants which obstruct symplectic embeddings in four
dimensions) will be computed in more examples and related to geodesic flows and
Hamiltonian dynamics. Analogues of ECH capacities for other kinds of contact
homology, such as cylindrical contact homology and rational symplectic field
theory, will be constructed and studied. These new tools will be used to explore
whether the Weinstein conjecture can be extended by increasing the lower bound
on the number of Reeb orbits or proving the existence of short Reeb orbits.
