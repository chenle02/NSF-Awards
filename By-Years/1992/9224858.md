9224858 Lincoln Logical elegance and execution speed are typically thought to be
incompatible traits of declarative programs, but recent developments in
resource-conscious logics indicate that it might be possible to resolve this
tension. Type systems for functional languages based on linear logic can be
exploited by compilers to generate optimized target code. Linear logic can also
be used as a computational framework for logic programming. Logic programming
calculi will be enriched with control and update primitives inspired by the
linear connectives. Insights from logic, type theory, and automated reasoning
will enhance both the expressiveness and execution speed of declarative
programming languages. ***
