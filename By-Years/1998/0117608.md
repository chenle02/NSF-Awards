Although social scientists have often studied fear of crime, they know little
about the underlying character and dynamics of that fear, and how it affects the
social life of urban communities. This project therefore examines how actors
socially construct fear of crime as a means of understanding places, events,
relationships, and groups in society. In turn, it examines how people experience
crime and cope with its risks. The data on these topics come from direct
observation of and face-to-face interviews with residents of two neighborhoods
(the Lower East Side and Flatbush/Midwood areas of New York City). The detailed
case study of these two areas and their inhabitants not only offers information
on the sources of fear of crime, but also has implications for the vitality,
safety, and future of urban neighborhoods.
