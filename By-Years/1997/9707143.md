In this project of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program in the Chemistry
Division with support for instrumentation from the Office of Multidisciplinary
Activities, Prof. Harry Tom will develop and characterize a new type of coherent
spectroscopy for surface optical phonons and for low frequency adsorbate-
substrate vibrational modes. The work here will establish general mechanisms for
creating and detecting coherent phonon oscillations on a large number of
surfaces. Establishing the energy and dephasing relaxation times for these low
frequency modes is an outstanding problem in surface dynamics. Both
semiconductor (GaAs and Si) and metal (Cu and alkali-covered Cu) surfaces will
be examined. The time-resolved surface second-harmonic generation signal (TRSHG)
technique to be developed here has several advantages over existing
spectroscopic techniques, such as better spectral resolution and higher signal-
to-noise ratio, and it is the only coherent technique for studying surface
phonons.
