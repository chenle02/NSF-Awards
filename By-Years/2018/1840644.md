The National Center for Women and Information Technology (NCWIT) proposes a
project to contribute to the design and population of the Broadening
Participation in Computing (BPC) Network Resource Portal (BPCNet), an online set
of resources to connect computing researchers with resources and opportunities
to participate in BPC activities. NCWIT will collaborate with the Computing
Research Association (CRA) in the design and implementation of BPCNet, providing
program scaffolding, resources and advice, and playing a key role in its
management and leadership. In addition, NCWIT will extend the activities of its
most successful and scalable programs to include Computer and Information
Sciences and Engineering (CISE) researchers. These include Aspirations in
Computing, AspireIT, Counselors for Computing, and Extension Services for
Undergraduate Programs, as well as other resources that have been evaluated and
packaged as easy to use programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NCWIT's large coalition
of corporations, startups, academic institutions, government agencies, and non-
profit organizations have a proven track record of successful programs that aim
to increase the participation of women in computing. The Aspirations in
Computing program, for example, supports women and girls throughout their entire
academic and career pipeline by providing access to scholarships, internships,
and job opportunities. All of NCWIT's programs involve participation of multiple
stakeholders, and thus provide an extensive network that will be key in
developing the strategy and infrastructure for the BPCNet
initiative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by NSF INCLUDES, which
focuses on catalyzing the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics
enterprise to collaboratively work for inclusive
change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
