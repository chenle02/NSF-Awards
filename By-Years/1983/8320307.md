This research consists of a program of theoretical investigations into problems
in the large-scale structure and instabilities in shear flow. The object is to
gain physical insight into situations where the large-scale structure and
instabilities play the essential role in shear flow development. Such organized
structures, in addition to being fundamental in turbulent shear flows, are
important to the understanding of jet noise, combustor efficiency, and to the
natural mixing processes in the atmosphere and ocean.
