9423929 Jacobson This is a research equipment grant (REG) for the purchase of
workstations to support computational research projects in the areas of large-
scale simulation and mathematical programming. The equipment is to be housed in
an existing laboratory on simulation and optimization. The new equipment will be
used to support a host of research projects , including computational research
necessary to assess the viability of new algorithms for verifying simulation
model structural properties, test new simulation algorithms that study the
design of efficient and effective manufacturing processes, assess the efficiency
of new steady state simulation sensitivity estimators, as well as design and
test algorithms for solving large-scale mixed integer zero-one problems,
nonlinear and nonconvex engineering design problems, and various transportation
and distribution problems. Because of the enhanced speed and memory storage
capacity, the workstations requested will provide the resources necessary to
undertake in-depth testing and analysis of algorithms in several areas of
research currently pursued by the investigators. This could lead to improvement
that would otherwise not be possible. In addition, both graduate and
undergraduate students will benefit from the new hardware. The use of the
equipment by graduate students will allow them to investigate larger and more
meaningful research problems. For undergraduates, the use of the equipment in
support of classroom instructions will expose them to the applications of modern
computing facilities to solve large-scale engineering problems.
