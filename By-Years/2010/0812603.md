With the recent emergence of many severe human diseases (e.g., West Nile, SARS,
Hantavirus), it has become increasingly important to understand the factors that
determine whether pathogens evolve to become virulent or benign. The
conventional wisdom states that a pathogen should always evolve towards a benign
coexistence with its host. However, there is substantial evidence that pathogens
sometimes evolve to cause severe disease, suggesting that high virulence may be
advantageous in some cases. This is referred to as virulence trade-offs. In this
project the fish virus IHNV and its rainbow trout host will be used to explore
the evolution of virulence. Virus strains that differ in virulence will be
tested in a novel system for quantifying viral fitness during infection in
living juvenile trout. Results will be used to develop a population-scale model
that will identify factors predicted to lead to increased virulence. Finally,
the model predictions will be tested by comparing virulence of virus field
strains that occur in different environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The evolution
of pathogen virulence has become a major field of investigation and numerous
theoretical models have been developed invoking virulence trade-offs. Progress
in this field is hampered by a general lack of experimental data, particularly
in vertebrate host-pathogen systems. In this project a combination of
experimental and theoretical approaches will provide novel information on the
existence and nature of virulence tradeoffs, enhancing our understanding of how
important veterinary and human diseases emerge. The project will also train
graduate and undergraduate students, including individuals from groups under-
represented in the sciences.&lt;br/&gt;
