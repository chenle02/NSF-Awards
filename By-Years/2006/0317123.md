ABSTRACT

The long-term goal of this proposal is to understand how associative learning
occurs. Previous studies have shown that neurons involved in such behavioral
modification (associative learning) undergo several structural, biophysical, and
biochemical changes within the cell bodies in neurons. Neurons communicate with
each other at the synapse where axons make contacts. The goal of this project is
to understand the synaptic mechanisms, at the axonal level, which underlie
associative learning in a sea slug (Hermissenda crasicornis).

Established behavior paradigms, as well as biochemical, and physiological
methods, will be employed to understand the mechanisms of associative learning
in the animal. Although the sea slug is considered a 'simple' model, recent
evidence suggests that many of the physiological changes that occur during
learning may be conserved across species. Because Hermissenda is a simple model,
several experimental manipulations that are impossible to undertake in higher
vertebrates are possible in this animal model. It is predicted that several
biochemical and electrophysiological changes ensue during, and after learning in
the axons. These changes could alter the electrical properties of the neurons,
which would result in memory acquisition. The significance of this project
transcends its contribution towards our understanding of learning and memory,
since it also has a broader impact in educating the public in neurobiology,
marine biology, and ecology. In addition students, including minorities and
international scholars, will be involved in collecting Hermissenda, conducting
the studies, and facilitate a basic understanding of the mechanisms underlying
learning and memory.
