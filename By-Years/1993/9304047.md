9304047 Johnson This award provides 68 percent of the funding required for the
acquisition of an ultra-precise surveying system or "total station" that will be
used by the Principal Investigator and colleagues and students in the Department
of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Purdue University. The University is
committed to providing the remaining funds needed for the acquisition. The total
station system combines an electronic theodolite and an electronic distance
measurement device with computer processing to establish mapping control points
in an x, y, z geometric reference frame for creating detailed geologic maps with
sub- millimeter precision. ***
