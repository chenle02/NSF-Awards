The aim of this proposed work is the development of new scalable algorithms and
software to&lt;br/&gt;address a number of outstanding problems arising in
scientific computing applications. In particular,computationally complex
simulations that demand the solution of multi-scale or multi-physics models will
benefit. A significant component of this research will be the collaboration with
applications scientists considering problems of this
nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project PIs have had significant experience and
success in the development of scalable&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for the fundamental
problems inherent in unstructured mesh calculations.&lt;br/&gt;The realization
of this toolkit will be a significant resource enabling educators and
scientists&lt;br/&gt;to make better use of the large-scale computing
infrastructure. This proposed work is driven through signi.cant collaborations
by the PIs with other NSF-funded initiatives at Universities,on-going work at
the National Laboratories,and with Industry. These collaborations will promote
widespread use of the toolkit as well as feedback to ensure that the toolkit
developed is relevant to user needs. The toolkit will be disseminated into the
public domain, as well as through direct collaboration, to ensure widespread
use.&lt;br/&gt;
