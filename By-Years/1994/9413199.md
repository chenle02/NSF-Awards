9413199 Burris, J. The Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) will purchase
laboratory and multi-user equipment that will benefit resident and visiting
scientists and the educational program. The acquired equipment will support
ongoing efforts in environmental, cell, and organismal biology, increasing
capabilities in sample analysis and preparation for a variety of studies. The
acquisition addresses the capability to precisely and accurately measure the
nitrogen and carbon contents and to determine the carbon quality of plant
tissue, litter, soil and sediment samples that are central to the research of
the MBL's Ecosystems Center and to visiting collaborators from other
institutions. In order to achieve this capability MBL will obtain a near
infrared reflectance (NIR) analysis system for rapid, non-destructive
measurements of samples. The NIR system would consist of an NIR analyzer, a
dedicated personal computer to run NIR software, and a large capacity grinding
mill for preparing samples. The second acquisition addresses the ability to
prepare biological samples and preparations in order to apply modern molecular
biology methods to their study. Small quantity, high-quality, centrifuges are
essential to this preparation, and MBL will acquire a Micro- Ultracentrifuge
that will provide this capability for visiting researchers and appropriate
educational users.
