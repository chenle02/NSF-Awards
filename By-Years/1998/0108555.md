DEB-0108555&lt;br/&gt;Jimmy McGuire&lt;br/&gt;Robert
Dudley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A grant has been awarded to Drs. Jimmy A. McGuire of
Louisiana State University and Robert Dudley of the University of Texas at
Austin to investigate the role that morphology and physiology have played in the
evolution of flight performance in hummingbirds. More specifically, they will
generate a phylogenetic tree describing the species-level genealogy for 300
species of hummingbirds and will then use this genealogy as the framework for
comparative analysis. To produce this tree, they will sequence five genes (one
mitochondrial and 4 nuclear) and then analyze these genetic data by applying a
recently developed model-based method of phylogenetic analysis. In the second
component of the project, they are measuring flight performance across the
diversity of hummingbirds to evaluate how variation in morphological design
affects locomotor performance, and how hummingbirds that occur at high elevation
compensate for reduced air density and oxygen content in this aerodynamically
challenging environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The phylogenetic analysis is not
only critical for statistical analysis of flight performance data, but will also
be invaluable to the larger community of evolutionary biologists that utilize
hummingbirds as the "model system" for their own investigations. This work is
also of general importance because it will substantially improve current
understanding of animal flight by utilizing comparative performance data. These
data are extremely difficult to obtain for other vertebrate species, but
tractable in hummingbirds because of their use of hovering flight.&lt;br/&gt;
