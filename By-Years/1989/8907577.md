The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary cooperative research project between
Dr. Kenneth Stevenson of Purdue University and Dr. Otto Horvath of Veszprem
University is to better define the photophysics and photochemistry of
halocuprates through continuous photolysis and time-resolved studies of
transient absorbance and luminescence research. Results are expected to broaden
fundamental knowledge of the photochemistry of these copper (I) complexes having
CTTS (charge-transfer-to-solvent) absorption bands. In particular, the intent is
to determine whether there are trends for all halocuprates, may the trends be
assigned to both cationic and anionic complexes and do complexes also exhibit
CTTS behavior. This project in inorganic chemistry fulfills the program
objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the
United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool
research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
