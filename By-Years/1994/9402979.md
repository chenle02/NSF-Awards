9402979 Leibovich This study seeks to acquire a better understanding of joint
effects of surface waves and turbulence in the upper ocean. The rationale for
the research is based on recent experiments which showed that turbulence in the
oceanic mixed layer is characterized by an important Langmuir circulation
component, which is distinguished by the effect of surface waves. The study will
apply large eddy simulation (LES) to the Craik-Leibovich theory of Langmuir
circulation and the results will be compared with experimental data. ***
