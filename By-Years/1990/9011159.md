This is a post-event investigation project to learn engineering lessons from
the Loma Prieta earthquake (October 1989). The Loma Prieta earthquake induced
munerous incidents of damage to both ground-based and elevated tanks, and even
to some of the retrofitted tanks. In particular, site amplification of long
period ground motion components appears to be the cause of large amplitude
sloshing and associated damage to tanks built on Bay Mud. In this project the
data collected will be analyzed to evaluate the performance of tank structures.
The tasks include: (1) collection of data and documentation of the damage
sustained by ground-based water and petroleum storage tanks and by elevated
water storage tanks, (2) calculation of the dynamic response of representative
tanks and correlation of the computed response with observed damage or lack of
damage, (3) study of the effects of site amplification of long period components
on the sloshing phenomenon and on rocking motion of tanks founded on Bay Mud,
(4) study of the damage to retrofitted tanks to deduce the reasons for the
ineffectiveness of the implemented retrofit mechanisms, and (5) comparison of
induced seismic forces with those specified by available codes and standards
such as API 650, AWWA 100 and UBC. By comparison of the predicted response with
actual behavior under earthquake loading, the analytical methods developed for
response calculation of tanks will be refined and improved design procedures
will be developed.
