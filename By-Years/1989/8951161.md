The importance of electro-optics and fiber optics in electrical engineering has
lead to the development of two elective courses with weekly laboratory sessions
utilizing basic equipment. The laboratory is being upgraded to include more
critical equipment and to provide more opportunities for hands-on
experimentation by the students.
