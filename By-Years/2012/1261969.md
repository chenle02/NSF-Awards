For the further exploration of the newly discovered Higgs boson and for gaining
more precise understanding of new physics, an electron positron collider
operating in the 300 to 1000 GeV energy range would be a powerful research
facility. Two candidate e+e- collider technologies exist, the International
Linear Collider (ILC) based upon superconducting accelerating structures, and
the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) using structures powered by an intense drive
beam of electrons. This award supports the continued participation and
leadership of Prof Paul Grannis of SUNY at Stony Brook in the international
electron positron collider effort as a member of the Linear Collider Steering
Group of the Americas (LCSGA). The broader impacts of the effort are strategic,
giving the US a significant role in an important area of global science.
