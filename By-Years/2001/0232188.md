This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate
the feasibility of developing temporal extensions to a commercial Geographic
Information System (GIS). In many fields, temporal information is a key part of
the domain models. For instance, a demographer studying population changes, an
environmental biologist investigating migration patterns, or a public official
looking for patterns of criminal activity all need a system that can work with
data that have both spatial and temporal dimensions. Temporal extensions would
leverage the strength of an existing GIS system and market demand for spatio-
temporal support is growing, but response by GIS vendors has been minimal.

The research will lead to the development of a marketable product in the form of
extension software to be sold to current and future customers of existing GIS
systems. The range of application includes natural resource management,
meteorology, agriculture, health, archeology, crime detection and prevention,
urban development, and other applications in government, military, and corporate
environments.
