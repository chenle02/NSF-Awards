Problems in Surface Geometry and Topology Abstract Howard Masur

The principal investigator proposes to work on problems in the geometry and
topology of surfaces. The geometric problems consist of studying the dynamics of
flows on flat surfaces with cone angle singularities. A particular example is
the study of billiards in polygons with angles that are rational multiples of
pi. The particular aspect of this study will be to attempt to find the
asymptotic growth rate for the number of periodic orbits. For some billiards
such as the square, the growth rate is known. Other more interesting examples
are certain right triangles. The principal investigator will study additional
examples such as the square with a slit or barrier. The idea is to find
asymptotic quadratic estimates. The topological problems concern the mapping
class group of a surface. This group is one of the main objects of study in
surface topology. One of the recent developments in group theory is to study the
large scale or asymptotic geometry of a group. The principal investigator
proposes to study the large scale geometry of the mapping class group with a
goal of showing that the mapping class group is quasi-isometrically rigid.

In the field of dynamical systems one studies the motion of objects. The field
had its origins in the study of the motion of the planets. Billiards are another
closely related example. There one has a point mass that moves in straight lines
so that when it encounters the boundary of a region, it rebounds so that the
angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence. Billiards have been studied
for over 100 years. In order to understand such a dynamical system one needs to
understand the long term behavior of the orbits. One particular example of this
long term behavior are the study of the periodic orbits. These are the orbits
that repeat themselves. The study of periodic orbits for billiards in polygons
in the plane is the main subject of this proposal.
