The objective of this project is to determine how the fine- scale patterns of
herd size, inter-individual distance, herd spacing, and herd movement in
antelope are affected by the fine- scale spatial distribution and patchiness of
their food supply. The project both addresses important current theoretical
issues in behavioral ecology and provides highly relevant information for range
management and conservation. The study will focus primarily on Thomson's
gazelles and will be carried out in Kenya for a three-year period. The basic
research questions involve the testing and refinement of several current animal
settlement and optimal group size models. Computerized graphical techniques will
be used to define the food patch pattern. The dispersion and movement of
gazelles over these areas will be mapped at intervals using a highly accurate
laser rangefinder and a computerized navigational system. Food intake rates will
be measured and radio-tracking of selected individuals, aerial surveys,
controlled manipulations of food distributions, and comparative observations on
other antelope species will be conducted. The investigators will be working in
close collaboration with several Kenyan biologists: Dr. Jonah Western of
Wildlife Conservation International, Dr. David Andere of KREMU (Kenya Rangeland
Environmental Monitoring Unit), and a graduate student from the University of
Nairobi. KREMU is charged with monitoring rangeland use by both wild and
domestic stock as well as agricultural land use. As Kenya's population continues
to grow, important decisions will have to be made concerning these three
critical resources. Most of their current data rely on aerial surveys. They are
particularly interested in the ground-level techniques developed in this project
for monitoring fine-grained dispersion of animals. Herd size and movement rates
may prove to be a more sensitive and instantaneous index of habitat quality than
overall animal densities. Dr. Western is an expert on the large mammal community
of Amboseli National Park as well as the behavioral ecology of the Maasai
tribesmen and their cattle. He will be conducting parallel studies of herd size
and spacing on domestic stock, where herd size, herd movement rate, and inter-
individual spacing can be experimentally manipulated. The combined results of
both studies will have important implications for the management of domestic and
wild herds.
