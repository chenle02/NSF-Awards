The goal of this research is to develop a potential reduction algorithm, based
on recent results for analytic centers and their associated potential functions,
that (1) allows column generation, (2) whose complexity does not depend on the
full system of constraints and (3) that is implementable with practical
efficiency. This type of a technique permits a great deal of flexibility for
solving such optimization programs as semi-infinite programs, convex nonlinear
programs and combinatorial optimization problems, in which the number of
constraints is very large or some constraints are not explicitly known.
