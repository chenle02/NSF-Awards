The program "Algebraic Graph Theory" will run from June 17-28, 2013, at the
University of Wyoming. This summer school is part of an annual program sponsored
by the Rocky Mountain Mathematics Consortium (RMMC). The purpose of this program
is to introduce graduate students and researchers to topics in algebraic graph
theory and their applications, foster collaboration, and build ties between
young researchers. Daily lectures will provide the participants with background
in the subject, and contributed talks and problem sessions in the afternoon will
reinforce the lectures and give the participants a chance to work together on
open problems.

The use of algebraic techniques to solve graph theory problems has been a very
fruitful approach, and continues to have applications beyond pure mathematics to
physics, computer science, biology and statistics. The topics covered include
spectral graph theory with applications to quantum computing, association
schemes with applications to design and coding theory, and graph polynomials
with applications to the Potts model and DNA self-assembly. The aim is for a
diverse body of student and researchers. Participation of members of groups
underrepresented in mathematics is encouraged and supported.
