9418068 DeFanti This Metacenter Regional Alliance will tie together three
complementary organizations: the Metacenter, the Software Technologies Research
Center (STRC) at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), and the Chicago
Manufacturing Center (CMC). The organizing principle is the provision of a high-
end testbed for virtual reality applied to manufacturing product design and
rapid prototyping, to both large companies and consortia of small ones. The
proposal will create and transfer the technology of virtual reality within the
National Information Infrastructure. The software and advanced human interface
technology for remote virtual prototyping and its supercomputing support will be
developed with regional metacenter partners and small businesses. The proposed
link to the vBNS is a vital part of this proposal. The STRC has demonstrated
over a twenty year history that it can apply visualization technology to many
areas, e.g., education, manufacturing, and training. It has provided the
expertise that culminated in the CAVE virtual reality theater at the SIGGRAPH
and Supercomputing conferences. CMC manages one of the newest NIST regional
manufacturing Centers whose aim is to assist small and medium sized businesses
modernize operations and improve competitiveness. Through its partnership with
STRC, CMC, and NCSA this Alliance has the opportunity to provide leadership in
areas of HPCC technology deployment to the Chicago region, and create a paradigm
that can be replicated by other urban research institutions.
