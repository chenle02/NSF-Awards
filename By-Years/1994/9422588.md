In collaboration with Robert Winkler of Duke University, this PI proposes to
develop procedures using the copula approach in order to assess dependence. The
situations in which this approach will be applied are expert knowledge ones in
which the decision maker must consider a set of interrelated random variables.
The research will involve the mathematical development and analysis of families
of copulas and dependence measures, the design of assessment procedures,
laboratory studies to test the ability of experts to understand the procedures,
development of computational procedures, field studies with real-world
knowledge-modeling applications, and the construction of protocols and general
prescriptive recommendations for dependence assessment.
