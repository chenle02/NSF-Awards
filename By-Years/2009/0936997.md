The Division of Chemistry supports Debraj Ghosh of the University of California
- Santa Cruz as an American Competitiveness in Chemistry Fellow. Dr. Ghosh will
investigate the preparation and characterization of semiconductor-metal hybrid
nanostructures for use as potential electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction. Dr.
Ghosh will work in collaboration with scientists at the Molecular Foundry at
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. In his plan for broadening participation,
Dr. Ghosh will work with local area high schools to teach students about
emerging alternative energy technologies. In addition, Dr. Ghosh will sponsor
and mentor three undergraduate students to do summer research at the Molecular
Foundry.

Research like that of Dr. Ghosh is aimed at developing better materials for fuel
cells. The ultimate goal of research like this is to increase the efficiency for
conversion of fuel to energy in these devices. These improvements will help
society become more sustainable. The efforts at broadening participation being
pursued by Dr. Ghosh are aimed at increasing the participation of young people
from underrepresented groups in the sciences.
