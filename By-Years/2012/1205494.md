In this project the PI will study the population and information dynamics that
drive the infection of the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans by the opportunistic
bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The worm offers advantages as a host model: its
geometry is simple and it is easy to cultivate and image, while mechanism of
infection and innate immune response are evolutionary conserved. The physical
locomotion of bacteria within the host, their sensation of the host environment,
and their adaptation and collective response will be imaged and quantified. Data
will be analyzed and compiled into a theoretical framework, inspired by the
physics of population dynamics and the statistical mechanics of ordering
phenomena in disordered systems. This project will provide detailed description
of within-host bacterial dynamics, believed to be key determinant in evolution
of virulence and resistance to infection. While the project will focus on
infection of C. elegans, emerging theoretical concepts are expected to be
broadly applicable. Novel tools will be developed to permit long-term high-
resolution imaging. The true interdisciplinary nature of the project and the
general interest in pathogenesis bear the potential to attract a diverse cohort
of students. The PI will develop a new course intended for advanced
undergraduate and graduate students, which will discuss a spectrum of dynamical
biological systems and develop the theoretical and practical aspects of modeling
a complex biological system. The PI will establish a discussion group to
accompany the project, composed of undergraduate students and public school
teachers.

This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program
in the Division of Physics and the Physiological and Structural Systems in the
Division of Integrative Organismal Systems.
