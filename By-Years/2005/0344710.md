The proposed research aims to identify the genes responsible for adaptive
coloration in natural populations of beach mice (Peromyscus polionotus). Beach
mice are an extremely pale relative of the darker inland forms. This reduction
in pigmentation is an adaptation for camouflage, as these mice inhabit the
light-colored sand dunes of barrier islands off the coast of Florida and
Alabama. The goal of this study is to be able to use both patterns of gene
expression and genetic mapping to identify genetic regions that are responsible
for adaptive color differences between island and mainland populations. A second
goal is to understand how these genes interact to produce coat color patterns.
Together, these results will shed light on the genetic basis of adaptation and
the role of gene interactions in complex morphological evolution of natural
populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because the relationship between color
variation and natural selection is straightforward in this system, the proposed
work is expected to be an appealing example of the genetics of adaptation and to
have an impact on the biological community as well as be accessible to society
in general. In addition, the integrative nature of this project highlights the
utility of combining ecological, evolutionary and genetic research to understand
biological diversity. Finally, the P.I. and current graduate students are all
female, and thus this project incorporates researchers traditionally
underrepresented in evolutionary biology.&lt;br/&gt;
