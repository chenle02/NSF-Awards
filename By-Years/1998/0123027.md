The Information Technology Scholars (ITS) program is using a grant from the
National Science Foundation's Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics
Scholarship (CSEMS) program to establish ongoing support for academically
promising students with financial need to graduate with a Bachelor of Science in
Computer Science from St. Bonaventure University and to enter the workforce as
information technology professionals. The CSEMS funds are used to support four
students for four years and an additional four students for three years. The
university will continue the program by funding the final year of the second
cohort of students and by providing four-year awards to two students per year
annually. &lt;br/&gt;The program is designed to attract students who have
demonstrated a strong work ethic and commitment to computer science as high
school students. The Department will use the one hundred and fifty high school
teachers who have participated in departmental outreach programs to recommend
students for the program. &lt;br/&gt;The Department has an exemplary record for
preparing undergraduates for entry-level positions in information technology.
Since 1989 100% of its graduates have entered the workforce as computer
professionals or have gone on for further study at the graduate level in
computer science.&lt;br/&gt;
