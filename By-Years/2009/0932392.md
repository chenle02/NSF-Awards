CPS: Small: Community-based Sense &amp; Respond -- Theory and
Applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to address a
fundamental question in cyber-physical systems: What is the ideal structure of
systems that detect critical events ? such as earthquakes ? by using data from
large numbers of sensors held and managed by ordinary people in the community?
The approach is to develop theory about widely-distributed sense and respond
systems, using dynamic ? and possibly unreliable ? networks using sensors and
responders installed and managed by ordinary citizens, and to apply the theory
to problems important to society, such as responding to
earthquakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This research develops
theory and prototype implementations of community-based sense-and-respond
systems that enable people help one another in societal crises. The number of
participants in such systems may change rapidly; some participants may be
unreliable and some may even deliberately attack systems; and the structures of
networks change as crises unfold. Such systems must function in rare critical
situations; so designs, analyses and tests of these systems must give confidence
that they will function when the crisis hits. The proposed research will show
how to design systems with organic growth, unreliable components and
connections, security against rogue components, and methods of demonstrating
reliability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: People want to help one
another in a crisis. Cheap sensors, mobile phones, and laptops enable people to
use information technology to help. This research empowers ordinary citizens
collaborate to overcome crises. The researchers collaborate with the US
Geological Service, Southern California Edison, and Microsoft, and will host
3,000 students at a seismic facility&lt;br/&gt;
