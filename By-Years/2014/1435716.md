The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP)
through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and
study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the
preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue
STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Delaware State University
seeks to enhance the undergraduate chemistry program in by infusing sustainable
chemistry concepts in courses and laboratories, with the goal to increase
recruitment, retention, and graduation rates of chemistry majors.

The specific objectives of the project are to: 1) develop a course and
laboratory in sustainable chemistry; 2) infuse sustainability and green
chemistry concepts in the existing chemistry undergraduate curriculum; 3)
integrate learning with hands-on sustainable chemistry research experiences; 4)
promote sustainable chemistry awareness at the university; and 5) widely
disseminate the results of the project. The project is projected to impact all
undergraduate chemistry majors at Delaware State University. The project will
create knowledge related to how undergraduate students learn chemistry when the
subject is taught in the context of green chemistry, environmental stewardship,
climate change, food security and other aspects of sustainability.
