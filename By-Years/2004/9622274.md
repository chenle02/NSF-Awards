ABSTRACT Chen 9622274 Support was requested for a scanning probe microscope
capable of operating as a scanning tunneling microscope, an atomic force
microscope, or a scanning thermal microscope. Applications to the study of
energy transfer in nanostructures, electronic devices, and optoelectronic
devices are envisioned. The grant was supported under the Research Equipement
Grant Program.
