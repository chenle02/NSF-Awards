The purpose of the proposed project is to acquire a total organic carbon
analyzer to enhance the teaching of environmental measurements. The instrument
is used for a number of field and laboratory exercises, including the
investigation of interrelationships between biochemical oxygen demand, chemical
oxygen demand, total organic carbon, and theoretical oxygen demand; a ground
water quality survey; a surface water quality survey; and the fate of total
organic carbon as water passes through a drinking water treatment facility.
