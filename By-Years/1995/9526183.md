The focus of this research is to develop an ene-like reaction between aldehydes
and vinyl ethers, catalyzed by an acetic acid:lanthanide shift reagent complex.
The methodology will be used to synthesize representative terpenes, prostanoids,
alkaloids and carbohydrates. The methodology offers a valuable, environmentally
benign alternative to aldol- and amino-aldol reactions now in use. With this
award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Marco A.
Ciufolini of the Department of Chemistry at Rice University. Professor Ciufolini
will focus his work on developing asymmetric, catalytic methods for the
formation of carbon-carbon bonds. These methods hold great potential for use in
the industrial synthesis of drugs and polymers with unique properties.
