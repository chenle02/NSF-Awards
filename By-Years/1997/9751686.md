The objective of this project is to introduce a laser photolysis experiment in
the undergraduate physical chemistry laboratory. The students in the laboratory
course represent a significant number of underrepresented groups who are being
strongly encouraged to pursue careers in science and technology. The new
laboratory is a simplified version of the current experimental methods in
kinetic measurements. At the same time, it conserves all the main features of
modern chemical kinetics. The main teaching objectives of the new laboratory are
(1) to make students familiar with one of the modern approaches of studying fast
chemical reactions laser photolysis combined with a transient spectroscopy; (2)
to familiarize students with the concept of isolation of an elementary reaction
and the pseudo-first-order conditions; and (3) to demonstrate the kinetics and
mechanism of ozone formation and hydrocarbon oxidation in the atmosphere. The
new experiment is assigned to students in the four sections (18/section) of
physical chemistry laboratory each academic year. Several faculty are evaluating
the effectiveness of this experiment for undergraduates and working to modify
the experiment when necessary to fit logically into the existing program. In
addition, the laboratory is being used in research on kinetics of oxidation of
halogen substituted radicals conducted by undergraduate students during summer
and regular semesters.
