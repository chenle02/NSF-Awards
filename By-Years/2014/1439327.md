Formal verification techniques such as model checking, satisfiability solving,
theorem proving, and static analysis have matured rapidly in recent years. These
techniques have a number of important applications ranging from the modeling and
analysis of biological and cyber-physical systems to the verification of the
safety and security of complex software systems. The Summer School on Formal
Techniques trains students in the principles and practice of formal
verification, with a strong emphasis on the hands-on use and development of this
technology. It primarily targets graduate students and young researchers who are
interested in using verification technology in their own research in fields such
as computing, engineering, biology, and mathematics. Students at the school are
given the opportunity to experiment with the tools and techniques presented in
the lectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2014 edition of the Summer School is the
fourth in the series takes place during May 19-23, 2014. Topics covered in this
school include logic, formalization, interactive theorem proving, SAT and SMT
solving, model checking, program semantics, modeling and verification of
security protocols, and software reliability. The students cooperate in solving
challenging problems while learning to use cutting-edge tools and techniques.
