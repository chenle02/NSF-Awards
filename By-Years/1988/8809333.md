This study will concentrate upon achieving high productivity of .-endotoxin
protein by Bacillus Thuringiensis cells by controlled fed- batch operation of
stirred bioreactors. The strategy involves growing the cells to high
concentrations in vegetative phase during which the fermentation parameters will
be controlled to minimize formation of undesirable toxic products. Minimal
requirements of nutrients for cell growth to high densities will be established
by continuous cultivation techniques. The fed-batch cultivation will be fine
tuned so that medium composition at high densities is optimum for subsequent
sporulation and endotoxin formation. Biological insecticides are increasingly
being viewed as more advantageous than chemical pesticides which are generally
energy intensive, have long half lives, and adversely affect many harmless forms
of life. .-endotoxin is a commercially produced insecticide that is being
studied extensively with major improvements in its potency. In addition, spore-
forming bacilli are commonly used to produce many industrially important
products; therefore, fundamental studies involving high density cultivation can
improve productivity of several processes.
