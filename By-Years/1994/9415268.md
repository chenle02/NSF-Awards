9415268 Laubenbacher The investigator organizes a five-day symposium on Groebner
bases and convex polytopes, featuring a series of ten lectures by Professor
Bernd Sturmfels describing some of the central results about Groebner bases of
toric ideals and their application to problems in integer programming and
statistics. These lectures are complemented by a concurrent contributed paper
session. Polynomial equations are important in algebraic geometry and
commutative algebra. Moreover, many scientific, economic and engineering
problems can be modeled by polynomial equations, and polynomials arise in
computational statistics, integer programming, and a variety of other
optimization problems. The theory of Groebner bases provides the foundation for
many algorithms used in the analysis of such equations. So the theory plays a
significant role not just in basic research but also in the solution of problems
of strategic interest. Increasingly, this theory is becoming part of the
standard curriculum at U.S. universities. Thus, the subject the conference is of
interest to students, teachers and researchers in several disciplines, including
mathematics, engineering, computer science, and operations research.
