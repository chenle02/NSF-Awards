The subject of this project is parameter estimation problems for flow equations
with discontinuous coefficients. These are the problems where parameters of the
medium are required to be determined by indirect measurements. Specifically the
objective of this project is developing of efficient algorithms for the
identification of discontinuous parameters a(x) in 2-D and 3-D problems. The
suggested algorithm uses finite elements approximations of the space variable
u(x,t) and does not require any discretization of the parameter variable a(x).
Special averaging procedure is introduced to eliminate numerical instabilities.
The general theory is based on G-convergence of parabolic operators and
principle od simultaneous minimization. Preliminary results for 2- d problems
show examples of successful identification and significant possibilities for
vectorization. We also study the problem of further improvements in the
identification by considering additional data sets of observations.
