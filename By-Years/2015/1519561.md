This award supports participation in the workshop "Expansion in linear groups"
taking place May 1-3, 2015 at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The theme
of the workshop is exploring the connections between random walks on a locally
compact space, additive combinatorics, and their applications. Bringing together
experts working in the area will create an environment in which to exchange
ideas and to start new projects. The workshop is an excellent opportunity for
junior researchers and graduate students to interact with experts and be
inspired for further work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The organizers of this workshop
are Ramin Takloo-Bighash (University of Illinois at Chicago) and Alireza Salehi-
Golsefidi. The confirmed speakers are Peter Sarnak, Alex Gamburd, Elena Fuchs,
Alex Kontorovich, Harald Helfgott, Igor Rivin, Nicolas de Saxce, and Alireza
Salehi Golsefidi. This is a part of the annual Oliver Atkin Memorial Lecture and
Workshop at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The lectures by invited
speakers will take place on May 2 and 3, and some spots are reserved for talks
by participating recent PhDs and graduate students. Select lectures will be
videotaped, and will be made available on a website to make the lectures
available to the mathematical community. The slides of talks will be made
available on the conference website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The website of the
