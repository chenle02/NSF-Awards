9703498 Hachen While there has been research on both social networks and job
mobility in labor markets, there is little research on how these two important
social phenomena are related. This Dissertation Research Improvement project
addresses this gap through systematically examining the effects of social
network structure on labor market mobility. The investigator argues that
structural holes, defined as non-redundant contacts within networks, can
increase the: (1) total amount of information an employee has about "a better
job," (2) information an employer has on potential employees, and (3) usefulness
of the information an employee obtains. A series of models and testable
hypotheses are formulated based on these assumptions. Data will be gathered from
the population of television station managers in the United States.
Specifically, 600 television station managers will be asked to complete a mail
survey which requests information on the respondent's social network, job
history and sources of job information obtained when looking for a job. Include
in this survey will be mangers who changed as well as those who did not change
jobs during 1996. ****
