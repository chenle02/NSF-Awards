In many physical problems, the dissipation is very small and conservative models
can be used for their study. These include the fluid motions in atmosphere and
ocean, the Bose-Einstein condensate in quantum mechanics, the plasmas in
controlled fusion devices, etc. The dynamical behavior of these models is very
complex due to the lack of strong dissipation. One important topic is to
understand the formation and persistence of coherent structures observed in
experiments and in nature. Some examples include the large vortex structures in
the atmosphere and ocean, the traveling wave patterns in ocean waves, and the
observed galaxy structures. Another topic is to understand and control the
instability in many applications. One such example is to control the instability
of plasmas in fusion devices to achieve the goal of controlled nuclear fusion
for energy production. Methods of mathematical analysis are the primary tools
employed in the proposed investigations. The rigorous mathematics makes it
feasible to do stable numerical computations and to better understand the
phenomena found in numerical and experimental studies.

One focus of the project is to understand invariant structures including quasi-
periodic solutions and invariant manifolds, near physically interesting
equilibria of several PDE models, including Vlasov equations, incompressible
Euler and Naiver-Stokes equations, and Gross-Pitaevskii equation. These
invariant structures form a skeleton in the physical phase space and provide
important clues to study long time dynamical behaviors. Topics to be studied
include: the regularity threshold for nonlinear damping and the existence of
nontrivial invariant structures near simpler equilibria of non-dissipative
models including Vlasov models and 2D Euler equations, the construction of
invariant manifolds in many conservative continuum models and Hamiltonian PDEs,
and the persistence of invariant structures for large time scale under small
dissipation. Also, new approaches will be developed to find stable BGK waves and
electrostatic solitary waves of Vlasov-Poisson systems.
