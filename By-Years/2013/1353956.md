Understanding how the brain efficiently extracts relevant information from a
complex visual scene, and uses these cues to guide behavior represents a
fundamental problem in neuroscience. Despite considerable effort, even compact
circuits that implement the elementary visual computations that are the building
blocks of brain function remain poorly understood. This project will combine
genetic analysis, behavioral studies and microscopy to dissect such circuits.
These studies will shed light on the computational mechanisms of the brain. More
broadly, this study will engage underrepresented high school students in
neuroscience research by developing a new educational program that combines the
physics of light with animal behavior in the local environment, developing
quantitative analysis skills. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Linear polarization
represents a fundamental quality of light that arises naturally from atmospheric
scattering, and surface reflections. Many animals orient their movements using
these signals, and studies in a variety of insects have developed computational
models for how neural circuits might guide behavioral responses to polarized
light, models that share key elements with models of color perception. Thus,
understanding these circuits provides insight into many important visual
processing tasks. This project will investigate the neural circuits that compute
responses to polarized light. The first objective of this project is to identify
neurons that respond to polarized light signals presented to the ventral retina
of the fruit fly Drosophila, using a combination of advanced genetic tools for
manipulating neural activity and behavioral studies. The second objective will
use in vivo two photon microscopy to measure changes in neural activity induced
by polarized light in order to describe the response properties of individual
neuron types. The third objective will map the functional connections between
neurons in these circuits by simultaneously increasing and decreasing the
activities of specific circuit components, while imaging the responses of
downstream neuronal targets. This work will determine how the brain processes
information about polarized light.
