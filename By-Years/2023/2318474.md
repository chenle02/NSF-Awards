This project develops a free and open-source software platform named Pushkin,
which permits researchers who conduct behavioral and cognitive experiments with
humans to run massive online experiments. These experiments can engage tens of
thousands of participants from around the world and enable citizen scientists to
run their own experiments. The ability to collect data from hundreds of
experiments simultaneously increases the rate, robustness, and reliability of
knowledge accumulation in psychology and the behavioral sciences. The Pushkin
infrastructure lowers barriers to accessing the results from and participating
in behavioral research, increases the diversity of both researchers and
participants, and advances understanding across a wide range of disciplines and
contexts, including social and educational programs and policies, product
design, therapies, and training and development of artificial intelligence.

Pushkin is difficult to use even for those researchers who already conduct
massive online experiments. The project adds functionality to Pushkin to make it
easier to use. Features are added that improve learning the software and that
make it faster to write and deploy experiments. Additional functionality
generates documentation of the collected data, including automatically generated
statistical summaries. The software will facilitate the use of best practices in
data sharing, which in turn will increase researchersâ€™ willingness to share data
and contribute to the rich datasets produced by massive online experiments.
Sharing of these datasets will support the development of new theories and
models of behavior and broaden the impact of social science research.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
