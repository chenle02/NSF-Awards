The immediate objectives of this project are to determine the distribution of
metamorphic zones, the peak metamorphic temperatures and pressures, and the P-T
paths for granulite facies rocks of the Adirondack Mountains. Mineral analyses
obtained by electron microprobe will be used with P-T-X calculations to
constrain peak metamorphic conditions, and mineral zoning determined by
techniques such as X-ray mapping will elucidate the reaction histories necessary
to infer P-T paths. The results will ultimately provide constraints on the
origin of the metamorphism and on the nature of associated tectonic processes.
