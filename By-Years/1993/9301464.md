9301464 Hernried A strategy for the active control of civil engineering
structures, particularly cable supported bridge structures, is planned. The
control algorithm incorporates nonlinearities and uncertainties that may exist
in the structural model. The control strategy is to be implemented in a
decentralized manner. Control forces are generated for and sensor information
obtained from subsystems of the structure. Analytical studies will be performed
using the nonlinear decentralized control strategy on several example cable
supported bridge structures subjected to free vibration, harmonic, and
earthquake excitation. Structural nonlinearities are expected to be primarily
geometric due to the possibly large motions of the bridge deck and supporting
cables. Both the uncontrolled and controlled response will be determined. An
iterative scheme will be employed to determine optimum sensor locations.
Experimental studies will be performed to verify the proposed methodology and
will serve as a comparison to the analytical simulations. ***
