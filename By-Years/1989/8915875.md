Four alloy systems are examined in order to compare the formation of metastable
phases with related thermodynamic and kinetic modeling. Two ternary systems are
selected that display negative heats of formation; these are subjected to a
schedule of rapid quench rates from the liquid. Observed metastable phases that
form are compared with theoretical predictions based on a model of continuous
cooling crystallization kinetics. Two binary immiscible alloy systems with
positive heats of formation are included in the research in an attempt to
produce metastable phases by sputtering or mechanical alloying. Phase
predictions based on modeling of the respective free energies and their changes
with temperature are planned for these binary systems.
