A theoretical research program in nuclear astrophysics will be carried out.
Specific areas of study will include investigations in nuclear physics,
classical novae and related phenomena, nucleosynthesis, galactic chemical
evolution, and the origin of globular clusters. Major problems to be addressed
include: (1) the determination of thermonuclear reaction and weak interaction
rates relevant to diverse astrophysical studies; (2) the analysis of the general
case of electron screening; (3) an analysis of the controlling physics of the
super-Eddington phase of evolution of classical novae in outburst; (4) the
possible consequences of the phase of commom envelope evolution that is known to
be experienced by most classical novae in outburst; (5) the nature of outbursts
triggered by high accretion rates onto hot white dwarfs; (6) nucleosynthesis
accompanying classical nova outbursts, including the production of the
radioactivities sodium 22 (22Na) and aluminum 26 (26Al); (7) the consequences of
silicon burning in massive stars of low initial metallicities; (8) the operation
of the r-process in the expansion and cooling of highly neutronized matter; (9)
s-process nucleosynthesis in red giant stars; (10) nuclear cosmochronology; (11)
the evolution of the lithium abundance in the galaxy; (12) the implications of
abundances in metal deficient stars for early galactic chemical evolution; and
(13) the nature of the origin and early evolution of the Milky Way globular
clusters.
