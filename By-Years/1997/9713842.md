9713842 Chen Computer simulation methods for unsteady lubricated metal forming
processes are being developed using meshless methods of analysis. Meshless
methods allow the domain of the workpiece to be modeled without using a
structured mesh thus avoiding mesh distortion difficulties that occur during the
course of large plastic deformation. The behavior of the lubricated interface,
including the effects of lubricant flow, pressure gradient, film thickness, and
surface roughness, are included in the simulation procedures through the
implementation of a hydrodynamic unsteady lubrication model into the meshless
formulation. Special emphasis is placed on the development of computationally
efficient meshless formulations to allow for large scale simulation of metal
forming processes. ***
