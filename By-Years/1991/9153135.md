FTIR Spectrophotometry in Undergraduate Chemistry LaboratoriesA Fourier
transform infrared spectrophotometer will be incorporated in the microscale
organic course, a new environmental instrumental analysis course, a course for
medical technicians, and an honors general chemistry course focused on
laboratory projects. The instrument will introduce students to a modern
instrument whose dedicated computer will allow for sophisticated data analysis
and spectral searching and matching. New experiments stressing practical
industrial applications will be developed, including environmental analysis of
waste dumps. The grantee will match the NSF award from non-Federal sources.
