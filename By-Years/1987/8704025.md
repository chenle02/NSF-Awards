In every area of large-scale computing, solutions to a range of vitally
important problems currently take too long, or cost too much, or are completely
unattainable because of the limitations inherent in even the most sophisticated
of today's serial or vector processing computers. As we reach the fundamental
limits of hardware technology, any substantial increase in computational speed
(and capabilities) must come from some form of parallel architecture. At
present, however, the usefulness of these systems is severly limited by the lack
of proper high-level parallel programming environments, and by the lack of
knowledge of appropriate parallel programming techniques. Scientific Computing
Associates is developing a parallel programming system based on Linda, a set of
parallel process management operations that can be inserted into an existing
serial programming language such as C or Fortran, and provide convenient access
to parallelism from within a familiar high- level language. During Phase II they
propose to extend and improve the performance of the C-Linda compiler, improve
the user-interface aspects of the Linda programming environment, build Linda
run-time systems for the Cray X/MP multiprocessor supercomputer and produce a
marketable product for shared memory parallel architectures based on the Linda
system. I recommend funding this proposal to the amount requested, and if
possible, making the award in two increments to assure the viability of the
project as suggested by one of the reviewers; the second half being contingent
upon satisfactory demonstration of the ultimate product to be marketed.
