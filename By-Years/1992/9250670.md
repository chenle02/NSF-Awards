The Department of Earth Sciences is purchasing a spectroradiometer, ground
penetrating radar equipment, and other related equipment for use in a field
methods course in environmental geology. In this course, students obtain
essential hands-on experience with representative equipment and techniques used
in environmental field work. Subsurface interface radar is used for mapping
subsurface features. Surface-truth data from spectroradiometer analyses supports
interpretation of remotely sensed images. Water quality studies are done with
portable water analysis laboratories. A gas vapor soil probe and organic vapor
meter are used for investigations of possible hydrocarbon leaks. This equipment
also provides important learning opportunities for many students in other
courses through equipment demonstrations and direct participation.
