The project involves the commercialization of a technological breakthrough in
the field of zeolites. Delaminated zeolites developed in the proposed work at
UC-Berkeley provide a new technology platform that is potentially disruptive to
conventional zeolite catalysts used in alkylation reactions. Delaminated
zeolites are a new class of materials that are formed via exfoliation of
conventional zeolites. This new class of materials has been demonstrated to be
catalytically more active than their three dimensional counterparts. The goal of
this project is to commercialize delaminated zeolites as catalysts for
alkylation of aromatics.

The proposed delaminated zeolite catalysts have been shown to be up to four
times more active for aromatic alkylation when compared with conventional non-
delaminated catalysts, and up to twice as active when compared with other
industrial catalysts such as MCM-22. The improvement of catalyst performance
when using the proposed delaminated zeolotic materials is projected to reduce
energy consumption and, therefore, reduce costs of molecular precursors, such as
ethylbenzene, which is used for synthesizing polymers.
