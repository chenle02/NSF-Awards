Funded through a Research Initiation Award, experimental and theoretical
research will be carried out on the effect of boundary roughness on the
transition of boundary layer flow to turbulence. The effect of both isolated and
distributed roughness elements will be explored, in two and three dimensions.
The focus is on a mechanism called Bypass Transition. The occurrence and cause
of turbulence in engineering flow systems is widespread and still not
sufficiently understood to permit reliable engineering predictions.
