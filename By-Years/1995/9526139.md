Abstract ATM-9526139 Markgraf. Vera University of Colorado Title: Coordination
of PEP I Research Activities PEP I (Pole-Equator-Pole, the paleoclimate transect
of the Americas)is a PAGES/IGBP research initiative in the organizational and
planing stages. Late Quaternary paleoenvironmental records contain information
on the natural variability of the earth's past environments and climate and
provide a framework for assessing the validity of future global climate change
predictions and for understanding mechanisms of past climate changes. A
scientific agenda for interhemispheric paleoclimate research has been
formulated. An international working group for PEP I will implement the science
program. This award will support: 1. annual meetings to coordinate working group
activities, especially in terms of enhancing cooperation in North and South
America in the past global change arena; 2.coordination efforts for maintaining
communication among the researchers, working groups, funding agencies (such as
IAI) and other global change programs; and 3. facilitate coordination of
research meetings on specific PEP I research themes.
