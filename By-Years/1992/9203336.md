This award supports a research and development program investigating various
aspects of adaptive optics and high resolution imaging techniques for astronomy.
Areas to be investigated include the development of innovative methods of
wavefront sensing using the properties of natural starlight and fast, low noise
detectors in both visible and near infrared wavelengths, and the incorporation
of speckle imaging, tip/tilt correction for image motion and full adaptive
correction in scienceprograms at the 2.3 meter and 6.86 meter Multiple Mirror
telescopes of the Steward Observatory. Graduate students will be involved in the
development and use of these techniques.
