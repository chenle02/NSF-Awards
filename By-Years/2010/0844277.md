&lt;br/&gt;The University of Central Florida is taking responsibility for the
operation of a unique long-path secure laser range facility on Air Force
property on Merritt Island, just south of the Kennedy Space Flight Center. This
facility, the Innovative Science &amp; Technology Experimentation Facility,
(ISTEF), provides unsurpassed options for laser-based experiments in rocket and
satellite hyper-spectral imaging, precision laser illumination and ranging,
atmospheric propagation across water, swamp and dry land, and other
applications. This project plans to locate at this facility several laser-based
experimental programs that are long-range extension studies of programs
currently ongoing on the UCF campus. They are programs pursuing (i) the
propagation of self-channeled femtosecond laser light through the atmosphere for
unique propagation and interaction effects, (ii) the development of stand-off
optical technologies for trace element explosives detection(iii) high-power eye-
safe, (2Ã¬m) laser propagation, ranging and imaging of rockets and satellite
instrumentation. The intellectual merit of the proposal is rooted in the new
avenues of fundamental science of long range laser propagation and effects that
will be enabled by this proposal. This science will have direct benefit to
technologies needed by the nation?s intelligence community for national security
needs. Providing access to the NCMR university partners, to UCF and other
universities will open access to this facility for field station student
training in advanced concepts of laser propagation, interaction and effects,
spectroscopy, sensing and imaging. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
