Electrical measurements as a function of applied uniaxial stress will be made on
GaAs/A1GaAs structures. Three areas will be covered: 1) Tunneling measurements.
Fowler-Nordheim tunneling, single barrier direct tunneling and double barrier
resonant tunneling will be studied to determine the position in crystal momentum
space of the electronic states in the barrier which govern the tunneling
processes. 2) DX centers. Kinetic trapping and transport measurements will be
made to determine the position in crystal momentum space of the DX center and
associated energy bands. 3) Pseudomorphic structures. Transport measurements
will be made on lattice matched systems to simulate pseudomorphic structures to
elucidate and optimize these properties.
