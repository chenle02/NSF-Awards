9415549 Tesanovic This project deals with the theory of superconductivity in
high magnetic fields. In high fields, the standard theory of superconductivity
has qualitative and dramatic deviations. Entirely new, strong fluctuation,
theoretical approaches are developed. The theory of coherent, gapless,
quasipartical bands formed by closely spaced, high-field vortices is studied.
Resolving these deep theoretical issues is likely to result in new physical
concepts and ideas which can be applied to a variety of other problems. %%% Many
applications of superconductors, from manufacturing applications to high-
performance magnets, involve the coexistence of superconductivity and high
magnetic fields. The standard theory of superconductivity no longer applies for
very large fields. In this project the theory of superconductivity in such
fields is developed. This work will relate to recent experimental activity
concerning the conditions under which materials will be superconductors. It will
also compliment NSF's strong commitment to the exploration of the high magnetic
field frontier, embodied in the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. ***
