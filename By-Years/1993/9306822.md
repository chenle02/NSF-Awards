This project will investigate approximation schemes for geometric objects. The
geometric objects considered are Euclidean Networks and Polyhedra. Euclidean
networks have diverse applications, such as in modeling geometric networks and
circuit interconnections. Polyhedra are used to model almost any real space
filling object, such as machine parts, automobiles, and robots. The complexity
of algorithms that manipulate these geometric objects often depends upon the
complexity of the objects themselves. The approximation schemes to be studied
will attempt to replace the original objects by simpler ones such that relevant
properties of the original objects are retained by the simpler objects. The hope
is, later computations get sped up. For dense Euclidean networks, a subset of
the edges will be eliminated in such a manner that in the sparser network
communication paths between any pair of vertices is not appreciably lengthened.
For polyhedra, the surface will be replaced by a simpler one containing fewer
planar pieces, yet retaining important original properties.
