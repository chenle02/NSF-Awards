NSF Postdoctoral Fellowships in Biology combine research and training components
to prepare young scientists for careers in emerging areas where biology
intersects with other scientific disciplines, in this case with control theory,
a branch of mathematics and engineering. The Fellows are expected to lead the
nation's scientific workforce of the future. This fellowship to Luis Zaman
supports research and training on theoretical aspects of evolution and seeks to
answer the question: Does complex ecology lead to simple evolution? The host
institution is the University of Washington, and the sponsoring scientists are
Drs. Ben Kerr and Eric Klavins. Training goals include the use and development
of theoretical tools inspired by control theory to predict evolution within, and
of, ecological networks. Educational and public outreach includes museums, the
Society for the Advancement of Chicano and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS)
chapter at the University of Washington, and `Science Pubs,` a program in which
scientists engage in casual scientific conversations with the public.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Innovative laboratory and field studies have transformed
evolutionary biology into a discipline in which evolutionary hypotheses can be
tested experimentally in real time. However, because of the stochastic nature of
evolution, accurate predictions are elusive. To make matters worse, evolution in
nature occurs within complex interaction networks (Darwin`s `tangled bank`).
Theoreticians have made substantial progress incorporating complexity -
especially ecological complexity - into models of evolution and coevolution. On
the other hand, experimental biologists often eliminate as much complexity as
possible in hopes of isolating the effects of their manipulations. This research
bridges the gap between empirical and theoretical evolution by studying the
effects of ecological complexity on evolutionary predictability. Predictions
being made through modeling are being tested and refined though experimental
evolution with bacteria-phage communities.
