Research will be performed in three areas: (i) stability, finite time blow-up,
decay rates, and asymptotics of life span of solutions to reaction-diffusion
equations in the whole space; (ii) locations and rates of blow-up of solutions
to spatially non-uniform nonlinear heat equations (model equations including the
ones arising in the channel flow problem); (iii) concentration phenomena of
solutions of semilinear elliptic equations (including Schrodinger equations and
the equations arising in chemotaxis and binary mixture problems in biology and
physics). The problems proposed are of mathematical, physical and biological
importance. Some of the equations in the project have been well-known to
mathematicians for years, yet new and challenging questions about these
equations remain unanswered. The solutions for these problems will not only
deepen our understanding of these concrete models, but also have impact on the
understanding of and resolution to other related problems in the fields of
mathematics, physics and biology.
