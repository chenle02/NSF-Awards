This award supports cooperative research in nuclear physics between Jurg X.
Saladin of the University of Pittsburgh and Prof. O. Dietzsch of the University
of Sao Paulo, Brazil. These scientists have had a long-standing collaboration
over two decades. Several students have been trained under this research
including one who has joined the Pittsburgh group. A systematic study is being
carried out of high nuclear spin states on the recently completed multidetector
array and 14-element spectrometer at Pittsburgh. The data on experiments with
(76,77,78)Kr will be analyzed by a graduate student on her return to Sao Paulo
so not only are the personnel of both groups essential for the array experiments
but both groups benefit from the collaboration. Experiments are now to be
carried out on (72-75)Kr, study of nuclear structure in the region 70&lt;A&lt;80
and high spin states in the A=170 neutron-rich region. Some of this work will be
done at the National Superconducting Cyclotron at Michigan State. The Brazilians
will participate in this. Later the U.S. scientists will help perform the data
analysis in Brazil continuing a productive collaboration with mutual benefits
for both countries.
