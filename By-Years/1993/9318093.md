9318093 Guerinot Iron is an essential nutrient for all higher plants, with
iron- containing compounds figuring prominently in the electron transport
systems of photosynthesis and respiration. Although iron is abundant in the
soil, the acquisition of iron is problematic due to its low solubility at
biological pH under aerobic conditions. Iron uptake mechanisms are being studied
in the model plant system, Arabidopsis thaliana, using biochemical, genetic and
molecular genetic techniques. The focus is on the reduction of ferric iron which
takes place at the root surface because ferric reduction is probably the primary
factor in making iron available for absorption by plants. The main objective is
to identify genes which encode components necessary for ferric reductase
activity. Three strategies to identify such genes will be pursued
simultaneously: a) use of the FRE1 gene from yeast to identify an Arabidopsis
homolog; b) complementation of the fre1-1 yeast mutant to identify an
Arabidopsis homolog; and c) identification of Arabidopsis mutants with altered
ferric reductase activity and use of such mutants to clone the gene(s) involved
in ferric reduction. A study of iron uptake in Arabidopsis should have
application to general transmembrance permeation processes and their regulation
and may ultimately lead to the construction of iron efficient plant varieties.
These studies should also shed light on root specific gene expression and the
regulation of gene expression by metals. ***
