9311151 Chryssostomidis The Underwater Vehicles Laboratory of the M.I.T. Sea
Grant College Program will purchase oceanographic sensors and sensor support
equipment to enable the use of existing Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) as
tools for oceanographic research. Six missions have been chosen to direct this
effort, including: 1) The investigation of plate tectonics and spreading centers
through geomagnetic measurements off the coast of Antarctica. 2) The development
of geophysical navigation methods, 3) The creation of a rapid-response AUV to
investigate transient ocean events, 4) The use of AUV development as a method of
enhancing engineering education, 5) The development of methodologies for
applying AUVs to study of shallow-water environments, and 6) The study of the
mechanics of Arctic ice. The high operating cost of research vessels constrains
oceanic research. AUVs increasing the search rate of the ocean floor, greatly
increasing the efficiency of the time spent at sea.
