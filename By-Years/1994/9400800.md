With this award, the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry
Program supports research on organometallic radicals by Dr. Dwight A. Sweigart
of the Chemistry Department, Brown University. Ligand substitution reactions,
metal dependence of reactivity patterns, and rates of electron transfer
reactions will be investigated for electrochemically generated 17- or 19-
electron species. In addition, catalytic ligand substitution and
electroactivation of hydrocarbons will be studied. A second area of
investigation is metal-promoted synthetic routes to indoles, diterpenes, and
steroids. Chiral metal complexes will be tested as effective reagents in the
preparation of optically pure products. High oxidation state species are
expected in the reaction of oxirenes with metals to form the first oxirene-metal
complexes. Odd-electron organometallic compounds are reactive species thought to
play important roles in catalytic reactions. Using electrochemical methods,
Sweigart can produce and characterize these species directly and thus predict
their reactivities. Because the systems to be studied include both homogeneous
and heterogenous examples, the results will provide insight into surface
corrosion as well as solution reactions. The investigation of large hydrocarbon
ring compounds is biologically relevant and establishing controlled synthetic
routes may prove useful to many investigators. The study will also extend the
electrochemical methods available for characterizing chemical processes.
