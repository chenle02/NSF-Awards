0118029&lt;br/&gt;Monismith&lt;br/&gt;The PI hypothesizes that river plume
conditions at the river mouth control the angle of impact at the stagnation
point, which then controls the split of waters that flow into the downstream
coastal current and the bulge associated with the outflow plume. Laboratory
experiments, complemented by numerical modeling, is proposed. Questions to be
answered include: Are river plumes inherently time dependent? How do river mouth
parameters affect alongshore and cross-shore transport? Is the assumption of a
geostrophic balance in the coastal current uniformly valid? The studies will
define the structure of he plume, the stagnation point, and the coastal current,
and describe the transport field within the coastal current. Five lab cases
include a standard, low inflow angle, high Rossby number, high Froude number,
and non-zero bottom slope situations. Reproducibility of the lab runs allows
data from multiple runs (at least for the first 7-10 rotations) to be combined
for analysis. &lt;br/&gt;
