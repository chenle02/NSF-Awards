This project will implement and test new architectures for artificial neural
networks designed to address the problem of controlling actions over time to
achieve stated results. The tests will be relatively well-understood and
mathematically simple, at first, in order to permit mathematical analysis and
comparison with traditional methods. If the initial work is successful, the new
architectures will be used in conjunction with the P.I.'s existing research on
the National Aerospace Plane (NASP), to provide an alternate control scheme for
NASP. Given the risks of the existing control plans, and the necessity for
large-throughput highly-nonlinear control (areas in which neural networks
excel), this should hopefully increase the long-term probability of success of
NASP.
