The main goal of the proposed research is to develop mathematical models for the
mechanics of point loads on the thin-walled structures made of incompressible or
compressible, rubber-like materials. The research will address the non-linear
elastic deformation of materials undergoing large deformations. This research
has the potential of greatly advancing the understanding of the behavior of
plates and shells as well as the basic principles of three-dimensional elastic
continuum mechanics. The PI is one of this countries leading scientists in non-
linear analysis. An award is recommended.
