9317784 Harrison Regulation of pH is one of the most critical aspects of
organismal homeostasis. Although acid-base status affects a wide variety of
cellular processes, including enzyme catalysis, ionic balance, membrane
transport, and hormone-receptor interactions, our knowledge of this aspect of
insect physiology is quite limited. Previous research by Dr. Harrison has shown
that locusts regulate extracellular pH quite closely, and that acid- base loads
resulting from diet, starvation, or injections of HCl are excreted. A major goal
of the proposed research is to determine the specific region(s) of the
alimentary canal/hindgut complex responsible for the regulated excretion of
acid-base loads. This research will also test whether changes in the secretion
of acid-base by the midgut can be directly induced by changes in acid-base
status. It is generally assumed (in insects and mammals) that excretion of
ammonium is functionally equivalent to acid excretion. However, this assumption
has never been tested directly in insects, and recently has been extensively
debated for mammals. The proposed study will test whether ammonium excretion by
the hindgut of locusts is functionally equivalent to acid secretion in a simple,
direct manner. Together, these experiments will provide the first organismal
model of the most important mechanisms of long-term acid-base regulation in
insects. ***
