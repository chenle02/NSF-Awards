This project is a mutual endeavor which will provide a highly visible outlet for
the dissemination of NSF Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement (ILI) and
Course and Curriculum Development (CCD) grant results. Poster sessions and
technical paper sessions sponsored by the ASEE Division for Experimental and
Laboratory Oriented Studies (DELOS) will be held at each year's ASEE Annual
Conference. Grantees of the ILI and CCD Programs will be invited to present the
results of their grant projects at these sessions. *
