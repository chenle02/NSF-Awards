&lt;br/&gt;This project is a three-year continuation of a theoretical and
experimental study of the dynamics of liquid water existing at the boundaries of
ice crystal at temperatures below the freezing point of pure water. This
process, called premelting, has significant consequences in the redistributing
of brine in sea ice, the apparent migrating of contaminants through glacier ice,
and the rate of frost heave and weathering in soils and
rocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Premelting is common to virtually all types of
materials, but has been most extensively studied in ice. It can be caused by
adsorption forces, wetting, size effects, or substrate disorder, and involves
many aspects of surface physics and phase transition phenomena. The study
program will include the observing of ice crystal growth from a contaminated
solution; of unfrozen water transport between crystals as functions of
temperature and temperature differences, as well as such studies between ice
crystals and various substrates. An important objective will be the development
of useful models for ice growth and impurity transport under natural conditions
in order to assess how grain interfaces may serve as chemical conduits.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The macroscale consequences of these molecular-scale
processes include the evolution of the electromagnetic properties of sea ice
which are important in remote sensing, the uptake of chlorine on polar
stratospheric cloud particles which are important in the chemistry of ozone
destruction, the migration of impurities in ice cores which affect the
stratigraphic isochrone estimates, and the penetration of atmospheric pollutants
into permafrost and firn.&lt;br/&gt;
