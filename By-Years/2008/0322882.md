Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: SGER: Distillation
Using Hollow Fibers as Structured Packing&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
CTS-0322882&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Edward
Cussler&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of
Minnesota&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed research
is to explore the implications of differential distillation using non-selective
membranes for structured packing. Preliminary experiments demonstrate that
distillation purity and productivity can be dramatically increased with this
technique. These membranes have a mass transfer resistance comparable to the
boundary layer resistances in adjacent solutions. In previous work, operation
above the normal limit of flooding and below the normal limit of loading was
demonstrated. Because the current membranes have low melting temperatures,
initial tests will be conducted near room temperature. Distillation using
nanoporous membranes will be attempted; it is expected that these membranes will
have high mass transfer rates near room temperature, and they may be suitable
for the distillation of air. Enhanced mass transfer due to membrane spacers,
which cause chaotic mixing will be studied. Propane-propylene distillation will
be used as a model system with experiments to be carried out in collaboration
with Los Alamos National Laboratory. In terms of the broader impacts, this work
has the potential to increase the efficiency of distillation processes, which
account for 5% of the US oil consumption. Traditional mentoring of graduate
students will also result.&lt;br/&gt;
