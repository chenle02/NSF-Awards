Non-technical abstract: &lt;br/&gt;The National Science Foundation chooses the
research that it funds based on Intellectual Merit (the potential to advance
knowledge) and Broader Impacts (the potential to benefit society). Scientists
recognize that the Broader Impact merit criteria as defined by NSF are essential
for building the public support necessary for science to flourish. This project
creates a website that will consolidate the wide range of broader impact
activities in Condensed Matter Physics, a field that has had a transformative
impact on society, leading to the development of transistors, computer memory
and light emitting diodes (LEDs). By acting both as a resource and a repository,
it will make the implementation of broader impact activities both more efficient
and effective. The wide range of broader impact activities include scientific
breakthroughs, patented inventions and start up companies made possible by NSF
funding. It also features the work of scientists who are enthusiastic
ambassadors for their field, giving public talks, increasing diversity,
developing scientific curriculum for students and teachers, and inspiring the
next generation to pursue careers in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical

Condensed matter physicists (CMP) have made transformative impacts on our
society that are often invisible to the public. Communicating the societal
benefits of our research is often a challenge because CMP consists of many
independent research groups for whom effective engagement in the public arena is
not necessarily a forte. Other broader impact activities, such as engaging K-12
students and teachers to increase scientific literacy and strengthen the
workforce in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)
fields, may be very effective; but are often isolated and short in duration. A
recent workshop on broader impacts attended by PIs supported by the NSF
Condensed Matter Physics Program, resulted in the formation of a committee to
advance the broader impacts of the CMP community in ways that go beyond what an
individual group can accomplish on its own. This project funds the first
initiative from this committee, the creation of a website to increase the
visibility of CMP and to make the implementation of broader impacts more
efficient. The site has two sides, a public side for communication of exciting
scientific discoveries and their enabling technologies to the broadest audience
and a private side for communication about broader impact activities among
condensed matter researchers.
