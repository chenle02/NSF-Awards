This is a study of teaching learning science in three neighborhood high schools
in Philadelphia, Pa. The study seeks to understand the teaching and learning of
science in terms of student use of their existing social and cultural capital to
make sense of the activities they participate in during school and after school.
It would involve six teacher-researchers who are involved with a local systemic
initiative in which the teachers are teaching courses in chemistry. The schools
are also involved with the Philadelphia's Urban Systemic Initiative. The study
would examine learning of science in different institutional settings "to
ascertain how students and teachers interact to give meaning to their
environment." It will seek to learn how teachers in poor urban environments gain
the respect of and build rapport with their students. It will answer other
questions such as, "when students act in ways that are resistant to the goals of
the teacher, how do teachers adapt their teaching to provide opportunities."
