This project is a study of one-dimensional systems in which competing
interactions with different length scales give rise to a succession of
commensurate and incommensurate phases. Their methods open up new possibilities
for understanding commensurate-incommensurate phase transitions. In this context
they will examine a selection of interesting and accessible problems: non-convex
interactions, multicritical points, mean- field theories of selected models,
modeling of a qusi-periodic potential, superconducting networks, mathematical
correspondence between ground states and more general equilibrium states.
