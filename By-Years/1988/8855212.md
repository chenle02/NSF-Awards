The American Chemical Society requests support for a two-year Young Scholars
program involving 40 high-potential Native American, Hispanic, or Black high
school students at the following four institutions: Northern Arizona University,
Montana College of Mineral Science and Technology, University of Texas at San
Antonio, and Florida International University. The program, to be run in
cooperation with the highly praised ACS Project SEED program, will begin with
eight-week summer research projects for the students at the above institutions.
Eligible students will be expected to present a poster paper on their research
at the fall meeting of the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native
Americans in Science. ACS will provide travel grants for this purpose. The
Society will also offer grants of up to $300/teacher to encourage high school
teachers of the participating students to attend the 11th Biennial Chemical
Education Conference to be held in Atlanta, Georgia in the summer of 1990. Each
student will receive a one-year, free subscription to CHEM MATTERS and free
membership in the ACS student affiliates, with all the attendant benefits, for
their first year in college. Following the summer program, the Society, working
through its Career Publications program, Project SEE, the four colleges and
universities, and the ACS local sections involved, will organize science career
programs and other outreach programs for the high schools of the ACS Young
Scholars.
