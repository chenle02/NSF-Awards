This study involves the translation and analysis of previously collected data
consisting of extensive life-histories of young adults in rural southern
Morocco. Taking the life-narratives as cultural "texts", and relating this
material (from extensive in- depth study of individual life-histories) to more
general material from ethnographic studies, the project will analyze the
relation of cultural symbols and the individual's sense of himself as a person.
The investigator, (a psychologist, who is fluent in the language but does not
have the sensitivity of a native speaker) will work with a native speaker of
Moroccan Arabic to complete the translation and analysis of the life narrative
texts as well as a series of projective tests taken by these respondents. The
funds will support six months of half- time research by the investigator, who
will analyze the cultural components and constitution of self-representation.
This research is important because the relation between a person's sense of him-
or herself and the cultural environment that person lives is has been not well
understood. The ethnographic component of the project is also important, as any
increased understanding of Arabic personalities will help us understand how and
why people in those cultures behave as they do.
