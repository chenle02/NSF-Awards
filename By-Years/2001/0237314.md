Although our movements seem smooth and continuous to us, they are not. They are
generated by the brain in small steps. This pulsing signal from the brain is
reflected in our muscles as what is known as physiological tremor; it occurs at
about 10 pulses per second, and it occurs both during movement and rest. This
pulsing signal is thought to save time and computational load in the brain, and
serves to bring all parts of the motor system into step. The proposed studies
will explore the possibility that a crucial part of the brain, the reticular
activating system, which helps control sleep-wake cycles and arousal as well as
posture and movement, generates this necessary background of activity, all at
the same rate of about 10 pulses per second. Such a background of activity could
participate in higher processes such as attention as well as lower motor
processes such as changes in posture or locomotion. This widespread rhythm might
be involved in such complex functions as fight-or-flight responses in which
attention (perceiving a threat) and locomotion (fighting or escaping) are
coordinated. In this project, higher brain regions involved in attention as well
as lower brain regions controlling posture and movement will be studied, in
order to determine if the reticular activating system talks to both higher and
lower centers in the same fashion. This would explain how we can smoothly carry
out complex fight-or-flight responses, and how we can change states, such as
from sleeping to waking, and shift our motor system accordingly.
