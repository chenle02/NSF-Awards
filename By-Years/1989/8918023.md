Oceanic sediments indicate that the Paleocene-Eocene transition involved global
warming, with a reduced latitudinal temperature gradient, ocean-dominated
poleward heat transport, and weak atmospheric circulation. Continental climates
should be warm but highly seasonal under these conditions, but Eocene
continental floras are usually interpreted as non-deciduous and non-seasonal.
Independent evidence of climate and seasonality is sought from fossil mammals.
Twenty-five large faunal samples are available from successive intervals in one
stratigrpahic section in northwestern Wyoming, and intensive collecting will
make at least 15 more samples large. These 40 faunal samples span the interval
from ca.58 to 56 Ma-- the interval including the Paleocene-Eocene epoch boundary
and earliest Eocene warming event. Temporal spacing of samples is comparable to
that in ODP cores. Analysis of species richness, species diversity,k rank
abundance of species-per-family, body size of the largest mammal, and rank-body-
size faunal structure should provide a record of change in continental
paleotemperature, moisture and forest openness for the 2 m.y. study interval.
Spacing of dentinal laminae in tusks of Coryphodon is being investigated as a
source of new information on seasonality.
