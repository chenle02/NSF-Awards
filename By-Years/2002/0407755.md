Genes code for proteins, but most do not do so at a constant rate under all
conditions. These differences in the expression of genes are thought to underlie
much of the diversity of organisms. This project uses the lac operon of E. coli,
which is responsible for metabolizing lactose, to examine the forces affecting
the evolution genetic regulation. Using E. coli collected from high and low
lactose environments, the investigators will determine the differences in
expression of the lac operon associated with these environmental differences.
DNA sequencing of the operon will elucidate the genetic basis of these adaptive
differences. The researchers will use recombinant DNA techniques to manipulate
the regulation of the genes and then measure the fitness of manipulated strains
in the laboratory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Studies of the lac operon have played a
major role in understanding how genetic regulation occurs. This study will use
the system to understand the evolution of genetic regulation, a major cause of
biodiversity. Changes in genetic regulation are likely play a major part in the
evolution of pathogenic bacteria and bacteria which function in basic ecological
processes like decomposition. The basic knowledge gained in these studies will
help our future understanding of these economic and social impacts of
biodiversity. &lt;br/&gt;
