9404154 Chang The proposed research lies in the area of differential geometry,
in particular, submanfiolds and harmonic maps. Five problems are proposed:
classify isoparametric hypersurfaces in higher dimensional spheres with four
distinct principal curvatures; find closed Riemannain n-manifolds of constant
scalar curvature admitting isometric minimal immersions into the
(n+1)-dimensional sphere; the third and fourth problems are about the uniqueness
of minimal embedded tori in the 3-sphere and Euclidean 3- space respectively;
the last problem is to classify those submanifolds of complex projective space
whose normal bundles come with Hermitian-Einstein metrics. The problems
considered have a classical origin; in particular, the study of minimal surfaces
has an interesting history and remains an active area of research in
mathematics. ***
