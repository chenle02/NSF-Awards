This project studies a general and powerful method for program optimization.
This method is based on incrementalization, which allows repeated computations
on slightly changing inputs to be performed efficiently by updating their values
incrementally from one computation to the next. Since all non-trivial
computations proceed in an iterative fashion, which requires repeated updates of
program states, incrementalization underlies essentially all loop optimizations.
This project focuses on an important application of incrementalization, namely,
loop optimization for aggregate computations on arrays. This optimization can
produce drastic speedups of programs for problems in image processing,
computational geometry, computer graphics, multimedia, matrix computation, etc.
The method captures aggregate array computations in loop bodies and
incrementally updates their results over iterations. Part of the analysis is
reduced to symbolic simplification of constraints on loop variables and array
subscripts. Analytical and experimental results both show drastic speedups
compared to previous techniques. Work specifically planned for this project
includes: refining and extending the techniques and algorithms, implementing the
algorithms, analyzing the performance of the optimization algorithm and the
optimized programs, and developing models for the time and space complexity and
data locality of the programs that will enable us to tune the optimizations.
