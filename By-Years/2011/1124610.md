In this project the Principal Investigators will study a relatively new pricing
mechanism that challenges traditional economic theories. Under Pay-What-You-Want
(PWYW) the customer determines how much to pay for the good (often including
$0). In prior research the PI has found that a considerable portion of customers
choose to pay something for goods and has proposed that this behavior is driven,
at least in part, by image management concerns. The current project focuses on
the role self and social image considerations have in PWYW purchases. A series
of experiments will be conducted in which features of the seller-buyer
relationship and type of interaction are systematically manipulated to identify
the parameters that predict the success (and failure) of PWYW strategies and
clarify the respective roles of self and social image concerns in PWYW
decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impact, this research will
shed light regarding the role of non-standard motivations in the marketplace. In
the process it will identify the conditions under which industries can sustain
long-term profits using PWYW pricing, suggest how firms might want to go about
modifying their pricing models, and suggest still other non-PWYW pricing
strategies that might be optimal in light of the drives that make PWYW a
profitable price mechanism.
