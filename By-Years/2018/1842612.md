Non-technical description:&lt;br/&gt;Quantum information science, which utilizes
the inherent principles of quantum mechanics, is leading the next revolution of
electronic and photonic technologies with application in computing,
communication, and sensing. Integrated quantum communication systems that go
beyond the individual devices and components, are crucial to continue pushing
the frontier of quantum information science. Novel approaches towards effective
device integration into quantum technologies become necessary. In this project,
the investigators will leverage the state-of-the-art integrated photonics
technology to develop a disruptive integrated quantum photonic platform. The
developed higher-dimensional control of photons will deliver high-density
information capacity and a higher level of security against quantum hacking, as
needed for quantum communication. This research is closely integrated with the
existing educational activities, providing both undergraduate and graduate
students with the opportunity to participate in cutting-edge science and
technology in an innovative way. The investigators also provide educational
outreach activities to promote the interests and participations of K-12 students
and broaden the participations from underrepresented groups.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description: &lt;br/&gt;With funding from the
Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems Division, the investigators from
the University of Pennsylvania and Stevens Institute of Technology are
developing a disruptive integrated higher-dimensional quantum photonic platform
based upon twisted single photons, ranging from deterministic twisted single-
photon emission, to transmission and high-fidelity detection. The elusive
symmetry and topology of twisted single photons will be explored, together with
their interplay with quantum materials and device geometry, to produce efficient
signal generation and high-fidelity detection of quantum qudits. To engineer the
media-links between qudits' emitter and receiver enabling the fully integrated
quantum system, novel optical fiber configurations will be investigated to
support simultaneous transmission of multiple twisted photons. The investigators
have highly complementary expertise on deterministic quantum emitters,
integrated lasing and photo-detection, which will be actively synergized to
perform high-density quantum key distribution with twisted single-photons,
featuring the increased information capacity and enhanced robustness against
eavesdropping and quantum cloning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
