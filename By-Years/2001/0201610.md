CTS-0201610&lt;br/&gt;Michael Schatz&lt;br/&gt;George Institute of
Technology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a one-year exploratory program to study
the use of thermocapillary-based opto-microfluidics with water based samples. It
is a "proof-of-principle" study to determine whether evaporation effects
adversely affect the intended motion of such fluid samples by the proposed opto-
microfluidic techniques. Experiments will be focused on aqueous microdroplets on
immiscible liquid substrates. The effect of biologically-based surface-active
agents on the motion of the microdroplets, and the metering and mixing of such
samples by the proposed technique will also be studied.
