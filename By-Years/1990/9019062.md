This project will review, evaluate, and analyze new and unprecedented sources
of data on the education and utilization of the Soviet science and engineering
workforce. Appropriate data on Soviet scientists and engineers (S/E's) will be
compiled and comparisons will be made with similar data for the United States.
Major changes are occurring in the Soviet science and technology infrastructure
and data collection systems. This project will examine some of these changes and
their implications for inter- preting overall S&amp;E capabilities. There are
also major changes occurring in the Soviet science and technology data
collection systems. This project will help to evaluate, analyze, and interpret
changes in the data availability, definitions, and data collection systems. This
project is related to one of the eight areas targeted for cooperative research
under the Memorandum of Understanding between NSF and the USSR Academy of
Sciences. Science and engineering indicators is a high priority under the
science policy area and information on the S&amp;E workforce is a critical
indicator of a country's S&amp;E capability. This project would help NSF access
and analyze the large amount of data now becoming available on S/E personnel,
establish a baseline for such data, and identify critical information gaps. The
project is also related to the NSF goal of expanding its international database
of science and engineering indicators.
