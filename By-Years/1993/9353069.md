9353069 Houston The University of Texas Medical Branch seeks to initiate an
eight- week, commuter and residential, Young Scholars project in biochemistry
and life science for 20 students entering grades 11 and 12. The project also
includes a Mathematics and Science Teaching Perspectives (MSTP) component for 4
teachers. The participants will be involved in a research experience under the
guidance of university scientists. Other activities include classroom lectures
and discussions, field trips, seminars, and laboratory activities. The goal of
the project is to provide a stimulating "hands-on" experience in scientific
research for disadvantaged students and their teachers.
