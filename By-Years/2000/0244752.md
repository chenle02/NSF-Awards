There are two main subprojects in this theoretical &lt;br/&gt;gravitational
physics project. On the one hand, the &lt;br/&gt;suitability of a new way of
specifying information &lt;br/&gt;necessary for numerical simulations of gravity
using &lt;br/&gt;the Einstein equations will be studied. This refers to
&lt;br/&gt;gravitational information flowing across the boundary &lt;br/&gt;into
the region where gravity is being simulated. On &lt;br/&gt;the other hand, a
formula for path corrections to light &lt;br/&gt;rays in response to the
thickness of a nearby massive &lt;br/&gt;object will be sought within the
framework of the &lt;br/&gt;theory of general relativity.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first subproject is, potentially, of deep relevance
&lt;br/&gt;to the successful simulation of gravitational wave &lt;br/&gt;signals
expected at powerful new detectors such as the &lt;br/&gt;Laser Interferometer
Gravitational Wave Observatory &lt;br/&gt;(LIGO). The detectors are expected to
open a new &lt;br/&gt;window of research into cosmology and astrophysics
&lt;br/&gt;by listening to gravitational waves, rather than
&lt;br/&gt;electromagnetic waves such as visible light or x-rays. &lt;br/&gt;The
second subproject &lt;br/&gt;has potential relevance to the current
astrophysical &lt;br/&gt;practices of extracting information about the mass of
&lt;br/&gt;the universe from deep-space pictures by advanced
&lt;br/&gt;instruments such as the Hubble Space Telescope.
&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduates will participate in this research.&lt;br/&gt;
