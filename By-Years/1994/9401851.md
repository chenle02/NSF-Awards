9401851 Lepowsky The principal investigators will investigate vertex operator
algebras and Lie algebras. One will study the new concept of vertex tensor
category. The other will construct a new type of basis for the free Lie algebra
and to study affinization of certain simple Lie algebras of Cartan type in prime
characteristic. Together they will use vertex operator algebra theory to study
Z-algebras. Conformal field theory is an important physical theory describing
both two-dimensional critical phenomena in condensed matter physics and
classical motions of strings in string theory. Besides its importance in
physics, the beautiful and rich mathematical structure of conformal field theory
also has interested many mathematicians. New relations between different
branches of mathematics, such as representations of infinite-dimensional Lie
algebras and groups, Riemann surfaces and algebraic curves, the Monster sporadic
group, modular functions and modular forms, elliptic genera, and knot theory, is
revealed in the study of conformal field theory.
