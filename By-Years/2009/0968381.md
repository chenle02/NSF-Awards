0968381 Auburn University; Pradeep Lall&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;CAVE is proposing
a Phase III support (third five-year period) for the Center, including support
for center personnel, evaluation and research. The proposed Center is a single-
university Center at Auburn University. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;CAVE, founded in
September 1999, is a research organization in new technologies for electronics
packaging, reliability, prognostics, and manufacturing related to harsh
environment applications. CAVE addresses both fundamental scientific issues and
the critical needs for operation in extreme environments. CAVE is poised to
continue its contributions to the development of a US core competence in design
and manufacturing of electronics for harsh environments through its focused
membership, experienced faculty, and state-of-the-art facilities. The Center
membership included major automotive, aerospace, and defense electronics OEMs,
as well as their supply infrastructure including manufacturers of printed wiring
boards, components, electronics materials, and assembly equipment.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center will continue to develop and implement new
technologies for the packaging and manufacturing of electronics, with emphasis
on the reliability, prognostics, and cost effectiveness in harsh environments.
The Center proposes to integrate academic learning with industrial problems for
students' education. The broader impacts of the CAVE Center research will be
achieved through: special programs for middle school science teachers and
students; broad dissemination of research findings through publications,
workshops, short courses, and the www; partnering with industry and federal
agencies; and, involvement of under-represented groups in undergraduate and
graduate research projects. &lt;br/&gt;
