This proposal requests funds to hold a workshop on research needs and
opportunities in high temperature superconductivity. The objectives of the
workshop are threefold, to: 1) identify the barriers that may limit the
developmental progress in high temperature superconductivity, 2) assess research
areas that are particularly ripe for important advances, and 3) investigate
interagency collaborative research projects that utilize existing large research
facilities.
