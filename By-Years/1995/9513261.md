INT 9513261 Coffin This U.S.-Hungary cooperative research project between Debra
Coffin of Colorado State University and Edit Kovacs-Lang of the Hungarian
Academy of Sciences' Institute of Ecology and Botany will evaluate the
importance of drought and soil texture to arid and semiarid grasslands in both
countries. Specifically, field studies and model simulations will be used to
evaluate effects of climate and soils on plant biodiversity, spatial pattern and
temporal dynamics. Results should yield a wealth of species- and community-level
data that may be used to predict changes in the structure of dry grasslands and
to develop controls on vegetation dynamics. Such new information can be useful
in interpreting the broader effects of global climate change on the grassland
biome, which altogether accounts for about 24 percent of the earth's surface
cover. This long-term ecological research project fulfills the program objective
of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the Untied
States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research
resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. ??
