This I-Corps team aims to explore the commercial potential of low-cost energy
efficient coating processes via the customer discovery process and value
creation activities. The techniques developed by the team can find applications
across a whole host of industries including solar cells, flat glass, eyeglasses,
microelectronics, and specialized/fiber optics industries.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team has developed the Microreactor-Assisted
Nanomaterials Deposition (MAND) processes that combine the merits of
microreaction technology with solution-phase nanomaterial synthesis,
purification, functionalization, and deposition. The MAND architecture is a
flexible and versatile nanomanufacturing platform for nanomaterials synthesis
and deployment. It can be implemented in various ways for the manufacturing of
functional nanostructures. MAND techniques have been shown to be effective at
producing sophisticated, functionally gradient nanostructures with better
material utilization and lower energy requirements with the potential for less
worker exposure and lower operating and capital costs.
