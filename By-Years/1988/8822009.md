An Imaging Fabry Perot Spectrometer will be constructed in order to carry out
long-term studies of emission-line objects using the Ohio State/Lowell
Observatory 72-inch telescope. This instrument will use commercially available
etalons (from Queensgate Instruments) with resolving powers of R=2500 and
R=30,000. It will operate in both the Ultraviolet (UV) and red parts of the
spectrum, requiring a total of 4 etalons and 2 camera/collimator sets. An UV
flooded Charge Coupled Device (CCD) detector will be used. The combination of
high throughput, high quantum efficiency, and relatively large amounts of
observing time will allow the Principal Investigator to carry out world-class
astronomy on a modest-sized telescope. Ohio State and Lowell Observatory are
provideing $57,000 in direct matching funds plus about $100,000 in salaries for
the project. The additional NSF funds will allow construction of the instrument,
which will then be used by a variety of Ohio State and Lowell astronomers for
extensive studies of the emission lines from active galaxies, irregular
galaxies, supernova remnants, planetary nebulae, HII regions, and solar system
objects.
