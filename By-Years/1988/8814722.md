This project will provide a new generation of VUV spectral data necessary for
rigorous testing of theoretical models for photoionization, photodissociation,
and other processes involving bound-continuum electronic interactions. Precise
variations of intensity with wavelength over wide ranges of energy are essential
to further progress in this area because all electronic structure and
photoinduced-process information must be deduced from deconvolution of the
experimental data using theory based models. Precise spectral photometric
intensities (1% or better) and absolute photoabsorption cross sections (0.5-2.5%
range) will be determined with high spectral resolving powers (R.P &gt; 100,000)
using facilities at the University of Maryland (UM) and at the SURF II electron
storage ring. Absolute photoabsorption cross sections measured to high accuracy
are rare because they are difficult to measure. They are however of great
practical significance in many applications. We thus recommend support for this
work.
