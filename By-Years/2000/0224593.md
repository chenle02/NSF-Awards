The objective of this project is to improve the productivity of indole alkaloids
in a well-characterized model plant tissue culture system, C. roseus. The
overall goals are to determine the metabolic effects of genetic manipulations of
some key enzymes in the indole and non-mevalonate terpenoid pathways on flux
through the indole alkaloid synthesis pathways, with special emphasis on the
interplay between primary and secondary metabolism on the final alkaloid
productivity. The specific objectives are to: 1) construct and characterize
transgenic hairy root lines overexpressing key enzymes, such as ORCA3, G10H,
DXS, DXR and AS-beta under the control of a recently characterized inducible
promoter system; 2) develop methods for NMR- based metabolic flux maps; 3)
perform metabolic characterization of these first generation transgenic lines;
4) develop techniques for co-transformation that allow the introduction of
multiple genes; 5) construct and characterize a second generation of transgenic
lines expressing strategic combinations of genes as determined from the results
of the first generation transgenic lines above.
