This research will test the idea that a distinctive fauna of ancient, endemic,
specialized invertebrates lives in the groundwaters of unglaciated Mesozoic
terrain in eastern North America. The existence of such a fauna is to be
expected based on the distribution of the faunas of caves and surface waters in
eastern North America. This idea will be tested by analyzing the invertebrate
communities of shallow groundwater (the hyporheic zone) at 15-20 sites between
the Canadian border and the Gulf of Mexico. The results of this research will
help to answer questions about several important topics, including: (i) the
zoogeography and evolution of the groundwater fauna; (ii) the ecological
structure and function of groundwater communities of different evolutionary
ages; (iii) interactions between epigean generalists and hypogean specialists in
groundwater communities; (iv) predicting the response of groundwater communities
to global climate change; (v) predicting the response of groundwater communities
to catastrophic disturbance; and (vi) elucidating the evolutionary and
physiological ecology of groundwater invertebrates. The project will contribute
to the basic ecology of groundwater communities, an area of major interest among
ecologists, and will add to the knowledge base useful for applied science.
