Graphical Software to Enhance Visualization in Beginning Chemistry Courses
Dynamic visualization materials for instruction in beginning chemistry courses
will be developed. The project will focus on graphical and animation techniques
in the Macintosh computer with "Director" software as well as SuperCard and
Super 3D. The materials will enhance comprehension of the dynamic molecular
processes that are central to an understanding of chemistry. They will relate
macroscopic behavior to abstract concepts and models. The materials may be used
as lecture tools, for lecture amplification/review, and as tutorial units. The
materials will be evaluated and reviewed at each step by a group of faculty
members from research universities, comprehensive universities and community
colleges. These materials will be especially beneficial for students with poor
science and mathematical backgrounds or weak communication skills.
