DVD research reports can bring coherence to teachers and researchers
perspectives on pedagogy that are very difficult to convey in written text, by
embodying them as active learning supports. The research proposed here will
explore the design and technological issues in making such DVDs imbedded in an
ongoing NSF-sponsored research study of urban children's mathematical thinking.
This new line of research draws on the substantial progress that was made in
understanding of student mathematical thinking in inner city classrooms.
Furthermore, this project will allow for dissemination efforts that will reach
teachers in ways that allow them to change their own teaching in constructive
ways. Additionally, researchers will be able to use the DVD material to support
new research avenues. The research will generate 3 successive versions of the
DVD with field-testing among audiences with each iteration/version. Products of
the research include the DVD's and a design framework for further work in the
domain.
