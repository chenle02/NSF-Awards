Navrotsky&lt;br/&gt;0229332&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal funds the
Thermochemistry Facility at UC Davis. This facility has unique capabilities to
measure enthalpies of formation in mineralogical systems. This project
emphasizes the thermochemistry of high-pressure perovskite phases relevant to
the Earth's lower mantle, of other lower pressure hydrous phases, and of rare
earth - bearing geochemical systems. In addition, it will provide the
infrastructure support to allow visitors to perform calorimetric measurements
relevant to a variety of mineralogical and geochemical problems.&lt;br/&gt;
