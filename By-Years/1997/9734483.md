The field of visual computing is concerned with the storage, analysis,
manipulation of sampled definitions of 3D objects and the resulting image
synthesis. Given the ubiquitous use of imagery for graphics in architecture,
engineering design and manufacturing, and entertainment, there is an ever-
growing need for realism in displayed images. For serious uses of imagery in
engineering and medicine, there is an additional need for assurances for
accuracy and for providing ways to validate the image. This project will
increase the level of understanding about the foundational aspects of image
synthesis, an essential component of visual computing. Volume rendering and
visualization algorithms are being increasingly used for image synthesis in
visual computing systems. The project plans to specifically address the
following issues: * Accuracy in volume rendering algorithms-Lack of concerted
efforts to define and measure image quality has stymied the widespread use of
visualization techniques and visual computing. * Volume Analysis- Given the
noisy nature of the datasets and large sizes, there is a need to seek minimal
correlated representations of the volumes and even rendering operators. *
Perceptual metrics - The displayed image should preset meaningful information to
the end-user. It would be useful to employ objective numerical tools to guide
the generation of new images if desired. One approach to achieving this goals
will be to use multiresolution methods including the wavelet transform. The work
will be initially targeted towards the requirements of computational fluid
dynamics engineers, marine geologists and medical imaging experts, given the
access of Principal Investigator (PI) to the ERC, NASA Stennis and the
University of Mississippi Medical center (UMMC) respectively.
