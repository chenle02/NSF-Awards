PROPOSAL NO.: 0234108 PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Martha Gray INSTITUTION NAME: MIT
TITLE: NIH-NSF BBSI HST-MGH Summer Institute for Biomedical Optics

ABSTRACT

The HST-MGH Summer Institute will focus on introducing students to Biomedical
Optics, the use of light in biology and medicine, to advance our understanding
of biology and pathophysiology and to create effective diagnostic and
therapeutic strategies. The Summer Institute, hosted jointly by the Harvard-MIT
Division of Health Sciences and Technology (HST) and The Wellman Lab at
Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), is designed in accordance with the
following objectives:

To introduce students to the interdisciplinary nature of bioengineering
research To introduce students to the technologies associated with Biomedical
Optics and provide an understanding of its strengths and limitations To
introduce students to current and envisioned biological and medical applications
of Biomedical Optics

The didactic program is based on HST and MGH/Wellman program elements that are
already in place, and will provide the students with both depth in biomedical
optics, and breadth in bioengineering more generally. These include:

A formal course on biomedical optics Tutorial lectures on the role of light in
medicine and biology An ongoing research lecture series on in Photomedicine An
ongoing seminar series by the Center for Integration of Medicine & Innovative
Technology (CIMIT), which deals more broadly with the use of bioengineering
techniques ranging from tissue engineering to image-guided therapy, and will
provide a broad view of current research at sites both inside and beyond MGH.
Weekly meetings of the research groups into which students are placed. A
research skills module designed to help students plan their research and
communicate their results orally and in writing. Bioethics module designed to
teach students to identify the ethical considerations of their research.

Students in the program will work on research projects in the following areas:

Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) Optical Coherence Tomography In vivo confocal
microscopy and multi-photon microscopy Selective Laser targeting to treat
diseases involving the retinal pigment epithelium Diffuse Optical Tomography
imaging of stroke, hemorrhage, brain function, and breast cancer Improved
Microscopy for Surgical Pathology Video microscopy for Biological Micromechanics
