Although approximation algorithms and on-line algorithms have each been studied
rather extensively, there has been very little work that examines the
approximation and on-line aspects in tandem. That is, the design of
approximation algorithms that work in an iterative fashion. The dual goals in
designing such algorithms are to make the algorithm run fast, and to produce a
good approximation. This research on incremental approximations is aimed at
examining the tradeoffs and issues involved, as well as to develop incremental
approximation methods for specific problems in register allocation, scheduling
for packet radio networks, and bin-packing.
