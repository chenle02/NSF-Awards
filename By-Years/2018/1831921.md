This research will design and develop a data science platform that provides
access to policy documents. The platform will make available for the first-time
analytical tools, using natural language computer processing and data science to
enable systematic research and inquiry by practitioners, project proponents,
scholars, and the public to answer a host of critical questions about public
policy. Using natural language processing and data science, this research will
design and develop a data science platform that provides access to tens of
thousands of policy documents. The research team will produce a blueprint for
the platform and validate its functionality with a community of scholars and
practitioners, and establish the platform structure, ingest data, and refine
analytical tools to integrate policy documents across many repositories, link
text to metadata even when text comes from one source and the metadata from
another, infer more detailed types of metadata that are not present in any of
the existing repositories from analysis of the text, and allow researchers,
contractors, and policy analysts to pose complex questions and answer them via
analysis of policy documents. The team will also build a user community to
catalyze scholarship and application and develop long-term mechanisms to ensure
the sustainability and continued growth, management, and use of the platform and
its resources.
