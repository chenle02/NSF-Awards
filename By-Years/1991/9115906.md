Knowledge of the molecular structures of proteins is increasingly important as
we try to understand their function and to modify that function by altering
their structures through genetic engineering. One of the important physical
tools for studying structure is vibrational (i.e., infrared and Raman)
spectroscopy, since it is not limited to the crystalline state (as is x-ray
diffraction) or to the solution state (as is high resolution NMR spectroscopy).
However, in order to realize its full potential, such spectroscopic studies must
progress beyond the band correlation stage to the use of the rigorous methods of
normal mode analysis, which permit detailed predictions to be made of spectral
frequencies and intensities associated with a given three-dimensional structure.
A strong foundation for such approaches has been laid by refining an empirical
vibrational force field for the polypeptide chain and applying it to normal mode
calculations and the analyses of structure in some peptide and polypeptide
systems. Dr. Krimm will now extend this approach to a number of new systems,
involving peptide, polypeptide, and disulfide bridge conformations, and use
empirical as well as quantum-mechanical force fields to develop molecular
mechanics potential functions for accurate spectroscopic predictions as well as
molecular dynamics simulations.
