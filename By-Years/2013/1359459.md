The main objectives of the Medical Informatics (MedIX) REU Site program are to
engage undergraduate students in challenging research projects, encourage them
to pursue graduate education and to expose students to interdisciplinary
research, especially at the border of information technology and medicine. The
MedIX REU Site runs for three summers, with eight student participants doing
research ten weeks each summer under the supervision of three mentors dedicated
to undergraduate research. The REU Site is hosted by two interdisciplinary
laboratories: the Medical Informatics Laboratory at DePaul University and the
Imaging Research Institute at the University of Chicago. The research
environment offers the students the opportunity to interact with computer
scientists, medical physicists, and medical doctors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All
of the projects are inspired by state-of-the-art research questions in imaging
informatics. Students work as part of faculty-undergraduate teams on new
problems ranging from traditional image processing (e.g., computer-aided
diagnosis, breast density assessment, cancer detection) to structured reporting
and natural language processing of radiology reports, to workflow and process
re-engineering to the application of data mining and ontology-based means for
image annotation and markup (e.g., lung nodule detection and interpretation).
Ultimately, each project has the long-term potential to increase the quality of
healthcare available to people everywhere. More information on the program can
