Abstract Strassmann & Queller IBN-9507515 Worker control of reproduction in
multiple-queen wasp societies The social insects provide one of the best models
for studying cooperative behavior in the natural world. Kin selection theory has
successfully explained why a social insect might help relatives instead of
trying to reproduce alone, but a more difficult problem remains unsolved. Given
that an individual decides to join a group, it should often be selected to
prefer being a reproductive rather than helping. But if this is so, how is
anarchy avoided, particularly in large colonies where the queen cannot hope to
physically dominate all her subordinates? The most promising hypothesis appears
to be collective worker control of reproduction, but this possibility has not
been tested very widely. Strassmann and Queller will take advantage of extensive
past work on a species of social wasp, Parachartergus colobopterus, to test for
collective worker control in three distinct contexts. First, do workers
determine who lays the haploid male eggs? Second, do workers determine which of
the numerous queens survives to produce new queens? Third, do workers determine
the timing and the identity of new queens? In each case the predictions will be
derived from kin selection theory and will be tested through the analysis of
videotaped behavior, combined with kinship analysis based on DNA microsatellite
genotypes. This research will ultimately reveal much about the expression and
resolution of genetic conflicts of interest. It will also contribute to the new
technology surrounding microsatellite genes, methods which are important in many
areas, including evolutionary studies, conservation genetics, forensics, and
gene-mapping studies for agricultural and medical needs. Besides contributing to
the training of postdoctoral and graduate students, Strassmann and Queller
encourage p articipation of undergraduates, high school students, and teachers
who take the knowledge they gain back to the classroom.
