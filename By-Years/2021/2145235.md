This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2).

An award is made to Georgia Institute of Technology to establish integrated
research and educational infrastructure innovation in biophotonics and advanced
microscopy. This CAREER project will catalyze the discovery of imaging science
and technology, the transformation of cross-disciplinary infrastructure for
discovery and training, and the broader participation of scientific communities
and underrepresented groups in STEM. The project seeks to transform biological
investigations relying on conventional biophotonic methods, through technical
breakthroughs and new knowledge in fundamental biology and, ultimately,
translational research. To broaden the educational impacts of the work, the PI
will (1) prioritize and recruit women and minority undergraduate and graduate
students to work on this project through on-campus or online resources, (2)
integrate research and education by organizing an Atlanta international school
on biophotonics and advanced optical microscopy, (3) develop innovative teaching
and learning methods to enhance problem-based education and improve the public
scientific literacy, and (4) engage underrepresented and veteran groups in STEM
by enhancing school-lab interactions and through a summer camp on biophotonics.
These efforts will impact the training of next-generation biologists, imaging
engineers, and professionals and promote cross-fertilization of research and
education from diverse disciplines.

Over the past decades, fluorescence microscopy has emerged as one of the most
vital and informative driving forces for biological research. Infrastructure
developments have therefore been increasingly demanded to cope with the unmet
needs of biological discovery. In response, this project addresses the critical
interface between microscopy innovations and cell biological research. In
particular, the research will advance live-cell imaging by developing
multiplexing light-field instrumentation and methods â€“ mux-LFM. The mux-LFM
platform is being pursued to transform the current cell microscopy
infrastructure, realizing functional, structural, and populational live-cell
interrogations through a unified architecture. This infrastructural advance will
enable broad cell biological research toward a systems-level understanding of
molecular, subcellular, and cellular programs. The results will inspire future
technology innovations, stimulate significant biological insights, and create
methodological pathways for broader science, engineering, and technology
breakthroughs.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
