9452549 McGinnis A computer-based neurophysiology laboratory will complement an
existing neurobiology course within the Biology Department. The laboratory
component will foster increased exploration, critical analysis and hands-on
experience in using state-of-the art instrumentation by students enrolled in the
course. Equipment will be purchased to build five (5) electrophysiological
workstations including: electrophysiological instrumentation, computers, and
optical equipment. Emphasis will be placed on the use of instrumentation, as
well as graphical and statistical analysis of data using computers and computer
software. As a result of this experience, students will learn concepts of
neurobiology through inquiry and experimentation. The students will also become
familiar with a computer and its application as a tool to gather and analyze
data, skills that are increasingly becoming a requisite for both technical and
non-technical careers. Approximately 40 students annually will be able to
increase their skills through enrollment in the proposed computer-based
neurophysiolocal laboratory.
