Abstract:

The PI plans to study the geometry of convex bodies using methods of harmonic
and functional analysis. One direction is to express different properties of
convex bodies in terms of the Fourier transform and then use methods of Fourier
analysis to solve geometric problems. This approach will lead to new results on
sections and projections of convex bodies, characterizations of different
classes of bodies, new results of the Busemann-Petty type. Another direction of
research is related to a new connection between convex geometry and the theory
of L_p-spaces, which has recently been found by the PI and allows to get new
geometric results by extending different facts about L_p-spaces to negative
values of p. Particularly interesting is the question of whether intersection
and polar projection bodies are isomorphically equivalent. A solution to this
problem will represent a big step in understanding the duality between sections
and projections, which remains one of the most intriguing mysteries of convex
geometry. The PI also plans to apply these methods to several open problems of
asymptotic geometric analysis, including the central limit problem for convex
bodies.

The study of geometric properties of convex bodies based on information about
sections and projections of these bodies has important applications to many
areas of mathematics and science, from the classical theory of x-rays and
geometric tomography to different problems of engineering and medicine. A new
approach to sections and projections of convex bodies, based on methods of
Fourier analysis, has recently been developed by the PI. This approach has
already led to several results, including a Fourier analytic solution of the
Busemann-Petty problem on sections of convex bodies asking whether bodies with
uniformly smaller central sections necessarily have smaller volume. The proposed
research will lead to better understanding of the geometry of convex bodies and
will further relate methods and results of convex geometry to harmonic analysis,
functional analysis and probability. New techniques for computing the Fourier
transform, developed in this project, will have independent value and can be
applied to signal processing and statistics.
