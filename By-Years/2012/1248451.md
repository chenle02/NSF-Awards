This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes a new tissue
engineered vascularized adipose graft product for reconstructive surgery. Of the
approximately one million new breast cancer cases worldwide, many patients
choose mastectomy due to a lack of viable reconstructive options. The long-term
objective of this research is to build an autologous tissue structure that can
integrate more naturally with the patient than conventional products. The
proposed research will use a new bioprinting technology to create capillary
channels that are hypothesized to anastomose with host tissue quickly, thereby
allowing lab-grown tissues to survive once transplanted to the patient. The
research team will build constructs, determine optimal parameters for printing
tissue, and measure feasibility of anastomosis with mouse models. The results
will help the development of design rules for bioprinted capillaries with
respect to rapid anastomoses to the host. From here a decision can be made to
move forward with testing pre-vascularized grafts in larger animals. The results
of this study are expected to impact several current treatment regimes, such as
autologous fat grafting for breast reconstruction following lumpectomy,
affecting approximately 110,000 people in the US annually.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will improve the
quality of life for people suffering from deformity due to cancer tumor removal,
congenital defects and traumatic injuries. Patients with asymmetry following
lumpectomy treatment for breast cancer are more likely to believe the cancer
will reoccur and to be depressed; it is estimated that 25-30% of breast cancer
patients are dissatisfied with the outcome of a lumpectomy and few
reconstructive options exist for lumpectomies. The methods presented herein, if
successful, should solve this problem, allowing a more natural solution
utilizing the patient's own cells with a theoretically excellent prognosis. The
field of Tissue Engineering is currently limited to small, thin constructs due
to inadequate nutrient profusion (i. e., Vasculature). Further development of
the bioprinting process and the reassembling of cells in vitro to construct
vascularized tissue analogs will generate new methods and results in the fields
of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine. The results of this research
will help the field move towards larger, clinically relevant tissues and
potentially whole organs. The commercial impacts of this research will be the
availability of an autologous option for women in the lucrative $10B (US) market
for breast augmentation.
