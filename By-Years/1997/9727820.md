97-27820 TSUCHITANI. Compared to listening with one ear, listening with two ears
provides significant advantages to hearing in quiet and noisy rooms. Individuals
who are deaf in one ear perform significantly more poorly than normal listeners
on tasks such as locating sound sources and identifying spoken words presented
in noise. Experiments have shown that differences between the sounds at the two
ears (i.e., interaural differences) are used by our brains to provide this
"binaural" advantage. Two important brain centers involved in comparing these
interaural differences are the lateral superior olive (LSO) and the medial
nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). MNTB neurons provide the LSO with
information about sounds coming from one ear, while cochlear nuclear neurons
provide information about sounds coming from the opposite ear. The studies of
Dr. Tsuchitani and her collaborators have shown that LSO neurons use this
information to compute interaural differences in loudness (ILD) and time-varying
ILDs produced by the sound-shadowing effect of the head and ear. Dr. Johnson and
collaborators developed a computational model of LSO neurons that permits
simulation of LSO responses, and statistical models that provide descriptions
and predictions of how the LSO system responds to different types of binaural
stimuli. The studies to be undertaken will explore the role of the LSO and MNTB
in the neural processing of complex signals akin to those encountered naturally
by employing methods developed for virtual acoustics. Transient complex stimuli
will be used, presented alone and in background noise. The apparent location of
the signal source will be manipulated by applying cat head-related transfer
functions supplied by Dr. Joseph Hind and Dr. John Brugge of the University of
Wisconsin. Dr. Tsuchitani, an auditory neurophysiologist, will conduct the
experiments manipulating the stimuli and recording the electrical responses of
single and multiple neurons in the LSO and MNTB to these stimuli. Dr. Johnson, a
communication/signal processing theorist, will be applying advanced signal
analysis techniques to the recorded data to determine how the ensemble of LSO
neurons responding to complex stimuli processes binaural information. This
technique will be used to determine what perceptual cues, ILD, time varying
ILDs, interaural time differences, and interaural spectral differences, the LSO
ensemble response provides. The results of this project will reveal how the
brain uses interaural differences to produce the binaural advantage in hearing
in quiet and noisy rooms.
