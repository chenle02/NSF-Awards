9714555 Jacko The proposed research focuses on the study of human-computer
interaction (HCI) in partially sighted individuals. The principal investigator
has made a series of observations of how the partially sighted interact with
graphical user interface (GUI)-based computers. These observations have resulted
in a set of seven hypotheses relating to how partially sighted individuals
interact with a GUI computer. This planning grant seeks to test these hypotheses
via a series of experiments to enable the investigator, in the long term, to
design improved user interfaces for the partially sighted. Approximately 100
subjects are to be studied in these experiments. Each subject will have
undergone a series of standard ophthalmology exams, which will be used to
establish an empirical link between visual system physiology and specific HCI
behaviors. ***
