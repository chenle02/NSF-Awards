With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Miami University in Oxford will
acquire a 400 MHz solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)spectrometer. This
equipment will enable researchers to carry out studies on a) the
characterization of the membrane-bound protein phospholamban; b) an
investigation of the structure and mechanism of action of CREP-1; c) an
examination of the metalloenzyme metallo-beta-lactamase, believed responsible
for antibiotic resistance in bacteria; d) organically modified polymers and
their use in combinatorial chemistry; e) influence of dendrimers on sol-gel
materials; and f) development of novel packing materials for chromatographic
separations.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies will have an impact in a number of areas, in particular, medicinal
chemistry, biochemistry and materials chemistry.
