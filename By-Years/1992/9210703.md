Experiments are proposed to study management decision making in industrial
markets characterized by uncertainty and asymmetric information: (1) Markets in
which incumbent firms may try to limit entry through strategic price
manipulations and (2) Markets in which a large chain-store may attempt to limit
entry in its markets by establishing a reputation for being a tough competitor.
A series of pilot experiments in both markets raise a number of questions that
go well beyond the original theory that occasioned the experiments. New
experiments are offered to answer these questions. The overall focus of the
experiments is to better understand information processing and decision making
by managers in industries with uncertainty and asymmetric information regarding
rival firms' underlying cost structure.
