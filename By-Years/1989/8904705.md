The history of timing, size and rupture geometry of past earthquakes provide
the most direct basis on which to determine past seismic periodicity and to
predict future activity. However, seismographically recorded earthquake
histories are too short for this approach. Some coasts in Vanuatu, Southwest
Pacific, uplift during each interplate thrust zone earthquake, and the uplift
raises shallow-living coral colonies above sea level and kills them. The
characteristic coral morphology of these events, combined with recently refined
thermal ionization mass spectrometric 230th dating makes it possible to date
these events precisely and thereby determine the coseismic uplift history. This
project, collaborative with EAR89-04987, will collect a suite of corals showing
uplift-kill morphology along several segments of central Vanuatu and conduct
230th age dating. Results will allow calculation of coseismic uplift periodicity
and since Vanuatu is considered a weakly coupled subduction zone, results will
also help in calculating the proportion of aseismic vs. seismic slip and
determine at what point in the earthquake cycle the aseismic slip occurs.
