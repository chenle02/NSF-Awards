This award is for support for a two year project to use seasonal oxygen-isotope
records from existing ice cores to provide a means of linking the surface of the
Greenland ice sheet to the global climate system through the analysis of
climatic data, atmospheric circulation patterns and other environmental
indicators. The proposed research will investigate the spatial and temporal
variability of seasonal oxygen isotope signals from a geographically diverse set
of ice cores, determine their applicability as indicators of regional climatic
conditions, and determine the ice-climate relationship through intercomparison
of ice core oxygen isotopic records, instrumental climate records and
atmospheric circulation from the recent past. The statistical methods to be used
include principle component analysis, linear trend analysis and stepwise
multiple regression of both surface temperature and circulation anomalies.
