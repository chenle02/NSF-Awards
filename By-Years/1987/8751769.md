Science Collaborative Project is a three project for 60 underprepared junior
high school science teachers from minority school districts in New York City
(Districts 4, 5, 6, 9, and 10). These teachers will take a specially designed
sequence of four courses (summer session and academic year) at CCNY in physics,
chemistry, earth sciences, and life sciences. These courses are designed to both
improve the teachers' understanding of basic concepts in these four areas, and
to extend their pedagogical skills in teaching physical and life science
material in largely minority junior high schools. In addition, a major aim of
the project is to improve the science skills and attitudes of minority students.
Approximately 45% of the science teachers in these five districts will
participate. They will receive 18 graduate credits from CCNY for the course
work. In addition, through collaboration with experienced junior and senior high
school science teachers at Bronx High School of Science, participants will have
the opportunity for extensive practice teaching during summer sessions.
Participants are expected to attain a level of competency that would permit many
of them to help other science teachers in their districts.
