broadening the participation of minorities and women in mid- and large-scale
research. The goals of the workshop are to 1) better understand convergence and
interdisciplinarity as they relate to collaborative and inclusive larger scale

participants to strategies for identifying ?big idea? larger scale problems and
establishing collaborations to solve them and 4) increase the numbers of
minorities and women engaged in transformative
convergent&lt;br/&gt;research.&lt;br/&gt;
