This proposal represents an effort to effectively disseminate NSF-funded
interactive and thematic introductory micro- and macro-economics courses
designed and implemented at the University of Cincinnati. These courses use
themes to help students from differing backgrounds and disciplinary interests
learn to apply economic concepts and theories. These classes are taught
interactively, requiring students to write, speak, solve problem, and analyze.
It is proposed to offer short "tasting workshops" at scheduled economics
conferences to increase awareness of the thematic and active learning
approaches; enhance the knowledge, skills, and abilities of a large number of
faculty at low cost; create a pool of potential attendees for a longer workshop;
and provide feedback concerning the needs of faculty in the areas of active
learning and thematic courses. Further, we will assess the effectiveness of
these workshops in terms of (1) the extent to which interactive and thematic
methods are used by participants prior to the workshops; (2) participants' end-
of workshop intentions; (3) longer term follow-up assessments. The primary
audience for the workshops is faculty who teach introductory economics courses.
However, given that standard introductory economics is often presented in a
format largely disconnected from contexts familiar and important to women and
minorities, and that the interactive thematic curricula specifically addresses
this issue, we will give preference to faculty who teach more diverse student
bodies. Successful implementation of the proposed dissemination project could
have a national impact. The problems of selective appeal, high enrollments, and
limited resources are experienced in hundreds of schools throughout the nation
and in a variety of departments.
