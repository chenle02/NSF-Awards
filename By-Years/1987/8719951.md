A new process was developed for creation of ceramic whiskers, using an NSF
Expedited Award for Novel Research. The process can form both silicon carbide
and silicon nitride whiskers. These whiskers can be incorporated into other
materials and result in large increases in the strength and toughness of that
material, thus leading to the ability to produce better manufactured products.
This award is to allow research to develop the procedure further to make it one
that can be adopted by industry. Attempts will be made to use the resulting
composite materials in several applications, e.g., metal cutting tools, and to
demonstrate their use in industry.
