Collisions of atoms at very low temperatures are investigated using close-
coupling methods and other more novel approaches for excited state interactions.
The dissipative effects of spontaneous emission, unimportant in collisions at
ordinary temperatures, play a major and as yet not well understood role in these
ultracold processes. New theoretical approaches using the Liouville equation
will be used to treat the excited state collisions in the presence of the laser
field. The subject of ultracold atomic collisions is under active experimental
study both here in the U.S. and abroad.
