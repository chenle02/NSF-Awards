This project is concerned with the computational analysis of time dependent
fluid flows and it involves both the design of reliable and efficient numerical
methods for problems on unbounded domains and the simulation of wave propagation
in reactive media. One aspect of this work is the development and testing of
asymptotic boundary conditions for the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations in
exterior and cylindrical domains. The main tool is the asymptotic analysis of
the long range propagation of waves. An advantage of this approach is enhanced
accuracy, which may be controlled by varying the domain size or improving the
asymptotic approximations. A second area of concentration is the computational
study of existence, stability and dynamics of multidimensional diffusive waves.
One application is to a model of flame propagation in a channel, including the
effects of heat loss at the walls. The numerical analysis of singular
perturbation problems will also be studied. The emphasis is on hyperbolic
problems with stiff source terms and on the long time simulation of complex
systems. The unifying theme throughout is the interplay between computational
and asymptotic analysis.
