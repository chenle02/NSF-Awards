Matching funds are provided to instrument a new computer graphics course in the
computer science program. The equipment list includes a slide recorder, color
thermal printer, single frame video recorder, a VTR controller and animation
software. The institution identified the need to improve its computer graphics
component of the computer science program with an additional project-oriented
course in computer graphics. The college also encourages interdisciplinary
projects using computer graphics for visualization in the physical sciences;
particularly in biology and chemistry.
