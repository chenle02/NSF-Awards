The University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) operates R/V Sikuliaq, a 261-foot,
global class, ice-capable oceanographic research vessel owned by the NSF as part
of the Academic Research Fleet (ARF) fleet. Sikuliaq provides a general-purpose
platform for multidisciplinary research missions from polar to temperate
latitudes. The ship was delivered in 2014 and has completed seven years of
funded operations. UAF requests funds to purchase oceanographic instrumentation
that would enhance the vesselâ€™s capability in support of NSF sponsored research
to be undertaken on Sikuliaq in the future. The proposed instrumentation would
be operated on a shared-use basis within the UNOLS framework and maintained by
the UAF/Sikuliaq oceanographic technical services group in support of NSF-funded
scientists who require use of such seagoing facilities. UAF requests funds for
the purchase, installation, and integration of a Kongsberg EM304 Mark II
Multibeam Echosounder (MBES).

The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2
of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 19-602). It provides infrastructure support for
scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of
their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo
separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition,
maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded
researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
