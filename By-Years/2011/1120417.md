Physical and chemical interactions between individuals are a necessary part of
normal reproduction, yet in many animals, differing reproductive goals of males
and females sometimes leads to a genetic conflict between the sexes. This
project uses the power of the well-studied nematode model system, Caenorhabditis
elegans, which reproduces primarily via self-reproduction, and its close
relative C. remanei, which has separate males and females, to examine the
genetic basis of reproductive interactions. This project uses comprehensive
genomic and proteomic approaches to identify the genetic bases of male
reproductive traits and antagonistic effects in both C. elegans and C. remanei
natural isolates, as well as in C. elegans populations that have been
genetically manipulated to reproduce via outcrossing instead of self-
reproduction.

Reproduction is a defining characteristic of living systems, and understanding
the genetic and functional basis of reproductive interactions can provide key
insights about the forces that maintain the tremendous diversity that we see in
the world. Infertility affects more than six million Americans each year, with
many of these cases being caused by mysterious incompatibilities between the
perspective parents. Many basic biological functions are conserved across all
animals, so identifying the genes and proteins involved in reproductive
interactions in these species may yield insights into similar interactions in
other organisms, including humans.
