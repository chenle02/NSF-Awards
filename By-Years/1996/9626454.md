Dr. Wayne W. Lukens has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Lukens received the doctoral degree from the University of
California at Berkeley under the supervision of Professor Richard Andersen. Dr.
Lukens will continue research at the University of California at Santa Barbara
under the sponsorship of Professor Galen Stucky. The postdoctoral research will
focus on the study of transition metal substituted mesoporous silicates. The
goal is to specifically substitute transition metals for framework silicon atoms
at the surface of the pores. Because of the substitution, the spectra of the
metal center, especially the EXAFS spectra, may be more straightforwardly
interpreted in characterization of the mesoporous materials. The longterm goal
is to prepare and characterize organometallic catalysts which are able to
perform sequential reactions such as carbonylation followed by ring-closing
metathesis. The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed
as an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and
experience of new Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in
contemporary chemical research and teaching.
