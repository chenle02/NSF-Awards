Public health systems in the United States have the ability to conduct manual
contact tracing; however they do not have the capacity to trace individuals at
the scale needed to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, work is
underway to develop contact tracing applications that use the mobile tracking
technologies (e.g., GPS, Bluetooth) in personal devices to gather, store, and
retrieve an individualâ€™s location and contact history. This project assesses the
technological limits of mobile location tracking applications being used in
COVID1-19 for contact tracing by public health officials to mitigate COVID-19.
At the same time this research will address questions of geospatial privacy,
including 1) notice-and-consent to location data collection, and 2) risk of
personal identification. The project will provide data and results that are
needed to develop more effective contact tracing systems. The databases and
publications created by this research will contribute to an informed public
debate about the role contact tracing should play during different phases of the
pandemic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As public health officials expand contact tracing
systems in response to COVID-19, it is essential to know when and where those
systems are likely to be most accurate. To meet these needs, this project will
catalog and evaluate the contact tracking technologies as they are deployed and
developed across the United States. Comparative studies across states will
facilitate the identification of the technologies and practices that are most
effective in different regional environments. More broadly, this research will
fill the gap in geospatial privacy literature by addressing geospatial privacy
of newly evolving mobile location tracking technologies and how these
technologies can contribute to the health and welfare of
sociey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
