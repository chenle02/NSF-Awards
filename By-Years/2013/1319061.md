Blockciphers are the basic building block of shared-key cryptography. However,
for certain important cryptographic goals, like building encryption schemes, the
interface presented by blockciphers is limiting. A more modern primitive, the
tweakable blockcipher (TBC), is often a better fit. Like a blockcipher, a TBC
takes as input a secret key, a block of data and the tweak which is an
additional input which provides variability to the TBC's input-output behavior
without having to change the secret key. TBC-based cryptography has the
potential to deliver efficient constructions with better security than analogous
blockcipher-based designs, as well natural support for associated data inputs,
key reuse, and other practical considerations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite its
clear promise, TBC-based cryptography has not received a sustained and coherent
examination. This project provides such an examination, in an effort to better
understand the potential of TBCs to impact future cryptographic practice. It
explores the construction of TBCs, both from scratch and leveraging off-the-
shelf primitives. It reconsiders existing blockcipher-based constructions
starting from the question, "what happens if we replace the blockcipher with a
TBC?", and leading to new designs with increased security, and greater
resilience to certain implementation and usage mistakes. It also considers
foundational matters concerning definitions of security for TBCs, and
connections to idealized models of ciphers.
