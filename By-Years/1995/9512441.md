*** 9512441 MONTASER This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure
Program will help the Department of Chemistry at George Washington University
acquire a Phase-Doppler Particle Analyzer. The research activity to be supported
includes: (1) investigation of novel nebulization systems and high-temperature
helium plasmas in analytical spectrometry for elemental analysis, (2)
investigation of plumes generated by laser ablation from metals, insulators, and
high-transition temperature superconductors, (3) investigations of the
production and monitoring of pollutants in diffusion flames, an area of interest
for the gas industry, (4) development of efficient practical high-order
computational methods for the simulation of physical phenomena described by
unsteady nonlinear three-dimensional partial differential equations. The Phase-
Doppler Particle Analyzer (PDPA) is a key diagnostic instrument which is used
when studying nebulization systems and high temperature helium plasmas in
analytical spectrometry for elemental analysis. It gives information on
particle-size and particle-velocity distribution of sample aerosol. ***
