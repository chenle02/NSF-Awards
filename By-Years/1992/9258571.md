Research underway involves the synthesis of novel materials utilizing i) near-
and supercritical fluid pathways to polymer synthesis and ii) thiophene-based
monomers. Both of these research programs utilize new polymer synthesis
techniques to achieve precise structural manipulations to tailor performance and
processing characteristics.
