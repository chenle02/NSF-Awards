The Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) is one of the oldest and most
prestigious fellowship programs for the National Science Foundation (NSF). The
program's reputation derives from the high level of success achieved by students
receiving the fellowship as well as those receiving honorable mention. As such,
it is important to ensure that students from traditionally underrepresented
groups in engineering are aware of the value and process of applying for
graduate fellowships. Addressing access to advanced degrees is critical to the
nation's ability to recruit and retain high achieving engineers and scientists
within the U.S. STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)
workforce. Formative issues for many GRFP applicants who are underrepresented in
engineering include formal and informal training in scientific writing and
communication, professional development training, and access to mentors and role
models engaged in innovative research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop
connects engineering and science students from underrepresented populations to a
currently funded NSF Engineering Research Center. This project builds on a
working hypothesis that underrepresented and women students motivated by
researchers working on socially relevant, convergent research will build
capacity to develop competitive fellowship applications. This hypothesis is
tested through the development and delivery of a workshop that incorporates
introductions to researchers, professional development, and informal training in
scientific writing. This activity, led by a principal investigator from an HBCU,
directly supports the NSF ERC goal of developing a culture that is diverse and
inclusive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
