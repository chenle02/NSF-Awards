Future mobile computing environments will need to support communication
intensive applications such as Web browsing, multimedia conferencing, etc. This
requires providing sustained quality of service over scarce and shared wireless
links. In the wireline domain, similar resource sharing problems have led to the
development of Integrated Services Packet Networks (ISPN) that support multiple
service classes for different applications. A similar solution is appropriate in
the cellular packet network domain, particularly because application demands
will be even more varied, and system resources even more stringent. Three
concerns are critical in our environment: (a) applications should be shielded
from underlying network dynamics as much as possible, (b) user mobility between
cells should be seamless, and (c) due to scarcity of resources, network
utilization should be maximized. In this project, we propose to provide an
Integrated Services Cellular Packet Network (ISCN), which supports quality of
service in mobile computing environments. There are three key ideas in our
proposal: (a) we propose Adaptive Services, which provide QoS
guarantees/assurances within bounds and support an enhanced set of QoS
parameters for wireless channel error and mobility; (b) we propose new
algorithms for resource adaptation in order in increase the network utilization
in the presence of mobility; and (c) we propose new algorithms for predictive
advance reservation in order to provide seamless mobility for users across
multiple cells in the ISCN. For more project details and publications, please
