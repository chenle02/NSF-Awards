This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project explores a novel
detection system for DNA microarrays, which are coin-size glass chips containing
diverse molecules of genetic material. DNA microarrays have revolutionized basic
research and industrial drug discovery, but have traditionally been difficult to
use in clinical diagnostics. DNA microarrays are typically expensive and require
long wait-times for data, in part because of the need to chemically label the
sample material. In contrast, Synamem Corporation (a Synergenics, LLC business)
is developing a novel readout for DNA microarrays using micron-size bead
particles which completely eliminates the need to label the sample material,
making the process considerably lower-cost and more rapid. This SBIR project
will address the following: 1) The DNA microarray label-free readout will be
optimized; 2) This readout will be tested in various potential diagnostic
applications of DNA microarrays in the field of cancer; and 3) The compatibility
of this label-free readout with commercially-available microarrays will be
assessed.

The broader impacts of this research are the development of DNA microarrays
which could potentially be used in diagnostics on a more cost-effective and
time-efficient basis. Successful commercialization and adoption of Synamem's
label-free microarray system will greatly simplify the process of measuring gene
expression, detecting gene single nucleotide polymorphisms and mutations, and
numerous other potential diagnostic applications of DNA microarrays. Indeed, it
will enable faster diagnostic results in the clinic, closer to the patient, as
it may eliminate the need for sending out samples for lengthy processing in
centralized hospital laboratories.
