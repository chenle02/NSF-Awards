The activity of genes (gene expression) is precisely regulated in all living
organisms, with genes varying in the timing, spatial distribution, and extent of
activity. This research aims to investigate evolutionary divergence in gene
expression between species. This will be accomplished using strains of the fruit
fly, Drosophila, that are hybrids between two closely related species. These
strains have been tested to identify genes with expression patterns that result
from interactions between the portions of their genomes that come from the two
parent species. This project will locate the precise genetic differences between
these species that are involved in these interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gene
expression results from complex interactions between genes, and between genes
and environmental influences. Understanding how interactions within genomes
contribute to physical characteristics of organisms, and how they change through
evolution, is a critical step towards elucidating how biological systems are
constructed and how they function. This research will generate opportunities for
college students to experience and participate in original scientific research
that lies at the interface of computational biology and genomics.&lt;br/&gt;
