This program examines solute atom segregation and phase transitions at internal
interfaces (grain boundaries and stacking faults) in body-centered cubic and
face-centered cubic metal alloys. A goal is to understand phase equilibria at
internal interfaces. Interface chemical composition, geometry, and structure are
analyzed by atom probe field ion microscopy, high resolution analytical
microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Computer simulation is
performed by Monte Carlo calculations using the embedded atom method to
correlate experimental results with theory.
