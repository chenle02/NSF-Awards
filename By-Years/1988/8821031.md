The nature of the interface between the fiber and matrix in fiber- reinforced
polymers greatly influences overall performance of the composite material. The
details of the interactions at this interface are not well understood, however.
It is firmly established that modifying the interface can greatly improve
performance, the underlying physicochemical mechanisms of adhesion and their
relationship to performance have not been established. The three main mechanisms
believed to underly the adhesive interaction are mechanical interactions,
intermolecular interactions, and chemical binding. Preliminary work by the
investigator has shown that a small number of pendant chains covalently attached
to a fiber surface significantly increases adhesion between fiber and matrix. An
experimental program has been designed to examine the exact cause of the
increased adhesion by systematically modifying the surface of Aramid Fibers with
pendant groups whose chemical structure provides varying potential for
physicochemical interaction with the matrix. A key phase of the research is
experimental determination of the exact state of the surface and the pendant
groups by means of quantitative dye analysis, nonradiative fluorescence energy
transfer, and continuous wetting force measurements. Results will be correlated
with adhesion data to delineate the relation between molecular level interfacial
details and interfacial adhesive bonding. There is no more important area of
research, relative to the future international competitiveness of American
industry, than the area of advanced composite materials. The properties of a
fiber composite are determined by the matrix, the fiber, and the interface at
which they interact. Obtaining understanding and control of this interface is
crucial to our ability to engineer composite materials so as to realize their
full potential.
