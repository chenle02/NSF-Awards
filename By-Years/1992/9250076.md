The California Advocacy for Mathematics and Science (CAMS) initiative will
bring together top-level leadership from the State Superintendent of Public
Instruction and the Governor's Office of Child Development and Education in
support of improving mathematics and science education with an emphasis on full
participation for underrepresented groups. The CAMS initiative addresses several
barriers to improvement of K-6 science and middle grades mathematics programs in
the state. The program has three objectives: 1. Galvanizing public support for
improving mathematics and science education. 2. Developing and promoting
elementary science instruction. 3. Replacing the usual curriculum and
instructional features of middle grades mathematics instruction with materials
and activities consistent with NCTM Standards. The CAMS initiative will make use
of special meetings with policymakers, business and community leaders, and
educators to heighten public awareness of the importance of science and
mathematics education. Professional development and support will provide the
basis for improved science instruction in the elementary grades and mathematics
instruction in the middle grades.
