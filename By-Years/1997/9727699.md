Computers have become indispensable in much of current biology, in their roles
of acquiring, processing, visualizing, and storing complex four- dimensional
(space &amp; time) data. However, the final stage in biological research is
going from acquired, processed, and stored data to new biological knowledge.
Computerized visualization is used in this stage, but there has been less
development of computerized reasoning tools that can complement the biologist's
toolkit. This project is developing discovery tools - in the form of novel
algorithms and software - to deal with the complex 4D data of biological
imaging. These tools will help detect subtle spatio-temporal patterns (i.e.,
non-randomness) that would be difficult to notice with standard means of
analysis. The main technique is based on permutation tests, which have been
applied widely in other sciences but not in biological imaging. The challenge is
to design algorithms to handle the specific problems posed by typical imaging
data.
