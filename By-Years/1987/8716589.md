A time-series sediment trapping program in the Sargasso Sea southeast of
Bermuda will be continued for three years. The existing series extends over nine
years. It is by far the longest such series and has attracted a number of other
projects to the site. Together with the hydrographic time series at nearby
Station "S", it provides a background of temporal variability which is likely to
be utilized and extended by the Global Ocean Flux Study (GOFS). The value of
time-series measurements is now widely appreciated. The series have demonstrated
the transfer of temporal variability from the surface to the deep ocean and its
effects on deep-sea chemistry and biology. Continuation of the Bermuda series
will be an efficient route towards assessing decade-scale trends in the
transport of anthropogenic components to the deep ocean. It is anticipated that
the transition from the present bimonthly sampling mode to the expected GOFS
sampling mode be facilitated by changing to a higher-frequency (weekly or
biweekly) sampling schedule using sequential-collector traps. Besides continuing
present studies on the samples, proposed studies include examination of
simultaneous time-depth changes in constituent ratios and in ontogenetic stages
of planktonic foraminifera; trends in the deep fluxes of lead and PCB's since
1978; the role of pteropods in calcium carbonate cycling in the water column;
and testing for relationships among hydrography, particle fluxes and CZCS color
data.//
