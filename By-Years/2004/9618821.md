9618821 Marin This project, sponsored by City College of New York in partnership
with New York City School District #2 is a three year project which will enhance
Middle School teachers in science content based upon nationally validated
science curriculum materials. Each year 60 teachers from grades 5-9 will be
provided an equivalent of seven weeks of in-service activities which will
strengthen the teachers' content knowledge, allow them to carry out inquiry
strategies in the classroom and develop leadership capabilities so that they
will be able to do in-service activities with peer teachers. A group of these
teachers will continue to participate in the program in ensuing years. As a
result of the project it is expected that the district will develop a
comprehensive Middle School science curriculum framework, provide the school
with exemplary science materials, provide in-service opportunities to all
teachers and set up two permanent Science & Technology Instructional Centers for
the teachers in the District to use as a resource. Matching funds constitute 33%
of the NSF award.
