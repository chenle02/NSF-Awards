This SGER addresses the problem of metaphoric inference in Natural Language
Understanding (NLU). Language is fundamentally a creative act and NLU systems
require extensive semantic knowledge and sophisticated inference methods that
are capable of dealing with figurative language. A prototypical example of the
power of figurative language in everyday discourse is the ubiquitous use of
metaphor to perform most linguistic functions including predication,
modification, and reference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To date, no comprehensive
computational system addressing all the aspects of metaphor has been implemented
or even designed. Our project seeks to remedy this situation by addressing key
challenges in building a scalable, open source, model of metaphor. Building on
previous modeling work and leveraging results from Cognitive Linguistics, we are
exploring techniques to a) design and populate a machine readable metaphor
ontology, b) analyze the metaphoric encoding of crucial discourse information,
including event structure and communicative intent, and c) use machine learning
algorithms for metaphor recognition from textual
sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a practical scale, this project provides a
machine readable ontology of metaphors, allowing programmatic access to the
relational structure of the data, enhancing reuse, and fostering incremental
development. Coupled with the metaphor recognition tools, this takes us part way
(a companion requirement is a corpus annotation effort) toward creating an open
and scalable metaphor resource. From the scientific side, this project creates a
better understanding of the form and content of metaphoric inference and the
first computational framework to explore the automatic processing of this
information from text languages and media.&lt;br/&gt;
