This is a project to continue the ongoing study of the Galapagos by looking at
its long term evolution. Previously analyzed dense magnetics data and SeaMARC II
sidescan and bathymetry data collected from 94 W to 96 W, well beyond the
boundaries of previous detailed studies, will be used to determine the shape,
position and character of tectonic elements. Propagation and spreading rates,
transform length, and deformational style will be constrained as a function of
time over a much larger area than previously. %%% The discovery of propagating
rifts in the sea floor less than a decade ago opened up a new way of looking at
sea floor tectonics and evolution. In recent years, a variety of other related
tectonic structures has been discovered, and these are just beginning to be
examined in detail. This project fits well into the current studies of seafloor
tectonics.
