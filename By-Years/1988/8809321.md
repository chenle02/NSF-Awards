This is an experimental study of the nucleation and growth of nanometer sized
metal oxide particles from the rapid expansion of supercritical aqueous
solutions through a nozzle. Initially silicon dioxide solutions will be studied
followed by zirconium and yttrium oxide solutions. Transmission Fourier
Transform spectroscopy will be used to characterized the molecular precursors to
the particles and particle size will be determined by Rayleigh scattering along
the beam axis. The research should yield important scientific information on
nucleation and particle growth under markedly different conditions than studied
heretofore. It offers a novel process for producing fine particles of controlled
size and composition for possible synthesis of ceramics, superconductors, or
catalysts.
