9503877 Browning The aim of this project is to link the macroscopic
electromagnetic performance of Ag sheathed Bi(Pb)SrCaCuO (2223) tapes to the
atomic and electronic structure of their defects. Low-temperature scanning
electron microscopy (LTSEM) will be used to locate the presence of weak-link
behavior. Using STEM &amp; EELS techniques correlation of the local hole
concentration with the atomic structure on a scale below the superconducting
coherence length will be made. The wealth of spectroscopic data on carrier
concentrations and doping effects in this material will be applied on a local
scale to determine the actual microscopic origins of tape performance. In turn,
the substantial technical expertise of the industrial tape supplier will enable
the defect content to be tailored for enhanced tape performance. %%% The
proposed studies will aim to link the macroscopic electromagnetic performance of
silver sheathed bismuth superconductor tapes to the atomic and electronic
structure of their defects.
