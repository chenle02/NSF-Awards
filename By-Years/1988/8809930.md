Dr. Ahearn plans to continue studies on the mechanisms of solute transport by
crustacean gastrointestinal and renal epithelial cells. The two major goals are:
1) Continue state-of-the-art membrane vesicle studies designed to elucidate the
mechanisms of ion, amino acid, sugar, lipid, peptide, vitamin, and organic acid
transport across isolated and purified brush border and basolateral membranes of
crustacean hepatopancreatic and antennal gland epithelia; and 2) Establish
preliminary data showing the feasibility of growing functional epithelial cell
monolayers from crustacean hepatopancreas and/or antennal gland that can be used
in transepithelial transport studies of inorganic and organic solutes. The
combination of these two approaches to epithelial biology should lead to
significant information about the mechanisms of nutrient and ion absorption and
organic acid secretion in two major organ systems of this economically-
important group of invertebrates.
