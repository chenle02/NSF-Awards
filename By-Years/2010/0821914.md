For many vertebrate animals, the capacity to learn certain skills is greatly
enhanced during a time in juvenile life referred to as a sensitive period. What
happens to the juvenile brain as the young animal learns a new skill?
Conversely, what properties of the juvenile's brain favor learning? This project
seeks answers to these questions. The goal of this project is to use a high
resolution, laser-powered microscope to visualize individual nerve cells in the
brain of a living songbird. The nerve cells to be imaged play an important role
in singing, a vocal behavior that resembles human speech in that both are
products of imitative learning. By re-imaging the same nerve cell over hours,
days and even weeks, and precisely monitoring the vocal learning process, the
investigator will examine whether vocal learning involves structural changes at
the connections, or synapses, linking together these nerve cells. The
investigator predicts that synapses will be less stable at the onset of the
sensitive period but that they will rapidly stabilize as the bird begins to
imitate the song of another bird. The significance of this project is three-
fold. First, it can assess whether enhanced structural plasticity characterizes
sensitive periods for learning. Second, it can identify the structural changes
that occur during the learning of a complex vocal behavior. Third, it will train
young scientists in cutting edge experimental methods at the high school,
doctoral and postdoctoral level.
