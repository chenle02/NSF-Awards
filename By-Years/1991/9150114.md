The Six Through Eight Mathematics (STEM) Project is designed to develop a new
curriculum for mathematics for grades 6-8, including a complete set of student
materials, teachers support materials, and evaluation materials, STEM is
designed to provide teachers with curricular materials which are mathematically
accurate, utilize technology, and provide students with bridges to the sciences
and other mathematical fields. These materials will be designed to integrate
communication into mathematics by providing opportunities for students to use
reading, writing, and speaking as tools for learning mathematics. STEM materials
will be problem-centered, application based, and will use technology where
appropriate. Many lessons will be designed to be project oriented so that
students work cooperatively. In addition, new evaluation techniques will be
developed for use with the materials. In designing the curriculum, staff will
work cooperatively with IBM, McDougal, Littell and Company, and Texas
Instruments. After the materials have been pilot tested throughout the nation,
they will be published nationally for dissemination.
