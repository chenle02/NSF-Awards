Advances in the effective integration of networked information systems, sensing
and communication devices, data sources, decision making, and physical
infrastructure are transforming society, allowing cities and communities to
surmount deeply interlocking physical, social, behavioral, economic, and
infrastructural challenges. These novel socio-technical approaches enable
increased understanding of how to intelligently and effectively design, adapt,
and manage Smart and Connected Communities (S&amp;CC). Successful S&amp;CC
solutions demand demonstration of marked improvement (quantifiable evidence) of
the stakeholder experience - whether in personal quality of life, community and
environmental health, social well-being, educational achievement, or overall
economic growth and stability. Research in S&amp;CC must pursue transformative
discoveries through a long-term research agenda that also includes innovation
off-ramps along the way. In order to advance research in this area, we are
convening a community visioning workshop focused on Smart and Connected
Communities. The purpose of the workshop is to engage academic researchers,
industry partners, and municipal leaders in detailed discussions on research
gaps, practical needs, and priorities for enabling the smart and connected
communities of the future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goal is to create
a research agenda to achieve the S&amp;CC vision. A workshop report will capture
major research and implementation challenges, promising approaches, and
potential pilot solutions. The report will be made available to all interested
parties regardless of their participation. Workshop topics cover a broad
waterfront of challenges faced by communities today spanning large and small
cities, metropolitan areas, and rural regions. A key emphasis is the integration
of social and technical perspectives to develop long term research agenda that
can address the needs of communities that are socially and economically
heterogeneous.
