Thin films of vanadia or molybdena on single crystals of titania or alumina are
investigated using electron spectroscopies including low-energy electron
diffraction (LEED), Auger spectroscopy, and high-resolution electron energy-loss
spectroscopy (HREELS), as well as chemisorption and measurement of catalytic
activity. Ordered monolayer structures may form on the single crystal
substrates, and, if so, the influence of these structures on catalytic activity
will be observed. Results will be compared with and related to data on high-
surface catalysts of the same composition. Oxides supported on oxides comprise a
significant fraction of industrial catalysts; they are widely used for the
selective oxidation of hydrocarbons. Real catalysts have been studied, but this
is a proposal to study "model" catalysts - near planar structures similar in
chemical composition to the very porous real catalysts. For many techniques,
model systems are much easier to study and give more detailed information.
