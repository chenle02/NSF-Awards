Parallel Methods for Large, Atomic-scale Quantitative Analysis of Materials
Project Summary

Experimental advances in materials science have enabled near atomic scale
imaging of materials, making it possible to relate atomic arrangements to
macroscopic material properties and enabling smart materials design. Driven by
the needs of the materials science community facing a rapid adoption of this new
technology, the goal of the proposed research is to develop comprehensive
algorithmic foundations for quantitative analysis of atomic-scale data from
interpreting atom probe tomography images to their analysis and feature
extraction. Parallel algorithms and high performance implementations will be
emphasized due to the large data set sizes which can reach several hundred
million to a billion atoms and beyond. The investigators will develop parallel
algorithms to 1) deal with inherent limitations and errors in atomic sampling,
2) determine crystallographic orientation, 3) perform autocorrelation based
clustering analysis, and 4) extract coherent structures and intrinsic geometric
features through linear and non-linear manifold learning. The research will be
carried out by an interdisciplinary team of PIs with expertise in parallel
algorithms, high performance computing, computational and differential geometry,
and materials science. The research is intended to advance materials science
from visualization and simulation of atomistic scale solid state phenomena to
its direct observation, quantitative analysis and interpretation.
