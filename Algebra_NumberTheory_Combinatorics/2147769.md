Invariant theory studies quantities that remain unchanged under symmetries in
high dimensional spaces. For example, the distance of a point to the rotation
axis is an invariant for the rotation symmetry. Invariant theory has many useful
applications in physics, chemistry, and other areas of mathematics. A classical
task in invariant theory is to find a finite list of fundamental invariants for
a given group of symmetries, such that all invariants can be expressed in terms
of the fundamental invariants. In this project, the principal investigator and
his collaborators plan to find bounds for the size of fundamental invariants and
apply these results to symmetries of high-dimensional arrays (also called
tensors), graphs, and questions in theoretical computer science. The principal
investigator is actively involved in the training of graduate students in fields
close to this research.

An example of particular interest is the action of simultaneous left and right
multiplication of the special linear group on m-tuples of n by n matrices. The
principal investigator and his collaborators obtained polynomial degree bounds
for the degrees of fundamental polynomial invariants, and this result has been
applied to get deterministic polynomial time algorithms for the noncommutative
Edmond's problem and for noncommutative rational identity testing. This project
focuses on invariant theory for tensors and new applications of constructive
invariant theory, such as the graph isomorphism problem and Brascamp-Lieb
inequalities.
