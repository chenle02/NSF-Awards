This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
is concerned with cluster compounds containing both transition metals and main
group atoms, particularly the so-called Zintl compounds. The synthesis and
chemistry of such cluster complexes will be developed to understand the
fundamental bonding patterns in these compounds. Of particular interest is the
creation of discrete complexes which have similarities to the Zintl cluster
anions and related Zintl phases. Classical main group atom-containing transition
metal carbonyls will be treated with ligands such as CO, and their reduction
chemistry will be explored following routes which have been successful for some
known clusters of this type. Efforts will center around the heavy elements,
namely Tl, Pb and Bi. Plans include exploration of the direct use of various
types of alloys for discrete cluster synthesis, including some of the Zintl
phases and main group/transition metal alloys. Reactions of bismuth-iron
carbonyl and of thallium-iron carbonyl cluster anions will be examined as
sources of high nuclearity substances. Compounds will be characterized by
single-crystal X-ray diffraction, magnetic measurements, electron microscopy and
NMR, Moessbauer and IR spectroscopies as appropriate. The reactions under
investigation in this project have strong implications for solid state chemistry
and materials science as well as catalysis.
