This project studies how to best allocate resources over time when money isn't
available as a means of eliciting the agents' private information - an essential
ingredient in the determination of the efficient allocation. Property rights to
the allocation must dynamically respond to claims by the agents regarding their
needs, punishing greedy agents and rewarding frugal ones, while attempting to
preserve efficiency. Potential applications range from how to allocate hospital
beds; how a nurse should divide up her time; how an agency should pick among
competing projects, etc. The goal is to derive transparent and robust yet
effective decision rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We allow the agent's private
information to be serially correlated over time (but independent across agents),
and consider both the cases in which agents desire only one unit (e.g., a
medical procedure), and in which their payoff is additive in the number of units
they get. Values are private. The principal is committed to the mechanism, and
the resource supply is exogenous. In some simple settings, a two-part tariff
using a virtual budget implements the optimum. For more complicated settings,
the project will rank standard procedures (e.g., auctions with virtual budgets)
and compare their performance to the best mechanism.
