This U.S.-Mexico award will support U.S. and Latin American participation in the
Fourth Latin American Congress of Probability and Mathematical Statistics to be
held in Mexico City, Mexico from September 24 to 29, 1990. The U.S. organizer
for this meeting is Professor Richard Griego of the University of New Mexico;
the Mexican organizer is Professor Luis Gorostiza of the Centro de Investigacion
del Instituto Politecnico Nacional (CINVESTAV) in Mexico City. The Congress will
bring together about 170 participants from Latin America and will feature
invited addresses, short courses, special workshops, and participant lectures.
Topics to be presented at the Congress include the theory and applications of
large deviations, convergence of stochastic processes, stochastic integration
and control theory, infinite particle systems, measure-valued stochastic
processes, random evolutions, and mathematical statistics. The meeting should
provide an opportunity for initiating and continuing joint collaborations
between U.S. and Latin American researchers. The Science in Developing Country
Program is also providing support to promote the participation of a greater
number of Latin American researchers.
