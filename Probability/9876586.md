There are three main areas of proposed activity. The first one is developing the
technique based on quasiderivatives of solutions of Ito's equations and applying
it for processes considered up to the first exit time from domains. The second
area is investigating smoothness of solutions of SPDEs arising in filtering
problems and the theory of measure--valued processes in order to be able to
guarantee certain rates of convergence of approximations to their solutions. The
third area is estimating the rate of convergence of numerical approximations for
degenerate controlled diffusion processes.

The project relates to investigations of probabilistic behavior of certain
objects. Part 1 is aimed at a better understanding of averaged quantities
related to optimal control of random processes. Part 2 aims at problems directly
related to many practical issues such as image reconstruction or high-
performance computing in eliminating "friendly fire." It is also vital in
dealing with problems like evolution of bacteria population which may be
important in biotechnology. Part 3 deals with practical ways of solving problems
of optimal control of random processes which arise for instance in finance.
