This project is being supported under a special funding focus for STEP,
"Graduate 10K+," an activity of the National Science Foundation, supported in
part by donations from the Intel Foundation and the GE Foundation, to stimulate
comprehensive action at universities and colleges to help increase the annual
number of new B.S. graduates in engineering and computer science by 10,000 over
the next decade. In particular, this project team is focusing on improving
retention and graduation of students in its School of Engineering, with a
particular emphasis on providing peer-led enrichment sessions and tutoring
support for three mathematics courses (Pre-Calculus and Calculus I and II)
identified as attrition points. Additional initiatives include enhanced
mentoring by peers, faculty and practicing engineers, implementation of a
student tracking program to allow early intervention for struggling students,
and involving first-year students in design-team and professional activities to
strengthen their connections to the engineering program. The intellectual merit
of the project lies in its multi-pronged approach that leverages best practices
from the STEM educational literature, as well as successful pilot studies of the
mathematics interventions. The broader impacts comprise enhanced achievement,
retention, and graduation of engineering students to enter the local and
regional workforce, as well as assessment and dissemination of the approaches to
serve as a model for other institutions of similar size and circumstances to
adopt.
