Measurement of rare kaon decay modes will be carried out at Brookhaven National
Lab to look for new physics beyond the standard model. The group will develop
the needed data acquisition system and Cherenkov detector. In addition at
Brookhaven, an experiment to search for the H-dibaryon, a six quark object
predicted by theory, will be conducted. Other kaon and hyperon studies are being
planned for CEBAF, and instrumentation required for this latter work is under
development by the group. The overall activities of the group relate to searches
for physics beyond the standard model, and tests of the quark sub-structure of
nucleons and hyperons. //
