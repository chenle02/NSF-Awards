An important question in molecular biology is how intricate biological processes
such as embryonic development are achieved through the actions of regulatory
molecules. In the fruit fly Drosophila, the early embryonic patterning along the
anterior-posterior axis is instructed by the homeodomain-containing
transcriptional activator Bicoid (Bcd), which initiates the cascade of the
patterning programs by turning on specific target genes required for anterior
development. Despite extensive studies of Bcd as an activator and molecular
morphogen, it remains unclear how Bcd activates transcription of its target
genes and what proteins participate in the activation process in embryos. This
project is designed to test the hypothesis that Bcd activates transcription by
facilitating the formation of the transcription machinery at target gene
promoters during development. There are three specific aims in this project. Aim
1 will directly analyze, using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, the
occupancy of general transcription factors at target gene promoters in wild type
and bcd-deficient embryos. Aim 2 will further dissect the interaction between
Bcd and TFIIB and determine the biological importance of this interaction during
development. Aim 3 will study the role of histone acetylation and, in
particular, the co-activator CBP in facilitating the action of Bcd in embryos.
This project takes advantage of both biochemical and genetic techniques,
focusing on the objective of revealing mechanistic insights relevant to early
embryonic patterning in Drosophila.
