The principal objective of this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research
project in solid state chemistry between Bostjan Zeks, Josef Stefan Institute,
and Cheng-cher Huang, University of Minnesota, is to study the properties and
effects of ferroelectric liquid crystals (FLC) in electric fields. The
investigators will measure dielectric (nonconductive) properties, and the
critical electrical field for unwinding the crystal structure will be
determined. This work will lead to a better understanding of the unwinding amd
switching properties of FLC structures. FLCs are applied in digital instruments.
This project combines the theoretical and experimental expertise of the Yugoslav
and U.S. scientist respectively. It extends their previous collaboration on the
thermodyanmic properties of FLCs. This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav
Joint Board on Cooperation in Science and Technology and is funded through a
joint fund of matching contributions from the U.S. and Yugoslav governments. The
U.S. contribution is provided annually by the Department of State. No NSF funds
are involved. Grants are made to the principal Yugoslav institution. Dollar
funds are included for U.S. scientist travel to Yugoslavia and for Yugoslav
scientists' living expenses in the U.S.
