This research is to analyze and interpret the high-quality, multicomponent,
normal-incidence to wide-angle data that were collected by the University of
Arizona PACE Piggyback Lithospheric Experiment. Focus of the work will be: 1) to
place constraints on Poisson's ratio and lower crustal composition; 2) analyze
upper crustal P-wave and S-wave anisotropy; 3) model normal-incidence to wide-
angle reflections to determine P-wave and S-wave velocity structure; 4)
reconcile refraction and COCORP reflection results that offer widely differing
interpretations of crustal thickness and reflectivity; 5) place quantitative
constraints on the dip of the Moho beneath the transition zone and constrain the
nature of this fundamental boundary; and 6) to interpret upper crustal
structures that control Colorado Plateau monoclines.
