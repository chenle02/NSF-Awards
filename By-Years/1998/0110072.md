Floras are the mechanisms for synthesizing and disseminating knowledge about
plant biodiversity. The Northwest Alliance for Computational Science and
Engineering and the Oregon Flora Project will collaborate to develop a software
architecture and tools for creating comprehensive electronic floras that cover a
broad spectrum of data about plants. The resulting personal digital field guide
(PDFG) will be comprehensive and extensible. Data will be available on the web.
The architecture and toolkits will be generalizable to other domains in the
natural sciences. The data set for the project represents the largest and most
comprehensive resource on regional flora to date. The project will integrate the
diverse sources, enabling new ways of exploring the relationships of plants to
their environments. A broad range of users, including nature lovers, scientists,
students, and decision makers, will be able to personalize the way they navigate
through the flora, selecting the amount and type of information presented as
well as how and when it will be accessed.
