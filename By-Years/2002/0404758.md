This project is providing opportunities for recipients of NSF DUE CCLI grants to
present their funded projects at the 2004 and 2005 SIGCSE Conferences. These
conferences are the annual Technical Symposia on Computer Science Education
sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education
(SIGCSE) and are international events held annually in the United States. They
are among the few events in the world dedicated solely to issues of
undergraduate computing education and attract over 1000 educators from primarily
the United States and Canada with a growing worldwide participation. The
Showcase is an opportunity for attendees to see the work done by CCLI-funded
projects and learn about new curriculum and materials they can use in their home
institutions.&lt;br/&gt;
