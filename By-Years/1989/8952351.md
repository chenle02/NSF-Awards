Physiological recording equipment interfaced with IBM-compatible computers will
support the development of a separate Physiology course from the prior combined
"Anatomy and Physiology" course. The equipment includes four new learning
stations for laboratories in the new course as well as for use in General
Biology. Included are digital storage units to freeze rapid transient data for
analysis by students and faculty. In addition to educating students (many of
whom are minorities) in basic physiological processes, the equipment will also
be used to train students in methods of interfacing instrumentation with
computers for data acquisition, storage, retrieval, and interpretation. The
University will provide 50% matching funds.
