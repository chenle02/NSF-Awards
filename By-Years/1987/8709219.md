By 1990, the City of Los Angeles plans to have caused the abatement of seismic
hazards in almost 8,000 unreinforced masonry buildings. No other U.S. city has
undertaken such an extensive program or has actually enforced the abatement of
so many structures. Recently, the Los Angeles City Council passed a six-month
moratorium on evictions for the purpose of seismic upgrading. This is the first
official indication of serious impacts arising from implementation of the
ordinance. The objective of the research is to identify the impacts stemming
from enforcement of the Los Angeles hazardous building ordinance and their
possible implications for other U.S. cities. The focus will be on changes in
building and land uses in neighborhoods with significant concentrations of
unreinforced masonry buildings. Information from the Los Angeles experience will
be made available to other researchers and summarized for use by public
officials in other cities planning and implementing similar programs.
