This project will provide undergraduate students with an opportunity to work
with advanced robotic systems. The College will acquire five additional HERO Jr.
robots, ten digital cameras and ten host computers. The robots will be used to
test interface software written to control locomotion, steering, speech
synthesis, ultrasonic transducers, and communication protocols between the robot
and a host computer. The digital cameras will be used to demonstrate topics in
computer vision such as gray level imaging, image reconstruction, boundary and
edge detection, and motion detection. The host computer will be used to write,
assemble, and save programs written for the robot. It will also be used to
display the reconstructed images coming from the camera via the robot. This
robotic-computer vision lab will prepare the students for an actual industrial
environment and will encourage them to pursue graduate work.
