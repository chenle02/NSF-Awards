The University of Minnesota will conduct "Research Explorations for Teachers,"
a program for 50 secondary teachers from Minnesota to join University faculty
research teams. Research projects are in areas such as: ecology and behavioral
biology, microbiology, geology, neurology, human genetics, soil science,
archaeology, anthropology, etc. Most projects will take place in Minnesota;
some, abroad. In addition to participating in the research projects of their
choice, teachers will attend three seminars conducted by University faculty that
will focus on the use of research in classrooms, recent trends in scientific
research, active learning styles, and curriculum development. Teachers will
receive both financial support and instructional assistance for developing
curricular materials related to the content and inquiry-based approach of their
research experiences. Curricular material resulting from these projects will be
distributed in at least three ways: (l) at meetings of the Minnesota Science
Teachers and the Minnesota Council of Social Studies Teachers; (2) through the
publication and distribution to district curriculum specialists of the best
materials created by teachers in this program; and (3) at in-service days of
participating school districts. An amount equivalent to 18.7% of the NSF award
is being contributed as cost-sharing.
