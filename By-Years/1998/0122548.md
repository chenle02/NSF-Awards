This program provides scholarships for academically talented but needy computer
science and mathematics majors who are entering their junior year. Particular
attention is given to recruiting women and minority students. Each CSMES scholar
is assigned at least one faculty mentor and all scholarship recipients will
participate in an undergraduate research experience. CSEMS scholars have access
to the Advanced Computational Laboratory and the Visualization
Laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;
