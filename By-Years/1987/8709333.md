The Klamath Mountains are an arcuate structural province of Ordovician to Late
Jurassic oceanic - and island arc - affinity rocks that were accreted to the
western margin of North America during Mesozoic plate convergence. However, the
actual tectonic processes during accretion are not well established. Recent work
has suggested that parts of the Condrey Mountain Schist exposed in the north-
central Klamath Mountains may be an eastward continuation of the Franciscan
Complex. If confirmed, this would indicate that the Klamath rocks have been
thrust about 100 km over the Franciscan Complex along shallow faults. This
project will provide geochronologic, petrologic and isotopic data to more firmly
establish the Condrey Mountain - Franciscan correlation and to allow a more
detailed account of the accretion processes involved.
