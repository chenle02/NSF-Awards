The ongoing Workshop in Analysis and Probability at Texas A&M University brings
together senior and junior researchers and graduate students in several areas of
analysis and probability as well as researchers in other fields (such as
geometry and theoretical computer science) in order to broaden the education of
the younger participants and to promote interaction among researchers in various
fields. The Workshop also sponsors three day conferences (SUMIRFAS: Informal
Regional Functional Analysis Seminar), Concentration Weeks, and mini-
conferences. These conferences include introductory lectures designed to
acquaint junior researchers and non experts with the basics of an area as well
as advanced lectures for experts.

The Workshop activities have a broad impact by providing intellectual
stimulation for all participants as well as giving an opportunity to a diverse
group of junior participants to broaden their knowledge and to interact with
senior researchers in several areas of mathematics. There is also significant
outreach to applied mathematics and computer science. Indeed, a very important
aspect of the Workshop is to promote cooperation among researchers in different
fields, and every Concentration Week involves participants from experts in two
or more research areas.
