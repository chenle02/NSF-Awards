9600236 Roberts The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
scientists and engineers to conduct three to twentyfour months of research
abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions
abroad. This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit which
will support Dr. Matthew A. Roberts to work with Dr. Hubert Girault at the Ecole
Polytechnique Federal de Lausanne in Switzerland. The objective of this project
is to 1) produce a microfabricated liquid handling device with an interdigitated
array (IDA) electrochemical (EC) detection cell and 2) to utilize IDAs for EC
detection of immunoassays within the proposed microfabricated liquid handling
device. The production of this miniaturized chemical analysis system device will
be able to monitor environmental pollutants in a truly field-portable fashion.
Analysis times of less than five minutes are expected which could be used for
the rapid analysis of priority pollutants and quick mapping of contaminant
mobility at remediation sites. This technology will help reduce characterization
and overall remediation costs at sites associated with national Superfund
programs due to these advantages. ***
