This four year study is designed to accumulate and examine external
morphological, cytological, and developmental data from representatives of
different dinoflagellate groups. The dinoflagellate algae are very peculiar
organisms that possess several more variations in their cells than do the
majority of eukaryotic algae and protozoa. Specifically, we propose to test
traditional systematic concepts of the dinoflagellates with these data via
cladistic analyses of the data we have at hand, those from collaborative
laboratories, and those we propose to obtain. These data will also allow us to
test current and previous opinion concerning the natural relationships of the
dinoflagellates and the other protistan groups. This proposal represents one of
the first integrative approaches toward deciphering the affinities of the
dinoflagellates. Another important aspect of the proposed studies is to
investigate the nature of peculiar dinoflagellates found only from remote marine
and freshwater locations in North America and to compare these taxa with those
from culture collections.
