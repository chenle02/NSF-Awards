This project continues the development of reliability-based concepts and
methods for assessing the seismic safety of structures. Structural damage models
are developed in terms of damage tolerance and reliability against collapse.
Damage data obtained from recent earthquakes will be used to calibrate these
models. Damage analysis of new and existing systems will be conducted. The
results will be incorporated into the criteria or guidelines for the
rehabilitation of existing structures. The damage models will be extended from
reinforced concrete buildings to include damage of flat slab buildings and steel
structures, incorporating field and experimental data existing worldwide. In
addition, a damage-related ground motion intensity measure will be defined to
reflect the real damage potential of an earthquake. The stucy will continue to
develop the fundamental basis of damage limiting design concept and methodolgy.
