This research project is focused on establishing properties of L-functions,
which are functions on the complex plane that encode information about various
mathematical structures. An example of an L-function is the Riemann zeta
function that encodes information about the prime numbers, which today are
essential to the way computer data is securely transferred. Other types of
L-functions can, for example, help explain the way waves propagate on certain
surfaces, a topic of interest in physics. The educational activities of the
project include mentoring a postdoctoral researcher, training graduate students
in research, introducing undergraduates to research, and immersing high school
students in a summer mathematics program that emphasizes the type of thinking
used in research.

This project will focus on investigating the subconvexity problem, an important
and deep question in the theory of L-functions. The subconvexity problem is
connected to equidistribution questions and involves obtaining non-trivial upper
bounds for an L-function on its critical line. Such bounds are particularly
difficult in “conductor-dropping’’ scenarios. The main goal of this project is
to establish new subconvexity bounds for L-functions and push existing bounds
towards the gold standard (the so-called Weyl bound). The project will consider
the symmetric-square L-functions (or close approximations of these), L-functions
at “special points” exhibiting conductor dropping, and strong hybrid bounds for
L-functions, such as those of Hecke eigenforms twisted by Dirichlet characters.
The methodology will include moments of L-functions in families, reciprocity
formulae, and automorphic spectral analysis.
