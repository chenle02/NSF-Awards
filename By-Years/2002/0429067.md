This project supports the development of a four-day workshop for twenty faculty
that will give the participants the background to design and deliver a software
engineering curriculum. This curriculum may be the basis of a B.S. degree in
software engineering or of a software engineering concentration in a computing
degree. The workshop helps faculty develop a support infrastructure for the
curriculum, set up an evaluation and assessment model for the curriculum, and
provides instructional resources for developing and teaching the modules of the
curriculum.
