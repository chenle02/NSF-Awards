Classical image processing has mostly disregarded semantic image
representations, in favor of more mathematically tractable representations based
on low?]level signal properties (frequency decompositions, mean squared error,
etc.). This is unlike biological solutions to image
processing&lt;br/&gt;problems, which rely extensively on understanding of scene
content. For example, regions of faces are usually processed more carefully than
the bushes in the background. The inability to tune image processing to the
semantic relevance of image content frequently leads to the sub?]optimal
allocation of&lt;br/&gt;resources, such as bandwidth, error protection, or
viewing time, to image areas that are perceptually irrelevant. One of the main
obstacles to the deployment of semantic image processing systems has been the
difficulty of training content?]understanding systems with large scale
vocabularies. This is, in great part, due to the requirement for large amounts
of training data and intensive human supervision associated with the classical
methods for vocabulary learning. This research aims to establish a foundation
for semantic image processing systems that can learn large scale vocabularies
from&lt;br/&gt;informally annotated data and no additional human supervision. It
builds on recent advances in semantic image labeling, which have made it
possible to learn vocabularies from noisy training data, such as that massively
(and inexpensively) available on the web. The research studies both
theoretical&lt;br/&gt;issues in vocabulary learning, and the design of image
processing algorithms that tune their behavior according to the content of the
images being processed. Semantic image processing could lead to transformative
advances in areas such as image compression, enhancement, encryption,
de?]noising, or&lt;br/&gt;segmentation, among others, which are of interest for
applications as diverse as medical imaging, image search and retrieval, or
security and surveillance.
