This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project will produce a Raman
spectrometer based on the use of liquid core optical fibers to enhance signal
intensity and improve signal-to-noise ratio. The fibers will be made of Teflon
AF, a clear, amorphous, low-refractive-index fluoropolymer. When filled with
nearly any transparent liquid (including water), they will act as optical
fibers, capturing and confining both excitation and Raman scattered radiation
over large interaction lengths. In doing so, they will greatly increase signal
intensity relative to conventional sampling arrangements. This will enable
significant cost reductions through the use of inexpensive low power lasers
and/or lower cost detectors as well as reduced acquisition times. This program
will extend Phase I work by improving fibers and optimizing the
fiber/spectrometer interface. Program goals include demonstrating significant
intensity enhancement in aqueous solutions and producing prototypes for specific
applications. This project will ease the performance requirements of lasers and
detectors and result in the production of Raman laboratory instruments (for
undergraduate teaching and biological sampling) and low cost, compact, reliable
and robust test cells.
