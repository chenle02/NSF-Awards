Adaptive optics (AO) is a technique used in astronomy to correct distortions in
the incoming light collected by optical systems (i.e. telescopes in astronomy)
due to the effects of the atmosphere through which the light passes. AO has
applications to fields outside of astronomy for example ophthalmology/vision
science. The proposed interdisciplinary workshop will bring together scientists
and engineers from a variety of fields that use AO for unique discussions. These
types of in person collaborations are essential for evolving the science and for
growing the avenues of communication between the various disciplines. The
proposed workshop will also train the next generation of scientists and
engineers by providing exposure to the multi-disciplinary AO
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is for an AO-specific workshop that
will be included as one of eight topical meetings held as part of the Imaging
and Applied Optics conference, to be held 25 - 28 July 2016 in Heidelberg,
Germany. The workshop entitled Adaptive Optics: Methods, Analysis, and
Applications will bring together researchers from various communities that use
AO to discuss new developments in the field and novel applications of adaptive
optics. Topics will include AO systems/component technologies, wave-front
correction optics, control algorithms, and signal processing electronics used in
AO implementations. The proposed workshop is directly relevant to current and
future development of NSF astronomical facilities and programs.
