The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in providing
a more sustainable, low-cost water management system capable of purifying, or
treating, wastewater produced through a wide array of applications, ranging from
agriculture to manufacturing. The core technology incorporates an efficient,
passive solar thermal harvesting technique for capturing thermal energy. The
successful development, commercialization and incorporation of this modular
system into existing wastewater systems could reduce costs and increase
efficiency in wastewater management, creation of renewable fresh water, and the
handling of potentially hazardous wastewater. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps
project provides a high-rate, high-efficiency transformative distillation method
that localizes radiation heat within porous media. This passive method for water
distillation utilizes stored radiative thermal energy for collecting distilled
water from wastewater. Unlike existing methods of distillation where the bulk of
the body of liquid is heated for evaporation/boiling, this technology focuses
the stored heat onto a thin layer of liquid and allows the rest of the bulk
liquid to remain unheated, leading to maximum efficiency and phase-change rate.
A physical model has been developed, and laboratory testing under typical solar
radiation intensity conditions has shown encouraging results. Through this
I-Corps project, this method of distillation can be investigated to determine
whether it will lead to the more effective and economical management of
industrial wastewater and agricultural runoff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
