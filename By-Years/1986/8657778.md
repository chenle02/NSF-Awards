This is a Presidential Young Investigator (PYI) award. The research involves
experimental and analytical studies of the chemistry and properties of geologic
fluids. Specific objectives of the project include (1) determining compositions
of natural geologic fluids by studying the microscopic fluid inclusions found in
minerals from various environments, (2) experimental studies of the pressure-
volume-temperature- composition (PVTX) properties of fluids representative of
those found in natural samples, and (3) studying the mechanisms of formation and
re-equilibration of natural fluid inclusions. The results of these studies will
advance our understanding of the important role of fluids in controlling
physical and chemical environments in the earth.
