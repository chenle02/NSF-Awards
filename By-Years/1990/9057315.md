Dr. Zamer wants to continue studying the genetic basis of physiological
phenomenon and their expression in varied environment. He wishes to examine the
mechanisms by which natural selection leads to differential reproductive success
as a key issue in evolutionary biology. In order to examine how the extent to
which genetic variation affects physiological performance, Dr. Zamer will study
both the organismal and metabolic and organismal levels of physiological
performance. He will qualify genetic components of total variation for several
metabolic and organismal level physiological characteristics underlying
genetically identical sea anemones under a variety of relevant environmental
conditions. This research is an important contribution to marine biology and
will enhance our understanding of the influence that genetic variation has on
reorganization of metabolism during environmental change.
