Infrared, specific heat, and elastic measurements on low- dimensional conductors
are to be carried out. The goal of the IR experiments is to understand the role
of solitons in charge- density-wave compounds with third- and quarter-filled
bands. Strain and photo-modulation spectroscopy will be carried out on blue
bronze, TaS3, and tetra-methyl-iodide-TCNQ. Elastic measurements will be
implemented in the range 10 Hz to 10 MHz, in order to trace dependencies of
elastic anomalies on frequency, temperature, and electric field, as well as
effects of "switching", magnetic fields, and strain. The same apparatus can be
used to study flux depinning in 2D superconductors. An ac calorimeter will be
constructed to examine specific heat anomalies at phase transitions, and the use
of CDW semiconductors as thermometers will be studied.
