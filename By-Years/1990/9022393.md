This Phase II SBIR proposal is to continue efforts to develop thin coatings for
implantable device cables. The emphasis is on using a plasma enhanced deposition
process to produce a coating of fluorinated parylene, an insulator. The research
will optimize the deposition process and will test biocompatibility using in
vitro experiments. If successful, the research will result in improved
implantable cables. This is potentially important because a deteriorating cable
is one of the most common causes of failure of implanted electronic devices.
