Recent developments in nonlinear control theory coupled with significant
advances in computing technology have made possible a new era of control systems
design. Availing ourselves of these advances, we seek to expand the
applicability of the theory toward an eventual goal of a practicable design
methodology. Using theoretical tools from differential geometry, center
manifolds, and singular perturbations and aided by powerful graphics and
symbolic computational tools, we will investigate: o input-output approximations
of nonlinear systems by nonlinear systems possessing desired regularity
conditions, and o the effect of system perturbations on the structure of MIMO
nonlinear systems. A better understanding of these areas will make a significant
contribution to the theoretical understanding and practical design of high
performance nonlinear control systems.
