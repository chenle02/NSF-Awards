Abstract&lt;br/&gt;PHY-0456631&lt;br/&gt;PI: Gary Felder&lt;br/&gt;Institution:
Smith College&lt;br/&gt;Simulating Models of High-Energy Physics in the Early
Universe&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has the main goal to
perform large-scale computer simulations to study the exit from inflation stage
of cosmological evolution. The significance of such studies is that one will be
able to understand complex properties of different fundamental particle physics
models at extremely high energies. In particular, it may help with clarifying
the issues in production of cosmic strings after inflation in various models.
This study may have significant implications for string theory and for
gravitational wave astronomy.&lt;br/&gt;The proposal will be carried out in an
undergraduate women's college and will promote teaching and training in
programming, data analysis and other computer skills of an underrepresented
group. Even though the project is at the forefront of research in particle
physics and cosmology, it has important components in which undergraduate women
students can actively participate.&lt;br/&gt;
