EIA- 0119469&lt;br/&gt;Ophir Frieder&lt;br/&gt;Illinois Institute of
Technology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educational Innovation: Enhancing the CS
Undergraduate Curriculum to Include Data Mining and Information
Retrieval&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves the development (and
introduction into the undergraduate computer science curriculum) of two new
courses: Data Mining and Information Retrieval. In this sequence, students build
systems that implement key data mining and information retrieval algorithms and
learn how to apply these algorithms to solve real-world problems. At the end of
this sequence, students understand and use the fundamental algorithms and
existing state-of-the-art in web search engines, intranets, data mining, and
customer relationship management. Two significant group projects provide
students with experience as participants of a software development team. These
projects enable larger implementation achievements that further the
understanding of algorithms, implementation trade-offs and software project
management. In addition, such a group project is a critical experience that
future employers and graduate schools look for. &lt;br/&gt;
