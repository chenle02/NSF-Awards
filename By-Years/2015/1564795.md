Recognizing that engineering and computer science are making concerted efforts
to increase the diversity of students in their academic programs and in the
workforce, this multi-institutional research team proposes a two-pronged
approach: (1) To provide scholarships to a diverse population of low-income
academically talented students with financial need; and (2) to adapt, implement,
and test a student experience model designed to increase the success of students
in those fields. The primary disciplinary foci are Electrical, Computer, and
Software Engineering (ECSE) with the inclusion of cyber-security at Iowa State
University (ISU); Des Moines Area Community College (DMACC) and Kirkwood
Community College (KCC). The project plans to award scholarships to 272 students
(100 unique scholars at Iowa State University; 90 unique scholars at Des Moines
Area Community College; and 82 unique scholars at Kirkwood Community College.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The student experience model includes a set of well-
established evidence-based practices that form an ecosystem of academic and co-
curricular supports for students and is designed to foster retention, transfer,
and graduation in STEM. The research team will conduct two research studies of
this ecosystem of supports. The qualitative phenomenological study is designed
to investigate and understand the development and maintenance of
professional/career identity. The quantitative comparison study is designed to
investigate the influence of individual motivation and the characteristics of
the academic and social environments of ECSE on student success, retention,
transfer, and degree attainment.
