This project involves revising the Interactive Mathematics Program (IMP), a
four-year, integrated, problem-based, college-preparatory, high-school
mathematics curriculum developed with funding from the State of California and
the NSF. Revisions will build on successful elements of the program in ways that
respond to the changing context of mathematics education. The revisions will
focus on three objectives. First, the curriculum will be strengthened by making
changes that give the program greater flexibility. This will be accomplished by
adding a major technology component, and by making content changes that respond
to recent state and national policy documents. Second, the professional
development program will be strengthened through leadership programs that
produce more professional development leaders and by creating consistency and
sustainability through a Professional Development Handbook that articulates
IMP's vision of successful professional development. Third, dissemination and
implementation efforts will be strengthened by developing new materials about
all aspects of IMP that will inform and address concerns of educational decision
makers such as school boards, administrators, parents, and teachers. These
efforts will be carried out with the guidance of a broad-based steering
committee. There will be general evaluation of all project components, as well
as analysis of the mathematical content of the revised curriculum materials.
Cost sharing includes substantial contributions from the publisher and from San
Francisco State University.
