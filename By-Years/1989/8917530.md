Experimental investigations of the structural properties of doped conjugated
polymers. X-ray diffraction will be combined with in situ vapor and
electrochemical techniques, in order to follow the doping-induced transitions as
they occur. The novel phases and novel phase transformations which occur in
these systems will be investigated. Correlations between the structural
evolution and the electronic behavior will be sought.
