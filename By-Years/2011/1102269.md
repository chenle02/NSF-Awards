The objective of this project is to explore the operation principle of
transmitarray antennas. The proposed research will investigate the transmission
properties of novel antenna elements inspired by complementary geometries and
gradient index metamaterials. Based on these element innovations, this project
will address two important concerns in transmitarrays: the bandwidth enhancement
and beam shaping. A thorough study will be carried out to understand the
bandwidth limits of a transmitarray; and both multi-resonant element and multi-
resonant aperture approaches will be applied to increase the antenna bandwidth.
To shape the radiation beam, an efficient synthesis algorithm based on the
intersection approach will be developed for large-aperture transmitarrays. Using
this algorithm, a single-feed quad-beam transmitarray will be developed to
demonstrate the advanced radiation capability of the transmitarray.

Intellectual Merits Compared to existing high gain antennas, the transmitarray
antenna is a transformative concept with unique radiation principle. Because of
the simultaneous magnitude and phase control of the antenna elements, the
transmitarray exhibits numerous advantages, such as low profile conformal
geometry, high radiation efficiency, and advanced radiation patterns. The
broadband performance and multi-beam operation are attractive merits of
transmitarray antennas to be studied in this project.

Broader Impacts The transmitarray concept has wide applications in many science
and engineering missions such as Earth remote sensing and spatial power
combining in high energy systems. This project will also provide an exciting
learning environment for both undergraduate and graduate students to obtain
knowledge in electromagnetics, microwaves, and antennas. It will help to improve
the environment for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in
Mississippi (an EPSCoR State) and to generate qualified work force, which
includes under-represented groups, for future scientific and engineering
development.
