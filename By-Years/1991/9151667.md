To improve undergraduate science teaching, Central Washington University is
developing a computer-based Interactive Multimedia Laboratory. Although CWU is a
comprehensive university it is also the main teacher-training institution in
Washington state. Fully one-third of its graduates are prospective
elementary/secondary school teachers, many of them women, who will serve urban
and rural (often disadvantaged agricultural or timber-harvesting) communities.
Since over 80% of these students take introductory anthropology courses the
Interactive Multimedia Laboratory will be used primarily by the Department of
Anthropology. The immediate target student population will consist of freshmen
and sophomores enrolled in introductory archaeology. Supported by the National
Science Foundation, CWU will acquire ten Macintosh LC microcomputers, plus
peripheral hardware including interactive videotape, video disc, and CD-ROM
players. Software will include Anthropology 3 (a HyperCard-based, EDUCOM award-
winning system developed by archaeologist Brian M. Fagan, University of
California at Santa Barbara). Adapting and enhancing this software, CWU faculty
will transform their introductory courses from a traditional lecture-based
format, to a learner-centered format emphasizing small-group discussion,
problem-solving activity, critical thinking, and the exploration of multi-media
databases and simulations. Anticipated future use of the lab includes an
intensive summer program of interactive multi-media experience for in-service
elementary/secondary science teachers.
