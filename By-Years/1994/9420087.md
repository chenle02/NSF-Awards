9420087 Balamuth Research will be carried out in high energy electron scattering
with the goals of determining the spin structure of nucleons and observing
manifestations of quark and gluon degrees of freedom in the nucleon. With
funding in the present proposal, a new electron polarimeter will be constructed
for use in the Hermes experiment at the HERA facility in Germany, where this
research will be carried out. Research in this area will advance our
understanding of the nucleon in terms of constituent quarks and sea-quarks
(quark-antiquark pairs surrounding the constituent quarks). This topic is among
the most exciting in nuclear and particle physics. Education of graduate
students is integral to this grant and to the overall research program which
will be carried out. ***
