9311813 Achen Social scientists often use aggregate data to study the behavior
of individuals but analysis of aggregates using conventional inferential methods
only show relationships among averages. In many cases the behavior of interest
occurs at the level of local human systems (e.g., farms, local governments) or
at the level of the individual human being. The investigator will build and test
a new method for analyzing aggregate data that will allow the human or
individual effects to be studied. This method will combine basic social science
knowledge about individual behavior and rigorous derivations of aggregate-level
statistical relationships. The resultant models will generate parameters from
aggregate data which can be interpreted at the individual or small human systems
level. The models will be developed using historical voting data, but once
developed these techniques are sufficiently general to extend to other domains
where only aggregate data are available. ***
