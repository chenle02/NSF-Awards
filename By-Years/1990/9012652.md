The Ichthyological Collection of the Field Museum of Natural History is one of
the five most important fish collections in the western hemisphere. These
reference collections are invaluable resources for systematists, ecologists,
biogeographers, and a variety of researchers interested in fishes. Dr. Barry
Chernoff, Curator of the collection, plans an aggressive program of expansion
and improvement for the collections. New storage areas will be added and
equipped with shelving systems. The collection will be reorganized during
transfer to the new storage areas, making them more accessible to visiting
researchers. Data entry of specimen information into a computerized database
will also increase the collection's research impact. Natural history collections
such as this provide the foundation on which generations of biological research
can be built. Well curated collections allow direct study of the effects of
changing climate and land use, and provide the only record left by extinct
species. Continued growth and improvement of these collections serves the
current research community, and provides critical resources for future
researchers.
