9305584 Bradshaw Darwinian fitness is achieved through high survival, fast
development, and prolific reproduction. Ideally, an organism would produce a
large number of offspring, each with a high probability of surviving, on the day
it is born. Clearly, organisms do not achieve this ideal; rather, the life cycle
of organisms is a compromise between fast, safe development of reproductive age
and number and quality of offspring produced. The pitcher-plant mosquito appears
to circumvent this compromise: fast developing mosquitoes are prone neither to
early death nor to reduced fecundity. Dr. Bradshaw's plans to determine whether
evolution of a mosquito that is capable of faster, safer development and higher
fecundity could occur. Mosquitoes that achieved high Darwinian fitness under
good conditions may be less able to survive and reproduce under stressful
conditions than are normal mosquitoes. If this proposition proves to be true,
then fitness in the real world represents a compromise between maximizing gain
in fitness under ideal conditions and minimizing loss to fitness under adverse
conditions. %%% Studies such as these may indicate which portions of mosquito
life cycles are adaptively rigid in response to adverse conditions, allowing
more effective targeting of sensitive developmental stages to biological or
chemical control. ***
