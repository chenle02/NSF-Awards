Rivera 9525983 The capacity to store new information in memory is one that
changes dramatically over the life span. However, little is known about the age-
related changes in the brain that underlie these changes. With this award, Dr.
Rivera will begin setting up a research laboratory to investigate which genes
are turned on or off at different ages that may affect learning and memory. This
work will provide crucial baseline information on the learning process, how it
is constrained by age, and what some causes for learning dysfunction may be. ***
