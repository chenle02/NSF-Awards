This award supports mid-career training in statistical methodology for
application to legal questions. The training involves organizing two workshops
on empirical research in the law, as well as a year of coursework in applied
statistics. The workshops and the individual study will foster progress on a
series of scholarly projects investigating legal decision making in the United
States Supreme Court in the economic context. The underlying goal of the
research is to understand the similarities and differences between court
decisions in civil rights cases and in cases addressing economic issues.

Formal training in statistics will advance the investigator's individual
research on empirical legal questions. It also will enable her to join other
legal scholars in bringing scientific and statistical methodology to the law
school curriculum. Lawyers, law professors, and judges frequently face difficult
empirical questions, but, for the most part, they have no formal training in
quantitative research methodology. This mid-career training opportunity will
help foster a sub-field in "law and statistics," thereby promoting empirical
legal scholarship as well as law school methods courses. These activities are
supported by the Methodology, Measurement, and Statistics Program and the Law
and Social Sciences Program under the Mid-Career Fellowship component of the MMS
Program Solicitation.
