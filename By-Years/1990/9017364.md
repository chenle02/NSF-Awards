This project is to use textural and chemical analyses of deep ocean pumice from
the Okinawa Trough (provided by Dr. K. Nakamura) to 1) document the deep ocean
origin of this material by measuring volatile contents of the glasses, 2)
quantify pumice structures, and 3) use the combined data presented above to
update current models of vesiculation and fragmentation in order to constrain
physical conditions of these submarine eruptions. Additionally, the PI proposes
to continue collaborative work with R.S. Fiske on a combined theoretical,
experimental and field- based investigation of partitioning of tephra.
