This project, developed by the Virginia Space grant Consortium (VSGC) proposes
to implement a state-wide Institute for gender balanced education to serve K-12
counselors. Over three years, 50 counselors will receive graduate credit for
Institute participation. Included in the Institute is a distance learning
component using a variety of mechanisms for information delivery concerning
gender equity issues. Participants will receive minigrants to pursue activities
implementing gender fair educational practices in their individual schools. The
primary goals of the project include raising awareness about gender issues as
they relate to the interest and success of girls in elementary through secondary
schools and assisting counselors in fostering a gender fair learning environment
in their work with teachers, administrators, parents ad students.
