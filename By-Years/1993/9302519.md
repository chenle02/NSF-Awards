The mapping class group of a closed surface acts on compactified Teichmuller
space. The topology of this space, as well as the dynamics of this action, are
well understood and give information about global properties of the mapping
class group. For example, it satisfies the Tits alternative. The project is to
continue an analogous study of the outer automorphism group of the free group
via its action on compactified outer space. Points in Outer Space are
equivalence classes of simplicial metric trees. The compactifying points are
classes of real trees, objects obtained from degenerations of simplicial trees.
Groups abound in the physical sciences because they arise as the set of
symmetries of an object. There is a special group, called the free group, from
which all others may be constructed. The project is to continue the
investigation of the basic structure of the free group. The technique is to use
tools recently developed by E. Rips and generalized by the investigator with M.
Bestvina.
