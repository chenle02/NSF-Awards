The United States Patent and Trademark Office will provide data to extend and
expand data series concerning patenting in the United States. Data will include
numbers of patents granted by year to Americans and to citizens of other
specified countries; patents owned by individuals as opposed to private
corporate entities and governments; and, patents assigned to universities and
colleges. Counts of granted patents will be classified by both the Patent Office
Classification System and the Standard Industrial Classification System. These
data are used in the National Science Board's series of Science and Engineering
reports as indicators of levels of technical invention in the various countries,
sectors, and fields.
