Digital image processing has important applications throughout various
engineering disciplines, biology, geography and medicine. This is an equipment
grant to support research for which the theoretical groundwork has already been
completed, and pilot experiments indicate the feasibility of large-scale
implementation. The projects include digital image processing and, in
particular, image registration and the determination of flow in time dependent
images.
