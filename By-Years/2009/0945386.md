This Small Business Innovation research Phase I project is to develop flexible,
elastic, superhydrophobic surfaces with a technology that physically transforms
surfaces by molding microstructures into base polymers, ceramics or metals on a
large scale. Uniquely the surfaces may be highly elastic and flexible; and, the
process can manufacture surfaces having multiple structures of different sizes
and shapes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Development and implementation of the proposed
manufacturing process will provide a method of manufacturing multi-scale and
multi-functional surfaces from every day, low cost materials suitable for
consumer products. The work could impact transportation safety (tires,
airplanes), low-cost green energy (solar panels, wind turbine blades), improved
health (medical devices), increased safety (tool grips, first responder tools)
and enjoyment (sports products).
