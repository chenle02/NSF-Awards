This research addresses the design, fabrication, and characterization of vacuum
microelectronic devices (diodes and triodes) using silicon shallow p-n junction
cold cathode arrays This will be accomplished using an ultra shallow p-n
junction biased in the avalanche region as a cold cathode, and a built-on-chip
polysilicon cantilever beam as an anode (for a diode) of a grid (for a triode).
A self-alignment technique will be tried to improve emission current density and
uniformity. The grid will be at a distance of 1-2 microns above the cathode.
These devices will be arrayed to increase the magnitude of total emission
current. The fabrication technology used will be fully compatible with IC
technology, and operation at low voltages should be achieved. Potential
applications include flat panel displays, fast switching devices, and as an
electron source for scientific instrumentation.
