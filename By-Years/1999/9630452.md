9630452 Kohn This grant supports the work of a senior, emeritus PI with a long
record of distinguished contributions to the theory of materials. The grant
contains work in three different areas: The first project contains further
development and applications of O(N) computational algorithms for general many
atom problems. It also includes work on the inclusion of Van der Waal's forces
and of time dependent response in the local density functional calculations. In
the second part consists of the study of dynamics of Hamiltonian systems subject
to finite time-periodic perturbations. The third project includes continuation
of PI's work on atom- surface interactions and properties of Copper-Gold alloys
at finite temperatures. %%% This grant supports work by one of the founders of
the modern many-body materials theory. After a wonderfully productive career
spanning over 40 year, the PI continues to be an active participant in detailed
research in many-body theory. The proposed work includes further exploration and
application of sophisticated computational methods devised recently by the PI.
It also includes a proposal to consider a long-standing mathematical problem in
the response of systems to time dependent forces. This work, like much of the
prior work of the PI, is timely in bridging the gap in system sizes between
small devices and the largest size that the computers can reliably handle. ***
