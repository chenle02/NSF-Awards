9411964 Young A continuing research program, largely using advanced
computational techniques, will further develop ideas in the areas of phase
transitions in disordered and frustrated systems, and in phase transitions
driven by quantum fluctuations. One of the main thrusts will be to study systems
which combine disorder or frustration with quantum fluctuations. These problems
are poorly understood despite there being interesting experimental results. %%%
This research program is one of the leading ones in the world that studies the
effects of disorder on the properties of complex systems. The present focus is
on combining this expertise on the effects of disorder a focus on systems which
are driven by quantum fluctuations, i.e., superconductor to insulator
transitions at absolute zero temperature. ***
