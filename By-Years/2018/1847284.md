Polynomials are the basic building blocks of algebra. Polytopes are sets in
high-dimensional space with flat sides. The aim of this project is to use
polytopes to answer questions about the coefficients of special families of
polynomials in many variables. For example, which coefficients are nonzero? How
do the coefficients compare to each other in size? If we plot the exponent
vectors of the monomials with nonzero coefficients, do they form the integer
points of a polytope? If we plot a histogram of the coefficients, do the ratios
of consecutive heights form a decreasing sequence? This project also has an
educational component, with the core goal of enabling young women to succeed in
STEM careers by introducing them to discrete mathematics, an area of growing
importance for computer science and data science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Schubert
and Grothendieck polynomials are multivariate polynomials representing
cohomology and K-theory classes on the flag manifold, respectively. Despite the
beautiful formulas developed for them over the past three decades, the
coefficients of these polynomials remain mysterious. It is not even evident how
to tell if a given coefficient is nonzero! The PI will investigate convexity
properties of the coefficients of Schubert and Grothendieck polynomials. For
instance, are the Newton polytopes of these polynomials saturated? Are their
coefficients log-concave along lines? Is there a polytope whose integer point
transform specializes to Schubert and Grothendieck polynomials? This project is
dedicated to understanding the coefficients of these polynomials, with an eye
for exposing polytopal reasons for their properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
