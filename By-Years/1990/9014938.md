This award will support collaborative research in population biology and
ecology between Dr. Philip Crowley, University of Kentucky, and Dr. J.H. Lawton,
Center for Population Biology, Imperial College at Silwood Park, Ascot,
Berkshire, England. The proposed study will focus on two areas: l) the possible
tendency for the abundances of individual populations or of groups of
populations to stabilize, and on how best to detect, measure and conceptualize
this stabiliza- tion process, and 2) the possibility that being sufficiently
spread out in space or fragmented into partially connected sub-populations can
reduce population variability and the risk of extinction. The proposed projects
represent attempts to facilitate the convergence of theory and data concerning
the stability and persistence of natural populations. Among the specific
objectives of each project are: 1) Density-Dependence and Stability: to devise
and improve statistically defensible and sensitive techniques for detecting
density-dependence in density sequences for individual populations and 2)
Metapopulation Stability and Persistence: to consider models of populations that
consist of quasi-independent parts weakly linked by dispersal and buffeted by
moderate environmental fluctuations and to conduct laboratory tests of the
models' predictions. The issues addressed in the proposed research are of
fundamental importance in population and community ecology. Though difficult to
document empirically, density dependence is central to our understanding of how
populations are regulated. Moreover, understanding persistence and measuring
stability are becoming increasingly critical in an era of human-induced
ecological stress and global climatic change. The Center for Population Biology
at Silwood Park provides an outstanding environment for collaborative research
in population dynamics. The expertise of Dr. Crowley and his British
collaborators is complementary, and should serve to enhance the proposed
research.
