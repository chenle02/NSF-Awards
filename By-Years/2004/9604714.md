The objective of this proposal is to provide powerful, state- of-the-art
instrumentation for the production of genetically altered mice. This specialized
equipment will provide investigators with the ability to go from a cloned DNA
molecule to genetically altered mice. These animals allow the biological study
of gene function in developmental and physiological processes in the whole
organism. This instrumentation will enable the University of Michigan Transgenic
Animal Core to meet the research demands of a growing number of investigators.
Demand for transgenic technology is constantly increasing due to the excellent
success rate of the Core and the power of this technology to enhance basic
science knowledge.
