The situation of a group acting on a space, for instance the group of real
numbers acting by time evolution on the state space of a physical system, is
encountered quite often in mathematics and its applications. In the physics
example, every possible configuration of the system lies on a line flowing from
remote past to distant future. One is interested in what happens overall, in the
long run, which may be quite difficult to infer solely from what happens over
short intervals of time. For purposes of analysis, the available information can
be encoded in several different ways: by differential equations or vector fields
or foliations or, as is the case in Professor Xia's research project, by an
algebra of operators on Hilbert space. Professor Xia will study a rather general
Toeplitz algebra construction that has recently been developed for (non-
commutative) dynamical systems; this is related to the more familiar notion of a
crossed product. The specific objectives of his work are to calculate the
K-groups of Toeplitz algebras and their associated commutator ideals, and to see
whether the Toeplitz algebra is a complete isomorphism invariant of the
underlying dynamical system.
