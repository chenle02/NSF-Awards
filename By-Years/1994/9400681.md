9400681 Ehmann The award is for the development of a computer integrated
environment for the automated design, manufacture, and evaluation of micro-
drills with helical point geometry. The new geometry would offer superior
cutting performance while, at the same time, being easier to produce than
conventional geometries. Scientific contributions include theoretical advances
related to mathematical modeling of drill point geometry, its relation to a
grinding model, algorithms for a computer controlled point grinder, and new
quantitative drill performance measures. The work is expected to result in
improvements in advanced micro-drill design, manufacturing and evaluation. The
quality and efficiency of micro-drill production and micro-hole drilling
operations in the domestic microelectronic industry are expected to improve.
