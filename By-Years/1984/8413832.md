The proposed workshop will bring together experts to examine the current status
of research and development (R&D) in hazardous waste treatment and disposal by
government, industry, and academia and to identify directions for future
inquiry. In particular, the possible role of NSF and other government agencies
will be critically examined. For this reason as well as for objectivity, the
participants will be drawn mainly from academic institutions.
