9613562 Braden The project responded to the NSF/EPA solicitation for proposals
for research on the topic of Water and Watersheds. The work will study the
renewal of large floodplain river ecosystems which are found in many areas of
the United States especially in the Midwestern States. The project will focus on
the conditions of the Upper Mississippi River Basin, using a section of the
Illinois River as the study site. This river is one of the only three large
floodplain river systems that retain an appreciable annual flood pulse. The
river also has a high ecological potential which has been diminished by water
management practices. A model that will integrate the river hydrology, ecology
and economy will be developed for the simulation of the interactions of flood
plain and river uses, such as agriculture, navigation, recreation, commercial
fishing and forestry, with species carrying capacity. The model will have a
policy component that will examine the significance of these uses and water
management on systems outcomes. The results from this research will improve the
management of the watershed resources and the organizations responsible for it,
and the experience will be transferable to other large floodplain river systems.
