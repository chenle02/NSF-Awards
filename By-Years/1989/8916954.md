Dr. McFadden's research will have two phases: (1) Laboratory analytical
experiments simulating the effects of solar wind on asteroid surfaces and the
way these changes affect spectral reflectance and other optical properties. (2)
Comparison of the laboratory results with remote sensing data made with respect
to spectral reflectance and polarimetric and photometric scattering properties.
This will define which of these parameters are diagnostic of solar wind
bombardment and also define asteroid surface conditions whose specific spectral
signatures are attributable to the effects of surface alteration. Understanding
the chemical and physical states of asteroids and their evolutionary history has
been impeded by investigators' inability to satisfactorily compare remote
sensing measurements with certain samples of meteorites and synthetic mixtures
of terrestrial materials. Dr. McFadden's study will examine the effects of solar
wind bombardment on the reflectance and other optical properties of meteorite
samples and mineral mixtures. This will improve the understanding of the
relationship between asteroids and their possible meteoritic analogues, and test
the current primary assumption in interpretation of asteroid spectral
reflectance: that the surfaces of asteroids are represented appropriately by
unaltered meteoritic materials.
