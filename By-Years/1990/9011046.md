Description: This project supports collaborative work by theoretical physicists
Dr. Steven Pieper at Argonne National Laboratory and Dr. A.R. Bodmer at the
University of Illinois-Chicago, and in the area of microscopic theory of
hypernuclei Dr. Q.N. Usmani at the Jamia Millia Islamia in New Delhi. They have
previously made calculations of S-shell hypernuclei, A binding to nuclear matter
and AP scattering data using simplified NN interactions, and have shown that a
consistent description of these data can be achieved with AN and ANN
interactions consistent with meson exchange models. The proposed work will
combine this effort with work by Dr. Pieper at Argonne in developing a
variational program for computing the ground-states of closed-shell nuclei using
realistic two-and three-nucleon interactions. The combined programs will extend
the closed-shell program firstly to allow for one or two A particles and
secondly to allow computation of P-shell hypernuclei. The objective is to obtain
a more detailed knowledge of the AN and ANN interactions. The problem of
baryonic mixtures and AE coupling will also be studied. Scope: This project
enables two highly qualified scientists, and their teams, to continue and expand
collaborative research that had started several years ago and resulted in
significant publications. The project will enable the Indian team to acquire
capabilities for extensive mathematical analysis and calculations necessary for
this work and to greatly contribute to the development of the theory of
hypernuclei. The project is one in which the collaboration is especially
beneficial to both sides.
