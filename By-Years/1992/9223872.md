9223872 Law This project will support research on the study of surface
nucleation and growth of droplets to a uniform film, called a wetting layer, at
liquid mixture surfaces. The physics behind the process of surface nucleation is
not well understood, nor is the coalescence of droplets to a uniform film on a
surface well understood. It is important to gain an impordec understanding of
such phenomena because the existance of wetting layers on surfaces is
technologically very important, especially for solid surfaces. Wetting layers on
solid surfaces modigy the physical and chemical properties of that surface. They
are important in such processes as lubrication and tertiary oil recovery. A
better understanding of the physics behind wetting layer formation will enable
the properties of these films to be controlled more precisely and also enable
the development of films with new and novel characteristics. ***
