9712885 Nelson The senior PI, in recent years, has been involved in (a) the
development of a Lagrangian formulation of long wavelength phenomena in
dielectric crystals, (b) using this formulation to derive and elucidate high-
order nonlinear interactions and correcting widely held long standing
misconceptions in classical theories and (c) incorporation of magnetic phenomena
in his formulation using Grassmann algebra of anticommuting variables. This
grant continues to support his work following a string of successes in the
previous award. This grant also includes work on a generalized energy
conservation law and a new Poynting vector, followed by application to the
properties of an optical soliton. %%% This senior PI is well known for his
contributions to Laser Physics. In this renewal grant, he continues his work on
a sophisticated mathematical formulation of electromagnetic wave propagation in
an insulating material. In this renewal he specifically wants to generalize the
formulation to include magnetic properties of materials. ***
