A laboratory in a classroom setting is used for teaching Calculus I and
Introductory Programming. The classroom setting facilitates demonstrations and
promotes student interactions with the computer during lectures. Computer
algebra system software and other programs with calculus/graphics capabilities
used in the math classes give the students a geometric demonstration of the
topics being discussed. Assignments made to students provide them with extensive
"hands-on" experience. Some of this is part of the lecture period and other
experience is during formal and informal laboratory periods. The grantee
provides funds for this project that are an equal match for the NSF award.
