9318528 Everett This project addresses the central hypotheses of the Arctic
System Science LAII Flux Study by examining spatial (local and regional) and
temporal (interannual to interdecadal) variations in soil active layer
thickness. This is done on representative landscapes by using different probing
and soil coring approaches (grids, transects, and point data). Standard 1 km x 1
km grids are located in different landscape units across the Alaska Arctic
Slope. The LAII sites, which are shared by other Flux Study projects, were
selected in most cases based on availability of long-term data sets including
soil thaw and local climate records. The study relies upon high frequency, site
specific determination of active layer thickness as a function of climate, soil
properties, and landscape units (geobotanical complexes). The historical
boundary between the base of the recent soil thaw and the upper permafrost is
established by coring the frozen ground and observing the distribution and
morphology of the ground ice. The thaw depth measurements are used to validate
or modify active layer models and to assess climate change upon the arctic
tundra ecosystem. The carbon status of the soils and near-surface permafrost are
established across landscape units and serve as a basis for carbon balance
extrapolations to regional scales. ***
