One of the relatively unexplored research areas of reinforced concrete is its
response under sub-zero temperatures. In this research, experimental and
analytical studies will be conducted on the local bond-slip relationships of
reinforced concrete specimens in the temperature range between -10;soC and
-40;soC. This temperature range covers most arctic coastal zones, sub-arctic,
and temperate zones. Both normal and lightweight concrete specimens subjected to
monotonic and cyclic loading conditions will be investigated. While there are a
number of specific studies that may be conducted on the behavior of reinforced
concrete under cryogenic conditions, the transfer of forces across the concrete-
steel interface by bond is of fundamental importance to many aspects of
reinforced concrete mechanics behavior.
