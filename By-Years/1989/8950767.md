This funding supports the purchase of a " Laboratory On-Line Computing System"
for teaching students the current techniques for monitoring and controlling
experimental laboratory tests in mechanical engineering. Specific applications
include gathering mobility data used in the prescription of an isolator system,
modal analysis to identify structural system parameters, and simulation and
modification of structures. This system is part of the university-wide overall
effort to upgrade the laboratory facilities for undergraduate teaching and
faculty enhancement. This award is being matched by an equal amount from the
principal investigator's institution.
