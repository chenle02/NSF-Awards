This grant in Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry provides support for the
research work of Dr. Peter Chen, Harvard University. This work focuses on using
laser techniques to determine both the strengths of chemical bonds and
stabilities of a number of important molecules. Specifically, this work will (1)
develop and exploit gas-phase laser spectroscopic techniques for determination
of bond strengths, heats of formation, and excited-state energies for medium-to-
large polyatomic molecules and reactive intermediates, (2) determine the C=C
homolytic bond dissociation energy of heteroatom-substituted olefins, and
singlet-triplet gaps for the corresponding singlet ground-state nucleophilic
carbenes, (3) test the relationship proposed by Simons and Goddard between the
homolytic bond dissociation energy of an olefin to a pair of carbenes and the
singlet-triplet gap in those carbenes by direct application of thermochemical
data, and (4) determine key thermochemical quantities necessary to assess the
importance of an electron-rich olefin/nucleophilic carbene equilibrium in
reactions catalyzed by thiazolium salts.
