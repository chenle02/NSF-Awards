This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This engineering education research
award to Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University will employ
researchers to combine two types of experiential learning, namely undergraduate
research and internships with industry, in a format that reaches a broad
population of students in three construction related degree programs at Virginia
Tech. The research will support the creation of sustainable engineering and
construction professionals by building on traditional summer internship
programs, while at the same time serving as a self-sustaining mechanism for
generating valid data to be used in sustainable engineering and construction
research. This project is anticipated to fill gaps in the existing knowledge
base about the impacts of experiential learning programs on diverse student
populations and the efficacy of hybrid experiential learning methods for
sustainability pedagogy. This will advance understanding of the role of such
programs in setting the stage for positive change toward sustainability in
industry and in better preparing engineering students for their roles in
industry.&lt;br/&gt;
