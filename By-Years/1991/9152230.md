Six workstations plus associated software are being used to develop courses in
software development, artificial intelligence, and mathematical foundations of
computer graphics. Students use CASE tools, tools for studying artificial
intelligence and developing expert systems including LISP and PROLOG, and
graphics software in the three upper division courses. A graphics
printer/plotter also facilitates student learning.
