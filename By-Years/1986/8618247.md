This project is in the general area of analytical and surfacechemistry and in
the subfields of mass spectrometry and materialschemistry. This grant provides
funds with which Dr. Hercules willacquire a new time-of-flight secondary ion
mass spectrometer(TOF-SIMS) which will enable the high resolution
characterizationof polymeric materials, especially their surfaces and
near.surface regions. This project is expected to provide new rapidand precise
methods of polymer analysis. This new TOF-SIMS spectrometer will be the first of
its kind inthe United States. With an expected resolution of approximately
13,000 and a mass range of up to 20,000 amu, this instrument will enable rapid
determination of molecular weight distributions and the determination of the
surface composition of polymers. This new spectrometer can be expected to
heighten the impact of the principal investigator's related research activities
that are currently supported under NSF grant CHE-8411835.
