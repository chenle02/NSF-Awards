This proposal seeks to partially support 18 undergraduate students, graduate
students, post-docs, and under-represented, female, junior and retired faculty
to attend and present at the symposium on Quantum and Nanomaterials at the
Spring Materials Research Society (MRS) national meeting in Seattle, Washington,
April 18-23, 2021. The main focus of this symposium is to discuss the advanced
state-of-the-art experimental tools and theoretical calculations used to
manipulate and detect the physical properties (magnetic, superconducting,
structural, opto-electronics, etc.) of quantum materials, heterostructures and
devices, particularly, on the atomically thin crystals, whose response is
exceedingly difficult to detect by employing conventional bulk techniques. This
meeting is the world's foremost international scientific gathering for materials
research, the MRS meeting showcases leading interdisciplinary research in both
fundamental and applied areas, coordinated by scientists from both academia and
industry in many countries around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
