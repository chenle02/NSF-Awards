General chemistry students in a second semester Quantitative Analysis laboratory
will learn to carry out chemical analyses by working cooperatively in small
groups. The groups will design experiments that are productive and efficient,
carry them out, and report on them. The students will be assigned cooperative
roles and taught technical and personal skills needed to be effective in group
activities. Experimental design including methods of identifying important
experimental factors, optimizing the factors, and collecting appropriate data to
characterize the response of a system will be a primary concern. The teamwork
and experimental design activities will provide students a better understanding
of what scientists do and a more complete preparation for scientific careers.
Information will be gathered to discover changes in student attitudes toward
cooperative activities and science.
