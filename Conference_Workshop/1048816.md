This award supports travel for participants in the Seventh International
Association for Mathematics and Computers in Simulation (IMACS) Conference on
Nonlinear Evolution Equations and Wave Phenomena: Computation and Theory," held
4-7 April 2011 at the University of Georgia. The workshop brings together
researchers in theory, computation, and applications of models for nonlinear
waves. The conference program, which includes tutorials suitable for students,
is designed to be valuable for young researchers.

The workshop will enhance communication among junior and senior researchers in
nonlinear evolution equations. Conference proceedings will be published. The
conference encourages and supports participation by graduate students, junior
researchers, and members of under-represented groups.
