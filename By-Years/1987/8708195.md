A major unresolved question in global seismology, the important implications
for Earth structure and dynamics, remains the detection and accurate
characterization of discontinuities of the transition zone, the jumps on elastic
parameters are known approximately, as well as their average locations, while
for others we have merely indirect evidence of their existence. We propose to
investigate the structure of the transition zone, with particular emphasis on
the characterization of discountinuities. To achieve this, we have developed a
procedure for inferring the properties of a discontinuity from a sparse network
of three commponent stations. This uses a hybrid reflectivity - WKBJ approach to
the systematic generation of all phases of non-negligible amplitude that
interact with a parti- cular boundary, combined with optimal estimates of body
wave vector displacement to constrain the observed ray parameter. By
incorporating a variety of reflected and converted phases for many events, at
different depths and with a range of ray para- meters, we can separate the
effects of jumps in wave speeds and density, while by using broad band data we
can also estimate thickness.
