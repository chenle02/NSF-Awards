9312134 Khargonekar This proposal is part of a major effort by systems/control
and solid state electronics specialists to advance the application of control
and systems theory to real time feedback control of semiconductor manufacturing
equipment. We have chosen Reactive Ion Etching (RIE) as our initial research
vehicle. This proposal describes fundamental research necessary for the
application of real time control systems theory and technology to RIE. Our
overall goal is to redesign the RIE machine for enhanced controllability and
improved performance. We believe that this research program has the potential of
offering dramatic improvement in the performance characteristics of RIE as
measured by attainable feature size, uniformity of wafer processing, and yield.
