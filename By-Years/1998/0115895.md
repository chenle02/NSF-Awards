AST-0115895&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Caton, Daniel B.&lt;br/&gt;An astronomical
telescope and dome system for research and training students will be developed
at Appalachia State University. Appalachia State University is a small non-PhD
granting institution dedicated primarily to teaching. Research will be centered
on measurements of eclipsing binaries and the detection of planets at the L4 and
L5 points within eclipsing binary systems. The telescope will also be used to
measure planet occultation of stars to characterize planets.
