The University of Maryland Probeware Project is a three year implementation
program which will introduce 74 well-prepared middle school physical science
teachers to the use of interfacing boxes and software needed to use the
microcomputer as a laboratory tool.In addition, the project will monitor middle
school student development of science concepts, graphing skills and science
processing skills. This is a cooperative venture of the University of Maryland
Science Teaching Center and schools in local school districts. Middle school
physical science teachers will learn to use probeware during introductory and
advanced summer workshops.
