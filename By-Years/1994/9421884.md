Hans Andersen of Stanford University is supported by a grant from the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to study computer simulations of
chemical and materials systems. Andersen's research will focus on new computer
simulation approaches to chemical and materials systems. Four major areas of
research will be pursued:1) Quantum theory of reaction rates of both condensed
and gas phase chemical species; 2) Computer simulation studies of melting in two
dimensional arrays of colloidal particles; 3) Theory of interaction of charged
colloidal particles in aqueous ionic solution; and 4) Methods for ab initio
computer simulation of materials including the use of new pseudopotentials, an
improved density functional method, and the use of wavelets for basis functions.
Computer simulations of chemical systems have provided chemists with many new
physical insights related to the elucidation of chemical properties in atomic
and molecular terms. As the models continue to improve, the predictions of such
models become increasingly reliable. As computational capabilities continue to
improve, the size of systems which can be reliably treated continues to
increase. Andersen's research is directed at the simulation of systems which are
of chemical and material importance many of which exhibit quantum effects and
cannot be treated by ordinary classical simulation techniques. Andersen will
develop new computational approaches which will facilitate the treatment of such
systems.
