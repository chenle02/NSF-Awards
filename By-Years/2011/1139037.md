Turbulent fluid flows occurring in many fields of science and engineering are
characterized by the complexities of fluctuations over a wide range of scales,
to the extent that their detailed computation is a premier challenge worthy of
the use of world-class computational resources. The core objectives of this
project are to pursue intensive efforts both computationally and scientifically
to ensure successful conduct of a massive investigation of mixing and dispersion
in turbulent flow, at a new world-record level of resolution on a new machine of
true sustained Petascale capability. The targeted simulation will reach a
resolution of 8192-cube (more than half a trillion) grid points and a Reynolds
number which exceeds most laboratory experiments. In order to succeed, there are
intellectual challenges to be overcome in pursuing the intricacies of several
emerging new computational paradigms, including hybrid multi-cored programming
and overlap between computation and interprocessor communication subject to the
logic of the numerical methods employed as well as characteristics of the new
machine hardware.

The conduct of the simulations and subsequent data analyses at Reynolds number
higher than ever achieved before will enable important progress in the study of
intermittency of turbulent fluctuations and the effect of these fluctuations on
many aspects of turbulent mixing and dispersion. Strategies for code development
and exploration of new programming models for the full simulation code on the
future NSF Track 1 Petascale machine carry inherent risk, because of the massive
size of the system whose characteristics are not fully known or determined at
this time. However the urgency for supporting code development is great since
the machine is scheduled to become available in 2012 and CPU hours will be in
great demand from a number of research teams pre-approved by NSF. Results from
the simulations and consequent unprecedented massive database are expected to
draw interest from the turbulence community worldwide and be of interest in many
problems of societal concern, including the efficiency of combustion devices and
the dispersion of pollutants in the environment.

To maximize the scientific impact of this work the challenges of making large
datasets better maintained and more readily accessible will be be addressed via
services provided by major supercomputer centers. This work will also provide a
unique training opportunity for a graduate student of high caliber, echoing the
success of prior joint mentoring activities by both investigators.
