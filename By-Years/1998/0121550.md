This NSDL Services project is developing an initial set of "data discovery"
tools to enable students to manipulate real (and real-time if needed) data sets
for visualization purposes. In addition, an Internet-based community center for
further tool building, the "Foundry", is being created. The proposed data
discovery tools are based on a novel technology that combines the data
visualization and analysis capabilities of Kodak's Interactive Data Language
(IDL) product with the interactive, multimedia authoring capabilities of
Macromedia's Director. The key to this authoring technology is the EDMI (Earth
Data Multimedia Instrument) software. The EDMI is a very simply a cross-platform
Windows and MacOS compatible IDL plug-in to Macromedia Director. Since the
proposed tools are all based on leading off-the-shelf software, there are
already many potential partners within the NSDL community capable of joining in
this effort on the tool development side. The initial set of tools and those
developed subsequently by the community are linked to Internet-based curricular
material, which means that teachers looking for a digital laboratory exercise
can either find an existing tool that does precisely what they need to
accomplish in the classroom, or they can make use of the Foundry to
collaboratively create a new tool or a new lab exercise for an existing tool.
