Experiments follow from a single question posed at the beginning of the course:
How is gene expression regulated? In order to answer this question students
learn the standard techniques of biotechnology: bacterial culture, DNA
purification, restriction and ligation of DNA, transformation of competent
cells, Southern transfer, polymerase chain reaction, preparation and labeling of
probes, chemiluminescent detection, in vitro mutagenesis, DNA sequencing,
protein electrophoresis and Western blotting. The continuity of the experiments
illustrate and emphasize the sequential nature of scientific inquiry. Many
important biochemical and genetic concepts are highlighted while students
simultaneously practice their investigative skills and develop their technical
skills.
