In his past research, the P.I. has studied the behavior of waves in random
systems of various geometries and in quasiperiodic systems. In the course of
this work, he has been able to identify some systems which are particularly
"clean" and he proposes to use these special geometries to answer some current
open questions in l.t. condensed-matter physics. Specifically, he proposes to
study: - 1) scaling and dimensional cross-over for 4He using a glass capillary
array; 2) the difference between local and non-local non-linear interactions in
random systems and quasiperiodic systems; 3) 2D, strong, Anderson localization
as a function of the amount of disorder; and 4) the superfluid transition with
4He permeated by a variable weak-link array (generated with standing e.m. waves
from crossed laser beams), with the possibility of observing a controlled Bose
glass transition.
