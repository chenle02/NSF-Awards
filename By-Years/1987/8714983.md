Analysis of ice deformation data from laboratories and from field measurements
on glaciers, coupled with preliminary biaxial creep experiments, suggest that
stress configuration (stresses acting in directions other that the direction in
which the strain rate is measured) may effect the deformation rate of ice much
more than that suggested by Glenn's Flow Law. This study will involve prepared
ice in simple shear and in simple shear with simultaneous compression in a cold
laboratory at the University of Wisconsin- River Falls. These experiments will
test the accuracy of Glen's Flow Law, which assumes independence from the third
invariant in describing deformation of ice under biaxial stresses. Results
should allow, if necessary, modification of the flow law to a more general form
based on both the second and third variants. A second part of this study will
involve conducting combined stress tests on glacier ice samples exhibiting a
broad range of crystal fabrics and grain sizes to investigate the form of the
flow law for anisotropic ice.
