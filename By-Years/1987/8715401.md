This project addresses the sensors and recording system necessary to make long
term in situ measurements of water properties. The main problem in obtaining the
required accuracy (about 0.01 ppt for salinity) is the stability of conductivity
measurements. The principal investigator has been working with moored
conductivity measurements for the past 15 years and has used both electrode and
inductive sensors. In the deep ocean, very small drifts have been observed over
several months, but in shallow waters, drifts of as large as 0.1 ppt in salinity
have occurred in a few months. Four tasks will be carried out: (1) conductivity
sensor performance in various configurations and locations will be summarized,
(ii) spatial and temporal aliasing errors will be investigated, (iii) sampling
and digitizing accuracy will be estimated, and (iv) a power budget and memory
size will be derived.
