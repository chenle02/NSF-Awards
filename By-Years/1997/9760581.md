*** 9760581 Hood This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
addresses research toward a novel detector design which can offer the potential
for high-sensitivity, low-noise, and large formats. It has the added feature of
being highly flexible in the design of pixel-to-pixel spectral sensitivity from
2 to over 25 microns. Large-format, low-noise, highly-sensitive infrared
detector arrays play an important role in modern astronomy. If this research is
succcessful, it can provide improvements in infrared detector technology which
can enable a continuation of the rapid advances being made in infrared
astronomy. This project will utilize specialized design software developed at
the Ohio State University, ElectroScience Laboratory to optimize the absorbing
structures; draw upon the NSF supported Cornell Nanofabrication Facility to
fabricate a series of test structures; and test the proof-of-principle
detectors. The commercial potential for this technology is low-cost large-format
room temperature and cryogenic infrared sensor arrays. These arrays can be used
in military, industrial monitoring and control, and surveillance applications.
