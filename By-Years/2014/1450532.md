Education researchers, practitioners, industry representatives, and policymakers
are increasingly committed to making engineering education accessible to all
K-12 students and teachers. This RAPID project is designed to learn what type of
collaborative infrastructure would best support NSF awardees in engaging in the
innovative, synergistic research, development, and dissemination activities that
will enable engineering to fulfill this important role in K-12 teaching and
learning. Focusing on Massachusetts (and the greater Boston area in particular),
researchers from Tufts University and EDC will conduct a landscape analysis of
K-12 engineering education, highlighting opportunities, gaps, and resources, and
identifying areas of overlapping interests among NSF awardees and other
stakeholders that may translate into a focus for purposeful activities.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While Massachusetts (and the greater Boston area in
particular) serves as a major center for NSF-funded K-12 engineering education
research and development activities, NSF awardees engaged in engineering
education and housed in institutions around the area do not routinely meet and
collaborate as a group in an effort to improve engineering education, and there
is currently no infrastructure in place to support NSF awardees and cross-sector
collaboration in K-12 engineering education on an ongoing basis. Thus this is an
appropriate testbed for a project concerned to learn more about infrastructures
to support funded researchers in efforts to enhance K-12 engineering education.
The researchers will concurrently conduct a robust literature review and
interview key stakeholders across sectors (starting with NSF awardees). A report
of findings from this landscape analysis will be disseminated broadly with the
goal of informing K-12 engineering education efforts both in the area and
nationally.
