The underlying hardware for flash memory-based solid-state drive (SSD) is
becoming increasingly unreliable, and the current state-of-the-art approaches
implement performance-sacrificing techniques to prevent data loss. This problem
is exacerbated as the storage ages, causing performance unpredictability and
making performance anomaly detection difficult. In the current capacity-
invariant interface where the storage device exports a fixed capacity throughout
its lifetime, an SSD has no other choice but to trade performance for
reliability as it wears out. This project rethinks the existing storage
interface from a holistic perspective by exploiting tradeoffs among capacity,
performance, and reliability (CPR) and designing a flexible capacity-variant
interface that allows the SSD to maintain performance while it gracefully
reduces the number of exported blocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves
three research thrusts. The first thrust is to quantify the error-induced
performance degradation by building an SSD aging framework. The second thrust
then builds a capacity-variant system and demonstrates the effectiveness of such
an approach. Lastly, the project studies how capacity-variance can be extended
across a heterogeneous aggregation of SSDs. The project is expected to have a
major impact in the storage industry, as the problem it addresses is both timely
and likely to get worse if left unchecked. A capacity-variant storage system can
make storage system maintenance and provisioning easier, and this project will
help educate students on the value and importance of cross-layer optimization
and holistic design thinking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
