The three principal investigators propose to conduct research into the
mathematical theory of control, stabilization, and optimization of infinite
dimensional systems - in particular, distributed parameter systems governed by
partial differential equations (PDE) and hereditary systems governed by
differential- delay (DDE) or more general functional -differential equations
(FDE). These investigations will concentrate on the problems of Hybrid Control
Systems in which an infinite dimensional system is linked or coupled to a
simpler system, usually a finite dimensional process controlled through ordinary
differential equations (ODE). These mathematical questions are motivated by a
multitude of control-theoretic problems of importance in current advanced
engineering projects (aerospace guidance, space platform and space station
control and stabilization), as well as in industrial engineering projects (tape
processing). In this sense the investigators recognize the two-way interaction
between classical mathematical analysis, and physical and engineering sciences;
but this research project will concentrate on the mathematical side, although
the research will necessarily be motivated by the areas of applications.
