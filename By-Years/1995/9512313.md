A group of scientists from several academic disciplines will form a new
laboratory at the University of Maryland-College Park, to house and operate a
new laser facility of use to them all. The instrument will be a unique resource,
and will deliver a wide range of pulse energy, intensity, repetition rate, and
optical frequency to match the range of requirements of the investigators.
