9354094 Skidmore The continuing Committee on Women is Science and Engineering
(CWSE), within the Office of Scientific and Engineering Personnel of the
National Research Council, is comprised of expert scientists and engineers who
are particularly knowledgeable about the underparticipation of women in the
technological work force of the United States. This project helps to fund
activities of the Committee to achieve greater representation of women in
science and engineering (S&amp;E) at undergraduate, graduate, postdoctoral, and
professional levels in the United States. CSWE is continuing and expanding the
multifaceted program of activities developed during the past three years to
address the unerrepresentation of women in S&amp;E careers. While recognition of
the barriers to participation in science and engineering by women, and of the
need for more comprehensive measures to spur the development of female
scientists and engineers, have been evident for some time, parity representation
of female scientists and engineers has not been achieved. CWSE is helping to
address this problem by: serving as a resource to collect and disseminate data
on the needs of and opportunities for women in science and engineering; exerting
its influence on the S&amp;E community, and society as a whole, working toward
the removal of barriers to the participation of women in the sciences and
engineering; encouraging interactions between concerned groups; and stimulating
development of innovative programs to increase the representation of women in
scientific and engineering careers. The Committee is setting an example in the
S&amp;E community, playing an effective role in revealing the status of and the
opportunities for women in these areas in society, as well as making
recommendations for policy and program changes that will enhance the
participation of women in S&amp;E careers. ***
