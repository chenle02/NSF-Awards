ABSTRACT EEC-9713003 ELSAYED Rutgers University Quality and reliability
engineering is an essential ingredient required to maintain the United States
manufacturing capacity effectiveness. Because of the importance of this area to
U.S. industry, a planning grant, EEC-9526413, was awarded to Rutgers University
and Arizona State University (including the Arizona State University) to explore
the forming of an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Quality
and Reliability Engineering. As a result of a planning meeting held in July
1996, sufficient industrial support has been generated to become an
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC). The Center's initial
research agenda will address: Improving Products that are Judged by Objective
Measurements and Consumer Panel Data; Optimal Design for Quality Using the Voice
of the Customer; System Reliability Prediction with Uncertainty in Component
Reliability Estimates; Integration of Bayesian and Physics of Failure Approaches
to Obtain Test Time Compression; A General Reliability Prediction Model for
Accelerated Life Testing; Accelerated Testing for Electronics Manufacturing;
Data Mining with Multivariate Statistical Tools; Equipment and Process
Characterization, Optimization, and Qualification; Multivariate Process
Monitoring and Control; Software Reliability and Development Process Models for
Automobile Systems; Process Capability Indices and Loss Function. This proposal
has been coordinated with Drs. Geogia-Ann Klutke and Lawrence Seiford, NSF
Program Directors for the Operations Research and Production Systems Program.
