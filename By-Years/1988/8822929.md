This proposal investigates the sources and dimensions of difficulty in decision
making. Just as risk management practices were advanced by an understanding of
the dimensions of risk, the proposal argues, so should decision management
practices be advanced by an understanding of the dimensions of perceived
difficulty. The proposed research effort seeks to understand the sources of
perceived difficulty by testing whether experts' and non.experts' intuitions
differ from analytic results in systematic ways, using physicians' analyses of
medical dilemmas as the primary data source. Specific strategies for reducing
the difficulty of decisions, such as improving the presentation of information
about temporal consequences and about differences in option sets, will be tested
in the context of real.world decisions typically faced by physicians and by
non.physicians. The ultimate goal of the project, which is to learn new ways to
make decisions less difficult, was considered to be important from both a
theoretical and applied perspective, and the principal investigators were
believed to have both the experience and the contacts necessary to design and to
conduct the proposed empirical research.
