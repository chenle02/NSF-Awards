The curriculum in civil engineering does not provide environmental laboratory
training as part of the introductory environmental engineering course. This
project is intended for development of a fully-equipped laboratory supported by
modern instructional methods. The lab instruments currently available include
devices for all major analyses except for elemental metal analyses. One flame
atomic absorption (AA) spectrophotometer is needed for major metal detection,
and a graphite furnace (AA) is requested for trace metal analyses. Two separate
machines, each computer controlled, will provide two new workstations. The lab
instructor will be supported by the use of interactive videodisc (IVD)
technology which has not been used previously in engineering labs. The IVD can
provide text, photos, and action video to illustrate standard lab procedures and
monitor student progress.
