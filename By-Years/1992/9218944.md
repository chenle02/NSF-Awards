This is an integrated petrological and geochemical study of the 630-650 m.y. old
Egersund dikes from SW Norway. The dikes are remarkably fresh, are relatively
unoxidized, and contain glass. They provide an outstanding opportunity to study
the high-pressure evolution (via fractionation and assimilation) of continental
basalts, and to study assimilation processes in detail. The proposed research,
involves acquisition of microprobe data for phenocryst, megacryst, xenocryst and
xenolith phases, whole-rock major (including Fe2O3 and FeO) and trace element
data for dikes, glasses, melt areas in xenoliths and whole xenoliths, and
limited isotopic (Sr, Nd, Pb) data for dikes and xenoliths. These data will be
used to model the evolution of the magmas, and place constraints on the mantle
source region using data from the least involved, uncontaminated dikes.
