*** Pirzada 9760415 This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
develop a cost-effective process to produce ultrafine powders of rare earth
magnetic materials. Rare earth materials have rapidly become the basis of
essential components for billion dollar industries and this market is predicted
to continue to grow rapidly. Existing processes for producing rare earth magnet
powders have inherent limitations that limit the powder size reduction beyond a
few microns while maintaining compositional purity, spherical shape, and
monodispersity. This in turn limits the maximum MGOe (million gauss oesteds) and
miniaturization currently achievable. During the Phase I project, the proposer
will establish the proof-of-concept of a process that may help launch powders
that are an order of magnitude finer than presently available. Future efforts
will seek to optimize the technology and produce prototypes from nanoscale
materials for customer qualification and commercialize the technology. Potential
commercial applications include miniaturized and higher energy product magnets
for the electronics, information, and telecommunications industries. Spin-off
applications will serve a wide range of industries using rare earth alloys. ***
