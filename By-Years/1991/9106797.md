The objectives of this research are (A) highly accurate calculations on small
systems for comparison with recent high precision measurements, and (B) the
development of better computational methods, where "better" means greater
accuracy and reliability with a smaller expenditure of computer time. Specific
problems to be considered include (1) The 1/Z expansion, (2) Bethe logarithms
and other matrix elements of functions of operators, (3) Hydrogen in strong
magnetic fields, (4) Basis functions for problems with multiple length scales,
(5) High precision calculations for lithium atoms, (6) Simplification of the
Fock expansions, and (7) A priori estimates of non-linear parameters in basis
functions.
