Dr. Katharine Covert, Department of Chemistry, West Virginia University,
Morgantown, West Virginia, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division and by the Experimental Program
to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) for studies of the synthesis of
antimony allyls and oxo-allyls. A class of antimony allyls with sterically
demanding alkoxides will be prepared. Oxidition and transfer studies of the
allyl fragments with molybdenum, tin, and vanadium will be performed. Dr.
Covert's group will also synthesize and resolve chiral antimony allyls, and they
will survey their reactivity in allyl transfer and oxidation reactions. The
education component of this project concentrates on large general chemistry
courses with a focus on student retention and development, and takes advantage
of the synergism between research and teaching. This project addresses the
synthesis of a series of antimony complexes containing both a reactive organic
fragment, known as an allyl, and a series of bulky substituents, known as
alkoxides. The combination of these bulky substituents with antimony provide the
opportunity to control the reactivity of the allyl fragment, and to understand
commercial processes which utilize antimony catalysts to perform the oxidation
of small organic molecules such as propene and propane. Fundamental studies of
the synthesis of these compounds and the oxidation and transfer of the allyl
fragments will be performed.
