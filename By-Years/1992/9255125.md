The University of the District of Columbia program expands the existing Science
and Engineering Center's pre-college program to include sixty seventh and eighth
grade minority students in a summer academic intervention commuter program.
Activities provide a non- traditional learning environment that allows for
participant acquisition of knowledge from hands-on mathematics, computer science
and electrical engineering instruction. Participants in this program will also
participate subsequently in the Physical Science Institute, a science program
for ninth through twelfth grade students.
