9303013 Grishman This is the second year of a collaborative project between
Monmouth College and New York University seeks to gather correspondences between
expressions in source and target parallel corpora in Japanese and English with
the objective of generalizing these correspondences to create rules for use in a
translation system. The performance of translation systems has been often
limited to a great extent by our ability to encode information about such
correspondences manually. In this project the texts in the source and target
languages are parsed and then syntactically regularized, producing regularized
parse trees. A tree-matching procedure aligns the corresponding trees from the
source and target texts, producing a set of detailed correspondences between
source and target structures. A set of sublanguage (semantic) word classes is
then defined and these correspondences are generalized to the extent possible
using these word classes; the result is a set of rules for the transfer phase of
a translation system. The approach uses corresponding programming language
manuals written in Japanese and English.
