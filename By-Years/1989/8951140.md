The junior year mechanical engineering curriculum is being revised to develop a
planned progression from the basics of modern instrumentation to sophisticated
use of the latest data acquisition and control equipment. This project is
expanding the electrical instrumentation course and integrating it with the
first-term mechanical engineering laboratory, fully instrumenting two major
pieces of equipment with modern instrumentation in the second-term mechanical
engineering laboratory, and implementing one equipment setup with
microprocessor-based control and data gathering for use in a culminating
experiment. This project is being matched by an amount equal to the award.
