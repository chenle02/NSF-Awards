The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project is to provide environmentally friendly, self-cleaning coating
technologies. Fluorinated materials, known as forever materials, have been
widely used due to their excellent self-cleaning properties, but the detrimental
environmental impacts resulting from these coatings motivate the introduction of
environmentally friendly solutions. This project plans to create a new
technology to enable environmentally-friendly coatings capable of adhering to a
myriad of substrates under any conditions, while offering high abrasion
resistance and exceptional weather resistance. The successful completion of the
project will set the stage for commercialization and adoption of this technology
for household and industrial products, automotive applications, sensors, solar
panels, and aerospace applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to validate pilot-scale
production feasibility, enhance the weatherability, and enable the
commercialization of fluorine-free, self-cleaning materials. Previous approaches
toward self-cleaning coatings have had several limitations such as reliance on
harmful fluorochemicals, high cost, poor scalability, poor optical properties,
and low weatherability. The proposed technology is developed via a unique
approach that enables higher performance, fluorine-free coatings (e.g.,
excellent mechanical properties, optical clarity, hydrophobicity, adhesion)
while preserving the ease of manufacturing processes at a lower cost. The key
objectives of this proposed project include: 1) pilot-scale production of the
coating to set the stage for commercialization; 2) extend the weatherability for
high-end applications such as those in the automotive and aerospace sectors; and
3) develop protocols for omniphobic additives for rapid implementation of the
technology into relevant applications. The anticipated results include
successful pilot-scale production tests, accomplishing the long-term
weatherability, and the successful synthesis of omniphobic additives with
desirable compositions and performance. The successful completion of the project
will set the stage for commercialization and adoption of this technology for
household and industrial products, automotive applications, sensors, solar
panels, and aerospace, to name a few.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
