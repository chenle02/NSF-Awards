The study consists of an analysis of patterns of distribution, diversity and
endemism in the terrestrial vertebrate fauna (amphibians, reptiles, birds, and
mammals) of humid montane forests in the state of Oaxaca in southern Mexico. Two
years will be spent exploring the four mountain ranges in the state that are
least well known faunistically: the Sierra de Miahuatlan, Sierra de Yucuyacua,
Sierra de Huautla, and various mountains in the Chimalapas region. Information
from other recent explorations, as well as historical records, will be added in
a geographic information system (GIS) data base. The GIS will allow analysis of
the faunistic data in relation to physical geographic features, economic
characteristics, and political limits. This study is a collaborative effort
between the Field Museum of Natural History and the Universidad Nacional
Autonoma de Mexico, and will result in the training of seven young Mexican
biologists in techniques for biological inventories, data management, specimen
curation, and analysis of conservation priorities.
