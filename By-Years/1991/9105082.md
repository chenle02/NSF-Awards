This award provides 50% funding for the acquisition of a computer system to be
installed and operated in the Institute for the Study of the Continents at
Cornell University. The University is committed to providing matching funds. The
equipment will consist of a high-performance workstation, high-resolution
plotter, and large capacity data storage. The Institute for the Study of the
Continents provides basic computer resources for geoscience research at Cornell.
Workstations are linked to the Cornell Supercomputer Center. The new system will
be used in this capacity in computing intensive projects of the Consortium for
Continental Reflection Profiling, the Andes Project, and the Global Basin
Research Network.
