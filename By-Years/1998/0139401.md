&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding to the University of Maryland-College
Park for the support of a five-year, REU Site " Research Internships in
Telecommunications Engineering-RITE Site," under the direction of Dr. Steven I.
Marcus. This eleven-week summer program will involve twenty-two students
annually in a diverse research experience on a wide range of topics in the field
of Telecommunications including communications systems and theory, networking,
signal processing, multimedia technology, information security, and neuromorphic
engineering. Each student will work in small groups (2-3 students) with faculty
members and graduate students. In addition to the fundamental aspects of
engineering disciplines, aspects of existing programs that combine engineering
and business perspectives will be incorporated into the RITE students'
experiences. The students will participate in industrial site visits and
interactions and will work closely with graduate research assistant mentors
throughout their summer research experience.&lt;br/&gt;
