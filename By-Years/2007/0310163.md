Title: Seeds of Success: A Comprehensive Program for the Retention, Quality
Training, and Advancement of STEM Students

Delaware State University

HRD 0310163

PI: William B. Delauder

Delaware State University (DSU) will implement comprehensive approaches to
strengthen the institution's undergraduate science, technology, engineering and
mathematics (STEM) education and research infrastructure. The University will
use NSF support to provide: (i) a Pre-Freshman Summer Program that will assist
students in the transition from high school to college and provide a solid
academic foundation for success in gatekeeper courses; (ii) faculty mentoring
that will initiate STEM students into a culture of learning; (iii) undergraduate
research opportunities at DSU, other universities, industry, and national
laboratories; (iv) curriculum reform and enhancement to emphasize investigative,
hands-on approaches in science and math courses and to encourage the development
of inter-disciplinary courses; (v) faculty development; (vi) development and
implementation of an electronic early warning system and expert advising system
to identify at-risk students in gatekeeper classes early in the semester; (vii)
modern instructional delivery systems in the classroom; and, (viii) a Science
Resource Center to provide peer tutor-mentoring, group study, workshops and
seminars, and bridging initiatives to address the transitions to graduate school
or to the STEM workforce.
