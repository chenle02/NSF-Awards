Cells maintain large differences in the concentration of ions (electrically
charged atoms or molecules) across the membrane that separates the cell from its
environment. This concentration difference is used to drive many essential
cellular processes and it is established and maintained by numerous membrane
pumps, which are proteins responsible for transporting these ions across the
membrane. This project will engage undergraduate students (including members of
minorities underrepresented in science) and graduate students in investigations
of the fundamental properties by which a particular membrane pump selects and
transports sodium and potassium ions across membranes. In addition to training
in biophysical techniques, the students will be supported to attend national
scientific meetings at which they will be able to present the results of their
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Na/K pump is electrogenic because it
transports 3 Na+ out of the cell in exchange for 2 K+, in each catalytic cycle.
One out of three sites can exclusively bind Na+ (a feature that distinguishes
the Na/K pump from other P-type ATPases). All P-type ATPases alternate between
two major conformations, E1 with inward facing ion binding sites and E2 with
outward facing ion binding sites. The molecular mechanisms of ion selectivity by
the Na/K pump remain unclear, yet knowledge of these is critical to an
understanding of how these proteins couple the chemical energy of ATP hydrolysis
to the mechanical work required for ion translocation. This project will study
the mechanisms of ion selection in the Na/K pump with an innovative approach
that integrates high-temporal-resolution electrophysiology, computational
chemistry and biochemistry. The available crystal structures and results from
our laboratory will be used to generate hypotheses with respect to (a)
Elucidating the mechanisms of ion selectivity in the two major pump
conformations; (b) Determining the order of intracellular Na+ binding and
external Na+ release; and (c) Identifying the pathway and mechanisms of
uncoupled H+ influx through Na/K pumps.
