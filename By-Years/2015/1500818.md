The structure of the eight-dimensional parameter space for gravitational waves
produced by binary black hole mergers is largely unknown. For each parameter
value, each solution is found from numerically solving Einstein's equations and
involves time intensive large-scale simulations. Hence, it is prohibitively
expensive to explore the parameter space with traditional methods, which
ultimately limits progress in gravitational waves physics and presents an
important scientific challenge for the experimental program at the Laser
Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). In this project, new
reduced-order modeling techniques will be developed for accurately representing
solutions of parameterized problems that are expensive to solve for numerically,
specifically in the context of gravitational waves from black hole binary
mergers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research project will enable
the scientific community to make significant progress in the ability to map the
continuum of gravitational waves from compact binary coalescence for
gravitational wave detection purposes. It is expected the methods developed in
this proposal will be useful for a broad range of other disciplines involving
parameterized problems and expensive large-scale numerical solutions. The
project involves significant contributions from two post-doctoral fellows, whose
future careers will benefit from performing creative research at the forefront
of an important scientific investigation.
