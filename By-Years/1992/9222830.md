A tightly coupled workstation cluster shall be developed as a powerful and cost
effective environment in which to conduct research on: * Fast algorithms for
equilibrium and diffusion problems. * Numerical methods for flows with multi-
scale structure. * Direct and inverse problems in wave scattering from random
media. * Fluid interface dynamics using parallelizable schemes. * Simulation of
realistic neural networks. Algorithms shall be ported to or developed on the
cluster and their performance in this environment will be examined.
