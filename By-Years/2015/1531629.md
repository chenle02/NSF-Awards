With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemistry
Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) programs, Florida State
University will acquire a transient absorption spectrometer. Transient
absorption (TA) spectroscopy is a powerful technique for monitoring the change
of absorbance of light by a sample (i. e., color) with respect to time after
excitation by a flash of light. While nanosecond transient absorption technique
is not new, its application to unexplored areas of research can yield important
results on the photophysical properties of molecules and materials. These
results will directly impact applications such as solar energy conversion,
photodynamic therapy, photocatalysis, solid-state lighting, and metal ion
sensing. The user-friendly nature of the proposed instrument will improve the
scholarship, education and training of students at all levels. The TA
spectrometer will be open to all academic institutions in the region, including
minority-serving institutions, and women?s colleges as well as industrial
partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is aimed at enhancing research
especially in areas such as (a) studying photophysical properties of molecules
and materials; (b) providing insight into electron/energy transfer; (c)
investigating excited state quenching; (d) studying photochemical reactions; and
(e) investigating excition diffusion and charge separation.
