9458060 Ade X-ray microscopy studies with chemical and orientational sensitivity
will be performed on a range of polymer samples important to industry. These
include, but are not limited to, methylene-diphenyl-diisocyanate and tuluene-
diisocyanate based polyurethane foams (Dow Chemical), various fibers such as
Kevlar and Nylon (DuPont), as well as polyimide thin films (DuPont). We propose
improvements in spatial resolution towards 10 nm and the addition of Auger,
secondary yield and fluorescent yield detection modes of absorption
spectromicroscopy. %%% ***
