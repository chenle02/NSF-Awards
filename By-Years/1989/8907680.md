Theoretical research in elementary particle physics and astrophysics will
investigate versions of superstring theory in which the cosmological constant
vanishes even though the world predicted by these versions is, as observed, not
supersymmetric. Superstring theory is a promising attempt to unify our
understanding of all the forces of nature. The cosmological constant, a quantity
which could in general occur in the equations which describe the expansion of
the universe, is observed to be at most very tiny. This fact has proved very
difficult to understand, and the work to be done here is an attempt to help
solve the puzzle.
