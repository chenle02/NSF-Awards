This award provides partial support for an interdisciplinary conference on
Reasoning About Knowledge. Reasoning about knowledge, which has long been of
great interest to philosophers, has recently been recognized to be of importance
to many other fields, including artificial intelligence, cryptography,
distributed systems, economics, and linguistics. The conference will be held at
Asilomar (Pacific Grove, California) on March 7-9, 1988. As the first meeting,
the participants from several different disciplines will present recent
developments in contributed papers and invited papers. The importance of this
conference is its interdisciplinary scope and the contribution it makes to
building a theoretical base for a wide variety of research in artificial
intelligence and knowledge based systems.
