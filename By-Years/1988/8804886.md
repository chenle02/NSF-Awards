Through this REU Program undergraduate students will be involved with research
in biophysical systems, specifically the applications of fundamentals to improve
the methods of producing and processing food and agricultural products takes
into account the responsible use of natural resources. A comprehensive procedure
to identify and recruit potential students and a program to provide a worthwhile
research experience that clearly meets the goals of the REU Program is
described. It is the intent of the faculty to have the students progress from a
dependent status to one where the students are capable of planning and
conducting research. Example projects include biological signal processing,
non.destructive contact measurements, and water quality control using spatial
and spectral information. There is a definite focus on the student in this
program.
