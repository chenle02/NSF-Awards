The three-day "Locomotion Systems Science Workshop" to be held in May, in
Arlington, VA, co-funded by NSF and ARO, will include a diversity of thinkers in
biology, physics, engineering, chemistry, computer science, and mathematics, for
the purpose of asking an actionable version of the question: why do animals move
better than machines in typical terrestrial environments? One of the themes will
be devoted to the question: how do living locomotion systems emerge from
nonliving components and is there a "locomotion systems science" that can
describe such emergence? The meeting will include a series of sessions that mix
different modes of problem formulation and categories of problem. The
participants will discuss: 1) Fundamental limits-- attempting to pin down how
close to a limit evolution has selected an animal's operating point, and why,
can help illuminate the analogous engineering tradeoffs between reductive focus
on optimality of components and integrative emphasis on modularity achieved
through better coordination of existing parts. 2) Multi-scale models-- compare
and assess formalisms for multiple scale modeling and analysis. 3) Comparative
Methods -- compare and interrelate traditional methods of inquiry in disciplines
like biology, physics, mathematics, computer science. These will be focused on
themes including Systems, Environment, Power and Information. The meeting with
have an impact on our ability to develop efficient machines that use the basic
motion principles that animals use.
