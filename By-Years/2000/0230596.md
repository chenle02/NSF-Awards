OIA-0230596&lt;br/&gt;McBay&lt;br/&gt;QEM&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quality Education
for Minorities (QEM) Network, a non-profit organization, has been instrumental
in improving the education of under-represented groups that have been
historically undeserved by the nation's educational system. A successor to the
Quality Education for Minorities Project based at MIT, QEM continues to develop
effective strategies of STEM education for minorities, and focuses on issues and
barriers that prevent minorities for receiving a high quality education.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award to QEM will provide technical assistance to
junior faculty at minority-serving institutions and eligible underrepresented
minority faculty at other institutions to enable them to participate more
successfully in the NSF's Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program.
Minority faculty play a significant role in the production of minority
baccalaureate degree recipients in STEM disciplines as well as in the
disproportionate production of minority college graduates who pursue graduate
degrees. Consequently there will be the broadening of participation and enhanced
diversity within the Foundation's programs as it relates to the strategic goal
of People, Tools, and Ideas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
