Due to its many successes in science and applications, superconducting radio-
frequency (SRF) has become an enabling technology for the accelerator-based
sciences such as particle physics, nuclear physics and the materials sciences.
Nevertheless, there remain technical and scientific challenges to the full
realization of the potential of this technology. This award to Cornell will
provide support for the study of in situ plasma cleaning of SRF cavities as an
effective method to recover and/or improve the medium field Q0 of cavities and
to systematically study how thermal cycling of a cavity increases its intrinsic
quality factor. The group will use temperature mapping systems and existing
single and 9-cell cavities for these studies. Broader impacts of the program are
extensive, including impacts across accelerator and materials sciences and
student research at the graduate level.
