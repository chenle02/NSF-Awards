The objective of this research is the development of turbulence approximations
which provide upper and lower bounds on quantities of physical interest. This
work is in the spirit of the bounding theory of Howard and Busse but proceeds
from a decimation scheme in which only a subset of the modes of the flow system
are treated explicitly. The remaining, implicit modes are represented by
stochastic forcing terms which are subject to an in infinite set of moment
constraints taken from the exact dynamics. To find bounds, it is proposed to
seek solutions which extremalize the chosen quantities under a restricted subset
of these constraints, imposed together with realizability inequalities. Since
the constraints are exact, bounds so constructed would be rigorous. Fourth.order
statistics play an essential role in the development of bounds. These statistics
are additionally important because of recent Navier.Stokes simulation studies
which show interesting behavior of mean.square helicity and the mean square of
the total nonlinear term. It is proposed to study 4th.order statistics by the
decimation scheme. The complexity of the work can be reduced by using integral
rather than detailed forms of 4th.order moment constraints.
