9600194 Hartenstein The studies proposed here are focused on the so-called early
genes which are important for the development of the adult and larval visual
system in Drosophila. This system provides an excellent preparation with which
to analyze the action of genes in the developing nervous system. The genes in
question have been cloned and their molecular characterization has been
completed. The particular focus is the role of the sine oculis, eyes absent, and
eyeless genes. Homologs of some of the genes occur in vertebrates and so appear
to have fundamental roles in the development of diverse eyes. The results of the
proposed experiments will shed light on the genetic mechanism which controls the
determination step in which the embryonic progenitor cell adopts a particular
developmental fate, and which orchestrates the progenitor cell?s transition from
an early proliferative phase to the phase of differentiation..
