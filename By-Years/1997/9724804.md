9724804 Wong This U.S.-Brazil award will support a research collaboration
between Dr. Peter N. Wong of Bates College to work with Professor Daciberg Lima
Goncalves at the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics of the University of
Sao Paulo. Their research is on Nielsen coincidence theory on homogeneous
spaces. This collaboration will unite five Nielsen theorists. In addition to
Drs. Wong and Goncalves, the project will include Drs. Lucila Borsari, Pedro
Fagundes and Fernanda Cardona of the University of Sao Paolo. The goal of this
research is to explore different computable algebraic means for computing the
Nielsen coincidence number. They propose to find algebraic conditions under
which the Nielsen coincidence number and the Reidemeister coincidence number
agree. ***
