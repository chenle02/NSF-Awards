9308666 Ferrand This is an award to support research, the objective of which is
to develop effective approaches to accommodating the influence that natural
heterogeneity of soils has on the movement of non-aqueous phase liquids through
them. The investigator plans on conducting her experiments in relatively large-
scale, laboratory soil flumes packed with heterogeneous soils. Fluid saturations
and pressures will be monitored and recorded by time-domain reflectometry and
tensiometer/transducer systems to establish spatially-averaged steady-state and
transient relationships of the fluids moving through the soils. Coarse-grid
simulations of the experiment will be performed to determine the best way in
which these relationships can be used to accurately predict fluid displacements.
The proposal leading to this award was submitted in response to NSF 92-122,
Research Initiation Awards Program Announcement and Guidelines. Results are
expected to improve models used in engineering design of remediation processes
and systems for decontamination of contaminated soils.
