What is the political impact of economic reform in contemporary Latin America?
Have new, market-oriented, government policies triggered new patterns of
political organization? This research investigates the impact of three major
policy reforms in contemporary Peru: taxation, social security pension
privatization and targeted poverty alleviation. Each of these areas of public
policy switched from state-centered to market-oriented mechanisms in the 1990s.
Theoretical work in the field of public policy suggests that the political
consequences of economic reform varies significantly across policy areas and is
directly related to the distribution of costs and benefits to the public. This
research has three important implications for the study of market-oriented
reforms. First, it sheds light on the long-term viability of such reforms.
Second, it provides insight into the growth and maintenance of new interest
groups. Finally, this research enhances our general understanding of state-
society interactions in Latin America.
