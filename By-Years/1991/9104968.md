Luteinizing hormone (LH) is produced by the anterior pituitary gland and acts
to stimulate steroid production by the gonads of both males and females. Among
the hormones known to exist, LH has one of the more complex chemical structures
because it contains two dissimilar peptide chains and because each of these
peptide chains has attached sugars. During the synthesis of this hormone, some
of the sugar portions of the molecules are altered giving them different amounts
of molecular charge. Thus, rather than existing as a single molecular entity,
luteinizing hormone exists as a family of closely related molecular forms.
Previous research has demonstrated that the distribution of LH among these
identifiable molecular forms can be changed by hypothalamic and gonadal hormones
which act at the anterior pituitary gland to regulate the secretion of
luteinizing hormone. Research to be performed will address the major question:
"Does the fact that luteinizing hormone exists as a family of identifiable
molecular components play a significant role in regulating the reproductive
processes of animals?" In order to answer this question, sheep will be used as
the experimental model because they have relatively large pituitry glands from
which these distinct molecular forms can be purified. Once these are purified,
their chemical structures will be obtained. In addition, the biological
functions of selected molecular forms of luteinizing hormone will be examined by
determining their ability to survive into circulation,by examining their ability
to stimulate gonadal target cells in vitro and by examining their ability to
stimulate gonadal target cells in intact animals. This research should reveal
whether the subtle changes which occur in the molecular structure of ovine LH
play a significant and meaningful role in the regulation of reproductive
function.//
