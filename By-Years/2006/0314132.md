The University of New Mexico, in collaboration with the National Park Service
(NPS) and the Grand Canyon National Park (GCNP), will plan the "Trail of Time,"
a signed and scaled walking trail with exhibits that interpret the geologic
history of the Grand Canyon. Scaled so that one meter equals one million years
of earth history, the "Trail" will engage visitors in learning about deep time
and how geologic history is recorded in the rock record. The planning activity
will involve defining specific learning goals based on visitor studies and work
with the NPS Interpretation Division. The "Trail" will help 5,000,000 annual
visitors to the Canyon learn about the scale of geologic time, the local geology
of the Canyon and the process of science.
