A group is an algebraic structure capturing the abstract properties of the
collection of symmetries of a geometric object or of a physical or mechanical
system. The project will concentrate on the study of free-by-cyclic groups.
These groups are natural counterparts of the fundamental groups of fibered
3-manifolds, which are important mathematical objects playing key roles in
Topology, Differential Geometry, Ergodic Theory, Number Theory, Computational
Complexity, and other branches of Mathematics. Compared with the 3-manifold
groups, the free-by-cyclic groups are much less well understood, even though
they exhibit a considerably wider variety of interesting features and behavior.
The project aims to study the geometry and dynamics of free-by-cyclic groups,
particularly through exploring new polynomial invariants of these groups. This
research should help better understand both the differences and the similarities
between the free-by-cyclic groups and their 3-manifold "cousins", and lead to
new insights about the interactions of algebra and dynamics in group theory.

The project will build on the new work of the proposer, joint with Leininger and
Dowdall, studying the properties of free-by-cyclic groups by means of a "folded
mapping torus", associated to such a group. The folded mapping torus comes
equipped with a natural semi-flow of continuous transformations, and it encodes
in a particularly useful and accessible form key algebraic, geometric and
dynamical information about the group. Another key object, associated to the
folded mapping torus, is the "McMullen polynomial", which is a free-by-cyclic
analog of the Teichmuller polynomial for fibered 3-manifolds. The main overall
research goal of the project is to understand algebraic, geometric and dynamical
features related to the many possible ways in which a free-by-cyclic group G can
split as a free-by-cyclic group and as an ascending HNN-extension of a free
group, and to gain new knowledge about free group automorphisms. Specific
problems to be studied include: understanding the relationship between the "cone
of sections" of folded mapping torus with the BNS-invariant of the group,
uniformizing the stable trees and the Cannon-Thurston maps associated with
different splittings of G, studying irreducibility properties of monodromy
automorphisms associated to different free-by-cyclic splittings of G, developing
an analog of the homological zeta-function for G, and others.
