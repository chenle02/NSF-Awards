Dr. Kannappan is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral
Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at the University of
Texas. Despite the success of hierarchical theories of galaxy formation,
fundamental gaps remain in our understanding of disk formation, the bulge-disk
connection, and the process of mass assembly. Dr. Kannappan will carry out a
program of observational research in three areas: (1) direct detection of late-
epoch bulge growth and galactic black hole growth, aimed at testing the
hypothesis of co-evolution (2) direct detection of gas and stellar disk
formation for a broad sample of nearby disk galaxies, and (3) analysis of
dynamical scaling relations for galaxies at low and high redshift to study star
formation histories, dark and baryonic matter distributions, and the evolution
of the velocity function of galaxy halos.

Dr. Kannappan will also manage a three-part education & outreach program in
which she will: (1) create new galaxy-themed activities to meet the astronomy
requirement in the Texas state science standards and visit local schools to test
these activities, (2) write a "Science in Action" article series for StarDate
magazine, and (3) design and mentor a student research project.
