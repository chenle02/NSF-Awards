Horizontal or lateral gene transfer (HGT) denotes the exchange of genetic
information between organisms as opposed to vertical inheritance, i.e. the
passing of genes from parent to daughter cells. This project will study the
relative contributions of HGT and vertical inheritance to microbial evolution.
First, the extent of intra-gene mosaicism will be explored. Individual genes can
be mosaic as a result of recombination. Preliminary data indicate that in the
case of ribosomal RNA intra-gene mosaicism might not be a rare event.
Statistical tests will be developed to assess how frequently intra-gene
mosaicism occurred during microbial evolution. These tests will utilize
simulated sequence evolution incorporating different models with varying amounts
of HGT and recombination. Second, genome evolution will be simulated to address
the following question: Are the confidently detected instances of HGT the tip of
an iceberg, the bulk of which remains below the detection limit? Or are many of
the alleged transfer events artifacts due to compositional bias, convergent
evolution and unrecognized gene duplications? The simulations will include
different frequencies of recombination and will utilize different models to
simulate sequence evolution. Simulations that take the detection levels for
horizontal gene transfer and intra-gene mosaicism into consideration will move
the study of horizontal gene transfer beyond a compilation of anecdotal
evidence. Third, a relaxed molecular clock model will be used to analyze the
early evolution of prokaryotic life. Time estimates and their credibility
intervals will be obtained for individual gene families. Dates for key
evolutionary events estimated from compatible datasets will be combined to
achieve more accurate divergence time estimates
