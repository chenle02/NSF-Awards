Topological recursion is a recent development in geometry that assigns an
infinite family of quantities (called correlation functions) to a spectral
curve. Although it plays an important role in many branches of mathematics, such
as enumerative geometry, Gromov-Witten theory, and random matrix theory, it is
still a poorly understood phenomenon. The goal of the proposed project is to
establish a general mathematical framework underlying topological recursion.
This structure is expressed through the newly introduced concepts of a
topological recursion (TR) operad and TR co-operad, and allows one to understand
the types of enumerative and geometric problems where Eynard-Orantin theory
appears, a precise mechanism to calculate the spectral curve of such a problem,
and, conversely, a concrete geometric or enumerative problem associated to an
arbitrary spectral curve. To be specific, the combinatorial structure of Eynard-
Orantin recursion is easily seen to be modeled on a TR operad, while in many
specific examples where Eynard-Orantin recursion appears, such as intersection
numbers of moduli spaces of stable curves, Hurwitz theory, Kontsevich's matrix
integral, etc., there is a naturally appearing TR co-operad. In general, the
Laplace transform of a TR operad is conjectured to determine the spectral curve.
On the other hand, a variation of the Feynman transform (which appears in
modular operads), takes a TR operad to a TR co-operad in the category of
topological spaces, which comes equipped with a natural measure. The volume of
the TR co-operad is conjectured to determine the Eynard-Orantin correlation
functions which underlie the original TRoperad.

Successful completion of the project would go a long way to understanding the
role and nature of topological recursion in general, and would provide several
useful applications in enumerative geometry and Gromov-Witten theory. The area
being investigated is the moduli space of Riemann surfaces, and related spaces.
Such constructions arise in high energy physics and are crucial in our
understanding of mirror symmetry, and more generally string theory. However,
potential applications are not limited to theoretical physics. Because of the
ubiquity of surfaces in everyday life, there are a surprising number of concrete
applications for such an abstract subject. For example, ribbon graphs, one of
the fundamental tools used to explore topological recursion, can be utilized in
facial recognition algorithms. In addition, they appear in Feynman graph
expansions, which are used to model particle collisions.
