This project will further explore the plasma emission phenomenon. Central to
many radio emission phenomena within the heliosphere and beyond, the study will
benefit many other related processes, including type II and type III bursts from
the sun and interplanetary space, radiation at the Earth's bow shock, and the
radio emission from the boundary region between our heliosphere and the
surrounding interstellar medium. Topics related to the PI's theory that will
also be studied are: (1) effects of ambient magnetic field on the polarization
of the radiation; (2) propagation and scattering of the radiation in
interplanetary space; (3) quantitative modeling of the nonlinear mode conversion
process of electrostatic to transverse wave; (4) particle-in-cell (PIC)
simulation of the nonlinear beam instability; (5) self-consistent modeling of
the nonlinear mode conversion process; (6) formulation and solution of nonlinear
wave-particle kinetic equation; (7) simulation of electron energization at the
collisionless shock; and (8) radiation by the energized electrons at the
collisionless shock.
