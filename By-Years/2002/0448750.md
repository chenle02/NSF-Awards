ABSTRACT for CAREER proposal DMS-0448750: Rational points on varieties and non-
abelian Galois groups

Principal investigator: Jordan S. Ellenberg

Institution: University of Wisconsin

The investigator proposes to address an ensemble of problems in arithmetic
geometry, centered on the problem of describing the distribution of rational
points on varieties over number fields. The study of rational points is, on the
one hand, passed down to us from the very beginning of number theory; on the
other hand, the present state of the art in this extremely active area involves
ideas from a wide variety of subjects, including etale cohomology, methods of
analytic number theory, and the complex algebraic geometry of moduli spaces of
morphisms. In the first project, the investigator and his colleagues will
continue their investigation of well-known conjectures on distribution of
rational points and distribution of discriminants of number fields. In the
second project, the investigator will study the arithmetic of towers of curves;
rational points in such towers seem to be intimately related with objects of
non-abelian Iwasawa theory, a subject which has enjoyed an explosion of interest
in the last five years. The proposed projects will involve a great deal of
collaboration with researchers from every part of number theory and algebraic
geometry, and should provide many opportunities for graduate students and
postdoctoral fellows.

The foundational problem of number theory is this: find all solutions in
rational numbers to an equation. For instance, one can ask for solutions of the
Pythagorean equation: for which rational numbers x,y, and z is it the case that
the square of x plus the square of y equals the square of z? The Pythagorean
equation has been well-understood for centuries; but many others, like Fermat's
equation, present -- to say the least! -- more serious difficulties, and most
equations are presently beyond our current ability to analyze. In recent years,
the subject of "rational points", or the analysis of solutions of equations, has
been taking shape as a subject of its own, drawing ideas and techniques from
many different parts of mathematics. The investigator proposes several research
projects in the area of rational points. Because this area of research combines
classical, easy-to-state problems with advanced methods and opportunities for
experimentation, it is very well-suited for fledgling mathematicians. The
investigator will launch a research program for students at Madison Memorial
High School, and will expand the scope of the Wisconsin Talent Search; the aim
will be to develop in Wisconsin an infrastructure for mathematical exploration,
enrichment and research in secondary school, which will have enough momentum to
continue beyond the duration of the present award.
