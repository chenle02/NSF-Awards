This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) at the National Science
Foundation supports the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at
Florida international University. The REU Program will bring 9 students to
campus for 10 weeks each summer to conduct research in a supportive research
environment. These students will pursue team-oriented summer projects in the
interdisciplinary field of sensing, participate in seminars and workshops,
present their work within and outside their scientific teams in widely-attended
venues at the FIU campus, and be encouraged to pursue a career in research and
discovery. Within the interdisciplinary area of sensing, the students will
participate in representative projects across analytical/environmental,
biological, inorganic, organic, physical/theoretical, and forensic chemistry.
Emphasis will be placed both on rigorous scientific training and the immersion
of students in an environment connecting scientific research with the real
world. The REU Site will provide faculty and peer mentorship and promote student
involvement in graduate student life. As part of the proposed activities,
participating faculty will give presentations on ethics and bioethics in
science, major scientific breakthroughs, and the role of scientists in modern
society. Student selection will focus on minorities and women nationwide, with
an emphasis on students from small colleges in Florida who have limited access
to research. through faculty and peer mentorship, and their involvement in
