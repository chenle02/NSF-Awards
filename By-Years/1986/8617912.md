The purpose of this activity is to review how basic knowledge developed in the
National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) has been and is being
applied. Three regional workshops will be organized to bring together
researchers who have been funded by the National Science Foundation and U.S.
Geological Survey, and policy makers of the region. They will evaluate the ways
that knowledge production and knowledge applications in the region have evolved
since the enactment of the 1977 National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act. The
goals are to learn from past experiences and to identify research and
applications agendas for the future. Incorporation of these agendas into NSF and
USGS programs will accelerate progress in mitigating potential losses from
future earthquakes in all earthquake-prone regions of the U.S. The investigator
is qualified to carry out this project. He has successfully coordinated similar
activities during the past several years.
