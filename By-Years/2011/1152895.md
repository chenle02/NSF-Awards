This project will address the "frontier problem-solving" aspect missing in
interdisciplinary research, and create a model of a course where experts from
several disciplines collaborate on a complex project, particularly a field
project. Today's science is increasingly an interdisciplinary endeavor, with
researchers from several disciplines collaborating on a project. Yes, current
graduate (and undergraduate) education is discipline-centered, with few
opportunities for team projects, especially from outside the field. As a result,
students are unprepared for the realities of cutting edge research. This problem
is starting to be addressed by many institutions in a variety of ways. This work
will design a highly integrated interdisciplinary field course, centered around
computational and field biology research. The proposed course will be offered by
the University of Illinois - Chicago, Princeton, and University of Nairobi where
graduate students in biology (primarily ecology and evolutionary biology) and
engineering (primarily in computer science and bioinformatics) work with faculty
in both disciplines to learn how to ask questions, frame hypotheses and
understand how and why the disciplines and cultures do this differently.
Fieldwork will be conducted in Kenya.
