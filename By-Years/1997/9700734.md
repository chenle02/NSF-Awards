9700734 Gopnik The National Academy of Sciences, through the Ocean Studies
Board (OSB) of the Commission on Geosciences, Environment, and Resources will
continue providing guidance on major ocean science and policy issues to the
National Science Foundation and other government agencies. The Ocean Studies
Board monitors the status and needs of ocean science community and assists NSF
in developing and maintaining strong programs of ocean research responsive to
scientific opportunities and national interests. OSB will: 1) contribute to the
advancement of scientific understanding of the ocean by maintaining continuous
oversight of the health of ocean sciences and stimulating their progress; 2)
foster the application of scientific knowledge to the use of the ocean and its
resources; 3)provide leadership for the formulation of national and
international marine policy and to clarify scientific issues that affect ocean
policy; and 4)address scientific issues involved in cooperative international
oceanographic research, and to improve technical assistance. Several other
agencies also contribute to these activities and provide support for focused
studies undertaken by the OSB.
