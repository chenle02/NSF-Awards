Bio-composites from Engineered Natural Fibers &lt;br/&gt;for Housing Panel
Applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;L. T. Drzal and A. K.
Mohanty&lt;br/&gt;Composite Materials and Structures Center &lt;br/&gt;Michigan
State University, MI 48824&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will have as its
objective, the development of natural fiber (bio-based) composites for housing
panel applications as an environmentally friendly alternative to contemporary
synthetic glass fiber - polyester composite materials. Research under this
project will investigate the utility of combining surface treated bast fibers
(e.g., kenaf, hemp) with leaf fibers (e.g. pineapple leaf) in order to
synergistically obtain the desired mechanical properties of strength, stiffness
and toughness. The bast fiber bio-composites alone show high flexural/tensile
properties while the leaf fiber based bio-composites alone show the best impact
properties. The agricultural origin of the biofibers will create a new value-
added use for pineapple leaf, at present a waste/underutilized product. This
project will be executed through effective collaboration of University (MSU), a
housing panel manufacturing company (Kemlite), and a natural fiber company
(Flaxcraft) in order to understand the changing demand and requirements of
paneling systems by industry so that the use of bio-composites is maximized. The
fundamental knowledge of the relevant structure-processing-property
relationships gained will be the basis for the commercialization of
biocomposites into the housing market. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
