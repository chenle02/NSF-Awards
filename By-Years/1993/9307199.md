This is a Planning Grant in the Research Opportunities for Women program. It
supports a one-year planning effort for research in three-dimensional methods
for brain tumor volume detection in cross-sectional medical imagery and in
particular, x-ray computed tomography and magnetic resonance images. The
planning effort will address problem formulation and image data collection,
knowledge collection and representation, and feasibility studies of 3-D
segmentation techniques. The ultimate objective of the research being planned is
to automate the detection of brain tumor volume.
