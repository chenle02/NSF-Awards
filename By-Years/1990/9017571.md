This award provides support to the National Materials Advisory Board (NMAB) to
convene a committee to identify fundamental research in materials in order to
provide the basis for new materials in the 21st Century. The committee will
organize a workshop of some 25 to 30 individuals to access the many disciplines
incorporated in materials science and engineering. The emphasis will be on
postulating innovative approaches to new materials based on fundamental
parameters governing the behavior of materials and on changes in processing
parameters now taking place. The workshop will be structured to allow for
maximum exchange of ideas and discussion in a free form mode, and the committee
will draw their conclusions and base their recommendations on the discussions.
The study will be coordinated with the Solid State Sciences Committee of the
Board on Physics and Astronomy.
