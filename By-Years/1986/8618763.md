It has become clear that all, or nearly all, present day star formation takes
place in molecular clouds, and the process of star formation is being vigorously
investigated on many fronts. In the fundamental stellar cycle -- molecular cloud
- star formation - stellar structure - stellar evolution - mass ejection -
molecular cloud formation -- it is probably the formation and the evolution of
molecular clouds which is the least well understood. Furthermore, because the
problem of star formation on a global scale has been reduced largely to the
questions of how, when, where, and why molecular clouds form, an understanding
of the formation and evolution of molecular clouds will provide an important key
to understanding the optical appearance of spiral, irregular, and in some cases,
peculiar galaxies. Dr. Blitz, at the University of Maryland, will continue a
very highly regarded research program to better understand the structure and
evolution of molecular clouds. A large number of observations will be undertaken
using radio astronomical techniques, primarily in the millimeter portion of the
spectrum, to probe the full range of known molecular clouds, from the recently
discovered high latitude clouds to the giant star forming clouds. The radiation
from various molecules will be observed with most emphasis on the carbon
monoxide molecule because of its usefulness as an indirect tracer of the
dominant species, molecular hydrogen. The data will be combined with optical and
infrared observations, as well as with observations of the atomic hydrogen gas
to obtain as complete a picture as possible of the progenitors of star formation
in our Galaxy and in other galaxies. An equally valuable aspect of Dr. Blitz'
program is his direct involvement of undergraduate students at the University of
Maryland in the research effort.
