The focus of this project is the development of an undergraduate honors program
in parallel processing. The principles of parallel processing and the
engineering of parallel programming cannot be taught in a single course. Nor can
they be mastered in a small number of laboratory exercises. The proposed honors
program will address these needs by requiring a carefully planned introduction
to the underlying principles, techniques and mechanisms, including architecture,
operating systems, algorithms, compilers, and concurrent programming languages.
A Sequent Symmetry system is to be acquired for the development and
implementation of the honors program. Parallel computing will play a major role
in scientific computing in the future. It is imperative that undergraduates
begin to be trained in this important discipline now.
