ASPIRE is an NSF-funded project that will examine the ecology of the Amundsen
Sea during the Austral summer of 2010. ASPIRE includes an international team of
trace metal and carbon chemists, phytoplankton physiologists, microbial and
zooplankton ecologists, and physical oceanographers, that will investigate why
and how the Amundsen Sea Polynya is so much more productive than other polynyas
and whether interannual variability can provide insight to climate-sensitive
mechanisms driving carbon fluxes. This project will compliment the existing
ASPIRE effort by using 1) experimental manipulations to understand
photoacclimation of the dominant phytoplankton taxa under conditions of varying
light and trace metal abundance, 2) nutrient addition bioassays to determine the
importance of trace metal versus nitrogen limitation of phytoplankton growth,
and 3) a numerical ecosystem model to understand the importance of differences
in mixing regime, flow field, and Fe sources in controlling phytoplankton bloom
dynamics and community composition in this unusually productive polynya system.
The research strategy will integrate satellite remote sensing, field-based
experimental manipulations, and numerical modeling. Outreach and education
include participation in Stanford's Summer Program for Professional Development
for Science Teachers, Stanford's School of Earth Sciences high school internship
program, and development of curriculum for local science training centers,
including the Chabot Space and Science Center. Undergraduate participation and
training will include support for both graduate students and undergraduate
assistants.
