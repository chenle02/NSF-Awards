The tremendous diversity of life on the planet is mirrored by the diversity of
web-based information about species. This information is often difficult to find
and unfriendly to use. Web pages that are useful to scientists are often
inaccessible to schoolchildren, and education pages usually hold no research
interest. Unlike the parts in a well-stocked building supply warehouse, the
databases and web pages about organisms are difficult to locate and combine into
coherent structure.

This project uses a component architecture to integrate biodiversity web
information seamlessly. It introduces building blocks to locate the origin and
authority of a species name, to extract maps for species distribution, and
provides nuts and bolts by which unrelated databases and web site can be made to
cooperate. This is achieved through using XML, the eXtensible Markup Language
that has been used in solving comparable problem in other parts of the web. The
project develops XML gateways to make flexible the data sources not able to
produce XML and provides multiple views on the same data. This accommodates
different purposes, educational background and ages, for example.

To illustrate its broad utility, the framework will be provided to a group of
school teachers working with biology undergraduates and graduate students to
produce a web-accessible field guide to the habitats of Columbia Point, Boston,
together with curricular material for classroom use.
