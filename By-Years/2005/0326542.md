The goal of this project is to develop tools for the creation of realistic
virtual cityscapes. Cities are immense and extremely difficult to model
manually, and previous efforts have not captured the historical and cultural
diversity of the real world. The investigators, from the disciplines of computer
science, learning sciences and architecture, are working in four complementary
streams: first, modeling urban land development and usage with agent-based
simulation; second, generating buildings to populate the urban landscape using
techniques based on grammars, optimization, and genetics; third, extending an
investigator's existing simulation toolset, NetLogo, enabling simulation on the
required scales; and fourth, collaborating closely with architects and urban
planners, both as research advisors and as users of the tools in architectural
curriculum and practice.&lt;br/&gt;These tools will meet an increasing demand
for simulation and graphical realism in the natural and social sciences as well
as in the entertainment, simulation, and military industries. According to a
recent National Research Council report, low-cost, easy-to-use hardware and
software tools for creating simulated environments [are] a critical need for
entertainment and defense applications. The tools and results will also be of
great interest to the architectural and urban planning communities, who will use
them to study the adequacy of current architectural and design
theory.&lt;br/&gt;
