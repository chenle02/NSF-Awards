In any long term relationship between economic decision-makers, the nature of
available information is critical for successful cooperation. The PI will study
an information structure called endogenous costly monitoring using techniques
drawn from game theory. The distinguishing characteristic of endogenous costly
monitoring is that each person has the opportunity to directly observe the
actions of others -- at a cost. Examples include collusive industries; each firm
in the industry might hire secret shoppers and other researchers to directly
observe the prices charged by other firms.

The PI is a young investigator. He and his co-author have already analyzed a
basic model and found a class of approximately efficient equilibriua with
interesting properties. This award will fund the PIs work to extend and apply
this basic framework to three richer models. The first is a multi-task
partnership game that is designed to consider some problems that appear in
managing joint projects. The second is an application to price-cutting in
collusive industries. The third is random task auditing, a management technique
that calls for one participant to to observe a randomly chose set of the
decisions made by other participants.
