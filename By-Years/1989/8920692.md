The role of the computer in the search for new exceptional combinatorial
configurations, as well as in the proofs of their nonexistence, has been
increasing over the last few years. It is now an indispensable tool in research
in this area. There have been many attempts to build appropriate software in
this direction worldwide, but none with the range of specific goals proposed
here. The four areas of interest are: balance designs, Ramsey graphs,
perpendicular arrays and set coverings systems. Previous research in these areas
repeatedly called for similar algorithms, which were implemented in an ad hoc
manner, depending on the particular situation. There were even variations of the
same algorithm within the same area. A principal goal of this one year project
is to refine, streamline and package the existing algorithms, using agreed upon
uniform data structures. With these algorithms one can devote more attention on
the theoretical properties of the set systems rather than on programming.
Particular attention will also be focused on finding some new important
configuations.
