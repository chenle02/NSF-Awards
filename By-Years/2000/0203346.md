Christopher Cramer of the University of Minnesota is supported by the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to develop new theoretical
methods for organic and inorganic systems characterized by multiple electronic
states spanning relatively narrow energy ranges. Development will focus on
several areas, including generalized-Born equilibrium and non-equilibrium
solvation models, the extension of existing continuum solvation models to new
atoms and new functionalities, and the development of new orthogonalized density
functional theory schemes for treating low-lying excited states. These models
will be applied in conjunction with existing methodologies to target chemistries
of particular interest, including applications to arylnitrenium ions,
phosphinidenes, arynes, dioxodicopper compounds, and metallocenes.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many theoretical calculations apply only to molecules in
the gas phase, rather than the more common experimental conditions of molecules
in the condensed phase. This research will improve the understanding of complex
molecular reactions in solution, with applications to a variety of useful
problems important to chemistry and biology.
