NSF INCLUDES is a national initiative focused on the full participation of all
of America's science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) talent in
discoveries and innovation in the U.S. By proactively seeking and effectively
developing talent nationally, including among those in underserved populations,
NSF INCLUDES projects affirm NSF's commitment to diversity, inclusion, and
broadening participation in STEM. The NSF INCLUDES initiative is promoting
collaboration among different groups committed to this common agenda with the
goal of improving national coordination, sharing knowledge, and maximizing
impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF INCLUDES Coordination Hub will lead
national coordination by building and sustaining a national Network among
efforts to broaden participation in STEM, including but not limited to those
funded by the NSF INCLUDES initiative. The Hub will strengthen the Network by
fostering exchange among members; brokering connections among related efforts;
offering professional learning to develop a broad leadership coalition; and
devising coordinated, national-level strategy. The Hub will also support
coordinated measurement of progress towards Network members' goals by developing
shared measurement approaches and aggregated data analyses. By sharing the
Network's results broadly, via academic journals and conferences, professional
associations memberships, trade publications, and the popular press, the Hub
will raise the visibility and impact of the NSF INCLUDES initiative. In
addition, the Hub will develop and share insights based on its study of the
Network, through the lenses of broadening participation, network analysis, and
organizational change. Together, the Coordination Hub's activities aim to build
public will, advance policy, and mobilize funding across the
Network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hub itself is a multi-institutional coalition.
SRI's partners are Education Development Center (EDC), Westat Inc., Quality
Education for Minorities (QEM) Network, Equal Measure, the Constellations Center
for Equity in Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and Digital
Promise Global. ORS Impact will serve as the Hub's external
evaluator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
