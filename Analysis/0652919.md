Professor Simon will continue his research into spectral theory, especially the
spectral theory of orthogonal polynomials. This project will focus on the theory
where the spectrum has a finite number of gaps. It will also study perturbations
of periodic Schrodinger operators, a model of impurities in solids.

Spectral theory concerns the relation of mathematical models to their "spectral
characteristics" and includes such areas as computer tomography, sonar analysis,
and scattering of subatomic particles. Orthogonal polynomials are the simplest
paradigm; they are especially useful because the inverse problem--often
difficult to even show has solutions--is so explicit. In addition, orthogonal
polynomials on the unit circle (on which Professor Simon has written a book) are
a central tool in electronic circuit filter design.
