The project examines novel services built on top of public
cloud&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure to enable cost-effective high-performance
computing.&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will explore the on-demand, elastic, and
configurable features of&lt;br/&gt;cloud computing to complement the traditional
supercomputer/cluster&lt;br/&gt;platforms. More specifically, this research aims
to assess the efficacy&lt;br/&gt;of building dynamic cloud-based clusters
leveraging the configurability&lt;br/&gt;and tiered pricing model of cloud
instances. The scientific value of this&lt;br/&gt;proposal lies in the novel use
of untapped features of cloud computing&lt;br/&gt;for HPC and the strategic
adoption of small, cloud-based clusters for&lt;br/&gt;the purpose of
developing/tuning applications for large
supercomputers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this research, the PIs expect to
answer key research questions&lt;br/&gt;regarding: (1) automatic workload-
specific cloud cluster configuration,&lt;br/&gt;(2) cost-aware and contention-
aware data and task co-scheduling,&lt;br/&gt;and (3) adaptive, integrated cloud
instance provisioning and job&lt;br/&gt;scheduling, plus workload aggregation
for cloud instance rental cost&lt;br/&gt;reduction. If successful, this research
will result in tools that&lt;br/&gt;adaptively aggregate, configure, and re-
configure cloud resources for&lt;br/&gt;different HPC needs, with the purpose of
offering low-cost R&amp;D&lt;br/&gt;environments for scalable parallel
applications.
