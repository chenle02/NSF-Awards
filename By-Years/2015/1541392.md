The University of Wyoming is developing an environment providing researchers and
students with access to local, regional, national, and international
computational, networking, and data storage resources needed to transform
scientific discovery and education. The university is developing a perimeter
network named UW-DMZ (University of Wyoming "science DMZ") that contains and
exposes the university's external facing services to Internet2. UW-DMZ enhances
Big Computing and Big Data based research by providing infrastructure needed to
leverage high performance, dynamic network services. Research is informed by a
wide variety of data collected from field work and sensor networks, mined from
databases, observed by lab experiments, or generated by simulations. The
movement of data from their source to computational and visualization resources
and then to the scientific world is critical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CI
Engineer provides essential knowledge for how to best use the UW-DMZ facilities
to researchers and students who have not experienced very fast computer
networking or Big Data environments. The CI Engineer provides short courses for
students and researchers that provide deeper, enriching experiences. Through the
university's significant research collaborations with Jackson State University
on environmental hydrology, their students and faculty are trained in accessing
and using computational and visualization resources and gain firsthand
experience in how to facilitate scientific discovery through management and
integration of Big Computing and Big Data.
