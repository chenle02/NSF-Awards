The University of Iowa, serving as a Pilot Center for the NSTA Project on
Scope, Sequence and Coordination, plans to implement major reforms in science
education in four school districts in Iowa. The NSTA model, which spreads the
teaching of the sciences over grades 7-12, will be extended to grade 6 and will
be adapted to the techniques associated with the Science, Technology, and
Society (STS) approach. Science and education staff from the University of Iowa
and from cooperating community and private colleges and Area Education Agencies
will work with staff from the school districts to implement this plan.
