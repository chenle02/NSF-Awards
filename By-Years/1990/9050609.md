This project upgrades and expands the experimental component of undergraduate
education in the natural sciences. The goal is to improve the students'
experimental expertise, to instruct them in the use of state-of-the-art
scientific instruments, and to aid data acquisition and analysis in laboratories
associated with formal courses and in student independent research projects. The
instruments include those for chromatography, electrophoresis,, mass
spectrometry,, radioisotopes and data acquisition along with accessosry
equipment related to these instruments. These instruments extends the range of
investigations conducted to include environmental physiology and ecology,
measurement of toxicants in the environment, and separation of biologically
significant molecules and cellular organelles. The grantee provides funds for
this project that are an equal match for the NSF award.
