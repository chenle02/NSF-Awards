Nuclear methods of analysis in geology have wide applications in petrogenetic,
alteration, age dating, pollution monitoring, and waste disposal. This project
is providing hands-on experience for undergraduate faculty in the operation and
use of a nuclear reactor, radiation safety, fundamentals of nuclear reactions,
obtaining data by nuclear methods, data reduction, and interpretation. The
program is using instrumental neutron activation analysis of short to long half-
life elements, autoradiography, and fission-track dating. Participants are
involved in a five day field trip to various sites in the Tertiary volcanic
province of the Pacific northwest and ar being introduced in the field to many
problems where the applications of nuclear methods are appropriate. Faculty are
returning to their home institutions with three to four projects that include
data sets, field samples and photographs, and plans for the use of the material
in undergraduate classes in petrology, geochemistry and independent studies.
Participants are being informed as to where and how they can continue these
projects for their undergraduate classes after the program has ended.
