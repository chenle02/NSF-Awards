This project is a study of several fundamental issues arising in the problem of
multiuser optical communications. Two general topics are being addressed: (1)
the stochastic modelling of the spectral behavior of semiconductor lasers and a
corresponding assesment of the fundamental effects of phase instabilities on
multiuser optical systems; and (2) the optimum demodulation of multiple access
optical signals within both continuous and quantum observation models.
