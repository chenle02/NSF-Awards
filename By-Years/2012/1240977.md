Westminster College of Salt Lake City, in partnership with Brigham Young
University, proposes to create a new one-semester course modeled on the LAUSD
Exploring Computer Science curriculum. The vast majority of Utah high school
students do not have the opportunity to learn about computing beyond a required
computer literacy course. This project seeks to provide all students in Utah
public schools with an alternative to this existing computer literacy course.
The Utah Exploring Computer Science Initiative will adapt the Exploring Computer
Science (ECS) curriculum into a half-year course that meets the computer
literacy high school graduation requirement for the state of Utah. Over three
years, the project will prepare and support 100 teachers with summer
professional development workshops, monthly meetings held during the academic
year, a mentoring program, and a supportive online community. The proposed
project will better prepare students with more advanced 21st century computing
skills and will increase student, parent and counselor awareness of computing.
It is anticipated that the ECS course will improve student perception of
computing as a discipline, leading to increased student interest in additional
CS courses, which will in turn drive demand for more rigorous course offerings,
such as AP CS A or the proposed, new AP Computer Principles course. The project
goal is to have the majority of Utah students taking the ECS course to fulfill
their computer literacy high school graduation requirement within 5 years.
