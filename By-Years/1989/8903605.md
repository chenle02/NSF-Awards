The archaeological site of Beidha, located in southern Jordan, was the focus of
eight seasons of field research between 1958 and 1983. The low tell covers an
area of approximately 2935 square miles, and extensive excavations have
uncovered almost this entire area. Six main village levels have been identified
and 70 structures examined. Radiocarbon dates indicate an occupation during the
8th and 7th millennia B.C., and this Neolithic site documents the early stages
of the transition to agriculture and herding in the Near East. Under the
sponsorship of Dr. Douglas Price, Dr. Brian Byrd will analyze Beidha data. Dr.
Byrd participated in the excavation and has access to the archaeological notes,
field plans, and artifacts. He will continue to analyze these materials to
examine changes in the organizational structure and nature of activity areas
during the long occupation sequence. Analysis will include the orientation and
arrangement of buildings, circulation pathways, and building size features and
contents. This data set will provide a unique opportunity to examine changes in
community organization, in household configuration and activities, and in
production of specialization. The Neolithic period in the Near East saw the rise
of a social system which is characteristic of complex societies such as our own.
Through examination of this process, archaeologists can gain insight into how
complex societies which characterize both developed and developing countries
arise and are maintained.
