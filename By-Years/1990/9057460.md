A computer code is to be constructed to simulate three- dimensional unsteady
turbulent reactive flows, based upon a spectral element algorithm which combines
the accuracy of pseudospectral methods with the versatility of finite-element
techniques. The large eddy simulation technique will be used, in which the
subgrid turbulent motion is modeled approximately while the large scale
structures are calculated directly. A single-point probability density function
method will be developed for the scalar subgrid closure, and a two-equation
subgrid model will be employed for the hydrodynamic closure. In a second
program, the effects of compressibility on hyper- velocity three-dimensional
reacting turbulent flows will be investigated using a hybrid finite
difference/element pseudospectral algorithm. Several recently developed shock
capturing schemes will be implemented for high Mach number flow simulations. The
thorough understanding of turbulent reactive flows is essential to operate
modern engines and power systems within the constraints of high efficiency and
low emissions, and the next generation of supersonic aircraft poses questions
which may not be answerable through traditional experimentation and development
techniques. This research program will provide new tools for engineers to
extract answers to many of those questions.
