This project will support a six week summer program for 24 women
undergraduates, selected nationwide, which would provide them with an intensive
immersion in mathematics designed to motivate them and strengthen their
preparation for entrance into a doctoral program in mathematics after
graduation. The program will also seek to broaden and strengthen the efforts of
the nation's mathematics faculty to encourage more women to major in mathematics
and to direct the most promising students to graduate school. The program will
also encourage participating students to serve as leaders in mathematical
activities among their peers at their own institutions. Finally, data will be
gathered and analyzed with a view to clarifying the reasons why many fewer women
mathematics majors than men currently go on to doctoral programs in mathematics.
