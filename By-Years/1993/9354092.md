Proposal No. ESIE 9354092 Proposal Name: PLANNING PROPOSAL FOR SCHOOL/SCIENCE
CENTER PARTNERSHIPS INITIATIVE PI: Judith Vecchione ABSTRACT The Association of
Science Technology Centers (ASTC) will plan a multi-year initiative to build the
capacity of science to facilitate the implementation of school/science center
partnerships. ASTC'S intention is to organize a network a "learning communities"
in five prominent interest areas, identified by the field, to help science
museums focus more effectively on school science education, and develop close
collaboration with schools to influence systemic change. During the planning
phase, ASTC will: Organize and convene a national advisory committee Develop a
position paper to inform and engage the field for school/science center
collaboration. Identify leadership institutions and their partners among school
systems, and form a core group of facilities and personnel for the leaning
communities. Investigate needs in existing practices and develop an appropriate
range of resources, services, and activities. Determine priorities for phased
implementation of learning communities and related program activities. Conduct
research to identify useful techniques and approaches for program documentation,
research, and evaluation.
