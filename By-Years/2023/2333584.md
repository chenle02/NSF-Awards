This CAREER project focuses on long-term chemical changes that take place in
mixtures of atmospheric organic aerosol. Organic molecules in the atmosphere can
have large impacts on climate, air quality, and on human health and the
environment. One of the goals of this research is to develop a more accurate way
to estimate the fraction of carbon emitted into the atmosphere that stays in the
condensed phase, both in aerosol and in surface films, as the aerosol ages.
Knowledge about the types and extents of slower aging reactions is key to
understanding and predicting the behaviors of carbon mixtures in the atmospheric
aerosols.

The central hypothesis of this research is that when organic mixtures are aged,
functional group distributions change, enabling subsequent accretion reactions.
The hypothesis is based on prior work by this investigator who has found that
both a-pinene and food cooking organic aerosol films show evidence of
oligomerization with long aging times (days to weeks). The objectives of this
research are to: (1) investigate the impact of water vapor on the multi-
generational aging of secondary organic aerosol, (2) investigate the aging
process for components of urban grime, including food cooking organic aerosol
and ambient surface films, and (3) help attract and retain students in the
atmospheric sciences by partnering with local high schools to develop learning
experiences related to air pollution.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
