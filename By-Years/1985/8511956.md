The proposed research, which includes experimental work and correlation of data
from others, is expected to extend existing theory to include the class of
systems which involve dissociation-association reactions. If successful, the
extended theory will do much to lead to better methods for treatment of both
potable water supplies and certain difficult kinds of sewage disposal.
