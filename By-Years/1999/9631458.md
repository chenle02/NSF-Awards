9631458 Bowman Cereals, legumes, nuts, and fruits of angiosperms provide a large
portion of the food that is consumed by both humans and livestock. Each of these
products is ultimately derived from carpels, the female reproductive organs of
the flower. Carpels are generated in developing flowers through the action of
many genes. The aim of this project is to identify the basic molecular and
genetic mechanisms by which the development of carpels is directed. Since all
angiosperms are likely to utilize a common set of regulatory genes, by cloning
and characterizing the relevant genes in the model species Arabidopsis, Dr.
Bowman can apply the knowledge gained to commercially important crop species.
Genetically engineered changes in sizes, numbers, structure and rate of maturity
of carpels will eventually be possible. Such manipulations in crop species may
lead to improvements in the amount and diversity of our food supply.
