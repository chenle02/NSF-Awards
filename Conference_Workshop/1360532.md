This award provides funds for the conference "Contemporary Combinatorics 2014",
which will be held at the University of Memphis during March 27-29, 2014. The
aim of this conference is to bring together a group of outstanding
mathematicians who work on topics loosely related to combinatorics, probability
and combinatorial number theory so that they can present their latest research
results, and also interact with other conference participants, including young
researchers and even high school students.

Combinatorics is an area of mathematics that studies discrete structures. It has
applications to computer science, chemistry, and many areas of engineering. The
conference aims to promote interaction between senior and junior researchers, to
allow for the dissemination of recent research results, and to publicize the
importance of combinatorics in the general public.
