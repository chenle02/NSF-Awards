The theory of measurement, which provides rigorous methods for assigning numbers
to and developing various numerically based mathematical structures for
empirical phenomenon, has generated in the last twenty years many new
fundamental ideas that are applicable to science -- particularly experimental
sciences that use sophisticated mathematical models. This research exploits and
extends these recent developments by (1) directly applying them to areas of
behavioral science that employ formal models of human judgment and decision, and
(2) by developing new methods of measurement and new mathematical models that
take into account empirical facts that contradict important, widely applied
models of judgment and decision. Because of the wide use by the military, the
government, and business of complicated decision strategies that have human
judgments and the results of human decisions as inputs, the results of this
research are expected to provide a basis for improving such decision strategies.
