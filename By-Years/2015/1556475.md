This project will study the beginning of anatomical knowledge when skeletons
were objects of intensive study by scientists and artists, in order to document
how modern ideas of anatomy and physiology emerged. The project will trace how
the skeleton's meaning has been defined by social, political, and religious
attitudes toward the body in order to contribute to current debates about the
exhibition and repatriation of human remains.

This project will examine the making, representing, marketing, displaying, and
collecting of human bones and skeletons. This project will study evidence from
scientific and popular written sources as well as archaeological evidence to
contribute to discussions in the history of science and medicine, art history,
archaeology, and historical anthropology. Findings of this project will be
dissemination in a book, open - access databases on early modern anatomy and
collecting, and a conference on human remains and their deposition. The work
will broaden our understanding of the range of practices of early modern life
sciences and their close connections to religion and popular culture. In
addition, it will enrich the historiography of early modern science and expand
its resource base with the inclusion of material artifacts.
