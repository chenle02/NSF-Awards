Over the last few years, most aspects of the mathematics curriculum have been
undergoing major changes. The calculus reform movement has generated changes
both in terms of what is taught and how materials are taught; these changes are
well documented. In the eighties a conference on reform calculus was held at
Tulane University in New Orleans. The Tulane conference helped shape some of the
ideas of reform calculus. This project does the same for precalculus.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the workshop is to rethink the preparation
for calculus, given that students are having such different mathematical
experiences in high school, calculus in college has changed, technology is
providing mathematical tools for both teaching and learning, and college algebra
is in the process of changing. Several mathematics educators were invited to a
working workshop that was designed to address each of these issues.&lt;br/&gt;
