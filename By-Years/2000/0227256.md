The SUPER (School-University Partnership for Excellence in Research-based) STEM
Project is a partnership between the Baltimore County Public Schools (BCPS) and
the University of Maryland Baltimore County. SUPER STEM activities are built on
a foundation of past work between the district and the university. The project
focuses on increasing student achievement, especially that of low-performing
students, and targets low-performing schools. Located in the suburban region
around Baltimore, BCPS enrolled 107,322 students during the 2001-02 academic
year. The County population is rapidly shifting in ethno-racial characteristics
such that the most recent census indicates that White residents in the county
have decreased from 84.9% in 1990 to 74.4% in 2000. Within BCPS, 33.7% of the
students are African American, 59.7% are White, 4.0% are Asian American, and
2.0% are Hispanic. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve its MSP-aligned goals, SUPER
STEM will:&lt;br/&gt;1. Establish Visiting STEM Scholarships to attract talented
scientists and educators to accelerate the development and teaching of new
curricula;&lt;br/&gt;2. Provide weekend and summer accelerated academic
coursework for the lowest-performing students and schools;&lt;br/&gt;3. Create
STEM Academies in the lowest-performing schools;&lt;br/&gt;4. Expand the UMBC
Urban Education Principal, Teacher and Intern Scholarships to recruit and retain
the most talented STEM educators to lowest-performing schools;&lt;br/&gt;5.
Provide over 100 hours of STEM training to roughly 1800 teachers;
and&lt;br/&gt;6. Conduct ongoing, hierarchical, multi-method longitudinal
student and teacher achievement analyses, performance assessments, and work
sampling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
