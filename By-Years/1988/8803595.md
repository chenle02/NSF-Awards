This project will involve the collection of data on fire ignitions during the
October 1, 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake. A major source of data will be
interviews with fire personnel in the various communities affected by the
earthquake and relevant company officials. All ignitions will be categorized by
type (for example, gas, electric and chemical related), thereby adding to the
data base of ignition sources that has evolved from other modern earthquakes
beginning with the 1971 San Fernando earthquake. The results of this project
should contribute to the basis for making projection about fire losses in future
events.
