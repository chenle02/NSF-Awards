The program at City College of the City University of New York builds on an
established base of female and minority bachelor's and master's degree
engineering students and on successful programs for recruitment and retention to
establish a new program of doctoral, graduate study and research traineeships
for underrepresented students. The program is entitled project FORCE (Focused
Opportunities For Research Careers in Engineering). FORCE involves specially
selected faculty research mentors from each of the engineering departments. The
four student participants will receive special advising, counseling and other
support services designed to improve their retention in the program and enhance
their potential for a successful research career. They will have a mandatory
internship experience in industry during the summer prior to their matriculation
as graduate students. Subsequent summer internships will be optional.
