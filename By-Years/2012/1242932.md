This research is a component of a broad community experiment named SOAS
(Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study) designed to further investigate the
oxidation of the emissions (biogenic volatile organic compounds; BVOCs) of
plants in the context of the atmospheric environment of the Southeast United
States. Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) particles arise, in situ, from
atmospheric reactions of BVOCs together with the subsequent partitioning of
these products into condensed phase materials. The direct measurement of
sensitivities of SOA production rates and properties to various environmentally
relevant perturbations in the ambient conditions at the SOAS study site will
provide a convenient test point for the description of the chemical mechanisms
of SOA formation, needed for use in a variety of climate and air quality models.

The project will involve undergraduate and graduate students, research staff and
faculty, creating an environment for student development and exposure to
interdisciplinary research and collaboration.
