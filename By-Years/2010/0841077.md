Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The work proposed is to integrate existing national
and international seismic data sets to provide insight into seismogenic zone
processes at the subduction zone off of Costa Rica and Nicaragua. This
subduction zone generates large and tsunami earthquakes.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will be done
by a Ph.D. student. Publishing the data collected by international colleagues
will benefit the U.S. marine geology and geophysics community. &lt;br/&gt;
