THIS AWARD SUPPORTS PRELIMINARY RESEARCH AIMED AT A DESCRIPTION OF CYCLIC
HOMOLOGY OF ALGEBRAIC VARIETIES USING TECHNIQUES IN DIFFERENTIAL ALGEBRA. IN
EARLIER WORK THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR HAS SHOWN THAT CYCLIC HOMOLOGY CAN BE
USED TO RECOVER A CLASSICAL INVARIANT, THE MILNOR OR TJURINA NUMBER, OF PLANE
CURVES WITH ISOLATED SINGULARITIES. SHE WILL NOW WORK ON OBTAINING AN EXPLICIT
COMPUTATION OF HOCHSCHILD HOMOLOGY AND CYCLIC HOMOLOGY FOR GENERAL ALGEBRAIC
CURVES. THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR WILL ALSO WORK ON THE MODULE OF DIFFERENTIAL
OPERATORS ON CURVES WITH ISOLATED SINGULARITIES. THIS RESEARCH IS CONCERNED WITH
ALGEBRAIC K-THEORY. IN A BROAD SENSE, ALGEBRAIC K-THEORY CONCERNS THE EVOLUTION
OF CONCEPTS FROM LINEAR ALGEBRA SUCH AS BASIS AND VECTOR SPACE. THIS WORK HAS
SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR NUMBER THEORY AND ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY, AND PROMISES
TO MAKE EXCITING CONNECTIONS BETWEEN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT AREAS OF MATHEMATICS.
