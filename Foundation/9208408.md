This project involves both set theory and recursion theory, focusing on various
degree structures and the applications of forcing to degree-theoretic questions.
The investigator will continue to work on the analysis of priority arguments in
the theory of recursively enumerable degrees and on the proof-theoretic strength
of these arguments. Groszek and Theodore A. Slaman (Univ. of Chicago) have been
developing a uniform presentation for all levels of priority argument and tying
these arguments to a standard proof-theoretic hierarchy of fragments of Peano
arithmetic. In addition to continuing this development, Groszek will investigate
specific statements about the partial order of recursively enumerable Turing
degrees, considering whether and how their proof- theoretic strength reflects
this analysis. In a different vein, Groszek will work on some long-standing open
questions regarding the degrees of constructibility. Finally, she will consider
the question of which partial orders can be embedded into the Turing degrees
(assuming the failure of CH), one of the remaining open questions about the
global structure of the Turing degrees. Prominent among the questions to be
addressed by this project are a number that bear on theoretical computability.
They lie in what is known as recursion theory, which deals with a model of
computability knowing no bounds on time or space. Although answers to such
questions have the ability to illuminate practical questions, they are really
practical only when their answers are negative, for it is a very strong
statement indeed to say that something cannot be computed even when one puts no
limits on resources available for the purpose. The finer structure of
computability theory is sometimes more relevant to actual computations, and
various aspects of that will also be considered. A major thrust of the project
is to equate degrees of computability with specific levels in a well studied
hierarchy dealing with the logic of arithmetic.
