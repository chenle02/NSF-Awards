This research is to analyze existing digital seismic data sets for further
evidence of a strong P-velocity anomaly in the lower mantle beneath the northern
Soviet Union and, if possible, to map its spatial extent. Although considerable
SH data show evidence of anomalous structure up to 350 km above the core- mantle
boundary, to this date only European WWSSN data and the GRF array have been
searched successfully to find the P-wave analog produced by such an anomaly. The
results should give information on what kind of structure is giving rise to the
anomalous observations which can, in turn, constrain dynamical models of the
mantle and core.
