The Mechanical Engineering Department of the University of Minnesota, Institute
of Technology has a program of summer research in mechanical engineering for
science and engineering undergraduates. Fifteen students will take part in the
program. Applicants for the program are asked to submit transcripts, letters of
recommendation and an essay. Participants are selected by a panel of faculty
members. The program starts with an orientation program in which research
projects and facilities are described. Participants are asked to select a
project on which to work from a group of twenty-nine ongoing research projects
in mechanical engineering. A faculty supervisor monitors the progress of each
student and they are given increasing responsibilities as their skills develop.
