Processes in Extreme Environments"

PI: Hailiang Dong, Department of Geology, Miami University, Oxford Ohio

This award supports two workshops, the first of which is to be held in October,
2008 at the Natural National Science Foundation of China (NSFC) in Beijing. The
follow-up workshop will be held in October 2009 at Penn State University in the
United States. Each workshop will host about 21 foreign scientists at each venue
and about 20 students each from the U.S. and China. Of the 21 U.S. scientists,
five (5) are female and nine are the early-career stage. The counterpart
organizers in China are Dr. YU, Bingsong, Professor of Earth Sciences, and
Associate Director of the Geomicrobiology Laboratory, Chinese University of
Geosciences, Beijing, China; Dr. LI, Wenjun Professor and Deputy Director of the
State Key Laboratory for Microbial Resources, Yunnan Institute of Microbiology,
Yunnan University in Kunming, China, and Dr. ZHAO, Fenghua, Professor of Coal
Resources and Aqueous Geochemistry, China University of Mining and Technology.
Co-funding support was provided by the Geobiology and Low-Temperature
Geochemistry Program.
