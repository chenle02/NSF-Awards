Advances in high-quality video frame-grabber technology, charge-coupled-device
(CCD) video cameras, and desktop computing have made image processing available
in fields as diverse as medical research and video entertainment. Many
experiments in introductory physics for both the science major and nonmajor use
older equipment and methods and suffer from a `cookbook` approach. Experiments
such as these fail to involve students in a meaningful way. They are boring and
do not teach students the important skill of experimental design. This project
applies digital video capture technology using Macintosh computers to kinematic
experiments in introductory physics. The video technology and image processing
software used in this project enables students in introductory physics
laboratories to easily visualize and quickly measure an object's displacement
and to calculate its velocity, acceleration, and the force acting on it.
Students use this equipment to explore free-fall, friction, conservation of
momentum, and other phenomena. Portable CCD cameras enable students to carry out
experiments outside the laboratory environment. Since experiments and data
analysis can be carried out rapidly, students can exercise their creativity by
trying their own variations on an experiment rather than just following the
`cookbook` approach often found in the introductory laboratory. Students need to
have laboratory experiences that encourage their creativity, help them explore
open-ended problems, and teach them to design experiments. Laboratory
experiments that students can perform with this equipment can help them develop
their physical understanding of and maintain enthusiasm for the discipline.
