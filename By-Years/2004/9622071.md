The objective of this project is to obtain a quantitative understanding of
magnetospheric hudromagnetic modes and their coupling to external and internal
sources of free energy, such as the ring current. Three interrelated areas of
study will be followed: (1) inner magnetospheric cavity modes, (2) general
properties of field line resonance modes, and (3) excitation of internally-
driven field line resonance modes by energetic ring current particles. Key
questions to be examined are: (1) what is the cavity mode structure in the inner
magnetosphere and the frequencies one should expect to see in ground and
satellite magnetic data and what is the efficiency of transport from the outer
magnetosphere, (2) what controls the field line resonant mode radial structure,
and (3) what causes the nonlinear saturation of the drift-bounce resonant mode,
and what is the self-consistent effect of the mode on ion motion. The methods to
be employed are: (1) for the cavity mode study, eigenmode analysis in dipole and
general geometry and MHD simulations, (2) for the field line resonance mode
study, MHD simulations in box and dipole geometry including finite Larmor radius
effects as well as ionospheric damping, and (3) for the study of internally-
driven field line resonance modes, hybrid MHD/gyrokinetic simulations in box and
dipole geometry. The goal is to incorporate the key physics which has not yet
been included in studies of these modes. Comparisons with spacecraft data will
be made to test the theoretical predictions and yield new insights into observed
wave properties and associated particle measurements.
