This award supports Professor Lu Sham and a junior associate of the University
of California at San Diego to collaborate with Professor Friedhelm Bechstedt of
the Friedrich Schiller University of Jena, Germany. They are studying coherence
effects in strongly-correlated insulators and metals. In particular, they will
investigate the possible detectability of coherence through the nonlinear
optical response of the system. The collaborating research groups bring
complementary expertise in many body theory and in optical properties of
condensed matter systems. Strong electron-electron correlation plays a pivotal
role in the electronic properties of modern metals and insulators such as the
cuprate compounds and the heavy fermion compounds. If optically excited
coherence effects can be shown to exist in theory, this will provide an
operational definition for strong correlation in a large number of metals and
insulators. In turn, this would lead to an optical means for experimentally
observing strongly correlated behavior and an effective optical test for
predictions of strong-correlation theories.
