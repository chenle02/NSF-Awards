This project will result in a catalogue of clouds compiled from data sets
gathered from weather stations, both land (from 1971 onward) and ocean (from
1952 onward). The basic ocean data set to be used is readily available from
COADS (the Comprehensive Ocean Atmosphere Data Set jointly archived by the
National Center for Atmospheric Research and the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The atlas will be compiled
with special emphasis on diurnal cycles, interannual variability and long-term
trends useful for climate studies. Information on total cloud cover, low cloud
amount, cloud types at three levels (stratus, stratocumulus and fog), types
altostratus and altocumulus, and present weather conditions at the time of
observation (e.g., precipitation, fog), and cloud base height will be provided.
Day and night-time observations will be separated. Satellite-based data sets
will be used to supplement the catalogue with optical properties associated with
morphologically defined types of cloud.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cloud catalogue
arising from this project is expected to prove highly useful to the scientific
community for climate change studies; for example, in improving estimates of the
Earth's radiation budget.
