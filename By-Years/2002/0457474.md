Delocalization, Localization and other Phenomena &lt;br/&gt;in Disordered
Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abel Klein&lt;br/&gt; University of California,
Irvine &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The subject of this
research proposal is the study of delocalization, localization, and other
phenomena in disordered systems. The main open problem in random Schrodinger
operators is delocalization; the existence of extended states. The study of
delocalization in random Schrodinger operators is the main goal of this
proposal. A major objective of this proposal is to prove dynamical
delocalization in random Schrodinger operators, using the new approach to the
metal-insulator transition based on transport instead of spectral properties
introduced by the PI and Germinet. In addition, questions related to
localization and linear response theory will be
investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In quantum mechanics, random Schrodinger
operators describe the motion of an electron in a crystal with impurities. The
impurities are modeled as a random media (or material). While the pure materials
may be conductors, impurities change the conduction properties of materials. At
energies in the region where impurities create localized states the material
behaves as an insulator, while at energies with extended (delocalized) states
the material behaves as a conductor. Examples of materials with impurities are
given by doped semiconductors, which have many applications in electronics. The
proposed research will further the understanding of the changes in the
conduction properties of such materials caused by the addition of
impurities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
