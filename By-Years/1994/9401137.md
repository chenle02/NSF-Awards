9401137 Matumoto Matumoto will investigate analysis concerning the
representation theory of real reductive Lie groups. Of particular interest will
be use of representation theory in the study of automorphic forms. He will also
investigate induced representations from drived functor modules and restrictions
of representations. These problems arise naturally in the study of the unitary
dual of reductive groups, one of the main subjects of the area. The theory of
Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, has been
one of the major themes in twentieth century mathematics. As the mathematical
vehicle for exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the representation
theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact up on mathematics itself,
particularly in analysis and number theory, and upon the oretical physics,
especially quantum mechanics and elementary particle physics. ***
