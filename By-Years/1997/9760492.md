*** 9760492 Wickman This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will develop a high-throughput automated system for catalyst testing.
Catalyst development is currently limited by the high labor costs in evaluating
new catalysts. With older, manual equipment, testing one catalyst could easily
cost several thousand dollars. Using microcomputer-controlled catalyst testing
apparatus capable of continuous, unattended operation, cost can be reduced to
several hundred dollars per catalyst. The new concept of high-throughput
catalyst testing may lower the unit cost of testing to less than ten dollars.
Phase I will develop a system for the simultaneous testing of an array of
catalysts. In Phase II will prepare and test a 10 by 10 array system of larger.
A high-throughput catalyst testing system is expected to find immediate
application by catalyst manufacturers, major refineries, and other industries
that use catalysts in manufacturing or processing. ***
