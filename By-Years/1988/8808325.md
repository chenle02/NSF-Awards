The development of area efficient fault-tolerant wafer-scale integration
architectures for very high performance processor arrays that specifically
ensure short and bounded interconnection lengths following restructuring is
being carried out. New yield and performance models to realistically evaluate
the designs are being developed. Semiconductor chips for matrix multiplication
are being implemented through the MOSIS (Metal Oxide Semiconductor
Implementation System) facility. Performance approaching one billion floating
point operations is expected. Wafer-scale integration allows processors of high
performance to be developed. In such designs, interprocessor signals are not
subject to off-chip propagation delays. Issues on fault tolerance are especially
important in such designs in order to overcome long delays caused by
reconfiguration due to fabrication defects.
