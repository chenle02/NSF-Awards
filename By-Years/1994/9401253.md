9401253 Quigg This proposal is a continuation of a study of noncommutative
duality for C*-dynamical systems. The primary objective is to further explore
the links among Landstad duality, twisted coactions, induced C*-algebras, and
crossed product duality. Further analysis will be made of the relation between
discrete coactions and compact actions. The general area of mathematics of this
project has its basis in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.
Operators can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex numbers.
Special types of operators are often put together in an algebra, naturally
called an operator algebra. These abstract objects have a surprising variety of
applications. For example, they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is
currently being used to study the structure of DNA, and they are of fundamental
importance in noncommutative geometry, which is becoming of increasing
importance in mathematical physics. ***
