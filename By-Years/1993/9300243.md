This project will bring eight undergraduates to the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois for a full
semester of research. Recruiting is to be national in scope. The selected
students will be matched with an NCSA research project in accordance with their
interests and background. The disciplinary focus of the project will be
computational science, with particular emphasis in the application of
parallelization and visualization concepts and techniques.
