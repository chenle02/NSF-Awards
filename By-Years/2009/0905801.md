This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A wide variety of research projects
will be pursued with the computational power of a new 84 node/672 processor
Beowulf Linux cluster. The science projects span cosmology and galaxy formation,
star and planet formation, and the astrophysics of compact objects with
relativistically strong gravity and electromagnetic fields. The cluster will
play a role in developing new methods of data analysis and acquisition,
especially with regard to next-generation radio astronomy instruments. The
cluster will be used by a diverse team of 21 researchers at the University of
California at Berkeley, with some time available for researchers outside of this
team.
