This award provides support for two-years for the operation of the ion
microprobe laboratory in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary
Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The laboratory will be
run as a regional/national facility and will be available for trace element and
isotope microanalysis of geological materials. The facility provides U.S.earth
scientists access to analyses with high mass resolution as well as excellent
spatial resolution (10 to 20 micrometers) for a number of nuclides that are very
significant in interpreting large- and small-scale mass transfer processes
within the Earth.
