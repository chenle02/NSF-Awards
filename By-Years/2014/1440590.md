UCF has established a Cyber Infrastructure Engineer (CI Engineer) position to
serve as a bridge between UCF's Computer Services &amp; Telecommunications
organization and the campus research computing community, as well as a catalyst
and link to the broader community of CI Engineers. This new CI Engineer position
leverages the research network that is being constructed at UCF. This position
expands UCF's capability to perform basic research by focusing on cyber
infrastructure dedicated to meeting current and future research needs.
Responsibilities for this position include the expansion of UCF's research
network and Science DMZ in close operation with campus IT staff, extension and
execution of UCF's long-term Cyber-Infrastructure plan, and participation in the
wider community of growing Cyber-Infrastructure professionals at other
institutions, both regionally (through Florida LambdaRail) and nationally
(through Internet2). Additionally, this effort helps meet the accelerating data
transfer needs of campus research by facilitating and participating in research
relating to the use of software defined networking and performance monitoring of
high-performance research networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UCF's full-time cyber
infrastructure engineer position is expected to expand and improve access for
faculty, graduate student researchers, and undergraduates to high performance
computing resources, both on and off campus. Moreover, the University expects
this CI Engineer position to help broaden the general understanding of best
practices for research-focused cyber infrastructure by participating in the
growing community of CI engineers at universities throughout the country.
