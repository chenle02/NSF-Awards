The IEEE International Symposium on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust (HOST)
brings together an interdisciplinary group of researchers and practitioners in
hardware security. The program features technical papers, panels and invited
talks, and discussion sessions. The seventh HOST will be held in fall 2015 in
the Washington, DC, area. The funds support travel grants for students to attend
the conference. HOST is the top conference devoted to hardware security. By
increasing student participation at the HOST conference, it may encourage more
students to get involved in hardware security research and pursue further
graduate education and careers in this area.
