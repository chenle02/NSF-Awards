This project will test the feasibility of measuring the global electric circuit
from Antarctica. The instruments will measure the vertical electric current from
which the ionospheric potential can be deduced. The test will involve placing
two of the current measuring instruments about one kilometer apart at South Pole
Station. If the instruments are successful in producing the same measurement to
within a few percent, then it is expected that they will at a later date be
installed in Automatic Geophysical Observatories (AGO) at widely separated sites
in Antarctica. It is the eventual goal of the investigation to be able to
generate a geoelectric index, similar to the geomagnetic indices, and also be
able to measure the cross polar cap potential differences. These have both been
goals of the geophysics community for many years, but until now, with the
development of the AGO system for the uniquely favorable antarctic environment,
it has not been feasible to make the required measurements.
