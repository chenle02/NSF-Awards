This grant provides the NSF support for a collaboration between Johns Hopkins
Applied Physics Laboratory and British Antarctic Survey (BAS) to operate a High
Frequency coherent scatter radar at BAS's Halley Bay Station. The radar is the
southern component of a pair of similar radars while the northern component is
at Goose Bay Labrador, which is located on the same geomagnetic field line as
Halley Bay. Such a pair is said to be "magnetically conjugate". The array is
called PACE (Polar Anglo-American Conjugate Experiment). In addition, the Halley
Bay radar has a field of view which includes the ionosphere above the well
instrumented USAP South Pole Station. Together the radars can map the density
and velocity of the ionospheric plasma in the polar caps of both hemispheres,
providing unprecedented opportunities to study conjugate phenomena and how the
Earth's high latitude ionosphere responds to changes in the solar wind. This
project is an important contribution to the International Solar Terrestrial
Physics (ISTP), Global Geospace Modelling (GEM) and Coupling, Energetics and
Dynamics through Atmospheric Regions (CEDAR) programs.//
