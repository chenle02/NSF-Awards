Computer systems today are all built around what is called the von Neumann
architecture where the computation subsystem and the memory subsystem are
separately designed and considered. This model has served the industry well for
several decades. It does, however, create a bottleneck (referred as the von
Neumann bottleneck) between the two subsystems. The increasing scale and
dependence on data in modern computers put more and more stress on the von
Neumann bottleneck, limiting computer speed and increasing energy costs. New
technologies to address this problem can significantly improve all computers
including modern data centers and supercomputers that are shouldering ever more
responsibilities in science, medicine, engineering, business and commerce, and
everyday life of an average citizen. This project is an effort to develop one
such technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research centers around a novel nano-
scale device recently developed by one of the investigators of the project. The
device is called a coupled-disk resonator or CDR for short. CDR contains two
flat disks very closely placed together. The fascinating property is that,
thanks to technology, these disks can be shrunk down to nano-scale and placed in
close proximity precisely. As a result, they can interact with light in a
variety of controllable ways that allow computer designers to build superior
optical communication systems than possible today. More excitingly, the CDRs can
be manipulated to perform (simple) computations directly without having to
convert optical signals first to electronic signals as is the case today. The
potential outcome is not only high-performance communication channels, but smart
ones that can significantly mitigate the von Neumann bottleneck. In this
project, the investigators will study and experiment with the designs of both
the device and the system built with these devices in an effort to bring this
potential technology closer to reality.
