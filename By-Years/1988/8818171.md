This is a project to maintain and augment as necessary, the network of twenty-
eight automatic weather stations established on the antarctic continent and on
several surrounding islands. These weather stations measure surface wind,
pressure, temperature, humidity, and in some instances other atmospheric
variables, and report these via satellite to a number of ground stations. The
data are used for operational weather forecasting in support of the United
States Antarctic Program, for climatological records, and for research purposes.
The AWS network, which began as a small-scale program in 1980, has been
extremely reliable and has proven indispensable for both forecasting and
research purposes.
