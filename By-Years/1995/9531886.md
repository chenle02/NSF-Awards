9531886 DeGrandpre This Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) project
will develop deploy a new long term, CO2 sensor on a mooring that will over-
winter on Georges Bank as part of the GLOBEC global change research program. The
PI has developed a new instrument called SAMI-CO2 for measuring CO2 levels
(Submersible Autonomous Moored Instrument - CO2). Measuring the partial pressure
of CO2 (pCO2) is important to many types of investigations involving climatic
studies. Long term measurements have been difficult to make. This deployment
opportunity represents an effective way to provide the research community with a
rigorous field evaluation. The work will also contribute to the GLOBEC program
that is seeking to determine dominant control of sea surface pCO2 levels for
ocean-atmosphere climate models and to improve our understanding of air-sea gas
exchange mechanisms.
