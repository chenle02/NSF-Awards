Our overall objective in this Major Instrumentation proposal is to acquire a
unique Scanning Hall Probe Microscope (SHPM). This instrument has exceptional
magnetic field imaging and sensing capabilities and has a number of important
advantages:&lt;br/&gt;1. It is non-invasive, as the probe itself is non-
magnetic.&lt;br/&gt;2. It measures magnetic field directly rather than field
derivatives (as in MFM).&lt;br/&gt;3. Its sensitivity at low temperatures is
already compatible to the best micro-SQUIDs.&lt;br/&gt;4. It has scanning
capabilities and (in contrast to a micro-SQUID) can operate in large external
magnetic fields. In collaboration with the Microscope manufacturer,
NanoMagnetics Instruments, we will further develop SHPM sensitivity, ultimately
allowing single electron spin detection. In particular we propose to do
measurements of a single spin in a quantum dot. The implementation of this stage
will result in a truly unique instrument with outstanding reaching
capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact&lt;br/&gt;This work, if
successful, will establish the new basis for nanofabrication of
unique&lt;br/&gt;nanostructures with potential application in intelligent
characterization of molecules and manipulation of single charges. The
acquisition and development of SHPM will allow the faculty from several
different departments at WSU (Physics, Chemistry, Electrical and Computer
Engineering) to integrate the multidisciplinary research and student training.
To compliment the research programs the PI and the Co-PIs will use SHPM in the
development of a pilot program to introduce a Senior Research Project at WSU as
a required part of the curriculum. The instrument will also help broaden the
participation of undergraduate in the current NSF- funded IGERT and REU programs
and will also be indispensable in the graduate interdisciplinary course,
Materials and Characterization Techniques and of a new graduate course
"Magnetism, Magnetic Devices and Nanotechnology".&lt;br/&gt;
