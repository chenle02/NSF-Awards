This project is to organize and develop the 4th US/Japan Workshop in Earthquake
Disaster Prevention of Lifeline Systems. The workshop will provide an
opportunity for researchers, designers, and construction specialists to exchange
discussions and ideas on the current state-of-the-art in seismic risk assessment
and design for lifelines. In addition it will determine future directions to be
pursued to improve current methods, and establish what mutual programs between
the U.S. and Japan can be initiated so that the most effective use of available
information is maximized. The workshop will be conducted in Los Angeles, in late
summer of 1991. This workshop will be of great benefit for the program
development of the Earthquake Hazards Mitigation Program as it will identify
future research needs in lifeline systems research. As an international activity
between the United States and Japan, it will be of mutual benefit to both
countries in the development of lifeline system earthquake -resistant design.
