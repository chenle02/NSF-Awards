This project attacks the process control problems using a formal method for
program derivation that is based on Hoare-style proof outlines. This involves
investigations into formal methods for reasoning about real-time and fault-
tolerance. It also involves applying the resulting methodology to actual process
control problems, leading to improved notations and techniques for suppressing
irrelevant details when deriving moderate-sized concurrent and distributed
programs.
