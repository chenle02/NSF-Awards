The Middle Awash area of Ethiopia has been a remarkably important and
productive paleontological region, yielding fossil remains of numerous
vertebrate taxa, including early hominids. Abundant vertebrate fossils collected
from Middle Awash deposits represent significant data relevant to studying the
later Neogene vertebrate evolution in Africa. This project represents a detailed
study of vertebrate fauna from the terminal Miocene of the Middle Awash Valley.
Results from such comparative analyses are essential to our understanding of the
Late Miocene vertebrate history of Africa. Argon/argon and paleomagnetic data
currently being generated from these deposits are establishing a reliable
chronostratigraphy for the Middle Awash, thereby refining biochronology of other
contemporaneous African Late Miocene localities for which radiometric dates do
not exist. The results of the proposed study will elucidate the
paleobiogeography, paleoenvironment, and faunal diversity during the time at
which hominids are believed to have differentiated
