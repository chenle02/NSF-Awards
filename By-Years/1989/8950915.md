This project will provide for computerized data acquisition and analysis in the
lower division electricity and magnetism laboratories for engineering students.
The equipment will provide the ability to sense temperatures, voltages, and
currents directly and read them into computerized spreadsheets. Additional
equipment will drive the experiments (power supplies and function generators)
and produce printed output (printers and plotters). This will continue an on-
going project of upgrading laboratory facilities and equipment at the college.
The software involved in this project will include LOTUS 123, an integrated
spreadsheet, graphics and database package, and LOTUS Measure, an add-on module
for 123 that allows measurements to be gathered from instruments directly into
123. LabTech Notebook will also be used in parallel with LOTUS 123 and LOTUS
Measure, to demonstrate a slightly different method of accomplishing the same
ends and to give the ability to do real time graphic display of gathered data.
The College will match the award with an equal amount.
