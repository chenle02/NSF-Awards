The investigators are planning to determine the nature of interplanetary cosmic
electrons by measuring the spectra of electrons (negatrons and positrons) in the
nearly unexplored energy range from 50 MeV to 500 MeV at the time of the next
solar minimum period. The main effort is to develop a lightweight balloon borne
instruments capable of a long-duration (20-30 day) flight from McMurdo Station,
Antarctica. Such a flight is also capable of examining variations in time of the
relative abundance of positrons over a complete solar rotation. Electrons
between 50 MeV and 500 MeV probe both large scale and turbulent structures in
the solar wind on length and time scales not accessible when only ions are
measured.
