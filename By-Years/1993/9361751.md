9361751 Farrelle This project is funded under the National Science Foundation's
(NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which is designed to
provide an opportunity for small business, particularly the small high
technology firm, to participate in NSF research. Phase I of the SBIR program
serves as a filter to select promising proposals and determine if the firm can
do high quality research. Phase II is the principal research project. Phase III
is the conversion of the NSF-funded research into commercial applications and
technological innovation supported by follow-on private venture capital or other
non-federal financing. This Phase I project studies the feasibility of a generic
architecture concept utilizing a library of fundamental building blocks which
can be combined to compress multiple image sources. Potential building blocks
include predictors, DCTs, DSTs, quantizers, entropy coders, and buffers. The
project is determining the feasibility of programming a commercially-available
digital video processor chip developed for real-time video imagery for
compression of other types of imagery.***
