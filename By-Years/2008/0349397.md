0349397&lt;br/&gt;Keniston&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award supports
research internships in India for graduate students at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT). The opportunity for student research internships
is a new component of MIT's international program in India, which currently
supports internships in industry and teaching. Funding from NSF's Office of
International Science &amp; Engineering will enable nine MIT graduate students
to undertake traineeships at six of India's leading centers of research and
higher education. The program is designed to integrate trainees into
groundbreaking research at India's finest institutions, allow them to explore
careers in research, and finally, become globally experienced early on in their
education and training. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: The PI is well connected
with Indian institutions/researchers and has recently completed a term as
visiting professor at the Nehru Centre for Advanced Studies, Indian Institute of
Science (IISc), Bangalore. His collaborations with Indian colleagues at the
IISc, the Indian Institute of Information Technology, the Indian Institute of
Technology-Madras, the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), and the
National Centre for Biological Sciences have lead to the development of
internships in leading edge areas of telecommunications, information technology,
genomics, and neurobiology. In addition to providing a unique research
experience for MIT graduate students, this award contributes to
internationalizing the U.S. workforce, making U.S. students globally
competitive, and creating scientific networks of lasting value.
