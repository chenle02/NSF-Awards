In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Prof. James Phillips of University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire
(UWEC) will conduct experimental and theoretical research on the spectroscopy of
donor-acceptor complexes produced in low-temperature, inert matrices (matrix
isolation spectroscopy). The details of the experimental spectra, combined with
theoretical studies, will be used to gain an understanding of the bonding in
these complexes, and the subtle influences that the matrix has on the
bonding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will make a positive impact
on the science program of UWEC in that the research program is geared towards
studying significant scientific problems and is carried out entirely by
undergraduate students. The work will expose UWEC students to modern
spectroscopic and theoretical techniques. Prof. Phillips has also developed
collaborations with industrial and research university colleagues that help to
enrich the experiences for UWEC students. Additionally, the majority of the
students at UWEC are female and roughly half are low-income/first generation
college students - groups that are historically underrepresented in the
sciences, and roughly half of UWEC's students matriculate to PhD programs.
