This research deals with the chemistry of alpha- hydroxymethylacrylate (HMA)
ester synthesis, polymerization, and characterization. Extension and exploration
of the rich chemistry of various alkyl esters (RHMAs) will make available
polymerizable derivatives possessing halide, ester, ether, silyl ether,
urethane, and amine groups. Many of these will also possess siloxane,
hydrocarbon, and fluorocarbon residues. Reactive oligomers with internal and
terminal groups will be synthesized using a newly- discovered ether-forming
reaction of the RHMA alcohol groups. Also available will be monomers with
supernucleophilic catalyst groups, and monomers capable of forming polymerizable
micelles, vesicles, monolayers, and liquid crystalline states.
Cyclopolymerization of the ether dimers generates pyran-containing polymers with
pendent carboxylate groups with potential anticancer and antiviral activity.
Formation of reactive halides and isocyanates of the RHMA's extends the
functional capability of the monomers and polymers to many other derivatives.
Anionic and group transfer polymerizations of ethers and silyl ethers will allow
isotactic and controlled MW polymer formation. Studies will also deal with
intramolecular 6-membered ring hydrogen bond effects on polymer solubility and
physical properties, steric inhibition of polymerization by a-methyl
substituents, and use of the t-butyl effect to form high molecular weight
cyclopolymers.
