This project is funded from the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)
Sites program in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences.
It has both scientific and societal benefits, and integrates research and
education. This REU site trains students in hands-on skills in research methods
and informal science learning. Students will work on language science research
projects investigating how language is used in a social context, how children
learn to use language in context, and how language understanding is integrated
with other aspects of cognition, such as attention and memory. They will also
learn how to explain complex scientific concepts to the general public in an
engaging and accessible way. Training future researchers to communicate
effectively is critical for maintaining a healthy long-term societal commitment
to good science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Language Sciences Research Lab is a
glass-enclosed space within a premier science museum, in which Ohio State
faculty and students conduct cutting-edge work at the intersection of rigorous
linguistic analysis, social interaction, and cognitive processing. Museum
visitors are able to witness and learn about the studies in progress and are
invited to join in the process as research participants. The REU site provides
students with an integrated experience that trains students in both missions of
the lab: how to conduct language science research and how to communicate with
the public about science. Students experience classroom training in linguistics
and psychology and in informal science education, research activities, and hand-
on work on the museum floor engaging the public using interactive demonstrations
of key language science concepts. The REU site expands the lab's undergraduate
engagement from the Ohio State Columbus campus students to students from
regional campuses and community colleges who might not otherwise be able to be
involved. At the end of the program, each student prepares and presents a
research poster and a novel interactive demo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
