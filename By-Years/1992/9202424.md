This is a Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) effort. The work is a
pilot experiment to determine the feasibility of using a virtual reality
environment with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) for real-time viewing and
manipulation of atoms and molecules. Recent advances make it possible to link a
STM to force feedback and head-mounted display system for new types of
scientific instruments. These instruments will give the user the subjective
experience of presence at the atomic scale on a physical surface. Scanning can
be at video rates for real-time visualization. Force feedback provides the
capability for tactile exploration of the contours of the electronic environment
presented at the atomic, molecular and substrate surfaces. Atoms and molecular
fragments can be manipulated interactively with the probe. The same probe can
cut molecular bonds and bring fragments together for reactions. The products of
resulting reactions can be explored to determine their morphology and other
characteristics. The STM collaborators are Dr. R. Stanley William and graduate
students from the Chemistry Department of UCLA.
