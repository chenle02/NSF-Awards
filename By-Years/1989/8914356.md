In order to understand the dynamics and response of the ionosphere to various
energy inputs requires a knowledge of the ways in which one type of atomic or
molecular ion interacts with the other atmospheric ion and neutral constituents.
This investigation makes use of state of the art laboratory instrumentation for
photo-ion and photo-electron coincidence techniques. Many fundamental absolute
cross-sections that involve charge transfer between selected specific energetic
states of O+ and neutral constituents such as N2, O2 and CO2 producing specific
excited states of N2+, NO+, O2+ and CO+ will be investigated.
