0221215 Impelluso The proposed work will create a 3D finite element (FE) mesh of
the human femur in which each element possesses unique material properties and
principal material directions. The effort will introduce modal analysis into an
algorithm to model bone adaptation. The mesh will be deployed to conduct near
real-time FE analyses, using a new FE code written by the PI and optimized and
parallelized for a massive parallel computer whose output can be viewed in 3D
virtual reality mode at a high performance visualization facility. The ultimate
goal is to bring the power of high performance computing into the surgical ward,
thus enabling the surgeon to visualize the stress shielding consequences of a
particular fixation method.
