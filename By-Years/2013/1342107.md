This project focuses on context-aware security and privacy for RFID systems and
has yielded a number of security and privacy techniques for RFID systems. These
techniques include: &lt;br/&gt;1) Context-aware selective unlocking techniques
to prevent malicious reading of sensitive information stored on RFID tags;
&lt;br/&gt;2) Context-aware transaction verification to secure authentication in
NFC-based mobile payment system&lt;br/&gt;3) Context-aware malware protection to
prevent malicious use of NFC chips and other valuable resources on smartphones.
&lt;br/&gt;The research team has built prototypes on a wireless identification
and sensing platform as well as a smartphone. Experiment results demonstrate the
feasibility of these techniques which are ready for further development. The
objective of this I-Corps project is to further develop contextaware security
and privacy techniques developed by the research team. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
impact of this project is derived from security mechanisms utilizing various
contextual information to provide enhanced security and privacy for RFID
systems. This technology is user-friendly, involving minimal user interruption.
It applies to a wide range of RFID applications including e-identity cards
(e-passport, e-driver license), payment cards (credit card), electronic toll
collection systems, access cards, and medical implants. It has the potential,
for both corporations and individuals, to drastically reduce financial loss from
identity theft due to a compromised e-identity card (passport, driver license)
or payment card. In addition the technology has been developed with ease of use
in mind, and thus will be more attractive to end users.
