Support is provided to support six two-year college faculty, who lead ATE
Centers, to participate in the National Transportation Workforce Development
Summit in April, 2012 and in the meeting of the Council of University
Transportation Centers (CUTC) in June, 2012 and to support three leaders of
University Transportation Centers (UTC) to participate in the ATE PI meeting in
October, 2012. The purpose is to close gaps between 2- and 4-year institutions
in the nation?s career pathways for developing the future transportation
workforce. Two-year college participants learn about the emerging transportation
technologies and workforce needs that can influence the development of new
technical programs. Members of the UTC learn how ATE centers work closely with
industry to support nationwide reform of technician education. Together both
groups can influence the policies needed to support career pathways in
transportation.
