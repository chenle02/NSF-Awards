The International Symposium on Networks-on-Chip (NOCS) is the premier event
dedicated to interdisciplinary research on on-chip, chip-scale, and multichip
package scale communication technology, architecture, design methods,
applications and systems. NOCS brings together scientists and engineers working
on NoC innovations and applications from inter-related research communities,
including computer architecture, networking, circuits and systems, packaging,
embedded systems, and design automation. NOCS has established itself as the
premier conference in this area. With these funds from this student travel
grant, the conference organizers will be able to provide 10-15 travel grants to
students, who may otherwise not be able to attend NOCS and take advantage of the
available learning opportunities in this evolving research area. The grant
recipients will be expected to report their learning experiences once the
conference is over. Special efforts will be made by personal contacts to recruit
student participants who are underrepresented minorities (i.e., African-
Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Native Pacific Islanders) and/or
women, coming from diverse institutions.
