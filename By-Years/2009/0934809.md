This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). The Drexel University Noyce Scholarship Phase II project, in
partnership with the School District of Philadelphia, is enabling 30 science,
technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) mid-career professionals from the
community to earn the credentials they need to teach mathematics and science in
Philadelphia's high need schools. Because these schools have a large proportion
of low-income (80%) student populations and shortages of highly qualified
teachers, the need for high quality instruction is critical. The program
objectives are to 1) Recruit STEM mid-career professionals with strong content
preparation who are dedicated to teaching in high need urban districts; 2)
Provide strong preparation in content knowledge, technology integration,
pedagogical content knowledge and knowledge about urban education issues
especially as they pertain to teaching in high need schools; 3) Provide onsite
well-designed mentoring and induction and resources in the form of teacher
supplies to support teachers in the classroom; 4) Emphasize recruitment of
minorities and persons with disabilities; 5) Ensure compliance to the teaching
requirement; 6) Continue to support and monitor Noyce scholars from the previous
Phase I Noyce award; and 7) Increase the number of students from partnering
schools at Drexel who may see teaching as a viable career choice for mathematics
and science majors. The project is contributing to the knowledge about effective
ways of monitoring teacher performance and how mentoring works.
