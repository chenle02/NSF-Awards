The primary function of the cell nucleolus is to assemble ribosomes that
subsequently move from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where they catalyze the
synthesis of the cell's various proteins. Ribosome assembly is a complex series
of biosynthetic reactions that begins at the gene level and ends with
synthetically functional ribosomes, each of which consists of four RNA molecules
and 80 different proteins. Ribosome assembly is thus a comprehensive paradigm
for gene expression. Disruption of ribosome biosynthesis leads to lethality or
developmental abnormalities. The goals of this research project are to establish
a molecular-genetic approach toward understanding how nucleolar-specific
proteins help assemble ribosomes in multicellular organisms. This project
examines the functions of two closely-related nucleolar proteins in the fruitfly
Drosophila melanogaster. Both proteins are encoded by the same gene, but the
transcripts are processed differently in Drosophila cells, resulting in two
protein variants. One of the two variants is very similar to a vertebrate
nucleolar protein of unknown function called Nopp140. The other Drosophila
variant is unique; it differs from all known vertebrate Nopp140 proteins in that
the normal tail end of Nopp140 is replaced by a peptide domain found in many
RNA-binding proteins. The project will define the developmental and tissue-
specific expression patterns of the two Drosophila Nopp140 variants. Transgenic
techniques will also be used to construct mutant flies with disruptions in
either one or both Nopp140 variants. The effects of Nopp140 gene disruptions
will be assessed by a combination of cytological and biochemical
techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will involve both undergraduate and
graduate students, and special effort will be made to recruit minority students
to the project. In the course of this research, students will gain experience in
modern genetics, cytology and biochemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
