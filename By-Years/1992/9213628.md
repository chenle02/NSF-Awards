This study develops and analyzes comparative data on change in the uses of
computing by a representative selection of greater New York private sector
firms. Returning to the sample studied by Attewell and Rule in the late 1980's,
the proposed research will document changes in computing use and in other basic
features of the original 184 establishments. Detailed telephone interviews will
be carried out with as many of these establishments as possible, and site
interviews will take place in a sub-sample of about fifty. Resulting analyses
should illuminate the form and extent of change in computing activities over
roughly seven intervening years, as well as the determinants of such change.
