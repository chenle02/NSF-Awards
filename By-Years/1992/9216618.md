By means of this award, the Inorganic, Bioninorganic, and Organometallic
Chemistry Program and the Atmospheric Chemistry Program provide support for an
interdisciplinary project on sources of atmospheric nitrous oxide. The work will
be carried out by Dr. William C. Trogler and Dr. Mark H. Thiemens of the
Chemistry Department of the University of California at San Diego. They will
examine the mechanism of decomposition of ammonium nitrate, the reaction of
hydroxylamine and nitric oxide, and other reactions by which nitrous oxide might
be produced. The influence of aerosols and particulates on these processes will
also be investigated. The means of elucidating the reaction mechanism, as well
as linking the nitrous oxide produced by various reactions to nitrous oxide in
the atmosphere, will be isotopic labeling of nitrogen and oxygen. %%% The
concentration of atmospheric nitrous oxide has been increasing in recent years,
but the sources of this increase are not well understood. Trogler and Thiemens
will investigate the details of nitrous oxide production from various reactions
that model potential environmental sources. Trogler's expertise in reaction
mechanisms, catalysis, and photochemistry, and Thiemens' in gas phase kinetics
and mass spectrometry will be helpful in this collaborative effort to examine
these reactions under relevant conditions. Nitrous oxide is a greenhouse gas and
is also involved in the atmospheric ozone balance.
