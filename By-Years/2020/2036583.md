The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project is that it will develop a novel biological glue to enhance knee
cartilage healing. Injuries (e.g., sports-related) or extensive use leads to
deterioration because cartilage does not heal. For repair implants, including
transplants and engineered grafts, securing the implant into the damaged
cartilage and ensuring its growth are critical for successful healing. The
proposed project will develop an advanced adhesive with live cells and other
biological additives to actively encourage integration of the implant into
adjacent cartilage for accelerated healing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
project will advance a biological glue to enhances cartilage healing.
Specifically, this project will increase the stickiness and thickness of the
glue to make its properties comparable or superior to fibrin glue, the
commercially available standard. This project will: (1) explore biological
additives to the active cells and molecular cartilage components already present
in the biological glue and compare performance with the fibrin standard; (2)
examine the biological glueâ€™s ability to secure a cartilage implant into damaged
native cartilage over four weeks in a laboratory model; and (3) assess the glue
durability and healing. Ultimately, it is anticipated that the glue developed in
this project will promote the fixation and integration of cartilage implants
into native cartilage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
