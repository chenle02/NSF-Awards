This group proposes to develop techniques for using pressures above 3 Mbars (to
the highest pressures that diamond can stand) for the study of a variety of
solids under extreme pressures. They intend to use energy dispersive x-ray
diffraction, optical absorption and optical reflectivity measurements to study
primarily the "optical properties" of these solids, which include oxygen,
sulfur, hydrogen and the group IV elements. They intend to extend the studies to
the row 4 iso-electronic series of Ge, GaAs, ZnSe, and CuBr.
