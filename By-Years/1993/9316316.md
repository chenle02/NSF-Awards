9316316 Burnham PI will investigate modern and fossil angiosperm climbers
(lianas). Objectives are to determine the diagnostic foliage characteristics of
climbing angiosperm families, to correlate basic climatic, habitat, and forest
structure characteristics with climber diversity, abundance, and morphology, and
to use these features of systematics and ecology to characterize the forested
habitats of two distinct sites in the early Tertiary of western North America
(Paleocene Raton Formation, NM; Eocene Puget Group, WA). Studies of modern sites
include field work in Central and South America. Results will be important to
studies of plant community evolution, with implications for the impact of
deforestation and global climate change on vegetation.
