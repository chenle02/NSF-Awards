This project will attempt to measure the isotropy of the cosmic microwave
background radiation (CMBR) from South Pole Station. The measurements will be
made by two different instruments working at different angular size scales and
frequencies and using different detection techniques. One of the instruments
will make measurements on an angular scale of 20 minutes at a frequency of 90
GHz using a bolometer detector. The other instrument will measure angular scales
of 4 degrees at a frequency of 19 GHz using a ruby maser detector. The
instruments have the sensitivity to set new upper limits on the anisotropy of
the CMBR, and if they do so it will be necessary to reformulate the current
cosmological theories. A detection of anisotropy would be an important
confirmation of the current theories. This is probably the most important
cosmological measurement that can be made, and the South Pole is the best place
on earth to make it. The institution and the proposer are outstandingly
qualified to perform the experiment. The proposer has developed the instruments
with funding from a Presidential Young Investigator grant especially awarded for
that purpose.
