High-performance computing (HPC) is essential for maintaining the US
international competitive edge and leadership in science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Advances in HPC are vital to national
interests by providing infrastructure for scientific discovery that improves the
national health, prosperity, welfare, and defense. To solve large-scale
scientific problems, HPC relies on an increasing number of nodes and components,
which makes it likelier for long-running computation to be interrupted with
failures before completing. A critical technique to ensure computation
completion is checkpointing. Checkpointing allows snapshots of the computation
to be saved so that when a failure occurs, computation state can be restored
from the last snapshot and continues execution, rather than restarting from the
beginning. The research in this project seeks to advance the state-of-the-art
checkpointing technique by making it significantly faster and lowering its cost.
This project also plans to contribute to the training of future workforce by
providing students with exposure to the mechanisms and inefficiencies of current
checkpointing mechanisms on NVMM, and the new in-place checkpointing. The
project seeks to increase participation of minority and under-represented groups
and involves undergraduates in research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prior approaches
to checkpointing rely on taking a snapshot of the system state (system-level
checkpointing) or the application state (application-level checkpointing) and
saving it to secondary non-volatile storage. With the advent of non-volatile
main memory (NVMM), a new approach to checkpointing becomes possible. In
contrast to traditional approaches to checkpointing that rely on storing
separate snapshots in a separate secondary storage, the project uses a new
approach where checkpoints can be constructed in-place in the NVMM utilizing the
working data structures used by the applications. This allows only very minimal
additional state beyond what the program already saves to memory, making
checkpointing significantly faster and incurring lower cost, in turn providing
further HPC scaling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
