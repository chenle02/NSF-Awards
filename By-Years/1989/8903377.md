Dr. Wing and two graduate assistants will analyze a large series of faunal and
floral remains recovered from archaeological sites in the Caribbean. Included in
this sample are materials from Haiti, Jamaica, the Virgin Islands, Nevis,
Antigua, Barbados and the Bahamas. In particular, the team wishes to reconstruct
subsistence practices across this wide range of islands, see how they changed
over time, and to examine the role played by domesticated and captive wild
species. To accomplish this, analysis will be conducted on assemblages currently
curated at the Florida State Museum as well as other institutions in the United
States. The Caribbean is a particularly interesting region for such a study,
because no indigenous species were domesticated in this region and all are
outside introductions from the South and Central American mainlands. In regions
where domestication takes place, it is extremely difficult to determine the
point in time when the shift from wild to domesticated occurs. In the Caribbean,
however, such is not the case, and it thus should be possible to determine just
when different domesticates enter the diet and then trace their effects over
time. This research is significant because it will provide insight into one of
the most important changes in human prehistory: the shift from a hunting and
gathering way of life to one based on domesticated plants and animals. It will
allow researchers not only to study changes in subsistence practice but also
broader alterations in social organization. The study will also increase our
understanding of how cultures change, and, hopefully, help us predict the
potential effects when improved species are introduced in less developed areas
of the world.
