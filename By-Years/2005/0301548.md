This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2003. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Linking genetic regulatory circuits
to ecophysiological function in fungi that process carbon and nitrogen in forest
ecosystems." This research integrates DNA gene expression profiles and compound
specific isotope analyses to understand the link between genetic regulatory
circuits and ecophysiological function in fungi. The symbiosis between fungi and
plants is selected for study since it represents a microbial system with
coordinated physiologies that encompasses multi-trophic relationships and plays
a dominant role in nutrient cycling.
