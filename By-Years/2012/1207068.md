This project studies various aspects of geometric structures and in particular
real projective structures on manifolds and orbifolds. A uniformly fat
degeneration of convex projective structures gives a limit metric locally
modeled on the affine building for the projective linear group. For surfaces the
general case is called a mixed structure. One project is to understand the
picture in higher dimensions, where there is some kind of stratification by
dimension depending on rates of growth in different directions. Another project
is to study transitions between different homogenous structures within the
setting of projective structures. In particular we hope to determine the graph
with eight vertices representing the Thurston geometries, and edges representing
a transition within projective geometry. Some of this discussion is most
naturally done in the language of nonstandard analysis using infinitesimals. The
study of geometrical properties of space in various dimensions forms the basis
of Einstein's theory of relativity, and the physics of superstring theory. We
experience the curvature of space as gravity. This is all based on Riemannian
geometry which is a way to study different kinds of distance. On the other hand
there is projective geometry. This arose from the study of perspective developed
by artists in the Renaissance and is based on the notion of straight line but
without a notion of distance. This geometry is useful in computer graphics.
Freeing oneself from length and distance introduces added flexibility. Recently
there has been interest in developing this in the context of topology and
applying it to theoretical physics.
