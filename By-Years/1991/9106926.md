The principal investigators will organize and conduct a series of annual
conferences on topics in geometry. The focus will be on differential geometry
reflecting the primary research interests of the organizers. Each conference
will consist of talks by approximately seven speakers spread over a three day
period. This will allow enough time for informal discussion among the
participants. Participants with other National Science Foundation support will
be expected to pay their expenses from individual grants; the highest priority
for funds from this grant shall be graduate students and recent PhDs with no
other source of travel support. This should make it possible for more people to
attend these meetings. Geometry has played an increasingly important role in
mathematics and science. It serves as the medium with which we describe our
surroundings and therefore plays some role in almost every physical model
including those from biology, physics, and material science. This series of
conferences will bring together a group of mathematicians with research
interests in many areas of geometry. Since the solution of so many problems in
mathematics relies on the application of varied techniques, communication and
collaboration are of central importance to a strong mathematical community -
hence the need for conferences such as these.
