9310367 Steward Neurons in the brain are interconnected with one-another forming
many complex circuits. When a neuronal circuit is activated by certain patterns
of activity, there is a change in the strength of the connections between nerve
cells in that circuit. The most typical change is that it subsequently requires
less input to activate the circuit. This is called long-term potentiation (LTP).
LTP is especially prominent in brain regions that are important for learning and
memory and is, therefore, believed to be involved in the mechanism for
information storage in the nervous system. Because the changes induced during
LTP endure for weeks or more, it has been proposed that this change results from
the growth of new connections between neurons. This project will test this
hypothesis directly. Quantitative electron microscopy will be used to determine
if the induction of LTP leads to the formation of new connections between
neurons. The results of this project will potentially offer new insights into
the mechanisms of learning and memory. *** connected with one-another forming
