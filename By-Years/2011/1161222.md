This project is focusing on retaining students who express an interest in STEM
and attracting students already on campus with a demonstrated proficiency in
STEM-related fields. Notre Dame's top-ranked business school attracts many
undergraduates who have the aptitude to succeed in STEM majors. This project is
engaging their interest in engineering and science while ensuring they have the
mathematics background to be successful in STEM. The Colleges of Business,
Science and Engineering are creating new business minors for STEM students, to
provide them with the business background that they desire.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the project is developing a STEM Learning
Community Network on campus by implementing the following programs and
activities: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) introducing Electronic Portfolios
(ePortfolios) as a tool for student planning, reflection, and
advising;&lt;br/&gt;(2) eliminating curricular roadblocks in the introductory
mathematics courses by developing new Bridging Mathematics Course
Modules;&lt;br/&gt;(3) establishing academic year and summer Academic Success
Programs that enhance study skills;&lt;br/&gt;(4) expanding opportunities for
Authentic Professional Experience and Engaged Scholarship for first-year
students through undergraduate research and community-based programs;
and&lt;br/&gt;(5) promoting a STEM-supportive campus culture through a STEM
Student Ambassador Program in the residence halls and other student-led
initiatives&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These activities are increasing the number of
STEM graduates and improving STEM education at Notre Dame. STEM Student
Ambassadors are improving the awareness and appreciation of STEM among all
students on campus, while ePortfolios and the Academic Success Programs are
enhancing student engagement and proficiency for all majors. Community-based
engaged scholarship programs are building partnerships with area K-12 schools,
further promoting STEM learning in the region.
