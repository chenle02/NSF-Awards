9313937 Farmer The project will explore the problems of tunnel-current-induced
defect generation and identification in the ultra-thin (<3.5nm) dielectric layer
of metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) tunnel diodes. This work is of current
importance to the continued scaling of MIS device structures, and shows promise
for revealing new information concerning the defects. Novel tunneling methods
will be used to investigate and model the dynamical, electrical and structural
characteristics of these defects. Both traditional, thermally grown oxides and
new, more robust dielectrics will be studied. ***
