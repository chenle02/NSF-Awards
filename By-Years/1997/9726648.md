9726648 Whitham Biologists have long considered hybridization to be a major
impetus to plant evolution. Mechanisms of how such events influence the
ecological performance of a species are largely unexplored. This research will
consider how variation created by hybridization affects diverse members of an
ecological community. The research will focus on cottonwoods (Populus spp.),
which are important trees in riparian habitats of the western US and known to
hybridize frequently. One of the goals of this project is to discover whether or
not the genetic differences in individuals of hybrid populations in the wild
determine the distribution of invertebrate herbivores. Another is to determine
if hybrid zone size affects the concentration of herbivores. In addition,
common-garden studies will be conducted to determine the underlying mechanisms
that affect hybrid resistance and susceptibility to herbivores. These latter
experiments will allow the investigators to determine the heritability of traits
involved in herbivore resistance. The outcome of this research is likely to
provide new insights into how genetic variation resulting from hybridization
contributes to community level processes. s
