Dr. Durbin has been selected as a Presidential Young Investigator. He is active
in fundamental research on x-ray superlattices grown by molecular beam epitaxy.
In the research program for the National Science Foundation he will pursue
studies to include the application of x-ray and electron dynamical diffraction
phenomena to the investigation of crystal surfaces. The entire program is based
on deriving structural information from the scattered x-ray and electron yields
from crystal-wave field excitations, within the context of dynamical diffraction
theory. By obtaining an understanding of bare crystal surfaces in vacuum, and
then the structures obtained by slowly adding a different atomic species to that
surface, the mechanics of epitaxial growth can be derived. This knowledge is
essential for fabrication of new materials with properties engineered on an
atomic scale.
