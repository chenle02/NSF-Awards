9305349 Brandon This award provides one-half the funds needed to acquire a
research optical microscope and a cathodoluminescence (CL) system to be used in
the Department of Geology and Geophysics at Yale University. Yale University is
committed to providing the remaining funds needed for the acquisition. The
optical microscope and the CL system will be used primarily in geological
research projects where mineral textures and compositions need to be studied in
reflected, transmitted, and induced fluorescent light. ***
