This project is focused on understanding the static and dynamic properties of
weak link arrays (WLA) in superfluid 3He. The WLA consists of a quantum coherent
array of apertures with diameter on the scale of the superfluid coherence
length: typically a few tens of nanometers. Past research has already exposed
several unanticipated features including: bi-stability, p-states, and new
sources of superfluid dissipation. The past research was performed only at zero
ambient pressure. The present project will explore the entire phase diagram of
3He, up to the melting pressure. The specific questions which will be answered
include: What is the form of the current-phase relation, I(f), for all relevant
temperatures and pressures? In the Josephson region, how does the critical
current density scale? What is the limit, if any, to the number of apertures
that will remain coherent in a weak link array? How do the dissipation processes
change at elevated pressure? Are there always two stable states of the weak link
array? Can a Josephson oscillation be driven by a temperature gradient as well
as a pressure gradient? How does the I(f) function change in the transition from
A to B phase? What is the nature of I(f)when there is an A-B bias across the
array? Graduate students trained in the project will learn state-of-the-art
techniques in microfabrication, ultra-cryogenics, SQUID magnetometry, electronic
instrumentation and computer control and analysis.

"Macroscopic quantum" systems span the range from the interior of neutron stars
to ultra-cold Bose-Einstein condensed gases. Relevant systems include
superconductors, both conventional and high Tc, superfluid 4He and superfluid
3He, both A and B phases. It is a major goal of physics to understand why such
diverse systems display phenomena which are generic to the entire class. This
project will be directed toward understanding the physics of weak links in
superfluid 3He. Weak links consist of devices which join two macroscopic quantum
systems into a single, weakly connected whole. In the case of 3He the weak link
is an array of nanometer-sized apertures, micro-machined in a 50nm thick
"window". These devices have been shown to display a variety of unexpected
phenomena, which have already led to a better understanding of superfluidity,
high Tc superconductivity and quantum computing. Since past research has only
covered experiments at zero ambient pressure, the present project will extend
the range of exploration over a wide range of pressure and will include two
different superfluid phases of 3He. To prepare them for future scientific
careers, students participating in the project will receive state-of-the-art
training in a variety of physics techniques including ultra-cryogenics, micro-
machining, ultrasensitive magnetometry, electronics and computer control.
