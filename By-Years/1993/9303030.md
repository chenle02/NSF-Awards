This research investigates instruction-level parallel (ILP) processors. The
goal is to develop processors that can sustain over 10 instructions per cycle
when executing arbitrary non-numeric applications such as compilers, simulators,
CAD, text processing, and database programs. The research builds on the previous
studies of ILP to expand the foundation for ILP processors. A novel paradigm for
ILP processors, the multiscalar processing paradigm, continues to be developed,
with the goal of bringing the multiscalar paradigm into the mainstream of
processor design. Issues relevant to the operation of a multiscalar processor
such as data memory systems, instruction memory systems, inter-operation
communication mechanisms, and task specification and execution, are studied
using detailed simulation models. Also investigated is software support for
multiscalar processors.
