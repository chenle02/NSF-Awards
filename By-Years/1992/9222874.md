This project provides international travel support for the principal
investigator to conduct cooperative studies in Korea and Hong Kong on a short-
term scientific visit basis. The investigator will: (1) work with researchers
from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) to investigate
nonlinear models for low-rise reinforced concrete shear walls and to develop
damage assessment methodology, and (2) to develop a seminar on optimum design
and control of tall buildings with researchers at Hong Kong University of
Science and Technology (HKUST). Both studies are of strong interest to the
United States and the international collaborative component provides a unique
venue for sources and facility leveraging which helps to enhance the chances of
success of the intended research. Both tasks are combined to be carried out in a
single trip to the Far East during the Fall of 1992. The studies will improve
engineering understanding of two important subjects, i.e., seismic shear wall
design and optimum and control of structures and are expected to develop program
framework for future cooperative studies on these subjects.
