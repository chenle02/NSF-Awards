&lt;br/&gt; The project "Design Parameterization for CHD-Based Mechanism
Optimization", is studying how product solid models can be parameterized
following a systematic approach to capture design intents in multiple CAD
systems and determine if an accurate and efficient design sensitivity analysis
can be developed that supports CAD-based mechanism optimization for industrial
applications.&lt;br/&gt;
