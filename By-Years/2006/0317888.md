0317888&lt;br/&gt;Tolstoy&lt;br/&gt;This award to Lamont-Doherty Earth
Observatory (LDEO) of Columbia University in the City of New York provides
support for participation of LDEO researchers in the multi-agency Sperm Whale
Seismic Study (SWSS), an investigation of behavioral response of endangered
sperm whales to anthropogenic sound. LDEO plans to participate in the 2003 field
season operations in the Gulf of Mexico, providing the R/V Ewing as a research
platform for interdisciplinary research, and conducting an investigation of
acoustic source and transmission properties of the R/V Ewing airgun arrays and
other acoustic sources on the vessel. The present award will cover costs to
modify an existing spar buoy as an acoustic receiver for the field program in
Gulf of Mexico, as well as participation in the experiment. It will also support
a postdoctoral researcher to analyze and model data from the Ewing array, and it
will support a study of acoustic propagation from a R/V Ewing cruise in the Gulf
of California in fall 2002.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
