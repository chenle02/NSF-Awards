This project is concerned with the application of adaptive control techniques in
the development and analysis of structures imbedded with intelligent/smart
materials. For example, structures such as a cantilever beam embedded with a
bulk material having "smart" properties will be considered; and, the distributed
actuator such as current, voltage and/or applied magnetic field will be used to
control the properties of the smart material so as to control/suppress the
vibrations. We propose to use an embedded distributed sensor in conjunction with
embedded distributed actuators to achieve the total internal sensing and motion
control tasks. By this, the spillover phenomena associated with a "truncated"
model due to neglected modes can be minimized. Possible applications of this
work are in the fields of aeronautics, space and atomic energy development.
Materials for use under severe environmental conditions not only should have
high reliability, but functions such as self-diagnosis, damage resistance, self-
repair, or notification of residual life should be provided to avoid accidents.
The project will consist of the following steps: Modeling and analysis
comprising the development and implementation of parameter estimation
algorithms, development of control policies concerning passive and active
control of structures and updating periodically material characteristics
(smartly) to adjust the controller parameters (for adaptive control). Some new
and novel techniques in the parameter estimation and adaptive control of
parameter-distributed system will be evolved on the basis of distributed
actuators and sensors measurements.
