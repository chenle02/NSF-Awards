*** 9661637 Romero In Phase I, TDA will fabricate dense, crack-free zeolite
membranes supported on the interior of a porous alumina support tube. The
increase in styrene production in a packed bed catalytic reactor, packed with a
commercial iron oxide catalyst will be demonstrated. The reaction will be
conducted in a reactor with and without the zeolite membrane to quantify the
improvement achieved with the membrane, and carry out an engineering analysis.
In Phase II they plan to optimize the preparation of supported zeolite
membranes, carry out a thorough investigation of the effects of temperature,
pressure and steam dilution on mechanical stability and yield improvement,
regeneration capability, and aging, and perform an extensive engineering
analysis. The commercialization of a zeolitic molecular sieve membrane reactor
to shift the equilibrium of the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene
towards the products could increase styrene yields, and decrease downstream
separation costs in this high-volume production process. This would result in a
significant cost savings for the industry. ***
