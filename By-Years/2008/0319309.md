Evergreen State College has been given a grant to create database tools for the
emerging area of ecological forest canopy studies. The project will include
further development of the Canopy Databank and significant additions of data and
functionality to it. It will also create a new module for enhanced 3-D spatial
models of forest ecology and operational definitions of structural diversity
that can be used to test hypotheses about structure-function relationships. The
project promotes best data practices among ecological data generators by
providing an appropriate data structure and repository. It will also provide
advanced visualization tools that will inform K-12 and public policy education
as well as empowering ecologists to do analyses not before possible.
