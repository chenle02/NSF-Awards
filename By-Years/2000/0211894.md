In this project funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, David Blank will develop and apply novel experimental
methods designed to address the role of intermolecular and low frequency
intramolecular nuclear motions in condensed-phase reactive and nonreactive
chemical dynamics. The experiments utilize multidimensional femtosecond
spectroscopic techniques, and can be divided into two types, based on the
complementary information each will provide. First, the response of low
frequency motions in response to the progress of a dynamic event in solution
will be probed by photo-initiating that event with an ultrafast laser pulse, and
monitoring the response using third-order time domain Raman spectroscopy.
Second, the coupling between low frequency motions in condensed systems will be
directly measured using a new resonance enhanced version of coherent two-
dimensional time domain Raman spectroscopy. These studies are expected to enable
new insights into low frequency motions in solution phase chemical
reactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The significant proportion of chemistry, from
industrial reactions to the chemistry of biology, takes place in the solution
phase. This project aims at providing a microscopic description of chemical
reactivity in solution, one of the central issues in physical chemistry today.
The proposed methods are direct and generally applicable techniques that will
aid in understanding the scientific issues involved. This work has applications
ranging from modern optics and metrology to advanced materials characterization
and fundamental research in condensed matter. As part of this research effort,
students from the undergraduate through the postdoctoral level are trained with
state-of-the-art instrumentation in ultrafast laser technology, an emerging
field in the physical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;
