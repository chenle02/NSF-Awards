The incorporation of a state-of-the-art high speed refrigerated centrifuge and
preparative ultracentrifuge are improving the laboratory part of the curriculum
by allowing students to perform experimental protocols in, for example,
subcellular fractionation, plasmid isolation, and protein and DNA separations.
This should facilitate the understanding of fundamental principles of modern
molecular biology. The equipment should also foster a greater diversity in
student research projects, by making available the instrumentation necessary for
performing macromolecular level separations. The college will contribute an
amount equal to the award.
