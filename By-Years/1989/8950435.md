This project provides the instrumentation for a machinery dynamics measurements
capability within the mechanical systems laboratory. This capability allows
students to experience and quantify many dynamic effects that are not observable
first hand. The main items of equipment are a high speed, computer controlled
data acquisition system, the associated microcomputer, and supporting software
for controlling the computer and data reduction and analysis. This award is
being matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
