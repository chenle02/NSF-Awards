Algebraic sets are solutions of polynomial systems. Exploiting the sparse
structure of a polynomial system, polyhedral homotopies are optimal for
computing all isolated solutions of general systems in the sense that every
solution path converges to a solution. The goal of this proposal is to develop
new homotopy algorithms that will be generically optimal for computing numerical
representations of positive dimensional solution sets. To solve large polynomial
systems, the new homotopy algorithms will be made suitable to run on
supercomputers.

Polynomial systems arise frequently in many problems in science and engineering.
The algorithms to solve polynomial systems are implemented in an open source
software package PHCpack, available for free on the web. User-friendly
interfaces to PHCpack (in computer algebra systems such as Maple (commercial),
SAGE (open source), and in scientific software systems such as MATLAB
(commercial), Octave (open source)) will continue to benefit many scientists and
engineers who solve polynomial systems in their research. The principal
investigator teaches his students to transfer mathematical technology through
software with an eye towards high performance computing.
