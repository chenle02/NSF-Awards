The PIs propose to continue a long-term project to modify the taxonomic system
(mostly at the family and generic level) of most radiolarian groups and to
determine the stratigraphic range of the newly defined groups. The large data
set is being compiled from studies of Deep Sea Drilling Project and Ocean
Drilling Program cores collected throughout the ocean. The proposed research
will deal with a group of radiolarians intermediate between two other groups
previously studied by the PI. The results of this study will provide a clearer
understanding of the nature of speciations through time in an important group of
microplankton.
