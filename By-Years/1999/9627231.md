9627231 Abbatt In this project, experimental studies of heterogeneous processes
involving halogen species important in determining the photochemical steady
state of the troposphere will be performed. The majority of the work will focus
upon aspects of bromine heterogeneous chemistry as it relates to the phenomenon
of ozone depletion in the Arctic boundary layer in the springtime. Particular
interactions to be studied are those of HOBr, HBr, BrO and brominated organic
species with tropospheric particulate surfaces. The goal of these experiments is
to better define the mechanism by which bromine is maintained in a form active
towards gas-phase ozone destruction and to determine the dominant source of
inorganic bromine. Motivated by observations which indicate large amounts of
active chlorine during these ozone depletion events, studies of chlorine
heterogeneous chemistry which may be an integral part of this phenomenon will
also be carried out. Experimentally, these studies will be performed using a
combination of experimental techniques. Gas-surface uptake coefficients and
reaction probabilities will be measured both in a high pressure, aerosol flow
tube recently constructed in this laboratory and in a standard low pressure,
coated-wall flow tube. To determine the partitioning of brominated species
between the gas and condensed phases, mass spectrometry will be used to measure
the equilibrium vapor pressures of stable species dissolved in solutions and to
measure the physical uptake of gas-phase species by thin films. Finally, FTIR
absorption spectroscopy will be used to monitor the phase and composition of the
aerosols within the aerosol flow tube. These experiments will be performed under
conditions of aerosol composition, temperature and relative humidity which match
as closely as possible those prevalent in the atmosphere. ***
