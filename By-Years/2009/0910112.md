A fundamental question in evolutionary biology is how biodiversity evolves and
is maintained. In many species, males vary markedly in anatomical,
physiological, and behavioral traits that constitute discrete alternative
strategies for obtaining mates. A proposed mechanism for the maintenance of such
variation is frequency dependence, which states that if a given male strategy
becomes rare its success in reproductive competition will increase relative to
the other strategies therefore preventing its extinction. In the fish
Xiphophorus nigrensis, there are two strategies that are correlated with male
body size, small 'sneaker' males that pre-empt female choice by forcing
copulations and larger 'courting' males that produce behavioral displays females
find attractive. To test the frequency dependence hypothesis, sneaking and
courting male X. nigrensis will be distributed at different frequencies in semi-
natural enclosures and their reproductive success measured using genetic
markers. The success of the strategies in nature will also be measured by
comparing strategy frequency in the adult population to strategy frequency in a
sample of offspring collected from pregnant females. In addition, this study
will examine the effects of frequency dependence on the genetic diversity within
individual broods produced by females. Sneaker male X. nigrensis produce
ejaculates that contain both a higher proportion of living sperm and sperm that
is longer lived, and as a result it is expected that variation in the quality of
sperm between strategies will influence the rates of multiple paternity. This
research will broaden our understanding of how frequency dependence affects
patterns of genetic variation both at the population level and among offspring
within broods. The broader impacts of this project involve training of a
graduate student, mentorship of undergraduates and outreach to elementary school
children.
