ABSTRACT OPP-9732076 WALKER, DONALD UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO The project will
investigate the relationship between climate change, tundra ecosystem, and soil
type as part of a multidisciplinary project that addresses the impact of global
change on land-atmosphere-ice interactions (LAII) in the Arctic. Regional scale
variations in climate gradient and vegetation will be compared to soil type by
producing circumarctic maps of vegetation from satellite imagery in combination
with field work to verify vegetation and soil classifications. The regional maps
and climate models will be used to project the effects of a warming climate on
the carbon cycle, exchanges of trace gas fluxes, water and energy, permafrost,
and the hydrological cycle. The results of this project will be used in
combination with other LAII projects to determine the regional impacts of global
change on terrestrial systems in the Arctic.
