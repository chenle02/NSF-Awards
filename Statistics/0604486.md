Documents are written with a specific audience in mind that varies across
several dimensions. One such dimension is the readability level, which may vary
from elementary child readability to adult readability. The investigator
developd statistical models for readability prediction and experiment with
different alternatives. As most standard representations of documents are not
well described using Euclidean geometry, the investigator directd his research
at non-Euclidean modeling of the word histogram or term-frequency
representation. Specifically, the task is that of non-linear regression where
the covariates are points in the simplex, but do not obey Euclidean geometry.
The task of predicting the readability of documents is an important one. A
likely implication of advances in this area is improvement in matching
readability level with documents retrieved by search systems. This in turn will
positively effect children and non-native speakers of English in their internet
searches and other automated textual efforts. As the research is
interdisciplinary it is expected to bring together and foster future
collaboration between the communities of statistics, machine learning and
information retrieval.
