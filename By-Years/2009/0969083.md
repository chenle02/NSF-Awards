This award supports the Boulder School for Condensed Matter and Materials
Physics. This is an annual summer school held in Boulder, Colorado, at the
University of Colorado. The goal of the School is to bridge the gap between
graduate training and research by providing advanced graduate students and
beginning postdoctoral researchers access to specialized training not readily
available through graduate programs at any one institution. The School is also
intended to foster a sense of community among junior researchers. Through online
resources that are broadly available, the School is an educational resource for
the community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Schools typically run for four weeks in July
each year and utilize facilities provided by the University of Colorado. Each
school has about sixty students and twenty lecturers. Lectures expose the
students to a wide range of subjects in forefront condensed matter and materials
physics; topics that are often not available at students' home institutions.
Members of underrepresented groups are always in attendance, as well as a number
of international students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The School has become an
institution that plays an important role in the condensed matter and materials
physics community. Through a diverse and evolving set of lectures, posted on the
School's website, and proposed to be webcast and video-recorded, it contributes
to the community well beyond student participants attending the School.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each summer school also presents one or two public
lectures for the Denver area community. Schools also expose local teachers
participating in NSF's Research Experience for Teachers program and high school
students to modern material science.
