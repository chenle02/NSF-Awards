This study harnesses the predictive power of numerical relativity simulations to
investigate extreme astrophysical systems. The work is organized in three
activities areas: 1) compact object binaries and a sandbox of simulation data,
2) massive black holes in astrophysical environments, and 3) compact object
mergers in scalar-tensor theories of gravity. The effort involves postdocs and
students working in an interdisciplinary environment fostering interactions and
collaborations with researchers in computing science and
engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Numerical relativity has truly become a tool
of discovery, enabling conversations between astrophysics and scientists from
many areas focussed on the intricacies of analyzing interferometric detector
data. This study is aimed at enhancing the impact numerical relativity is having
on gravitational wave physics, astrophysics and cosmology. The work focuses on
multi-scale/multi-physics problems where gravity displays its strongest grip,
situations such as the collision of black holes in astrophysical environments
for which the tools of numerical relativity provide the only avenue to gain new
insights and to make observational predictions.
