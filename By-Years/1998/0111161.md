Dr. James A. Cowan, Chemistry Department, Ohio State University, is supported by
the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division for investigations into the mechanism of mitochondrial Fe-S
cluster assembly. Recent characterization of gene products that are putatively
involved in biosynthetic cluster assembly allows consideration of a range of
molecular mechanisms that underlie the chemistry of cluster biogenesis. The
understanding of the details of the cellular pathways requires the
characterization of such proteins and the elucidation of their functional
chemistry. Accordingly, this project will focus on a systematic investigation of
two proteins implicated in mitochondrial ironsulfur cluster biosynthesis: IscU
and IscA. The structure and function of these Fe-S cluster-containing proteins
will be characterized. Particular attention will be paid to the elucidation of
cognate protein partners, mechanisms of iron/sulfur transfer, and the role of
redox chemistry in mediating these pathways.

Iron sulfur clusters are essential metal cofactors that are involved in
mitochondrial respiration, cell signaling pathways, transcriptional and
translational control in gene regulation, metal ion homeostasis, the biological
chemistry of reactive oxygen species, and novel mechanisms for enzymatic
catalysis. This study will probe the fundamental, but as yet unanswered
questions of how such centers are synthesized in vivo, what proteins are
involved in the syntheses, and how the proteins function?
