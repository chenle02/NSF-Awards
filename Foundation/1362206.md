In this project, the PI Russell Miller will continue his work using
computability theory to analyze the difficulty of problems in other areas of
mathematics. These areas include field theory, commutative and differential
algebra, model theory, and number theory, as well as the possibility of
describing uncountable structures and studying them effectively. Traditional
computability theory examines the capabilities of digital computers and the
limits on the problems which can be solved using such computers. Since the
pioneering work of Alan Turing, it has been known that many problems cannot be
solved by any digital computer running any program whatsoever. Even these
"noncomputable" problems can be ranked by difficulty, however: problem A is
easier (or at least, no more difficult) than problem B if we can show how a
hypothetical program solving B would allow us to solve A as well. Indeed, in
certain cases we can learn whether a particular problem is computable or not by
determining where related noncomputable problems sit in this hierarchy.
Recently, the PI has made contributions ranging from solutions to concrete
problems about deciding whether certain polynomial equations can be satisfied
using rational numbers, to more abstract questions about the difficulty of
solving algebraic differential equations and the relative difficulty of
considering structures from different areas of mathematics.

The PI recently collaborated with several number theorists to produce new
evidence for the undecidability of Hilbert's Tenth Problem for the rational
numbers, the problem which asks for an algorithm to decide which Diophantine
equations have rational solutions. He plans to continue this work, considering
the specific question of subrings of the rationals of density 0 (i.e., "very
close" to the integers). In field theory, he has made substantial progress, both
by asking and answering natural computable-model-theoretic questions about the
difficulty of computing isomorphisms between fields, and also by using
computability theory to answer general questions about the complexity of fields
in relation to the complexity of other mathematical structures. He hopes to
address a key question in differential algebra, whose solution would help
mathematicians better understand differentially closed fields and solutions to
differential equations. (These are analogous to algebraically closed fields, but
are much less well understood at present.) For some years now he has taken the
lead in introducing computability techniques to researchers throughout
mathematics, and has often been able to interest such people in his questions
and his methods. With this grant, those efforts will most certainly continue.
