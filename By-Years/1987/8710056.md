The proposed researh will analyze the distribution of juvenile hormone (JH)
receptor proteins in fat body nuclei of melanoplus bivittaus. JH stimulates
synthesis of egg yolk protein by grasshopper fat body, and JH receptors are
thought to convert the hormone signal to activity at the gene level. A
combination of methods used to isolate chromatin, nuclear matrix, and steroid
acceptor sites from chromatin will be adapted to analyze JH receptors. Agents
such as ionic and non-ionic detergents, neutral and chaotropic salts, and site
specific enzymes will be used along with immunological techniques and Western
blots currently being developed to simplify receptor identification. Tissues
from females, males, and nymphs will be used to judge the physiological
importance of receptor distribution within nuclei. Long-term goals include
analyses of regulation of receptor synthesis in target and nontarget tissues, of
receptor evolution, and of gene regulatory sites. The principles of JH action as
determined for the grasshopper should be equally valid for other insects, and
additional knowledge of JH action may allow design of chemicals that target the
insect hormone pathway to control populations with no harm to vertebrates.
