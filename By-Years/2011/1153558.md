Existing techniques for reasoning about the behavior and correctness of software
running on multi-processor computers assume that each location in the shared
memory always has a single, unique value as observed by the processors. But, on
modern computer systems, this assumption is false---programs executing on
different processors may simultaneously observe different values for some
locations in memory. As a consequence, when applied to some important classes of
programs, existing reasoning techniques may falsely assert that an incorrect
program is in fact correct, thus potentially leading to runtime errors or even
security breaches. The goal of this research project is to develop foundational
theories and automatic, practical tools for program reasoning that are correct
for such modern multi-processor computer systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
theory consists of a Hoare-style program logic, which deeply incorporates the
specifics of the x86 memory model, and which can be used to give rigorous, high-
level proofs of partial correctness properties of C-like, multi-threaded
programs. The logic is inspired by separation logic, and embodies a x86-specific
principle of local reasoning, which allows specifications and proofs to be
restricted to just those resources used at runtime, instead of the global system
state. The project additionally includes program checkers based on this logic,
for automatically constructing proofs of partially-specified programs. Using
these tools, the project intends to target, in particular, concurrent data
structures: concurrent, and typically race-prone implementations of traditional
sequential data structures, which carefully omit locks and other synchronization
instructions to maximize concurrent throughput.
