Soybean is an important legume crop that supplies more than half of the worldâ€™s
vegetable oil and protein. Soybean cyst nematode (SCN) is the most damaging
soybean pest worldwide, causing over $1.5 billion yearly yield loss in U.S.
soybean production. Deploying SCN-resistant soybean varieties is the most
efficient and environmentally friendly strategy for managing SCN damage. But
this strategy is challenging because SCN populations evolve rapidly, and the
current SCN-resistant soybean varieties are losing resistance. To solve this
significant problem, the critical first steps are to identify new genetic
resources with broad-spectrum SCN resistance and to uncover its underlying
molecular mechanism. This project convenes an interdisciplinary group of
researchers with expertise in various cutting-edge plant biology, including
multi-omics, systems biology, functional genetics, plant physiology,
phenotyping, and computational biology. The main objective is to uncover novel
molecular mechanisms of broad nematode resistance in wild soybean (Glycine
soja), the wild ancestor of cultivated soybeans. The results will inform the
development of new soybean varieties with broad nematode resistance, which has a
significant positive impact on agriculture and environmental sustainability in
the U.S. and the world. This research will also provide opportunities to train
omics-enabled plant biologists and high-school teachers.

This project will leverage the newly identified wild soybean (Glycine soja)
genotype with broad-spectrum soybean cyst nematode (SCN) resistance to unravel
the molecular mechanisms underlying its broad resistance. Preliminary studies
showed that the well-known mechanisms in the current soybean cultivars could not
explain the wild soybean resistance, indicating novel mechanisms for defending
against SCN. Rather than targeting a single well-studied SCN type, this
innovative research will focus on multiple less-studied, but widespread SCN
types. This is the first study to dissect the novel mechanisms of broad SCN
resistance in wild soybean through integrating population genomics, multi-omics,
systems analyses, and genome editing. The results will deepen our understanding
of the molecular mechanisms underlying plant nematode defense and inform the
development of soybean varieties with broad-spectrum nematode resistance.
Additionally, we will use this study to showcase the utility of crop wild
relatives, evolutionary principles, and systems biology tool-kit in improving
crops for stress resilience and increased yield.
