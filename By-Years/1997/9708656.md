IBN-9708656 PI: MOODY The neurons that populate the mammalian brain are
generated during embryonic development from cells that line the ventricles.
These cells divide repeatedly, and then migrate away from the ventricles to
populate the brain itself. It is critically important that the processes of
division and migration occur correctly in order for the brain to develop
normally. Although it is well known that mature neurons in the brain use
electrical signalling to process information, there is also some evidence that
modified forms of electrical signalling are used during the processes of
division and migration that create the brain during early embryogenesis. Dr.
Moody will use quantitative techniques to record electrical signals from
individual cells lining the ventricles of the embryonic mouse brain to determine
how such signals are used in early brain development. By using living slices of
embryonic brain tissue, it will be possible to identify individual cells
according to their state of division and migration, and to then detemine the
exact nature of the electrical signals they can generate. Once this is
understood, specific drugs that block different aspects of those signals will be
used to determine whether normal patterns of division and migration require this
type of signalling. Results from this project will allow us to understand
whether the normal adult forms of electrical communication between neurons in
the brain are also used in modified form to mediate critical aspects of neural
development.
