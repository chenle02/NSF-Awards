The Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) proposes to run six
regional workshops over three years to help local faculty design and implement
changes to their programs consistent with the recommendations of the SIAM Report
on Mathematics in Industry (MII). The emphasis of these workshops will be on
facilitating local action by working directly with faculty and local industry,
where applicable. In addition, emphasis will be placed on exploring means of
providing relevant applied, nonacademic mathematical experiences for students at
locations where there is no appropriate local industry. One of the conclusions
that was reached early in the MII study is that universities and colleges need
more experience and incentive in exploring interdisciplinary programs and
identifying and working with industry. This project will provide an opportunity
for university and college departments to obtain some insight into how to gain
this experience.
