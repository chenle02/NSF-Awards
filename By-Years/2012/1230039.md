This project supports a workshop entitled `` DATA-DRIVEN ENERGY SYSTEMS: From
Data Collection to Information Technology for Sustainable Services?? to be held
at Carnegie Mellon University on March 12-14, 2012. It is a part of the 8th
Carnegie Mellon University Electricity Conference that provides a venue for
structured brainstorming by the thought leaders in multiple communities. One of
the key premises in this workshop is that IT-enabled flexible utilization of
assets is key to sustainable energy services. However, the challenge is enormous
as the industry paradigm shifts from the predictive, worst-case centralized data
management to highly distributed interactive data and resource management.
Invited talks by the academic, industry and government participants will be
presented to pose these problems more formally, to assess state-of-the-art, and
to investigate new approaches. The conference proceedings will provide a point
of reference for future research and education.
