The proposed research will concern three areas of ecology and population
biology: food webs, infectious diseases, and age- structured populations. Food
webs describe which species eat which other species in a community of species.
Many food webs observed in real communities have led to a mathematical model
that appears to unify and explain (for the first time) a number of these
empirical generalizations. The proposed research will test this mathematical
model against further empirical observations and attempt to incorporate and
explain other regularities about the roles of body size and distribution of
biomass in communities. The goal of this basic research is to establish a better
understanding of the structure of ecological communities. The hope is that good
scientific tools will eventually become available to help solve applied
problems, such as the accidental or intentional introduction of new species, the
design of nature reserves and closed ecological life support systems, and the
concentration of toxins and pollutants by ecological processes. Infectious
diseases are a classical problem of public health, and a scientifically
rewarding area in which study fundamental problems of population biology. One
specific problem to be investigated is how to predict the effect of malaria
control programs on death rates in developing countries. A mathematical model
will be developed and calibrated against a real malaria control program in
Africa. Another specific problem to be investigated is why hosts and parasites
have so many strategies of defense (e.g., antibody clones) and attack (e.g.,
antigenic variants or strains). Age-structured populations include human
populations, many other animal populations and many plant populations. A common
problem is to estimate future numbers of individuals in each age class. The goal
of the proposed work is to develop improved techniques for preparing
projections, and estimates of the uncertainty of projections, that take account
of random variation in the birth and death rates that the population has
experienced and will experience.
