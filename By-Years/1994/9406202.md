The notion of types is an important concept in both the design of programming
languages and in the theoretical investigations of programming languages. While
a significant understanding of type theoretic issues in a programming language
context exists, fairly basic questions remain open. Similarly, while it has been
suggested that sophisticated type systems enhance the expressive power of
languages, very little has been done to set-up a formal work to investigate this
idea. Two related issues form the core of this work: language expressiveness,
and types and operational semantics. A notion of expressiveness for typed
programming languages is described. The expressive power of a language relative
to another is measured by comparing the sets of abstract data types
implementable in the two languages. Preliminary results suggest that the
resulting expressiveness hierarchy of programming languages in non-trivial. This
research conducts a detailed investigation into the relationship between this
notion of expressiveness, and various type disciplines and language mechanisms.
Answers to these questions have a definite impact on the design of programming
languages. The research investigates some questions about types in an
operational semantics context; these are related to questions studied in the
context of lambda calculus and type theory. Two specific classes of questions
that are addressed follow: (1) orthogonal extension questions: does type system
A, when added to a languages based on type system B, invalidate any existing
observational equivalences; and (2) type isomorphism questions: given a pair of
types in a programming language is there a pair of definable functions (from one
to the other) which are observationally inverse. These lead to further questions
about axiomatization of observational equivalence in fragments of typed
programming languages.
