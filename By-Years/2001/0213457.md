Professor Drueckhammer proposes to develop a general computer-based design
method for molecular recognition using the software CAVEAT. CAVEAT will first be
used to identify structures on which to position functional groups in a precise
relative orientation for the desired molecular recognition. Sialic acid
receptors, PNA mimics for DNA recognition, and zinc and copper ion receptors
will be designed and prepared during the course of this work. A collaboration
with the CAVEAT developer will also enable the design of new CAVEAT databases
which have host scaffoldings which are more easily synthesized.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
Program is supporting the research of Dr. Dale G. Drueckhammer of the Department
of Chemistry at the State University of New York in Stony Brook. Dr.
Drueckhammer and his students will work on the development of computer based
methods to design and synthesize small molecule receptors. They will be
designing and preparing molecules capable of carbohydrate recognition, DNA
recognition and metal ion binding. The work also has potential broader
implications in being able to rationally design and synthesize a variety of
sensing devices. Students trained during the course of this interdisciplinary
work will be learning both computational and synthetic organic chemistry and, as
such, gaining skills needed by the pharmaceutical and speciality chemicals
industries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
