This project focuses on two related topics in algebraic geometry, the study of
solutions of systems of polynomial equations, that are motivated by their
connections with physical theories (string theory and gauge theory). The first
topic is Gromov-Witten (GW) theory, which roughly speaking is about a systematic
way of counting numbers of curves with particular constraints in a space defined
by a set of polynomial equations. For example on a plane there are four conics
passing three given points and two given lines in general positions. The second
topic is Donaldson-Thomas (DT) theory, which studies properties of the space
parametrizing sets of polynomials defining one dimensional objects with certain
topological constraints in a space. In a so-called Calabi-Yau space, a series of
remarkable conjectures say that counting using GW theory is equivalent to that
using DT theory. Different branches of mathematics are linked together by these
two theories and deep properties of geometric objects have been uncovered by
calculating invariants they give rise to. In this project the PI will
investigate a conjectured duality between these two theories and relate them to
other branches of mathematics and physics.

In more detail, the projects in this proposal are designed to study several
aspects of enumerative properties of the moduli spaces of geometric objects in
algebraic geometry. The first topic is Gromov-Witten theory. The PI will study
birational transformations between GW invariants, calculate the quantum
cohomology of symplectic Deligne-Mumford stacks, and relate the monodromy of the
quantum connections to the monodromy coming from the equivalence between the
derived categories. The second topic is Donaldson-Thomas theory. The PI will
study local DT invariants via Berkovich analytic spaces, apply the cotangent
invariants of the PI and R. Thomas to find more dualities for geometric spaces,
and investigate the motivic Donaldson-Thomas invariants by the method of motivic
integration.
