9707261 Shivaji The Third Mississippi State Conference on DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
&amp; COMPUTATIONAL SIMULATIONS will be held May 16 and 17, 1997 at Mississippi
State University. There are nine invited principle speakers. These are: Walter
Allegretto, University of Alberta, Canada, Microsensor Analysis and Simulation
Jerry L. Bona,University of Texas, Stability and Instability of Solitary Waves
and Associated Singularity Formation Djairo de Figueiredo, University of
Campinas, Brazil, Decay, Symmetry and Existence of Positive Solutions of
Semilinear Elliptic Systems S. Godunov, Sobolev Institute of Mathematics,
Russia, Spectral Stratification in Models of Finite Elements for Elliptic
Problems Anthony Jameson, Princeton University, Title to be announced Jean
Mawhin, Universite de Louvain, Belgium, Floquet Boundary Value Problems for
Nonlinear Differential Equations: A Blend of Topology and Symmetry Stanley
Osher, University of California, The Level Set Method: What's In It For You?
Klaus Schmitt, University of Utah, Bifurcation Problems for Variational
Inequalities Joseph Shang, Wright Patterson Air Force Base, High Resolution
Schemes for Computational Electromagnetics in the Time Domain This
interdisciplinary conference will provide a joint forum where mathematicians,
scientists, and engineers from academia and industry can exchange research ideas
involving theoretical and applied developments in differential equations and
computational simulations. In addition to the nine principal lecturers, there
will be sessions of contributed talks. This conference is held bi-annually.
Reviewed manuscripts will be published as a special issue of the Electronic
Journal of Differential Equations. Information on the conference is available on
the conference home web page: http://www.msstate.edu/Dept/Math/conf.html
