Neubert 9973212 The investigators systematically develop and analyze
mathematical models of biological invasions. Their aim is to understand how
three key factors (species interactions, environmental heterogeneity, and
demographic stochasticity) affect the invasion process. The models take the form
of systems of nonlinear integrodifference equations. They test their models with
data from a nascent, biologically simple invasion: the spread of lupine and its
caterpillar herbivore into the Pumice Plains region of Mount St. Helens
following its 1980 eruption. Invasions by exotic species -- species like zebra
mussels, gypsy moths, and purple loosestrife -- are occurring more frequently
than ever before. In one recent year, 456 million exotic plants were imported
into the United States. The biological and economic consequences of these
invasions can be dramatic; estimates of the damage done to agricultural crops by
exotic species run in the billions of dollars. A key to controlling the spread
of exotic species is a scientific understanding of the factors that determine
how fast they spread across the landscape. One way to obtain this understanding
is through the use of mathematical models of the invasion process. The
investigators construct and analyze invasion models that incorporate an
important biological reality that has often been missing in other studies: the
fact that invaders interact both with their prey and often with simultaneously
introduced predators and competitors. They test the predictions of their models
with data from actual biological invasions that occurred in the wake of the
eruption of Mount St. Helens. The insight they gain from these studies will help
environmental managers deal more effectively with invading nonnative pest
species. The project is supported by the programs of Applied Mathematics and of
Computational Mathematics and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in MPS
and by the programs of Population Biology and of Ecology in BIO.
