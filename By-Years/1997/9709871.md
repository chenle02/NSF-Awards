9709871 Levent The objective of this SGER award is to create a comprehensive
hydrometeorological data base for the recent flooding events that occurred in
Northern California during December 1996 through January 1997. This data base
will include the watersheds draining into San Joaquin River, the Russian River,
the Sacramento River, the Feather/Yuba River and the Truckee River. The
Hydrologic and atmosheric data, collected in time and space, will be obtained
from Federal, State and local agencies and organizations. This data base then
will be complied in an ARC/INFO Geographic Information System and stored in
special 8mm tapes so that it can be accessible to any researcher or practitioner
interested in developing improved methods for the prediction and
control/management of floods. ***
