This research is on the development of methods for synthesis and verification of
asynchronous circuits. The approach is to extend approximation techniques for
state exploration, that have been successfully applied to speed-independent
circuits, to semi-custom timed circuits. Tools and techniques being developed
include: 1. estimators of circuit area, performance, and power at architectural,
gate, and circuit levels; 2. a synthesis tool that accepts behavioral
specifications and derives gate-level circuits; and 3. a hierarchical
verification tool for timed circuits. The verification and synthesis tools are
integrated so as to support advanced logic optimizations.
