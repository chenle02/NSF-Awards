This award is to support a workshop designed to explore the potential
participation of U.S. investigators, through the U.S. Antarctic Program, in the
"Cape Roberts Project," a stratigraphic drilling project with target sites in
the southwestern Ross Sea. This project has developed and evolved through the
course of meetings held both as international workshops and as less formal
meetings in conjunction with other professional scientific meetings. Other
potential participants in this project are New Zealand, Italy, Germany, and
Japan. Scientific objectives for drilling include several problems in the
paleobiogeography and glacial history of the Ross Sea and problems in the
tectonic history of the Ross Sea region. The workshop will be held at the Byrd
Polar Research Center at The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, during
spring of 1993.
