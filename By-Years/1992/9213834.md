This career advancement award supports the research of Professor Meuser to study
the Igusa local zeta function. In particular she plans to explore connections
between the explicit form of the local zeta function and the geometry of the
associated variety. This project falls into the general area of arithmetic
geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number
theory and geometry. This combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful -
having recently solved problems that withstood generations. Among its many
consequences are new error correcting codes. Such codes are essential for both
modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
