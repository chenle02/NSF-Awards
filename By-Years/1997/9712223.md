This project documents and analyzes the adaptation of America's two nuclear
weapons laboratories to the end of the Cold War. By 1996, it became clear that,
despite the nuclear test ban treaty, both laboratories would retain their
primary focus on weapons science. Conversion was a largely stillborn project
because of little enthusiasm for it in Congress and in the executive branch, and
because the organizational culture of the laboratories obstructed conversion.
The laboratories are reorganizing their way of doing weapons science around a
group of new technologies that simulate aspects of nuclear weapons testing.
Collectively, these technologies make up the Science Based Stockpile Stewardship
program. The effectiveness and significance of these technologies is
fundamentally contested by different political actors. This project argues that
it is in the nature of such simulation technologies that they are `hyper-
constructible.` The proposed project spans six months, including an interview
component and a writing component. The book will further our understanding of
the effects of military funding on scientific institutions, of the difficulties
in converting such institutions to civilian purposes, and it will suggest a less
literal approach than that of most arms control analysts to understanding the
significance of the Science Based Stockpile Stewardship Program.
