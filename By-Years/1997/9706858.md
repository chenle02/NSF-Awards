Abstract WU This project studies the higher index problem for Dirac operators on
coverings of manifolds with boundary, with global boundary condition of Atiyah-
Patodi-Singer type. The main steps in solving this problem are: (1) Study a
canonical boundary condition defined by the Calderon projector constructed from
the bounding manifold. (2) Reduce the K-theoretic index of the boundary value
problem to the noncommutative spectral flow from the original bmundary condition
to the Calderon projector. These steps provide an identification of the boundary
value index at the K-theory level. To get more explicit formulae for the index,
one then needs to calculate the Chern character of the index in cyclic homology.
Using the formula for the cyclic character for the spectral flows, this amounts
to identifying the higher (cyclic) eta-invariant of the boundary Dirac and the
Calderon projector in terms of the geometry of the bounding manifold. A
successful solution of the higher index problem would lead to many interesting
applications in differential geometry and topology. It also provides valuable
theoretical understandings to the study of boundary value problems of elliptic
partial differential equations arising from various applied scientific fields
and engineering.
