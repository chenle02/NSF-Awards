The main goal of this project is to develop methods of potential theory and
harmonic analysis applicable to quasilinear and fully nonlinear partial
differential equations and inequalities with singular coefficients and data.
This includes existence and regularity of viscosity solutions to elliptic and
parabolic problems with nonlinear source terms, sharp estimates of kernels of
Neumann series of integral operators with quasimetric kernels, Green's functions
and the conditional gauge associated with fractional Schrodinger operators, and
extensions of Hessian Sobolev and Poincare inequalities of Trudinger and Wang.
Among the tools employed in this project will be dyadic models, discrete
Carleson measures, Wolff's potentials, maximal and singular integral operators
on non-homogeneous spaces, non-standard duality, and weighted norm inequalities
with indefinite weights, along with techniques of modern PDE theory.

This research focusing on the interface between several diverse branches of
mathematics will advance applications to areas of current interest in
differential and integral equations, nonlinear potential theory, conformal
geometry, and mathematical physics. In particular, our studies of singularities
of solutions will be important to challenging problems where the presence of
competing nonlinearities in differential operators and source terms,
singularities of the coefficients, data and boundaries of the domains require
the development of new analytic techniques. They will result in further
understanding of fundamental nonlinear phenomena arising in theoretical physics
and applied sciences.
