9308131 Powers This is an award to support research, the objective of which is
to develop a fundamental understanding of nonaqueous phase liquid entrapment and
dissolution processes in heterogeneous subsurface systems and to develop a
phenomenological model to mathematically described these processes. The
investigator plans on using an approach that involves both experimental and
mathematical modeling of the problem. The experimental activity includes
simulation of the nonaqueous fluids using polymerized styrene which will allow
visualization and characterization of the fluid distribution within the medium
studied. The proposal leading to this award was submitted in response to NSF
92-122, Research Initiation Awards Program Announcement and Guidelines. Results
are expected to provide a more fundamental understanding of phenomena associated
with movement of nonaqueous fluids through porous media than now exists leading
to an improvement in models used in engineering design of remediation processes
and systems for decontamination of soils contaminated with these types of
fluids.
