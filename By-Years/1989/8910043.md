This award provides funds to the Public Health Research Institute for the
purchase or upgrade of a variety of instruments needed for the synthesis or
analysis of proteins, and for a thermal cycler for synthesis of DNA using the
polymerase chain reaction. The equipment will be used to help furnish a core
facility that serves investigators involved in studies of a wide variety of
biological problems. These include the mechanism of DNA uptake during DNA
transformation and of site specific recombination, the role of protein-nucleic
acid interactions in the virions of filamentous viruses, the mechanism of proton
translocation in yeast, the regulation of sporulation in bacteria, and a number
of other problems. The rapid advance of our understanding of a variety of
biological processes has been due in no small part to the development of
sophisticated and highly sensitive instruments for the synthesis, purification
and analysis of proteins. The equipment purchased through this award will enable
a group of solid investigators to pursue a variety of projects concerned with
protein structure and function. Their rates of progress will be substantially
augmented by the equipping of a core facility made possible through this award.
