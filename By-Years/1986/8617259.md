The measurements to be carried out by Dr. Atkinson are for the purpose of
testing a recently published theory. This is a good illustration of an
experimentalist being able to apply classical solution thermodynamics to test a
theory that describes a real system. Developing and testing against experimental
measurements theories, which are based on models of physical systems can lead to
refinement of the models and thus to better understanding of physical phenomena.
There are a class of electrolytes termed "bolaform electrolytes" because they
contain two charges separated by a rigid or flexible uncharged chain. They
represent a class of electrolytes intermediate between polyelectrolytes and
simple electrolytes. A variety of thermodynamic measurements on unusual
compounds will be carried out by Dr. Atkinson. The compounds to be studied have
been selected because they are rigid and there is an increasing distance between
the two charged centers; as a consequence, there is a goal to develop a
theoretical understanding of the results. A two year standard grant is provided
to carry out the experimental measurements and test modern statistical
mechanical theory.
