Because solutions of ever-greater complexity of the vacuum and electrovac
Einstein equations, generated using procedures based upon general formalisms of
Belinskii- Zakharov, Hoenselaers-Kinnersley-Xanthopoulos, Alekseev, Sibgatullin,
and Hauser-Ernst, are rarely checked by direct substitution into the Einstein
equations, it has become especially important to validate the theoretical basis
for and to identify any limitations of such formalisms. Dr. Ernst and Dr. Hauser
will clarify the logical foundations of solution-generating machinery by
establishing the mathematical relationships among the various formalisms, and by
attempting to provide, within an integrated framework, clear statements and
bona-fide proofs of all the tacit or as yet unproven assumptions upon which the
diverse formalisms must ultimately be based. This includes, but is not limited
to, a careful specification of domains of functions and differentiability
requirements, proofs of equivalence of various integral equations and associated
Riemann-Hilbert problems, proofs of existence of solutions of these equations,
and proofs that these solutions satisfy the Einstein equations.
