Kulkarni has already made major contributions in research on the interstellar
medium and in the search for pulsars. He will continue work on these topics but
concentrate on optical interferometry, using radio techniques for phase closure.
This award under the Presidential Young Investigator Program is made to an
astrophysicist who already has a worldwide reputation for his work on the
interstellar medium, search for pulsars, and design of astronomical
instrumentation. He was co-discoverer of the first pulsar with a rotation period
of only a few milliseconds, a phenomenon that provided new understanding
concerning the aging of stars. Kulkarni is an expert on interferometry, the
method of using several telescopes to provide a joint sharp image of an
astronomical object. He expects to extend a particularly effective technique of
radio interferometry to the optical and infrared wavelength. As a first
objective, he will obtain the sharpest possible images from the Mount Palomar
five-meter telescope despite the continual blurring of the Earth's atmosphere.
