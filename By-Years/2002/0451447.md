This award supports ten graduate students in a new Masters International Natural
Hazards program, which is organized in connection with the U.S. Peace Corps. The
program is the first of its kind in the geosciences, and has attracted
significant interest from students across the country. The program includes a
two-year Peace Corps assignment in a Latin American country with significant
natural hazards. NSF funding supports the academic year component leading to a
masters degree. The award allows the exploration of the potential of the program
to support a strong and diverse student population from across the U.S. and to
assess the potential of Peace Corps collaboration with Earth science curricula
in natural hazards. The program is designed to emphasize a substantial social
component in natural hazards research, to allow substantial multicultural
foreign practical experience, and to facilitate long-term contact with natural
hazards.
