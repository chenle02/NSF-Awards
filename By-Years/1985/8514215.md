This project involves theoretical and experimental research on the causes of
fracture in cutting tools. Prior research has shown that for carbide tools the
strain of fracture is the same under static and dynamic conditions for uniaxial
tension and that fracture occurs without plastic flow. This research also showed
that when the forces are mainly compressive, plastic flow occurs before
fracture. This research will be extended to ceramics and cermets; however, the
main focus will be on studying the compressive forces that occur during rapid
loading and unloading of the tool, at the beginning and the end of a cut. The
research will involve both cutting experiments and finite element analysis of
tool tip stresses.
