This project concerns the study of systems of semilinear partial differential
equations. Questions of existence, uniqueness and continuous dependence upon
parameters of solutions will be addressed. Also the qualitative behavior and
variety of physical, chemical and biological areas. These include the theory of
chemical reactors, population biology, semiconductor theory, fluid dynamics,
combustion theory, neurobiology and aeronautical engineering.
