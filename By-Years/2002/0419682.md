This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the key
technical challenge for realizing the substantial improvements in high storage
capacity, high charge-discharge rates promised by the next generation of
nanomaterial-based lithium-ion electrodes in supercapacitor configurations. The
innovative approach proposed uses mono-disperse nano-sized particles of lithium
titanate spinel (anode), individually coated with a structured carbon overlayer,
and compacted into appropriate structures for performance testing in a thin-film
hybrid superconductor prototype. The proposed design should provide dramatically
enhanced access to lithium ion and electrical connectivity involving the entire
assembly of nanomaterials.

Industry estimates the value of the primary battery markets over $13 billion,
secondary battery markets for electronics applications , toys and games, and
telephones around $2 billion; while NiMH cell sales are slowly falling ($1.5
billion), lithium-ion cells are holding steady at $2 billion. Success here will
provide a breakthrough in performance for cost effective electrode materials
that will stimulate significant growth in the commercial lithium-ion power
device markets.
