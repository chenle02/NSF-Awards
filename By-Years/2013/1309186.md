The 28th Summer Conference on Topology and Its Applications will be hosted, July
23-26, 2013, at Nipissing University, North Bay, Ontario, Canada. The conference
will have five parallel Special Sessions in Asymmetric Topology, Set-theoretic
Topology, Geometric Topology, Continuum Theory and Dynamical systems, and New
Trends in Topology. The special sessions proposed cover the classical scientific
focus of the conference as well as established and emerging research interests
of the various groups of topologists in North America. In addition to plenary
talks connected to these research areas, and usually to more than one area,
there will be two workshops: (1) Coarse Topology, with an emphasis on
connections to geometric group theory, dimension theory, and geometric topology,
and (2) Homogeneous Compact Spaces, one of the most important classes of spaces,
for instance, containing the class of compact topological groups. Each workshop
will consist of a series of lectures intended to enable participants to begin
research in these areas. Although the workshops will be tied to General Topology
and Geometric Topology, each will focus on new theory and techniques, will have
broad appeal to attendees in other sessions, and will feature connections to
areas both inside and outside topology. The conference proceedings will be
published in the fully refereed journal Topology Proceedings
(http://topology.auburn.edu/tp/).

There are two major conference series on Topology in North America: the Spring
Topology and Dynamics Conference and the Summer Conference on Topology and Its
Applications. The summer conference brings together mathematicians who have
research interests in general topology, set-theoretic topology, topological
algebras, topological groups, functional analysis, geometric topology,
topological dynamics, and continuum theory as well as applied areas such as
computer science and computational topology/geometry, and other areas where
topology has applications and connections. The scheduled workshops, one on
Coarse Topology and the other on Homogeneous Compact Spaces, will acquaint
younger researchers, including recent PhDs and graduate students, with active
research areas in topology and its applications. Major speakers with
international reputations have been selected who are active in these research
areas and others. Students and junior researchers, whose focus has necessarily
often been narrow, will be exposed to research techniques and results that draw
from multiple sources. NSF support will enable at least 12 US-based students and
junior researchers to attend the conference and expand their research horizons.
