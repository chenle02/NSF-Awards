This Science in Developing Countries award will support a regional workshop in
mathematics organized by Professor Joseph Kohn of Princeton University and
mathematicians from the Centro de Matematica, Universidad Central del Ecuador
under the direction of Professor Ronaldo Saenz Andrade. The workshop will
involve up to five representatives from the different Bolivarian countries
(Panama, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia) plus Chile, with an
emphasis on the selection of young and active mathematicians interested in
increasing communication with the international mathematical community. In
addition, there will be participation of a number of outstanding European
mathematicians who will be supported by their own countries. The workshop will
include the following activities: lectures, round table discussions, and a mini-
course with ample opportunities for informal discussions. The teaching of
mathematics and the promotion of research activities will be emphasized, taking
into account the experiences of the attendees. The participation of a
distinguished group of U.S. mathematicians, who are knowledgeable about the
problems of doing research and teaching in Latin America, is likely to lead to
improved communication and increased mathematical activity in the region.
