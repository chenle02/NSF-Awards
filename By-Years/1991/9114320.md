Under the direction of Dr. Lee Cassanelli, Ms Kathleen Ryan will collect
ethnographic data for her doctoral dissertation. She will conduct two seasons of
field research with Massai pastoralists in southern Kenya to study herd
management strategies. The Massai depend on cattle for subsistence and maintain
large herds of animals. Ms Ryan wishes to know what, at a traditional level of
subsistence, are the constraints which such herds impose and what constitute the
most successful management strategies. During a preliminary field season, she
has obtained permission to work with traditional Massai groups. She plans to
examine herd compositions in terms of animal age and sex distribution. She will
also look at culling strategies which are employed, labor requirements for care
of animals, how cattle are redistributed and exchanged through bridewealth,
inheritance and other practices. The redistributive effect of cattle raiding
will also be studied. Finally, Ms Ryan will examine Massai strategies to deal
with cattle disease and other disasters. While the data collected will be
ethnographic, the goals of this research are archaeological in nature. Cattle
were first domesticated ca. 10,000-12,000 years ago and they formed the
subsistence base for prehistoric societies in many parts of the Old World.
During some time periods in areas such as Ireland, cattle played a major role in
shaping social organization and Ms Ryan believes that one can begin with cattle
themselves, determine the requirements for a successful management strategy, and
on this basis gain insight into human social practices. Since the Maasai rely so
heavily on cattle they provide an ideal context to examine relationships of this
type. This research is important for several reasons. It will provide data which
may be generalizable to many contexts and therefore be of interest to many
archaeologists. It will yield insights into present day African subsistence
practices and will assist in the training of a promising young scientist.
