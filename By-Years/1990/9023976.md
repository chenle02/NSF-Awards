This research examines phase transitions induced by surface segregation of
solute in metal alloys. An associated surface miscibility gap is determined by
experiment and modeling and the morphological features of the phase transition
followed. A model of the transition is compared to experimental results. The
model alloy system is copper-silver with selected alloy compositions. A second
thrust is on the effects of surface segregation on the equilibrium form of alloy
crystals and related surface energies. This research is performed on lead-
bismuth and lead-tin alloys. This study of surfaces relates to a variety of
physical phenomena occurring at or near crystal surfaces that in part determines
the useful properies of such materials. Therefore this research is important to
the continued advancement of materials.
