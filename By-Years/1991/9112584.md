The PI will study the metabolism of fructose in two species of plants, known
commonly as thistle and dandelion. These plant store carbohydrate as fructans,
and knowledge of the metabolism could be of considerable use in controlling
their contamination of range- and cropland. The research is an extension of the
PI's graduate experience and would be of considerable benefit to allow the PI to
focus on a project which could funded by the USDA, state Ag funds, and NSF
programs. The planning period is of great merit to further the career plans of
the PI. It is designed to be partly a post- doctoral, and collaborative
interaction with scientists who may very favorably impact upon the PI's
development.
