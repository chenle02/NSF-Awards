This facilities project at the Hopkins Marine Station, Stanford University,
involves the construction of a versatile sea water laboratory/culture facility.
The project is motivated by the recognition that marine organisms provide unique
model systems for biomedical, ecological, and evolution research and the
importance of these systems is continually expanding. The laboratory will be an
enclosed structure suitable for culturing marine specimens, maintaining cloned
species, containing transgenic organisms, and for conduction experiments under
controlled conditions. The building is single storied with a 50X40 ft. footprint
and it is sited adjacent to existing seawater delivery and outlet pipes. It will
be of masonry construction with tile roof and cement slab floor. The interior
space is divided into two rooms by a central wall and connecting doors. The
interior design is very flexible in order to accommodate new experiments or
containment needs as they arise. Special equipment such as water chillers,
sterilization equipment, tank racks, video monitoring will be the responsibility
of the individual laboratories using the flexible space. The new
laboratory/culture facility will enhance the current research program at the
Hopkins Marine Station and open exciting new research opportunities.
