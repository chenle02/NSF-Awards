Waves propogate through all levels of the atmosphere, somewhat analagous to
waves in the ocean, and serve to couple the upper and lower atmosphere regions
by virtue of the energy and momentum that they carry. Waves known as traveling
ionic disturbances originate in the auroral zones and travel globally, while
waves known as infrasonde have relatively nearby sources and restricted regional
effects. The majority of waves arise from meteorological events and propagate
thousands of kilometers and ascend to great height with exponential growth. The
work in this project is aimed at developing theoretical understanding of
acoustic gravity waves (AGW) in the upper atmosphere with efforts concentrated
in five particular areas: 1) participation in the World Acoustic Gravity Wave
Study (WAGS), 2) studies of atmospheric waves and turbulence by coherent radars,
3) model computation of AGW propagation in a realistic atmosphere, 4) nonlinear
interaction of mesoscale perturbations in the atmosphere, and 5) modeling of the
middle atmosphere gravity wave continuum in terms of chaos.
