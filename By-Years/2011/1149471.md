Urban areas emit the vast majority of anthropogenic CO2, but most efforts to
study terrestrial and atmospheric carbon dynamics avoid areas influenced by
urbanization. Urban areas are growing in spatial extent and the ecology of
cities is becoming ever more germane to people?s lives and the development of
carbon mitigation strategies. This research will improve understanding of how
urbanization affects ecosystem characteristics and productivity across the
Boston urban-to-rural gradient, and develop a framework for analysis of urban
impacts on ecosystems, by (1) quantifying how ecosystem productivity changes
across an urban-to-rural gradient and developing a clear empirical foundation
for productivity estimation; (2) mapping historical and current patterns of
land-cover change to determine trajectories of development and the carbon
consequences of increasing urban lands; and (3) developing new methods to scale
the results of this work from the plot and pixel level to the entire region.

This research addresses the pressing need for science to inform the development
of policies that enhance core ecosystem services (e.g., air and water
purification, carbon and nitrogen sequestration, food and energy production)
while supporting a growing and increasingly urban human population. This work
includes the development of a new science education curriculum, collaborations
with the City of Boston, and will support undergraduate and graduate student
research.
