Computer science majors can significantly enhance their ability to solve
problems through introduction to exploratory research programming. This kind of
programming is not typically found in computer science classes in the normal
course of study but is comparable with the kind of explorative study performed
regularly by other science majors. The objective of this project is to introduce
students to exploratory programming techniques in the framework of large-scale,
ongoing software projects. Throughout the laboratory, students pursue five
different projects pertaining to mobile robot navigation and having exploratory
components. These projects introduce students to current technology such as
X-Windows programming and Unix TCP/IP network programming, while also requiring
students to program sophisticated hardware devices such as stereo vision system,
and various sensors. Students receive excellent training in research programming
and large-scale team programming projects to benefit those who go on to strong
software development firms or excellent graduate schools. The equipment benefits
not only the university students and faculty, but also the Mathematics and
Science Center and local area high schools. *
