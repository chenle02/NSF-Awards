On May 9, 1989, the California Division of Mines and Geology is conducting the
"SMIP89 Seminar on Seismological and Engineering Implications of Recent Strong-
Motion Data". The purpose of this Seminar is to provide state-of-the-art data
and analysis results from recent research studies of earthquake strong-motion
data: these data were collected by the California Strong-Motion Instrumentation
Program (SMIP). The workshop agenda includes discussions of earthquake ground
motion data as well as data from instrumented buildings, bridges, and dams
subjected to these ground motions. On the following day, May 10 1989, the
California Division of Mines and Geology is holding a one-day workshop to (1)
identify the most meaningful seismological and engineering implications of
recent strong- motion data, and (2) to develop a research agenda for the next
series of SMIP research awards. The participants include Seminar paper authors,
members of the SMIP Advisory Panels, and 10 invited participants. This action is
to provide partial support for the workshop attendants, and travel expenses for
the 10 invited participants to the Seminar and workshop.
