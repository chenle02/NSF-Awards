This research project studies the impact of strategic integration of relevant
math and science topics on teachers' knowledge and beliefs, their classroom
practice, and their students' understanding and beliefs. Teachers in a control
group will receive comparable professional development in which science and
mathematics are covered separately. The target population of grades 2-5 teachers
comes from 20 schools in Eugene, OR, a region with a socio-economically diverse
student population. The proposal hypothesizes that the strategic integration
will lead to more frequent and effective use of mathematics in science teaching
and improved student outcomes. The project employs both qualitative and
quantitative research measures and proposes a robust dissemination plan,
including outreach to rural districts in Oregon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
