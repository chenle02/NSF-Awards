The addition of two environmental chambers to the Biology Department facilities
is enhancing laboratory courses (Botany, Ecology, Physiology, Developmental
Biology) and student research (required of all seniors for graduation). The two
chambers, in conjunction with a biological incubator already available, allow
the faculty to establish controlled environments in which experiments with
plants and animals can be performed. The chambers are being used in three ways:
to compare responses of plants and animals to different environments; to
physiologically prepare organisms for experimental treatments; and to maintain
organisms in controlled conditions to reduce extraneous environmental variation
in experiments in which environmental factors are not designed to be
experimental variables. By expanding the types of experiments available to this
department and especially by allowing comparative studies of environmental
effects on organisms, these chambers greatly enhance undergraduate biology
laboratories. Good, clear results from lab exercises with living plants and
animals allow students to gain better perceptions of the concepts they read
about or hear about in lectures. For student research, the chambers increase
precision and accuracy and significantly expand the range of possible studies.
