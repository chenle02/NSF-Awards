This proposed research is motivated from the development of intelligent micro-
robots for manipulating microscopic objects. Attention is focused on the
manipulation and control of microscopic particles immersed in a fluid medium.
The proposed approach is to use a guided travelling surface wave for steering
particles immersed in a fluid layer. The proposed study consists of two phases.
The initial phase is devoted to a theoretical and computational study of various
problems associated with the proposed idea, in particular, the conditions under
which particle trapping is attainable, and the development of applicable methods
for manipulation and control. This phase is followed by an experimental study
for determining the range of validity of the theoretical results, and the
practicality of the proposed approach. The proposed idea involves the control of
a nonlinear distributed system in which the domain shape is the control
variable.
