9413164 Peterson This project is a contribution to the US World Ocean
Circulation Experiment (WOCE) Indian Ocean Hydrographic Program (IO WHP). The PI
will provide hydrographic support and scientific leadership for the Indian Ocean
survey in the vicinity of Madagascar, designated as WOCE section I-4/I-5W/I-7C.
This section crosses the western boundary currents in such a way as to make it
one of the definitive sections for determining meridional transport of mass,
heat and salt. ***
