9457950 Balsara The objective of this project is to understand molecular
organization in microstructured polymer mixtures under quiescent conditions and
under the influence of external fields. This will enable the use and processing
of existing materials more effectively, and lead to the fabrication of new
polymer-based materials such as photonic bandgaps. This work is concerned with
the synthesis and characterization of such materials and the quantification of
thermodynamic interactions that lead to microstructure formation. %%% ***
