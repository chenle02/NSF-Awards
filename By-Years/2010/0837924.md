Social cognition research studies how people form impressions of each other, a
critical topic in today's global village. The PI contributed the first text on
this topic, and continues to conduct cutting-edge research linking social
cognition to neuroscience. The European Social Cognition Network's annual
conference provides a unique forum for international scientific exchange,
focusing on recent developments. Funds are requested for the PI and one senior
graduate student to attend the 10th annual conference in Volterra, Italy, in
early September, 2008. The PI is an invited plenary speaker, and the graduate
student will present a related poster. Both use the PI's Stereotype Content
Model showing two fundamental dimensions of social perception; People judge each
other first on warmth (intent for good or ill) and then on competence (ability
to enact intents). The PI's research supports these two universal dimensions
with evidence from the brain, from first impressions, from surveys, and from
cultural comparisons. The model has been generated research by international
colleagues, so this conference provides an opportunity to consult and
collaborate. The conference mixes junior (70%) and senior (30%) researchers,
from 15-20 countries, mostly but not all European; all present research and
receive concentrated feedback. Attendees interact formally and informally,
fostering international research collaboration and general networks for future
contact, serving to integrate the younger researchers into the international
scientific community.
