The Mid-Atlantic Mathematical Logic Seminar (MAMLS) will have its first
conference of Academic Year 2013-2014 at Rutgers University in either September
or October 2013. MAMLS was formed in the fall of 1982 under the aegis of Lee
Stanley and has supported 2-4 regional meetings per year of 1-2 days' duration
since then. These meetings are held at various locations and cover a broad
spectrum of mathematical logic, with particular emphasis on complexity theory,
theoretical computer science, fragments of arithmetic, pure and applied model
theory, proof theory, recursion theory/computability theory, set theory,
subsystems of analysis in accordance with the program of H. Friedman and S.
Simpson, and topos theory. NSF support is provided for some of the expenses of
the speakers and attendees, in particular of the graduate students and those
without access to their own funding.

Via the meetings sponsored, the MAMLS grant maintains the vitality of the field
of mathematical logic. Special emphasis is placed on enhancing the participation
of younger researchers and members of traditionally underrepresented groups,
especially women. This is done by providing an intellectual forum in which all
interested persons are invited to contribute and in which there are lectures on
current topics of research.
