9416785 Irwin This award to the Committee on the Status of Women (CRAW),
provides for travel support for committee meetings, for continuing projects, and
for new projects. CRAW, a committee of the Computing Research Association (CRA),
was established in 1990. The goal of the Committee is to take positive action to
increase the number of women participating in computer science and engineering
research and education at all levels. Dr. Mary Jane Irwin, a Professor of
Computer Science and Engineering at Pennsylvania State University, and Dr. Fran
Berman, an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the University of
California, San Diego are co-chairs of CRAW. CRAW has been very active in
recommending and organizing projects and in many cases obtaining separate
funding for them. Members of CRAW have produced several articles on women's
issues in CS for the Computing Research News; have started the Systers-Academia,
a moderated electronic mailing list for female faculty and Ph.D. students in
CS&amp;E; have established the Ph.D. database of women with Ph.D's in CS&amp;E;
and have presented career management workshops at major conferences and events
(with additional funding). The CRA is an association of U.S. and Canadian
academic departments of Computer Science and Computer Engineering, and
Industrial Laboratories engaging in basic computing research. The mission of CRA
is to represent and inform the computing research community and to support and
promote its interests. ***
