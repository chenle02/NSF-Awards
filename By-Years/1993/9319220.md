9319220 Cooper This award supports participation of US investigators in the
ANTOSTRAT Symposium which will bring together seismic stratigraphers,
sedimentologists, glacial geologists, and paleontologists to develop a state-of-
the-art picture of the continental margin stratigraphy of Antarctica.
Investigators sponsored by the United States Antarctic Program have been major
contributors to geologic models for the evolution of the Antarctic continental
margins. This symposium is the culmination of scientific collaborations that
have been developed under the aegis of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic
Research and that have been realized through several ANTOSTRAT Regional Working
Groups. This symposium is expected to produce a comprehensive atlas of seismic
stratigraphy accompanied by interpretations of the glacial and marine geology
several large segments of the Antarctic continental margin. ***
