This project solicits support to acquire a state-of-the-art fluorine laser to be
used in laboratory studies of atmospheric processes. SRI International will host
this laser system in a modern laser laboratory that will be made available to
the atmospheric research community as a shared facility. With this system, large
quantities of oxygen atoms can be generated under conditions with a low
concentration of residual oxygen molecules. These conditions mimic those in the
upper atmosphere of the Earth and will permit the study of collisional processes
that would be difficult or impossible to study with other methods. This laser
will make possible a series of laboratory studies addressing important
unresolved problems in the fields of aeronomy and atmospheric science.
