This project is building a scalable mobile computing emulation infrastructure
named ScalableSQ. With the popularity of mobile computing, there is an
increasing need to allow mobile users to access data and process queries
ubiquitously through their mobile devices. In the past decade, research efforts
have been investigateing spatial query processing and pervasive data airing in
mobile computing environments. However, the research issues on scalable data
dissemination and efficient spatial query processing for supporting large-scale
mobile computing systems have not been well explored. The main objective of this
project is to design and develop a scalable data dissemination and query
evaluation infrastructure for querying, indexing, and routing datasets to
support novel mobile applications. Specific research challenges being addressed
include design of highly scalable spatial query evaluation mechanisms, broadcast
channel access bounds to speed on-air data accesses, effective memory management
strategies to reduce access latency and tuning time, and novel request routing
techniques to facilitate data sharing based query processing.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to research, this project also benefits
education by providing hands-on experience in mobile computing through the
ScalableSQ infrastructure to both undergraduate and graduate students.
Furthermore, the PIs will organize workshops at Tuskegee University (an HBCU)
and collaborate with industrial partners to disseminate new discoveries from
this project as the outreach component. The results of this project will be
disseminated as research papers and as freely available tools in the project
website at http://www.eng.auburn.edu/~weishinn/ScalableSQ.html.&lt;br/&gt;
