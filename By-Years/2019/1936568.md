The Association for Computing Machinery's Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity
in Computing is one of the premier venues to acknowledge, promote and celebrate
diversity in all parts of the computing field. This project will provide
scholarships for the next three years of the conference. Scholarships will
facilitate attendance of undergraduate and graduate students; faculty from
minority-serving institutions will attend and participate in conference
activities, and a Doctoral Consortium will provide PhD students with group and
one-on-one interactions with leaders in the field of computing. The intellectual
merit of this project is in the stimulating environment and knowledge provided
by the excellent presentations and activities associated with the conference.
The broader impact will consist largely in the connections made by the
scholarship recipients with other attendees at the conference and with the
entire breadth of the computer science field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
