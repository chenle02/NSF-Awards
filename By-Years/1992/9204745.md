The genetic basis of load and inbreeding depression has important implications
for the evolution of mating systems and management of rare and endangered
species. Yet the best data available consider viability load at the level of
whole chromosomes in Drosophila. The Principal Investigator proposes to measure
the load attributable to small (ca. 10 centiMorgan) chromosome segments in the
plant Brassica campestris. Maximum likelihood methods to map QTL onto short
chromosomal regions marked by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)
will be employed.By determining the degree to which small QTL bearing chromosome
segments contribute to load by overdominance, dominance, or epistasis, the
researchers can begin to infer the distribution of effects for loci contributing
to genetic load and inbreeding depression. Most previous studies have examined
single fitness components in one environment, precluding the possibility of
overdominance induced by pleiotropy among fitness components or genotype x
environment interaction. This research project will measure viability and
fecundity in both field and greenhouse to give more accurate estimates of
overdominance. This study represents the next step towards resolving the basis
of genetic load at the gene level by combining molecular and quantitative
genetics.
