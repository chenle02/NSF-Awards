9703281 Giannuzzi The goal of this CAREER research grant is to determine the
effects of impurity grain boundary segregation on grain boundary diffusion.
Attention is given to the effects of segregating atoms on heterodiffusion along
low angle, high angle, and special copper twist grain boundaries, comparing
heterodiffusion along unsegregated and segregated twist boundaries. Grain
boundary diffusion of a solute is assessed in the presence of impurity
segregants at the same temperatures used for the segregation experiments.
Systematic evaluation of segregation composition, grain boundary diffusion
lengths, and grain boundary structure is performed as a function of the
annealing conditions. Experimental and theoretical approaches are employed to
model enhancement or reduction of grain boundary diffusion due to the
segregating impurity atoms. A primary goal of the CAREER education component of
the program is to develop innovative teaching methods, while incorporating
recent research findings into the classroom in the Materials Science and
Engineering discipline. Multimedia and computer usage is planned for videotaped
and live interactive classroom demonstrations. Computer software demonstrations
and digital image computer analyses are employed. The effort includes mentoring
undergraduates and exposing them to research projects, curriculum development,
and community outreach. %%% This research is significant because identification
of the mechanisms of impurity segregation effects on grain boundary diffusion
will assist in the processing of materials with specific grain boundary
properties. Ultimately, grain boundary engineering could be performed to either
enhance or minimize a particular solid-state reaction. ***
