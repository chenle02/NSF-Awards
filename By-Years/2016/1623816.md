1623816&lt;br/&gt;Georgen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Division of Earth Sciences
Instrumentation and Facilities Program grant supports acquisition of
computational equipment to support research and research training in geophysics
and geodynamics. Funding would allow for purchase of two Mac Pro desktops with
3.5 GHz six-core CPUs, 64 Gb RAM and dual GPUs each to support larger numerical
model domains and smaller grid resolutions to better model geological processes
with high spatial and temporal gradients, better handling of time-dependent
solutions, and higher overall higher model throughput. This support is congruent
with NSFs mission of promoting the progress of science and advancing the
national health, prosperity and welfare given the importance of training the
next generation scientific workforce in computational modeling techniques and
the societal importance of understanding the impacts of changing climate and sea
level on terrestrial hydrologic reservoirs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research will
focus on modeling of geodynamics processed including mantle plume ? mid ocean
ridge interactions, subduction zone dynamics and effects of sea level change on
groundwater hydrology and submarine groundwater discharge along the eastern Mid-
Atlantic shore.
