9727654 Smithson The single most important result from deep scientific drilling
in crystalline rocks in Russia and Germany may be the discovery of hydrous
fluids through the entire depth range (9 to 12 km) of deep boreholes. The
presence of hydrous fluids is so important, because even in small amounts, they
have a dramatic effect on geologic processes such as mineral reactions, melting,
rock strength, material transfer, seismic wave attenuation and ore deposits.
Fluids also strongly affect seismic reflectivity by creating larger reflection
coefficients than can be found from rock-rock interfaces alone. This award
supports the U.S. portion of a cooperative project with the Principal
Investigator's German colleagues to conduct a vertical seismic profile (VSP) in
the deep part (3-8.5 km) of the KTB borehole in Germany and a moving source
profile (MSP) from the surface into geophones in the borehole. The ICDP
(International Continental Scientific Drilling Program) has already approved
funding for the project. This award will provide one-third of the data
acquisition costs. The Principal Investigator will participate in the data
acquisition and data analysis by contributing his time to the project at no
charge. ***
