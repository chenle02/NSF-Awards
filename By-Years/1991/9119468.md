Research is to be continued on phase change phenomena under strongly non-
equilibrium conditions in tetrograde fluids. These are characterized by a
combination of high molecular weight and heat capacity. Shock wave and expansion
wave phenomena can then, under certain conditions, be reverse from what is
accepted as normal. The investigation is mainly experimental, complemented with
theoretical modeling. It is focused on liquefaction shock thickness, and futher
details of expansion shocks and spinoidal phase changes. The test fluid will be
iso-octane. This research has applications to future fuel injection systems for
producing more complete fuel vaporization in the combustion chamber.
