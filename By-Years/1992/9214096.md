9214096 Wilkens This award supports Professor Roy H. Wilkens and a graduate
student from the University of Hawaii for international collaboration with Dr.
Jurgen Mienert and others of GEOMAR, a marine geological institute in Kiel,
Germany. These two groups share an interest in the measurement and
interpretation of acoustic properties and the acoustic stratigraphy of the
seafloor under the deep ocean. They plan to investigate in great detail the
variations in several physical properties in the upper zone of these seafloor
sediments. The German research group has been developing geophysical
instrumentation complementary to some being developed at the University of
Hawaii. Professor Wilkens and his student have been invited to join in the
planning for and accompany the Germans on at least one cruise aboard a German
research vessel. Both U. S. and German scientific programs will benefit greatly
from the proposed combination of measuring techniques and oceanographic
expertise. The upper ten meters of the seafloor contain the largest gradients in
physical and acoustic proerties in the sediment- seawater system. Within this
zone, porosity may change by 20- 30% and density may vary by as much as 50%
Modern geophysical instrumentation such as that being developed by the
participating research groups is making it possible to locate precisely and
sample the discontinuities where sediment composition or microstructure changes.
Examining such samples reveals the nature of the changes in the sediment and can
provide evidence of changes in paleo-environmental conditions. Such data are
extremely valuable in studies of local and global climate change. ***
