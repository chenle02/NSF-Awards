Pythagorean-hodograph (PH) curves offer many important computational advantages
over the "ordinary" Bezier/B-spline representations commonly used in CAD/CAM
applications. Among the attributes that distinguish PH curves from the latter
are: exact rectification in terms of a polynomial arc-length function; exact
rational representations of their offsets; a closed-form expression, suitable
for purposes of optimization, for their elastic bending energies; and a
propensity to yield fairer loci --- exhibiting a smoother curver distribution
--- in the interpolation of discrete data. Moreover, existing CAD systems can
readily take advantage of these properties, since the PH curves are entirely
compatible with the Bezier/B-spline representation. This project investigates
outstanding theoretical and algorithmic issues concerning the construction and
manipulation of PH curves. Their solution will permit the full potential of PH
curves to be realized in applications such as rapid prototyping and NC milling.
These issues encompass trimming procedures for PH curve offsets; real-time CNC
interpolators for PH curves; optimal shape design with PH curves; algorithms for
efficient construction of C2 PH splines; and alternate algebraic formulations
for PH space curves. ***
