The objective of this project is to improve instruction in the courses in which
the root zone of the plant and the soil's interactions with the plant are
studied. Students must measure plant growth, soil nutrient status, and the
microclimate in order to understand the influence of the rhizosphere on plant
growth. The goal of the project is to increase students' understanding of basic
scientific principles involved in soil- plant relationships. This understanding
will foster conservation of soil and contribute to efficiency in crop
production. The equipment purchases through this award are typical of the
sophisticated equipment used in soil and plant analysis laboratories that serve
agricultural producers and research. Instruments for measuring nutrient content
of the soil and for measuring light penetration through the plant canopy can be
used successfully by undergraduate students, and are the types of equipment that
soil and plant science graduates will use in their careers. Student enthusiasm
for learning the principles of soil reactions and plant growth is greatly
enhanced when instructional activity is carried out with "real world" equipment
rather than with typical student laboratory equipment. High precision
instruments such as atomic absorption spectrophotometers, an infrared
thermometer, leaf area meter, radiometer, autotitrator, and plant growth
chambers will contribute directly to the objective of improving instruction in
the courses involving soil-plant relations. For example, the atomic absorption
spectrophotometer will detect elements in the soil; the growth chambers will
permit the establishment and maintenance of two different climates for plant
growth in a synchronous time frame; the infrared thermometer will measure plant
temperature differences that indicate wilting stress in plant leaves before the
leaf shows visible symptoms of wilting. This project brings a very significant
infusion of scientific principles and insights to this agricultural program.
