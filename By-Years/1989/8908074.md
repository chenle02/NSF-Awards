This is a project to examine some of the processes by which blood pressure is
regulated. Normally, the brain sends messages to arteries and veins through
nerves. Activation of these nerves causes the blood vessels to contract by
releasing a chemical messenger, norepinephrine. The receptor molecules for
norepinephrine which are on the surface of the muscle cells in the blood vessels
will be studied. Dr. Minneman has previously shown that there are several
different types of such receptors, which are affected differently by various
drugs. He will now study the molecular mechanisms by which these different
receptor types cause the blood vessels to contract. He is particularly
interested in whether these receptors are acting through different mechanisms to
cause contraction, as is suggested by preliminary results. Identification of
these different mechanisms will be important in understanding more about how
blood pressure is regulated, and in helping to identify ways to selectively
control blood pressure. //
