This project develops software to automate the management of a game simulating
the economic decisions in running a company. In the game, students apply the
principles learned in class to "run their company", as investment opportunities
become available. Each opportunity requires the use of the most recent topics
covered in class. The current "manual" version of the game, although very
popular with the students, requires inordinate instructor time to manage the
game and calculate the results of the students' decisions. Students will be
surveyed to get their reaction and their suggestions; also test results from
students who used the game in their course will be compared to those from a
similar course where the game was not used. The investigators will present
papers describing the game and the results of their evaluation at professional
conferences, and they will make the software available free to anyone who is
interested through a web site and a CD-ROM.
