Understanding decision making under uncertainty is one of the most important
problems in economics. Economists and decision theorists have long sought to
develop rigorous foundations for realistic models of how people perceive and
respond to uncertainty. The expected utility theory has been the dominant
paradigm for both theoretical and applied work incorporating uncertainty for
over fifty years. However, there are serious shortcomings in this theory. For
example, the well-known paradoxes of Allais and Ellsberg suggest that decision
makers routinely and systematically violate expected utility axioms. These
violations take the form of misinterpreting small probability events in the case
of the Allais paradox, and failing to form a unique subjective prior and use it
in a probabilistically sophisticated way in the case of Ellsberg's paradox.
Similarly, Kahneman and Tversky's seminal work on prospect theory and loss
aversion shows that decision makers often respond differently to losses than to
gains.

This project will study a variety of problems using models featuring ambiguity.
Ambiguity appears when decision makers do not have a precise idea of the
probability of the different possible outcomes of their decisions. The project
will focus on developing mathematical techniques for describing individual's
preferences in abstract choice problems. It will also analyze the implications
of ambiguity on markets and on the design of incentive systems. Results will
include a deeper understanding of the effects of uncertainty on important
resource allocation mechanisms. These results will be useful to other scholars
and to policymakers interested in a range of questions from the timing and
structure of innovation to why people use relatively simple arrangements such as
English auctions for buying and selling.
