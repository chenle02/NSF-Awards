The goal of this workshop is to highlight scientific opportunities that can
address the energy challenges in nanoelectronics in general, as symbolized by
the coming end of Moore's law. This is an emerging frontier of research in
Condensed Matter and Materials Physics. Some representative opportunities
include the following: Spintronic materials, Valleytronics, Topological
materials, Quantum information / computation, Multiferroic materials, Quantum
materials, Topological excitations such as magnetic skyrmions, Ionics and
neuromorphic computation. The workshop highlights the latest progresses in these
diverse directions, identify major hurdles, milestones, metrics, as well as
opportunities, and facilitate interactions across traditional research
boundaries. It will also address research infrastructure needs and workforce
development. Workshop participants will identify emerging challenges, obstacles
and bottlenecks as well as future directions of research in the topical areas. A
report will be prepared, with draft report written during the workshop, and
distributed to the community and made available to general
public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
