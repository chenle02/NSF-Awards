Intellectual Merit The International Congress on Catalysis, ICC, in the most
largely attended meeting of the international catalytic community. All the
developments both practical and new understand in catalysis over the last four
years will be presented at this meeting. This is also the best place to discuss
ongoing or international collaborations within the catalytic community, both
industrial and academic. Participation by US scientists is crucial to our
visibility in this area that impacts over a quarter of the US economy.

Broader Impacts A major focus of this ICC meeting is on renewable, sustainable
energy sources made by catalytic means. Many foreign laboratories have pioneered
in these efforts and will be present and presenting their studies at this
meeting. Several workshops and symposia for faculty or students are being held
in conjunction (before or after) the ICC. This grant will enable US
participation in these. One of the primary purposes is to provide support for
junior faculty to participate in this ICC, as well as to support women and
underrepresented minority candidates. This is an ideal opportunity for these
groups to establish international collaborations as well as to understand the
cutting edge of catalytic science and engineering.
