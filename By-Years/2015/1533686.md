Implementation Projects in the Historically Black Colleges and Universities -
Undergraduate program provide support to design, implement, study and assess
comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the numbers of students and the
quality of their preparation by strengthening science, technology, engineering
and mathematics (STEM) education and research. This implementation project at
Bowie State University (BSU) seeks to transform the first two years of STEM
teaching and learning. The project is grounded in theories of science identity
and constructivism and will provide a student-centered learning environment that
is integrated into the STEM curriculum at the institution. The evidence-based
strategies for student success will serve as a reference and provide a framework
for other institutions with whom BSU shares similar characteristics. The project
is guided by an on-going evaluation, as well as an internal steering committee
and an external advisory committee. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is
implementing three goals and related interventions to support mainly first and
second year STEM students and faculty as follows: to develop students' identity
by building student learning communities, providing career-related mentoring and
providing undergraduate research learning opportunities; to integrate problem-
solving and entrepreneurship in the STEM curriculum by adapting technology
commercialization into STEM courses, and expanding access to a maker space to
support students' multidisciplinary learning; and to provide professional
development to faculty on experiential learning and evidence-based instructional
practices.
