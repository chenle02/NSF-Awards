This award will allow 23 scientists from U.S. universities to participate in an
international conference on "Southern Hemisphere Temperate Ecosystems and Biota:
Contributions towards a Global Synthesis" to be held January 2004 in Cape Town
South Africa. This conference will constitute the IV Congress of the Southern
Connection, an organization of approximately 400 scientists with an interest in
comparative studies of the biota and ecosystems of the southern hemisphere
temperate latitudes. The Congress will include plenary addresses, symposia, oral
contributed papers, contributed posters, special discussion sessions on chosen
topics including technical workshops, and field trips. Works to be presented and
discussed at the conference will describe the results of original research in
fields such as ecosystem ecology (primarily terrestrial ecosystems but also
marine ecosystems), evolutionary ecology, landscape ecology, paleontology,
plant-animal interactions, phylogeny, evolution, paleoecology, ecological and
historical biogeography, biological invasions, vegetation history, and ecosystem
restoration and sustainable management. This workshop is co-funded through
Ecosystem Science; Ecology; Geography and Regional Sciences; and the Office of
Science and Engineering.
