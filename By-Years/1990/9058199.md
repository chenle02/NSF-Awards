The P.I. intends to demonstrate the integration of field geology with
quantitative laboratory investigations, geophysical modeling, and geochemical
studies in the systematic examination of Precambrian sedimentary basins. This
work will allow for the deciphering of long-term continental evolution as well
as the history of oceans and atmosphere, throughout most of earth history. Two
projects focus on the goals; the first will undertake an analysis of Proterozoic
continental lithosphere trough investigations of the geometry and tectonics of
foreland basins. The second project will investigate the possible long-term
chemical changes in the Precambrian atmosphere and oceans. The key study of this
work will be a sedimentologic/geochemical analysis of Precambrian carbonate
sediments and depositional systems.
