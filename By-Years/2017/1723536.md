With the goal of stimulating innovation, federal funding agencies and
universities have invested in interdisciplinary research, using various
mechanisms, including: targetted funding opportunities; re-organization of
physical work spaces; establishment of topic specific, disciplinary spanning
research centers; faculty cluster hires; interdisciplinary fellowship programs;
and graduate training programs like IGERT. This research synthesizes the
literature to assess which mechanisms have been most effective and under what
circumstances. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interdisciplinarity is a timely and
nationally important science policy topic, but there are always limits to
funding, and those who make and implement policy need to know how best to
achieve returns on their investments. The research identifies the mechanisms and
policies that have been most successful and thus made the most effective use of
R&amp;D funding. The policy report comprehensively reviews the scholarship and
attends closely to the reliability and robustness of the studies reviewed. It
begins by comparing the various definitions and measures of interdisciplinary
research that have been proposed, and moves toward assessing the impact of
interdisciplinary research and valued outcomes like scientific productivity and
innovation. The policy report provides policy prescriptions based on evidence in
the scientific research.
