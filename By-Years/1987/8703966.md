The objective of this research is the evaluation of evaportranspiration over a
region of the Amazon, the recent site of a joint field experiment to measure
sources, sinks, and transport of several trace gases. Special geostationary
satellite observations of the moisture distribution are available in addition to
various meteorological observations (radiation, turbulent fluxes in the boundary
layer) made at or near the earth's surface and in the forest canopy. The water
budget - the source, sink, and transport of aggregate water substance - has
never been adequately measured in the wet tropics; a knowledge of the water
budget - the most variable meteorological quantity after radiation and
cloudiness - will contribute to a better description of atmospheric circulation,
including the release of latent heat, the hydrological balance of the Amazon
River and the ecology of the vegetation. The forest cover is itself a major
source of water vapor and, thus, if these trees are cut down and the land
cleared, as in fact is taking place in several tropical regions, the proposed
research could provide an informed analysis of some of the consequences,
meteorological and otherwise.
