This is a proposal for modern nucleic acid sequence analysis instrumentation.
Sequencing experiments to be pursued include: (1) sequencing of cloned mutant
genes for the enzyme luciferase in order to better characterize the active site
of the enzyme, (2) sequencing of the regulatory regions of the lux operons of
Vibrio harveyi and Xenorhabdus luminescens, (3) sequencing of cloned fragments
containing recombinational hot-spots to determine orientation, (4) sequencing of
the products of confirmed in vitro recombination to characterize the
recombinational event, (5) sequencing of other members of a new family of
retroviral sequences found in as many as thirty copies per mouse genome, and (6)
sequencing of portions of a novel transposon in Streptococcus suis which
mediates its own transfer via conjugation.
