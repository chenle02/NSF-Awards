New materials with special properties are necessary in the search for new clean
energy sources and advanced medical devices. Electromagnetic phenomena play a
key role in the design of new materials such as meta-materials and conducting
materials. Meta-materials, assembled with blocks of meta-atoms of naturally
available components, have provided a wide range of new possibilities to design
man-made materials with special properties. Novel devices using meta-materials
have been proposed including perfect lens and sub-diffraction-limited imaging
for medical applications, light harvest in clear energy solar cells. In
addition, understanding the conducting flow of a charged system is essential for
studying confined nuclear thermal reactions for the exploration of new clean
energy sources.

The computational simulation of electromagnetic phenomena is challenging, owing
to the demand of highly accurate and efficient numerical methods that not only
represent the correct physics in the magnetic induction equation but also
resolve the multiple scattering and local field enhancements from random objects
in meta-materials. To meet these requirements, the PIs will accomplish the
following two tasks in this project: (1) to develop a highly efficient volume
integral equation method for Maxwell equations for very accurate computation of
multiple scatterings of large number of regular or random objects employed in
the construction of meta-materials; (2) to devise a high order constrained
transport finite element method for the magnetic induction equations in the
magneto-hydrodynamics problem so the global divergence free condition on the
magnetic field is preserved. The research findings will be disseminated through
journal publications and software tool development.
