Children's Television Workshop proposes to produce a fourth and fifth season of
SQUARE ONE TV, a daily series on mathematics for children ages eight to twelve.
Season Four will consist of 40 new half-hours for air on PBS stations beginning
September 1991. Consistent with CTW's experimental mission in education, CTW
also proposes to undertake a new programming approach to expand the reach of
SQUARE ONE TV to a family audience by converting the daily detective serial
featured in the series, MATHNET, into four one-hour specials for family viewing.
These Season Four MATHNET Specials will be researched to test their
effectiveness. Eleven hour-long weekly SQUARE ONE TV programs will be produced
for Season Five to be aired in addition to re-broadcasts of the daily series
starting January, 1993. Seasons Four and Five production will capitalize on the
educational impact and appeal of prior seasons. Mathematical content will be
based on research and in conjunction with the Series Advisory Committee and
consultants. The additional seasons will be supported by a full range of
promotion, community outreach activities, and school services, including
teacher's guides.
