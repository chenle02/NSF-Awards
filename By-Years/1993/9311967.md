9311967 Offutt This project is investigating the relative merits of unit-level
software testing techniques, specifically various data-flow criteria and
mutation testing. It is developing and implementing algorithms for automatically
generating test data to satisfy data- flow criteria. Heuristic procedures for
determining program sub paths that cannot be executed are also being
investigated. The techniques studied will be evaluated on an experimental basis,
using combination of fault detection ability and relative abilities of the
studied criteria to cover each other. Recent results with constraint-based test
data generation strongly indicate that test data can be automatically generated
to test software program units according to the data-flow criteria. This project
would develop algorithms that can be used to improve the current state of
practice and research in testing software. It would also provide evidence
concerning the efficacy of testing criteria with the objective of improving the
quality of software. ***
