This project introduces novel frameworks for using graphs in analyzing complex
datasets. These new applications of graphs allow researchers to investigate the
intricate relation among quantities of interest. The newly developed methods
will offer novel directions for studying the growth and evolution of a galaxy.
The PI also plans to develop methodologies to handle complex missing data
problems in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center's database. The project
highlights how abstract mathematical objects like graphs offer a unified
treatment on problems arising from different fields such as astronomy and
dementia studies. The PI will also initiate several new educational programs and
engage both graduate and undergraduate students in research in various ways.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI plans to investigate two novel research directions
of applying graphs to statistical problems. In the first direction, the PI
develops a novel graphical approach called density skeleton, an undirected graph
summarizing the shape of the covariate distribution. The PI will study how to
apply density skeleton to various statistical learning problems, including
regression, algorithmic fairness, and topological data analysis. In the second
part of the project, the PI develops a new graph-based method called Markov
missing graph to handle missing data problems. The Markov missing graph defines
an identifying assumption to recover the missing entries' distribution. The PI
intends to study how the modeling, computation, and efficiency theory interacts
with graph geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
