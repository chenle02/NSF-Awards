Proposal Number: ECS-9523978 Principal Investigator: Shrivinas Joshi Title:
Reflection of ultrasonic lamb waves: theory and applications In this research,
theoretical and experimental research into ultrasonic Lamb waves, which are
elastic waves propagating in plates of finite thickness, is proposed. Recently
Lamb wave devices have been fabricated on plates that are thinner than one
micron (including work by the PI). Waves propagating in such thin structures
have a number of attractive properties for use in physical, chemical and
biological sensors. Lamb waves also can provide a convenient tool for measuring
the elastic properties of self-supporting thin films and microminiature
mechanical structures. In this work, Lamb wave reflections will be particularly
investigated. The reflection analysis will consider three types of
discontinuities: thin conducting strips, mass loading strips and etched grooves.
The information obtained from this work will be used to develop Lamb wave
resonators, unidirectional transducers and low loss delay lines. These devices
will be designed and fabricated and their performance compared with the
theoretical calculations. The combined theoretical/experimental investigations
are both fundamental and thorough and should result in advances applicable to
the general field of elastic-wave microsensors.
