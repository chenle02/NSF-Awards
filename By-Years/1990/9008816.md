This is a study of several aspects of the ways in which rhythmic movement
patterns can be altered, and the ways in which functionally related movement
patterns are coordinated with one another. The PI will study these problems at
the level of individual nerve cells in the simple nervous system of the lobster.
The role of different neuropeptide neurotransmitters in the rhythmic patterns of
cardiac sac and gastric neurons will be examined. This research will lead to a
better understanding of neurons control complicated integrated movements.
