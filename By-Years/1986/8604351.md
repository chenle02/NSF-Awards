Practical communications systems sometimes contain unknown signals or signals
that are slowly time varying, and that in both cases have additive noise. The
objective of this research is to design and analyze novel adaptive filters for
narrow-band signals with additive noise using the recursive prediction error
method. Applications would be in extracting and eliminating narrow-band
components in sonar signal processing, speech processing and spectral
estimation.
