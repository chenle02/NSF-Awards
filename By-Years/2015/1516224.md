This award will support attendance by early-career scientists to seven
conferences to be held in 2015 at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, including:
Systems Biology: Networks; Wiring the Brain; the Annual CSHL Symposium: 21st
Century Genetics; Eukaryotic mRNA Processing; Mechanisms of Eukaryotic
Transcription; Cell Biology of Yeast; and Plant Genomes &amp; Biotechnology.
Each conference will include presentations by junior and senior investigators in
a format designed to promote scientific exchange in both formal and informal
settings. Results from the conferences will be disseminated via distribution of
abstract books and via the CSHL Leading Strand video
