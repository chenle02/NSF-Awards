The Workshop on Logic and Systems Biology is affiliated with the 2012 Logic in
Computer Science (LICS) Conference in Dubrovnik, Croatia and is scheduled for
June 29. It will consist of one day of invited lectures. The talks will cover a
variety of connections between computer science and biology, with emphasis on
the uses of formal logic in modeling biomolecular interaction
systems.&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT&lt;br/&gt;The LICS organizing committee
believes that logic will have an important role in systems biology, and invited
a proposal for a workshop to explore current and future applications of logic to
system biology. Since systems biology is a new field of study which is still
unfamiliar to most LICS attendees, the organizers decided to restrict the
lectures to invitation only, with an open session for discussion of future
research. The lectures are intended to be accessible to computer scientists who
have some knowledge about the use of formal methods for analyzing software and
hardware, but who may not have much experience with biology. The speakers will
also be invited to submit more technical versions of their talks to a refereed
proceedings.&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACT&lt;br/&gt;The lectures will explore
connections between biology, computer science, and mathematics, with the goal of
encouraging collaborations between researchers in the different groups, leading
to new applications of logic and raising interesting theoretical questions. It
is also expected that graduate students and recent Ph. D.s in computer science
will attend the workshop. Since the talks will be partly expository, this will
be an opportunity for them to broaden their perspective, with future benefits to
their research and teaching.
