9350962 Rudmann This project has established a social and behavioral sciences
computer laboratory that introduces undergraduate students to computer-based
social science research. To fully understand and appreciate the scientific
dimensions of the social sciences, students are actively involved in conducting
research, and are encouraged to become scientifically literate, self-directed,
computer literate learners. Students also study social science issues with real
data, using state of the art hardware and software. With this foundation, majors
are expected to be much better prepared for upper division work, while non-
majors will have an enhanced understanding and appreciation for the scientific
basis of social science knowledge. ***
