This grant provides support for an Ohio State University faculty member in his
studies of the spin-isospin degrees of freedom in nuclei. The experiments
utilize the charge- exchange reaction in which the neutron ejectile energy is
measured using the time-of-flight method. The investigations will provide unique
information on a variety of topics such as Gamow-Teller distributions, nuclear
capture cross sections for solar/galactic neutrinos, and properties of the
nuclear force at intermediate energies.
