9528221 Support was requested for a Neodymium: YAG laser for particle imaging
velocimetry. With the addition of the laser, the PIs will have a system for
vizualizing and measuring instantaneous velocity fields in a variety of
applications. Projects which will benefit from the PIV system involve heat
transfer and fluid flow in advanced gas turbine disk cavities, in gas turbine
centrifugal compressor backface cavities, and in subcooled boiling. The grant
was supported under the Research Equipment Grant Program.
