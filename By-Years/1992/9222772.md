This award supports the continued maintenance, collection, improvement and
distribution of genetic stocks of Neurospora, Aspergillus and to a lesser extent
other filamentous fungi at the Fungal Genetics Stock Center (FGSC) currently
located at University of Kansas Medical Center. The FGSC was initially
established at Dartmouth and has been continuously supported by NSF. Dr. John A.
Kinsey serves as the Director of the FGSC and oversees the operation of the
Center. The ready availability of over 7,000 reliable genetic stocks from FGSC
has markedly stimulated the use of these organisms for research in genetics,
molecular biology, biochemistry, microbiology, systematics, plant pathology, and
other related fields. In addition to genetic stocks, the FGSC maintains and
distributes molecular tools for fungal research such as cloned genes and
libraries of genomic or cDNA from filamentous fungi. Many of the strains in the
collection are also used for educational purposes. As part of its service to the
community, the FGSC prepares the Fungal Genetics Newsletter as well as a
biannual catalog of available cultures and services. The FGSC plans to expand
its collection to include filamentous plant pathogenic fungi. It also plans to
establish an electronic Fungal Genetics bulletin board if there is sufficient
interest in the community. Further information can be obtained by contacting
FGSC at 913/588- 7044 (phone) or 913/588-7295 (fax).
