This research addresses the issues of modeling, analysis, stability, and
performance optimization of multiple access techniques for packet-switched,
local area networks providing integrated services. Different types of traffic
which are to be integrated include voice, video, and data. Measures of network
performance include blocking and loss, channel stability, throughput, and
message delay. Results are anticipated in the areas of priority implementations
for integrated services,stability/performance/system parameter tradeoffs,
conditions for throughput maximization with stability guaranteed, and delay vs.
throughput optimization. The investigation of integrated local area networks is
timely, since thedevelopment of these networks is just beginning. Partial
integration of two or more services is being studied, and indepth systematic
examination will be made.
