Forest degradation is one of the most serious environmental problems afflicting
Honduras and much of Latin America. Despite considerable deforestation in one
region of Honduras local Lenca Indians have apparently managed their communal
forests well. A new agrarian law and a recently created a national park in the
area that will influence the future of these woodlands. These events appear
related to a resurgence in Lenca ethnic identity and community members' efforts
to gain title to their communal forests by organizing politically. This project
will investigate how communal forests are being managed and how a resurgence in
ethnic identity help the Lenca to maintain communal forest lands. The research
will focus on co-heads of households, community leaders, grassroots organization
members, government officials, and development professionals. The resulting
doctoral dissertation will increase our knowledge of communal forest management
and the social, ethnic, and political processes which can reduce the degradation
of forest ecosystems. The research findings will also assist in planning policy
to promote sustainable management of forests in Honduras and other Latin
American nations.
