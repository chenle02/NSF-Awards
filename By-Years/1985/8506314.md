Equipment will be utilized which will allow the development of a large force,
4.5 million and l.5 million pounds dynamic, tension element research facility.
The specific equipment includes a hydraulic power supply and high performance
servovalve and a data acquisition and specimen surveillance system. The
equipment will provide a state-of-the-art facility to investigate and evolve new
generation cables and other tension elements used in structures. Further, this
equipment will be used to improve the capabilities of the large capacity tension
loading research facility. The eqipment will allow faster cyclic testing and
enhanced data acquisition and specimen surveillance. The equipment will allow
intelligent data acquisition through computer control throughout the test. The
equipment will also monitor specimen performance, such as individual wire
fracture in a multistrand cable, to provide additional understanding of the
cable or specimen performance. The equipment will allow basic research in this
area to be performed to further enhance our understanding of cable and cable
anchorage behavior under fatigue loading.
