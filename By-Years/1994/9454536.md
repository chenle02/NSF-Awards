The aim of this project is to create an instrumentation calibration curriculum
strand for engineering technology, technician and science students. The
curriculum focuses on a dedicated laboratory consisting of three independent but
integratable modules providing hands-on experience with equipment measuring: (1)
voltage, current, resistance, and power; (2) fluid flow; and (3) pressure,
temperature, and volume.The resultant curriculum consists of ten modified or new
courses, affecting 16 engineering technology and science faculty and offered to
students in seven different majors and directly and indirectly to area high
school students and college students statewide. Two years of development and
evaluation, will produce a replicable model for how two-year colleges can
adequately produce the type of broadly-educated technician needed to lead in
instrumentation calibration design and operation in high-performance industries.
