Access control is one of the key aspects of information security.
In&lt;br/&gt;the past decade and a half, significant progress has been made
in&lt;br/&gt;increasing the assurance and expressiveness offered by access-
control&lt;br/&gt;systems, in large part through the use of formal logics to
model or&lt;br/&gt;implement these systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A particular
challenge in building access-control systems is to allow&lt;br/&gt;delegation
between domains that use different authorization logics.&lt;br/&gt;This project
focuses on developing a framework for interfacing&lt;br/&gt;different, mutually
incompatible authorization logics. The framework&lt;br/&gt;provides an interface
for communication between logics via a very&lt;br/&gt;small set of primitives
that imposes no fundamental constraints on the&lt;br/&gt;design of the logics
that use it. Part of this framework will be an&lt;br/&gt;architecture to
facilitate the automated construction of proofs
of&lt;br/&gt;access.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another barrier to implementing logic-
based access-control systems is&lt;br/&gt;that substantial effort is typically
required to retrofit existing&lt;br/&gt;systems to support the use of theorem
provers, proof checkers, and&lt;br/&gt;associated infrastructure. This project
will investigate several&lt;br/&gt;approaches to solving this problem, including
automated program&lt;br/&gt;rewriting and automated construction of lightweight
theorem provers&lt;br/&gt;and proof checkers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
