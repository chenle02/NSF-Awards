AST-9529190 Marcia Rieke George Rieke Nuclear Starbursts and Galaxy Evolution.
The processes in and around the nuclei of galaxies are among the most intriguing
subjects of astronomical research. This work will concentrate on the shortlived
episodes of massive star formation -- starbursts -- that can dominate these
regions. At the same time the project will explore the possibility that star
formation plays an enabling role in feeding black holes in galactic nuclei. The
components of the program include observations of young starbursts, the
development of an appropriate library of infrared spectra of stars, attempting
to find the products of starbursts, and investigations of the roles of Active
Galactic Nuclei in these classes of galaxies.
