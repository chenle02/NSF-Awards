Dresner 9619052 In each of three years 40 middle and high school teachers from
the Pacific Northwest will participate in field-based experiences in forest
ecosystem functioning. The teachers' institute begins with one week of
background study in forest ecology at Portland State University followed by four
weeks of field research at a National Forest site. The final week of the summer
session includes teachers meeting with participating agencies (National Forest
sites) near their school who have agreed to be partners. Teachers receive
8-units of graduate credit from PSU. The summer teacher teams are from the same
school, and during the academic year their students will do research and collect
data for use in their science classes and by the Forest Service. During the
second and third summers teachers who have completed a year in the program will
work as leadership teachers for the new participants. This forest research
project for teachers will become institutionalized as it becomes a permanent
part of PSU's new Masters in Science Teaching Program. Partners on this project
are US Forest Service scientists and faculty from PSU, Oregon State University,
and the Oregon Institute of Technology.
