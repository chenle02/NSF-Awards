This project will be performed at the Ford Wixom Assembly Plant and Danou
Technical Center. The objective is to propose, evaluate and analyze diagnostic
testing strategies for advanced vehicle electronic systems. The recently
developed theory of discrete event systems will be used. The study will result
in increased efficiency during the assembly process, reduced costs of service
and maintenance, and the ability to meet increasingly stringent environmental
regulations.
