Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Ariola, Zena&lt;br/&gt;Oregon
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is the development of a
summer school to prepare graduate students, faculty and industrial people to
conduct research on the foundations of security. Three types of material is
presented and discussed: &lt;br/&gt;Background&lt;br/&gt;This material consists
of well established results developed in the late 80's and early 90's. This
provides an introduction to the essential concepts and methodologies.
&lt;br/&gt;Advanced Topics&lt;br/&gt;This material consists of more recent
results that extend and generalize the earlier work. This provides students with
insights into research and open questions.&lt;br/&gt;Applications&lt;br/&gt;This
material demonstrates how theoretical results can be used by practitioners in
dealing with security problems in a concurrent setting.&lt;br/&gt;This provides
students with skills in the use of formal methods to reason about and generate
solutions to practical problems, such as verification of protocols or Java
specifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following the summer school the material
presented by the speakers will be made available through the summer school web
site. Thus, the the school can have a broader impact on the
community.&lt;br/&gt;
