9413464 Viney This instrument is to be used on research projects that include:
(a) real-time studies of the assembly of materials, structures and molecular
machinery at sub-cellular scales; (b) the hierarchial assembly of fibrous,
tubular and network protein structures outside cells; (c) studies of inorganic
crystal nucleation on engineered protein templates leading to the improved
design of novel polymer/ceramic composites; (d) the deformation and fracture
properties of biological materials; (e) rational design of biomaterials (e.g.,
implants, contract lenses) based on their observed structure and interaction
with biological media; (f) the effect of gaseous environment on high temperature
sintering reactions in ceramics; and (g) cermets: the effect of environment and
ceramic surface characteristics on wettability by liquid metals. An
interdisciplinary group of researchers at the University of Washington is to
utilize this instrument. ***
