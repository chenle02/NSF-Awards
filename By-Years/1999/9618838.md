Tools for Lexicon Building" project is preparing a lexical database for English
called "Framenet" built on abundant corpus evidence and formulated on the
principles of frame semantics. It will be freely available to researchers in
several formats, including one that can serve as an accessory to WordNet. The
primary deliverable is a highly relational "starter" lexicon containing 5,000
entries covering major semantic domains. Each database entry is associated with
the semantic frame in which it participates, and annotated with respect to how
it constellates with the elements of that frame, both morphosyntactically and
semantically. Entries will also list examples taken from the corpus showing the
range of the word's use, including relative frequency data. Another significant
development of the project is a set of high-performance computational tools for
corpus research, annotation, and analysis (some of which are being developed in
collaboration with colleagues in Europe) which will be made available to the
research community. The resulting facility, which incorporates both linguistic-
semantic and lexicographic techniques, will be valuable to human users of both
printed and online works and also to researchers exploring natural language
processing, speech recognition, and the complex problems of language
understanding.
