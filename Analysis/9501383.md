9501383 Ornstein Part of the research involves a completely new approach to
stability results of the KAM type. This approach fills the gaps in earlier work
on diffeomorphisms of the circle and are optimal. The method gives a new proof
of the Moser twist theorem; gives optimal smoothness for invariant curves whose
rotation numbers belong to a "good" set of full measure; gives invariant curves
for twist maps which are not necessarily close to a rigid twist. The project
will involve completing this work and extending to higher dimensions. In other
directions the investigators will continue their work on a statistical version
of structural stability and applications of ergodic theory to combinatorics and
number theory. Some of the research is focused on the question: What can we say
about the long-term behavior of a dynamical system, if we have only approximate
information about the equations that govern them? This research will focus on
two simple examples involving maps of the circle or an annulus. A study will
also be made of chaotic systems. Applications of ergodic theory and dynamical
systems to combinatorial and number theoretic problems as well as statistics and
data compression will be investigated. ***
