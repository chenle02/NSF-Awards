The problems of assessing the deterioration of musculoskeletal functions in a
human after disease or excessive loads, continues to be a social problem of
enormous magnitude. Major advances in computerized axial tomography (CAT)
scanning during the past decade has provided an effective means to spatially and
quantitatively examine the internal structure of parts of the body. CAT scan
images are interpreted to provide information for improved diagonistic
procedures and treatments. Further advances in the CAT scan method appear
possible by utilizing image analysis methods to quantatively evaluate the CAT
scan images. The research program deals with developing software for image
analysis to establish a quantitative method for evaluating bone structure,
density and geometry of the human musculoskeletal system. Specifically the
project will focus on osteoporosis femur specimens with the objective of
evaluating the extent and severity of the disease. Physical and mechanical
property evaluation will also be performed to correlate CT data with important
mechanical properties. PDA Engineering has an excellent background in R&D
associated with both industrial and medical CT scanner systems and have
significant experience in biomedical applications. The staff qualifications are
excellent as the research team has extensive experience in electronics, NDE and
bioengineering which are required for successful completion of the program. A
grant is recommended.
