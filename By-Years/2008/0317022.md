The surface of all insects is covered by a thin layer of very long-chain
hydrocarbons that serve the critical function of restricting water loss to
prevent a lethal rate of desiccation. Many species also use hydrocarbons in
chemical communication. Despite their importance for an insect's survival and
absence among most other animals, there have been few studies aimed at
understanding the biochemistry and molecular biology of hydrocarbon formation. A
clear understanding of this critical process in insects is also needed to design
inhibitors of key steps that could function in novel and environmentally sound
insect control techniques. The housefly, Musca domestica, is an excellent model
insect with which to study the biochemistry and molecular biology of hydrocarbon
formation. Ovarian produced ecdysteroids regulate hydrocarbon production, which
results in the female producing (Z)-9-tricosene and a series of methyl-branched
hydrocarbons, all of which function in the sex pheromone. The work proposed
herein is designed to gain an understanding of a critical process in hydrocarbon
formation, the elongation of 16 and 18 carbon fatty acids to the very-long chain
24-36 carbon fatty acids that are the immediate precursors to hydrocarbons.
Specifically, the objectives are to: (1) Isolate, clone and sequence key enzymes
involved in hydrocarbon synthesis, (2) Determine the ecdysteroid regulation of
these enzymes at the molecular level and (3) Assay the key enzymes. In addition
to training post-doctoral fellows and graduate students, undergraduates also
will be trained in aspects of biochemistry and molecular biology. The proposed
work will lead to a better understanding of critical processes in insects that
could lead to new targets for future pest control strategies.
