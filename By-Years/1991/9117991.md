This research will address the ecology of an Antarctic predatory copepod,
Euchaeta antarctica, a biomass dominant and important macroplanktonic carnivore
in Croker Passage, a deep basin off the Antarctic peninsula. Previous work has
shown that size-selective feeding on crustacean prey more than adequately covers
respiratory costs so excess dietary input could be stored by this large lipid-
rich copepod. With the onset of winter, feeding stops, respiration and excretion
rates decline and oxygen/nitrogen ratio increases, indicating a shift from a
protein and lipid based metabolism to a lipid-dominated metabolism,
corroborating summer feeding activity and winter reliance on lipids. During
winter, nearly all females are reproductively mature, producing multiple
clutches of lipid-rich eggs from their maternal stores. Early stages mature
slowly so the first feeding stage appears in the plankton in synchrony with the
active bloom in southern waters. The extreme seasonality of food availability in
this polar region enforces the separation of 2 processes: feeding in summer and
reproduction in winter. This project will complete the lipid analyses, an
essential component of this research. Samples, previously collected, permit an
analysis of total lipid content, lipid class composition and production rates by
different copepodid stages during three different seasons, and by different
reproductive states of the adult female in the winter. This work will allow for
an evaluation of whether the stored reserves are sufficient to provide energy to
support winter metabolic rates and reproductive demands and will provide an
understanding of the linkage between lipid content/composition and life history
strategies.
