This research, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, uses laser
techniques to explore the electronic structure and intermolecular interactions
that determine chemical properties in prototypical organic molecules in the
solid state. The data obtained, together with their interpretation using
available and developing models, are utilized to understand the chemical
properties, dynamics and electronic structures of polyene systems. The results
of this research are useful in understanding many technologies varying from
optical memories to the molecular basis for vision. Laser-based photochemical
hole burning techniques will be utilized to measure 1- and 2-photon spectra and
excited state dynamics for well defined polyenes substituted into mixed crystals
at liquid helium temperatures. The data obtained will elucidate the fundamental
mechanism by which a linear polyene isomerizes in a molecular cavity. In
addition to providing new information on cis to trans isomerization, these
studies will explain the connection between isomerization and nonbonded
interactions between guest and host molecules.
