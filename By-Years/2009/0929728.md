The Promoting Underrepresented Girls Involvement in Research, Science, and
Energy (PURSE) program is a Strategies Project where Metropolitan Detroit high
school girls in grades 9-11, participate in project based out-of-school time in
space and engineering activities that teach concepts related to the production
and storage of energy. The project is designed to advance knowledge and
understanding about key mathematical and scientific concepts in areas of energy
such as batteries and fuel cells, nuclear energy and alternative energy sources
like wind and solar. Students will participate in team oriented programming that
exposes them to fundamental chemistry, physics and engineering concepts that
enable energy generation and storage. The project offers a well-conceptualized,
multi-layered set of experiences designed to ignite and sustain girls? interest
in science, engineering, and leadership in the Renewable Energy and Energy
Efficiency (RE&EE) industries.
