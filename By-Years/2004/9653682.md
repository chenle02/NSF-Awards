Drexel University has become a national leader in restructuring engineering and
science education as a result of multi-year efforts. The experimental E4 program
has emerged as an international model for core engineering education in the 21st
century. Its success and the encouragement of virtually every segment of the
engineering enterprise, caused the College of Engineering to initiate a program
of unprecedented scale and scope to develop a totally new curriculum based on
this core. In the biological sciences, the Enhanced Bioscience Education (EBE)
program has gained national recognition for the way it engages bioscience majors
in experiential learning and project-based inquiry during their freshmen and
sophomore years. In keeping with the mission of our technological University,
the faculty, with support from administration, are now ready to develop
additional University-wide reforms and innovations. The Initiatives for Systmic
Educational Reform project is intended to provide the next steps in this
continuing process. The project focuses on overcoming the problems of scale and
paradigm changes which are associated with sweeping institutional reforms. The
strategy is to continue curricular innovations of a systemic nature and at the
same time expand the University's ability of create further innovations. The
strategy is being implemented using the teams of faculty and the methodologies
that created the successes of E4 and EBE. The cadre of experienced faculty is
being expanded with the addition of new faculty to generate the new courses and
approaches that are critically needed in our existing reform efforts. At the
same time supporting infrastructures for long-term curricular and faculty
development are being established to sustain the effort in the future.
