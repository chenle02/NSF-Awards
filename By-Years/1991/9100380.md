This award provides funds to the Program in Molecular Biology and Biotechnology,
an independent campus-wide unit created to promote genetic engineering research
and education at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, to continue its
Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site for an additional three
years. Academically promising students chosen from a national pool will
participate in ongoing research carried out by a select group of PMBB faculty.
Emphasis will be placed on recruitment of students with limited research
opportunities and on students from groups historically under-represented in the
sciences. A total of 12 REU students will participate. Nine students will be
funded by the NSF, two students will be funded by the UNC School of Medicine,
and one student will be supported with funds from the Division of Health
Affairs. The overall goals are to (1) introduce students to a diversity of
biological research and techniques, particularly in molecular biology and
molecular genetics, (2) familiarize students with the process of independent
research, (3) promote development of laboratory and communication skills, and
(4) provide guidance to aid students in selection of graduate programs. To meet
these goals students will (1) work for ten weeks with faculty on projects having
meaningful scientific objectives and derived from ongoing research, (2) attend
weekly research topic discussions with each faculty preceptor, (3) attend a
meeting in which Directors of Graduate Studies from various departments provide
students with advice and information about Ph.D. programs (4) visit campus
scientific core facilities (eg, protein sequencing and analysis), laboratories
at the UNC Hospitals that employ molecular techniques in medical diagnoses (eg,
DNA Diagnostic Facility), and pharmaceutical establishments in Research Triangle
Park, and (4) present the results of their research in talks before the campus
community.
