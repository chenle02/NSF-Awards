The National Academy of Science Committee on Science, Engineering and Public
Policy (COSEPUP) is charged to "to deliberate on initiatives for new studies in
the area of science and technology policy, taking especially into account the
concerns and requests of the President's Science Advisor, the Director of the
NSF, the Chairman of the National Science Board, and the chairmen of key science
and technology-related committees of the Congress." Its work has addressed
issues of critical importance to Federal Agencies and the Nation. Among its
recent studies is the widely publicized "Rising above the Gathering Storm:
Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future", which has
since helped to focus renewed attention on science and technology as a driver
for U.S. competitiveness in the global economy. Since its inception, the
National Science Foundation has supported COSEPUP activities. This award will
provide funds for core support of COSEPUP, to continue its work as an
independent advisor on issues relating to national science and technology
policy.
