Recent research on investment decisions under uncertainty has highlighted the
importance of option values, or of waiting to resolve some uncertainty and
gather more information. This work is mostly restricted to "classical" economic
environments, with perfect risk markets and without economies of scale or
externalities. This project extends the analysis to "non- classical" settings,
using corresponding extensions of techniques of stochastic optimal control. The
more general theory will then be applied to some important policy issues.
Examples include the following. (1) Criteria for investment under uncertainty
with scale economies and externalities will be developed, built into a model of
industry evolution, and linked to the new theory of growth. (2) Since labor
income risk is hard or impossible to diversify, trade adjustment, and more
generally job losses due to plant closure, alter risk- bearing. The issue, and
appropriate policies, will be modelled. (3) Real rigidities of slow adjustment
will be combined with nominal inertia into macroeconomic models of employment
fluctuations. (4) When evaluating new technologies to reduce environmental
damage, the value of waiting to gather more information must be traded off
against the risk of irreversible damage while we wait. This will be formulated
as a stochastic control problem with filtering.
