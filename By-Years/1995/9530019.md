9530019 Maciie This is a three year collaborative proposal for investigating
upper mantle (&lt; 1000 km) conductivity differences beneath the oceans and
continents. Subcontinental and suboceanic upper mantle compositional and
temperature differences have been proposed to explain a wide array of
geophysical data (jordan, 1975) and are postulated to play an important role in
plate tectonics and mantle convection. This concept, known as the tectosphere
concept, envisions that the subcontinental mantle is cold and depleted in iron
relative to the suboceanic mantle. Electrical properties in the mantle are
strongly dependent upon both temperature and iron, and hence, it is expected
that there would be considerable information in the electrical property
differences between the suboceanic and subcontinental uppers mantles. The
project will involve collections of several field data sets which will be
combined into a consistent and robust 3-D model of the upper mantle conductivity
structure for a detailed electrical look at the tectosphere concept.
