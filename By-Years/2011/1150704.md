The Internet's astounding success and growth can also lead to its gradual
`ossification', hampering its ability to evolve and accommodate new services and
applications. To address this problem, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has
been proposed as a way to 'program' networks and make it easier to deploy new
protocols and new applications, as well as tune network performance. To-date,
SDN techniques have, for the most part, targeted infrastructure-based networks.
However, as self-organizing, infrastructure-less networks become more prevalent
and ubiquitous, they will become integral parts of the Internets of the future,
enabling a variety of applications such as vehicular communications, community
services, healthcare delivery, emergency response, environmental monitoring, to
name a few.

Motivated by this vision of the internet of the future, this project will
develop Hybrid-SDN, or H-SDN, which will enable SDN in future internets
consisting of infrastructure-based and infrastructure-less networks. To
accomplish this goal, current SDN approaches, e.g., OpenFlow, which are
inherently centralized, will be augmented so that they can operate in
infrastructure-less, decentralized networked environments. The main deliverable
of this project is the basic H-SDN prototype. Subsequently, we plan to (1)
continue the H-SDN development and (2) develop efficient and flexible content
delivery services in hybrid networks using H-SDN.

Broader Impact: By developing H-SDN, this research will likely have considerable
broader impact as it will enable efficient content delivery in future internets.
With content and computation moving to the cloud, efficient content delivery
will be critical for content-- and service providers, as well as end users. This
project also has a strong education component to this project including an
exchange and co-supervision of junior researchers and graduate students between
the two partner institutions.
