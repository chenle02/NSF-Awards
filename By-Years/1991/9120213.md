Professor Jaecks measures the dynamics of three-body dissociation among heavy
charged particles, such as protons and hydrogent negative ions, so as to
understand their very long- range, correlated motion. The problem of charged
three-particle dynamics is unsolved in quantum theory and this experiment will
measure the critical parameters necessary to advance our understanding of this
process commonly encountered in atomic and molecular interactions.
