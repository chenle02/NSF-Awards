This award in the NSF/DARPA Joint Initiative on Image Understanding and Speech
Recognition is for research on multilevel acoustic and phonetic models for
large-vocabulary speaker-independent continuous speech recognition. Drs.
Ostendorf and Rohlicek will use the hidden-Markov speech recognition system at
BBN Systems and Technologies Corporation as a baseline, and will add multilevel
phonetic segment modeling to improve performance. The grant includes support for
several graduate and undergraduate students, as well as workstation hardware and
software needed for speech recognition research.
