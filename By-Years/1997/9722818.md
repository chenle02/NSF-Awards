9722818 Feigenson A goal of this work is to find the solubility limit of
cholesterol in model and real biomembranes, above which cholesterol precipitates
from the bilayer as a crystal. This project has four main components: (I)
defined mixtures of cholesterol and phospholipids are used as models for
biomembranes; (ii) novel methods, together with X-ray diffraction experiments,
are developed that are sensitive to the formation of coexisting phases; (iii)
Monte Carlo computer simulations are used in order to find the cholesterol and
phospholipid interaction energy over the entire range of compositions; (iv)
crystalline cholesterol monohydrate formation is probed in cultured mammalian
cells. These experiments will enable construction of 3-component phase diagrams
that describe the mixing of cholesterol with two different phospholipids. The
theoretical part of this project develops a model to describe the microscopic
interaction energy between cholesterol and its neighboring lipids. Guided by
these model system studies, X-ray diffraction and electron and optical
microscopy of cells in culture will determine cholesterol solubility limits in
real biomembranes. The overall objective of this project is to define and
measure excessive cholesterol content, for a given membrane. These basic studies
will clarify mechanisms of cholesterol accumulation within cells and cellular
signals for its uptake. ***
