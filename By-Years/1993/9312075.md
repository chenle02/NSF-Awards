9312075 Selser This work will use light scattering, principally the noninvasive
dynamic light scattering technique known as photon correlation spectroscopy, to
study slow relaxations in poly(ethylene oxide) polymer electrolytes.
Poly(ethylene oxide) itself and poly(ethylene oxide)-based polymer hosts are
generally acknowledged as among the best choices for polymer electrolytes both
for research and for application. The purpose of this work will be to determine,
under the same conditions, the relationship between conductivity in
poly(ethylene oxide) electrolytes and slow relaxations in poly(ethylene oxide)
electrolytes, as probed by light scattering. ***
