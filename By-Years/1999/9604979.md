This dissertation enhancement grant supports a US graduate student, Kimberly P.
Pfeifer, working under the guidance of Dr. Goran Hyden, Professor of Political
Science at the University of Florida, to do field research in Tanzania. The
project will study the Fumba, Chakwa, Nungwi and Mkwajuni communities in
Zanzibar to determine how they use their ethnic identities to influence the
development and implementation of sustainable development and resource
management policies created by Tanzanian state and nongovernmental
organizations. The results of this study should provide valuable information on
ways policy-making organizations can incorporate the concerns of local
communities into their strategies and policies to address global change
problems. The principal methods used will be interviews, focus group sessions,
and archival research. Staff members of the Institute of Development Studies at
the University of Dar es Salaam will collaborate with Ms. Pfeifer on this
project. This study will make an important contribution to the understanding of
how different ethnic groups contribute to the success or failure of national
policies on conservation and resource distribution and management. The grant
will also provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong,
independent research career. Funding for this project is being provided by the
Division of International Programs and by the Division of Social, Behavioral,
and Economic Research.
