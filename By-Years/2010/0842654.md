This project focuses on the design, synthesis, and catalytic conversion of
cyclic esters derived from renewable resources into useful, sustainable
polymeric materials. An interdisciplinary approach will be taken that integrates
chemical synthesis and structural definition of new monomers, catalysts, and
polymers, mechanistic studies of polymerization catalysis via synergistic use of
experimental and theoretical methods, and characterization of the properties of
new and useful multiblock polymeric materials. An approach aimed at uncovering
important and detailed mechanistic information concerning metal alkoxide systems
will also be pursued. Finally, expansion and further development of all-
renewable and degradable polylactide-polymenthide-polylactide thermoplastic
elastomers will be augmented with new efforts to develop these materials for
specific applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professors
William Tolman and Marc Hillmyer of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. The jointly directed research efforts of
Professors Tolman and Hillmyer address the challenge of transforming traditional
chemical and materials processing, production, and disposal methods and
contribute to sustainable technology development by providing fundamental
insights into catalysis of renewable cyclic ester polymerizations. The findings
from this research will be useful to future industrial efforts to develop new
and useful polymeric materials that are environmentally friendly, renewable, and
biodegradable. Through interdisciplinary student training in synthesis, polymer
chemistry, and catalysis, dissemination of research findings through
publications and lectures at conferences, and other activities aimed at
informing the public, the research program will impact efforts to develop
sustainable technologies for the benefit of society.
