The wetland sediments fringing estuaries at the Cascadia subduction zone harbor
a unique record of plate-boundary earthquakes during the past 5,000 years.
However, the precision of past measurements of land-level changes at Cascadia is
low (errors of greater than plus or minus 0.5 meter), the measurements are
spatially limited, and they span only fractions of complete cycles of subduction
zone strain accumulation and release. This makes past measurements insufficient
for determining which hypotheses of plate-boundary deformation are most valid.
This deficiency will be redressed by applying recently developed statistical
transfer functions to microfossils, such as foraminifera and diatoms, collected
from Cascadia estuarine sediments. Similar studies of sea-level change on other
continents have obtained an unprecedented vertical resolution of plus or minus
0.1-0.3 meter. Seasonal and spatial differences in modern foraminfera and
diatoms from Cascadia estuaries are assessed and the results are used to improve
our microfossil-based transfer functions. Transfer functions are applied to
fossil foraminiferal and diatom data at several estuaries to reconstruct land-
level changes spanning the four most recent great earthquake cycles in the
central Cascadia subduction zone. Detailed lithostratigraphical and
biostratigraphical descriptions and radiocarbon dating of estuarine sediment
allow correlation of microfossil reconstructions among estuaries and help
reconstruct a history of plate-boundary deformation in Oregon. The improved
vertical resolution of our reconstructions will: (1) yield more precise measures
of Cascadia deformation over time periods of 10 to 100 years; (2) provide
critical tests for competing hypotheses of coastal uplift versus subsidence just
prior to great earthquakes; (3) help constrain regional models of Cascadia
plate-boundary deformation; and (4) directly test hypotheses of slip-
predictable, time-predictable, and slip-time-unpredictable strain accumulation
proposed for other subduction zones.
