Modern software is increasingly developed using managed programming languages,
such as Java and C#, because they eliminate a large class of low-level memory-
related errors that have plagued languages such as C and C++ and caused
countless failures and security vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, software still
suffers from a troubling array of higher-level semantic errors, which can cause
programs to misbehave without necessarily triggering an overt failure. Prior
techniques for detecting these errors suffer from some combination of
imprecision (false positives), poor scalability on large programs, or extremely
high run-time overheads.

This project will explore a new approach for detecting programming errors that
is precise, informative, scalable, and efficient enough to use in deployed
software. The approach leverages techniques from static analysis that allow
programmers to express expected program properties, but overcomes prior
limitations by checking the properties at run-time. The key idea is to piggyback
error checking on the garbage collector, which can check and elucidate complex
program properties with very low overhead because it periodically visits all
objects in the heap. The result of this research will be a much-needed technique
for detecting and diagnosing bugs in deployed software -- especially large,
complex, and highly dynamic programs, such as server applications.
