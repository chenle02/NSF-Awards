Charles Boyer will continue his research into moduli problems which arise in
mathematical physics. This is currently one of the most active areas of
mathematics and has been shown to have profound consequences in mathematical
physics, topology and geometry. The motivation for much of Boyer's work is the
realization that many moduli problems in mathematics and mathematical physics
are intimately related to the homotopy theory of iterated loop spaces. It is
this observation that reveals the relationship between the topology of the
moduli spaces and the differential topology of the underlying four dimensional
manifold. Boyer's work is expected to shed further light on this relationship.
It also holds promise of revealing deeper understanding of connections between
algebraic topology and geometric non-linear partial differential equations.
