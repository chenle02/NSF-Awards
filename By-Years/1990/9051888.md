This award provides funds to the Department of Botany at Ohio State University
to help purchase equipment to be used in a new two- quarter course in modern
plant biology. The new course (BOT 102) includes a completely new laboratory
component. Written by experts in sub-specialties of plant science, most
exercises use the new rapid cycling Brassicas and all call for hands-on
experimentation and observation using current technology. Equipment to be
purchased with this grant will be used in three of the ten lab exercises: 1) For
Cell Structure--video cameras, monitors, and video recorders will allow the
students to observe special cellular structures and phenomena visible with
fluorescent or oil immersion microscopy...instruments which are prohibitively
expensive for individual student use. 2) For Development and Biotechnology--
sterile transfer hoods will support experiments with plant hormones using tissue
culture techniques. 3) For Photosynthesis, Phototropism, and Phototaxis--the
students will use spectrophotometers, chart recorders, quantum radiometers,
centrifuges, balances, etc. to learn how plants absorb and utilize light
efficiently in food production. The grantee is matching this award with non-
Federal sources.
