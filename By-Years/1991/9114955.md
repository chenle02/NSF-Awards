This is a continuation of the work on the nannoplankton species Florisphaera
profunda as a paleoceanographic proxy. The study will estimate spatial and
temporal variations in mean heat content of tropical turbulent layer of the
Atlantic using this spp. as a proxy. Results are considered important for
atmosphere-ocean model validation. In addition, similar analyses of equatorial
regions of Ekman divergence in the Pacific will also be made to see if the
Pacific behaves the same way as the Atlantic in response to orbital forcing in
terms of nutricline/thermocline dynamics. Chronological potential of F. profunda
will also be investigated.
