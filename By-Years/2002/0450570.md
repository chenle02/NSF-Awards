This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on
developing methods to improve the power and performance of an exciting new
diode-pumped solid-state laser crystal. Laser crystals are superior to any other
candidate material in the emerging and rapidly developing field of ultrafast
lasers by their ability to generate high power femtosecond pulses. The proposed
program will involve crystal growth in order to select the material with optimum
operating performance and power handling capabilities. Issues to be addressed
include the optimum concentration in the crystals, the uniformity of dopant
incorporation during crystal growth, the preferred orientation of the crystal
for laser rod fabrication, and methods to improve the quality and reliability of
these crystals.

The first commercial ultrafast laser system based on this technology was
recently introduced. In order to ensure the rapid development of this new
technology and the myriad applications in material processing, medicine and
basic science it will undoubtedly enable, considerable development effort is
required. This research effort is directed toward bringing the material system
on which the laser is based to a point of performance, reliability and
producability necessary for the commercial success of this new device.
