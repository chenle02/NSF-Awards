Work on this project will be in the following topical areas: 1. Full nuclear
Overhauser effect characterization of template-nucleated alanine helices through
study of deuterium-labeled derivatives. 2. Determination for the first time of
the experimental length-dependence of the CD ellipticities for short alanine-
derived helices. 3. Measurements of the energetics and stabilization/
destabilization of helices by the twenty amino acid residues, using template-
nucleated helices. These measurements should resolve the current controversies
concerning the magnitudes and independence of s values (helix propagation
constants). 4. Design, synthesis, and study of maximally nucleating helix
templates. 5. Measurement in templated systems of the magnitudes of polar
stabilization effects. With this award, the Organic Synthesis Program will
support the research of Dr. Daniel S. Kemp at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. The research will develop structural models that will facilitate the
evaluation of parameters which control the formation of secondary and tertiary
structure in peptide chains. This information is crucial to the understanding of
protein chemistry and the design of biologically active molecules for
biochemistry and medicine, as well as in the chemical industry.
