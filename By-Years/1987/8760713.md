A large number of toxins (such as paralytic shellfish toxins, tetrodotoxin and
bactrachotoxin) are potentially lethal contaminants in seafood. They are known
to act by altering the conductance properties of a well-characterized sodium
channel found in muscle and nerve tissues. The objective of this study is to
develop an enzyme-linked assay to detect these toxins. Enzyme or coenzyme
conjugates of the toxin will be coupled with purified sodium channels for use on
displacement assays to quantitate the amount of site 1 sodium channel toxins in
the sample. The assay is expected to have a sensitivity comparable to the
radioimmunoassys currently used, but will avoid the hazards of handling
radioisotopes. It will also have a greatly improved cross-reactivity, thus
enabling the detection of any site 1 toxin in a seafood sample. In Phase I,
enzyme and coenzyme conjugates of saxitoxin and tetrodotoxin will be prepared
and tested in displacement assays using partially purified sodium channels. In
Phase II enzyme linked toxins will be compared to radiolabeled toxins for
binding affinity to the sodium channel and for sensitivity in assays to detect
unlabeled toxins. The toxin assay developed will be extremely useful as
screening test for the safety of seafood samples. In addition, the reagents
produced may aid in the study of sodium channel function.
