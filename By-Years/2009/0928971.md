The Science and Math Applied Real-problem Teaching (SMART) project is a
collaboration between the core partners Adelphi University, Westbury High
School, and the Cradle of Aviation Museum. The goal of the project is to enhance
the quality of high school science and mathematics education in high-needs
schools in Long Island, New York by (1) jointly developing a museum-based
curriculum grounded in inquiry models of instruction and (2) building school
capacity for ongoing professional development and build learning communities
among math and science teachers. The SMART project pairs high schools with a
nearby science museum such that classes will be taught at the museums by
teachers from the high school. This partnership enables teachers and students to
gain an appreciation for how the material relates to the world around them by
providing opportunities for students to make connections between theoretical
science and real life experiences. This project is jointly designing a grade 9
integrated physics/math course grounded in local interactive museum contexts,
and build a collaborative network amongst teachers, museum educators and
university faculty. The program incorporates Physics First, an educational
philosophy involving teaching physics at the beginning of the high school
curriculum.
