This project enhances undergraduate student learning, retention, and recruitment
through the development of academic roadmaps, which guide academic planning,
advising, and study. Principal Investigators are 1) developing a transferable
web-based template and two actual conceptual student roadmaps that describe
academic and career information in two science disciplines, geology and
nutrition. These web-based electronic maps illustrate educational pathways,
requirements, and expectations for learning; relevance to national issues and
trends; workplace applications and career tracks; research, internship, and
volunteer opportunities; and related course information. 2) Translating the
intellectual content of the roadmaps into powerful software and visually
appealing graphics and screens for use on the World Wide Web. 3) Linking the
roadmap screens to the institutions' academic, advising, and admissions sites,
and to national portals of disciplinary information. 4) Training university and
community college faculty and professional staff to utilize roadmap materials in
all college advising, student program planning, student recruitment activities,
and evaluation of institutional effectiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
electronic maps are being made available to a broad range of students and
families through national disciplinary, labor, and career websites. The
transparency of such a graphic advising system should lead to improved student
retention and performance in the sciences. The availability of such maps will
also improve student recruitment into relevant science fields. This project is
developing a mapping template that will be transferable to other institutions,
both locally and throughout the nation. Such a tool will also enhance
communication with higher education's stakeholders and state legislators about
the generation of competent, reflective graduates who are articulate about their
knowledge and skills, are adept problem solvers and communicators, and who
pursue lifelong learning. &lt;br/&gt;
