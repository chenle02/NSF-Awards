The proposal plans to connect HWI to vBNS and Abilene via the University at
Buffalo. Scientists at HWI are engaged in protein research and will use this
connection for real-time access and control of diffraction experiments conducted
at synchrotron sites around the country in order to conduct protein analyses,
for data-mining and data-warehousing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
