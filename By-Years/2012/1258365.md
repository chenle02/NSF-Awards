The project will characterize the large spatial and temporal variability in the
terrestrial fluxes of methyl halides and C2-C4 alkenes into the atmosphere.
Field studies will be conducted to quantify ecosystem net fluxes from high
emitting peatland pasture (Sherman Island) and temperate forest (Manitou Forest)
ecosystems. The hypothesis that methyl halide and light alkene emissions from
terrestrial ecosystems are predominantly biogenic and are strongly coupled to
each other through the production of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) will be
investigated. The results of the study will be incorporated into a regional and
global emissions model that takes into account biological, physical and chemical
driving factors of terrestrial biogenic emissions to the atmosphere.

Methyl halides impact stratospheric ozone depletion, and light alkenes
contribute to tropospheric ozone production. The biogenic emissions of these
compounds, from sources such as plants, are a major contributor to organic
aerosols that also affect air quality and climate.
