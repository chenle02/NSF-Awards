9303890 Chave A thorough evaluation of the ability of the combination of
Horizontal electrometers (HEMs) and Inverted Echo Sounders (IESs) to accurately
estimate volume and heat transports will be conducted. Possible improvements of
the accuracy of these estimates by adding bottom pressure sensors will also be
investigated. The HEM and IES observations gathered as part of the SYNOP
(Synoptic observation of the Gulf Stream) program will be compared to the direct
transport measurements obtained with traditional current meter arrays.
