9315358 Doty This award, in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research mode,
addresses simulation and preliminary hardware implementations for exploration of
the use of a "swarm" paradigm for organization of multiple cooperating robots
for robust, flexible material handling in dynamic and uncertain environments.
The exploration emphasizes collective behavior of agents with individually
modest intelligence, using a minimalist approach of variations on a single basic
building block. The domain of exploration is manufacturing work cells. If such a
system can have sufficient robustness designed in, it could make robotics more
appealing for manufacturing applications. Robust robotization of material
handling would also facilitate system control of the material flow in a plant,
thus supporting computer integration of manufacturing operations. This
evolutionary design approach seems worthy of at least initial exploration, and
at the modest level requested, and award is recommended.
