9361665 Ting This project deals with reduction of boat drag through a
modification of the pressure field around the vessel by venting areas of high
pressure to areas of low pressure via orifices through the side of the hull
connected by ducting. The research consist of a combination of model testing on
a single hull and theoretical analysis. General approaches are developed to
predict the opportunities for reduction of drag, and consequently the necessary
propulsion power, for a variety of displacement vessels ranging from small boats
to large ships. ***
