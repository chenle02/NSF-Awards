Mathematical models for reinforcement of assortative mating

Mathematical models are used to gain insight into complex evolutionary processes
and to quantify evolutionary forces. This study proposes two projects that use
mathematical models in both of these ways to investigate the role of natural
selection in speciation. Specifically, this work investigates the process of
reinforcement in which selection favors the evolution of reproductive isolation
that decreases costly hybridization. The first proposed project would create
analytic models to determine the conditions under which selection against
hybrids can cause reinforcement of assortative mating. The second proposed
project will combine mathematical models with empirical observations to estimate
the strength of selection, the rate of hybridization, and migration affecting
reinforcement in the Texas wildflower, Phlox drummondii. A spatially-explicit
simulation model will be developed based on the geography and genetics of
natural P. drummondii populations. This model will be fit to empirical data to
give the first estimates of evolutionary parameters involved in reinforcement.

The proposed projects will train the postdoctoral fellow in diverse
mathematical, simulation, and statistical methods such as learning to create and
solve dynamic systems, methods of approximation, and likelihood methods. This
fellowship work includes creating a Science, Technology, Engineering and Math
(STEM) club at a local Austin middle school, which serves a diverse student
body. The major goal of the STEM club will be to guide students through the
design and execution of their own research projects.
