INVESTIGATOR: Zaslavsky , Alexander&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: NER: Exploring Nanodevices
for Probabilistic Computing
Architectures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;The progress of modern
transistor-based digital technology has depended on shrinking silicon transistor
to ever smaller sizes and integrating more of these transistors into logic
circuits. At some point in the next decade, however, transistors will reach
their ultimate physical size and circuits will contain so many transistors that
some nonworking devices are inevitable. As a result, we may need both new types
of devices to replace silicon transistors or new types of logic architectures
that can tolerate some number of defective devices in a circuit, or
both.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed exploratory research targets both of
these issues. We propose to map our previously developed probabilistic computer
architectures onto real experimental devices, that will be fabricated from
carbon nanotube material. Conversely, the nonlinear characteristics of the
nanotube device prototypes will provide the experimental inputs to designing
more advanced fault-tolerant logic circuits. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
