College&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MRI: Acquisition of Computing and
Peripheral Hardware to Support Collaborative Research and Undergraduate Research
Education in Virtual Reality&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a proposal for
equipment acquisition under the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program to
support research and student training in virtual reality. The virtual reality
effort will provide a platform for the investigation of human motion planning
and the development of computational models to enable high fidelity object
manipulation within a virtual environment. &lt;br/&gt;
