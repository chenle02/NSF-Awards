SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a workshop on the Materials
Genome Initiative. The workshop will be held at NSF in Arlington, VA in
December, 2012. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Materials Genome Initiative promises
to revolutionize the way in materials science and engineering is practiced. Many
areas stand to benefit from this initiative, but in order to have a long lasting
impact it is important for the materials research community to identify clear
opportunities for development and compelling areas of research. The workshop
will focus on the synergy between computational and experimental research. The
workshop will bring together experimental, computational, and theoretical
scientists and engineers with the goal of identifying such opportunities. This
workshop complements past workshops related to MGI which largely centered on
computational aspects. This workshop includes the interaction of computation
with experiment and other important aspects in the broader context of how
materials research is done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The areas of research to be
covered in the workshop span a wide spectrum of materials science and
engineering, ranging from semiconductors to polymeric systems. The candidate
speakers have been carefully selected on the basis of their expertise, vision,
and the influence that they have exerted in materials research. Additional
participants for the workshop will also be invited in order to provide a forum
for discussion that is inclusive and representative of the materials community
at large. The key outcome of the workshop will be a report that will be widely
disseminated throughout the scientific community.
