9312053 Holmes University of Massachusetts - Amherst Dr. Robert R. Holmes,
Chemistry Department, University of Massachusetts, is supported by the
Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program for a US-Russia
Cooperative Science Program with Dr. Rauza P. Arshinova, Kazan State Univ.,
Russia, to determine features which determine the properties of cyclic four- and
five-coordinate silicon and five- and six-coordinate phosphorus compounds. New
tri- and tetra-coordinate cyclic phosphorus and silicon compounds will be
prepared by the Russian group. These will be used as precursors for five-
coordinated cyclic derivatives to be synthesized by the Russian and US groups.
These complexes will by studied by NMR spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction to
determine ring conformational changes and ligand exchange phenomena. Theoretical
calculations will be employed to model these processes and to understand the
energetics of nucleophilic displacement reactions at phosphorus and silicon.
Many reactions of phosphorus and silicon involve some reagent attacking a
phosphorus or silicon compound to produce an intermediate containing all of the
reacting species. This project will combine the expertise of a US and a Russian
group to determine how these intermediates behave and what reaction pathways are
open to them. The work will center particularly on reactions which are important
in biochemical energy transfer processes.
