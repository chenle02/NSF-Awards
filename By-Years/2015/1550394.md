The Fifth Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) will take place on
January 19 2016, as part of the flagship programming language conference,
Principles of Programming Languages (POPL), which will be held in St.Petersburg,
Florida, USA. This grant will support approximately 10 students to attend the
PLMW event plus the POPL conference. While there is other funding available
(through ACM SIGPLAN PAC) for students who are presenting papers at POPL, this
proposal is intended specifically to increase the numbers of students from
underrepresented groups and gives priority to US citizens and permanent
residents. The broader significance and importance of the grant relate to the
need to broaden participation, provide opportunities for students to receive
mentoring from leading members of the programming languages community, and build
the next generation of researchers and knowledgeable practitioners in this
important research arena.
