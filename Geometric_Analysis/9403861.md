9403861 Alber The investigator plans to continue research in geometric phases
and asymptotics for non-linear equations with singularities. Hamiltonian
systems, holonomic constraints and optical soliton solutions will also be
considered. The scope of the research has a number of potential applications to
such areas as fiber optics, micromotors and robotic engineering. ***
