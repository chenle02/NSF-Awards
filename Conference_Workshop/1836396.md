This award will support an NSF - CBMS regional conference to be held during the
week of August 19-23, 2019 at the University of Texas at Austin on topics in
extension theory with applications to computer science, statistics, and data
science. The principal speaker is Charles L. Fefferman, Herbert E. Jones, Jr.
Professor of Mathematics at Princeton University. The ten lectures will focus on
problems in interpolation, function approximation, and manifold learning, which
are of central importance to many applied fields. In addition, there will be
four lectures on complementary topics delivered by invited speakers.

Recent progress in extension theory has been driven by deep mathematical work of
Fefferman on Whitney's extension problem. When the problem is formulated for
functions on finite sets, it takes the form of a practical question about the
interpolation of data by smooth functions. These problems are related to the
more difficult problem of manifold learning, in which one attempts to pass a
smooth surface with reasonable geometry through a finite set of points. The
interdisciplinary nature of the featured topics will promote new avenues of
research and collaboration between a diverse set of communities. Lectures will
be designed to be accessible to graduate students with a background in
statistics, computer science, or mathematics. For more information, see the
conference website http://www.ma.utexas.edu/conferences/cbms/

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
