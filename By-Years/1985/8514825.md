This study addresses the unusual phenomena observed in organic charge-transfer
salts, using the combined expertise and methodologies of the two groups to
synthesize thoroughly characterize, and examine any given sample. Organic charge
transfer salts, based on TMTSF (tetramethyl-tetraselenafulvalene), originally
attracted interest as the first organic superconductors. However, it has become
increasingly evident that their real interest to science lies in their being a
model system for studying the phase transitions and ground states of a strongly
interacting electron in reduced dimensions. With the recent discovery of
superconductivity at 8 K in the related BEDT-TTF (bisethylenedithio-
tetrathiofulvalene) salts, the questions of further enhanced critical
temperatures for superconductivity and of what controls the critical temperature
have become amenable to experimental and theoretical analysis.
