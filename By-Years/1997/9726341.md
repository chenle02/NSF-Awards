9726341 Prestegard The overall objective of this work is to explore a potential
new source of information on protein structure and dynamics in solution. The new
information comes from residual dipolar couplings recently seen in NMR spectra
of molecules with highly anisotropic magnetic susceptibilities when these
molecules are placed in very high magnetic fields. The contributions are
dependent on the orientation of the vector connecting the nuclei relative to the
axes of a molecular susceptibility tensor. Measurement, thus, can provide
structural information by constraining orientations of remote parts of large
molecules in ways that are inaccessible using existing NOE based distance
constraints. The couplings are also subject to the effects of motional
averaging. This is particularly important because the range of motions
contributing to the averaging process is much larger than those contributing to
commonly measured NMR relaxation parameters. Experiments may, therefore, give
insight into large amplitude, slower, motions that are among those most likely
to contribute to protein function. Devising and testing methods for measurement
and analysis of residual dipolar couplings is the primary object of this
research. Two paramagnetic proteins, myoglobin and cytochrome b5, are chosen as
targets for preliminary application. Both are well characterized structurally
and should serve as suitable benchmarks for a new structural strategy. However,
both have also been the subject of much debate as to motional contributions to
function. Methods developed and applied to these proteins should contribute to
resolution of this debate. ***
