This project will support the 24th Southern Biomedical Engineering Conference
(SBEC) to be held April 18-20, 2008 at the University of Texas at El Paso
(UTEP). The SBEC aims to assemble students, researchers, clinicians, and
industry leaders in Biomedical Engineering to disseminate information in this
rapidly growing field. The SBEC will provide a multidisciplinary, educational
forum for discussing new ideas and future concepts in the field of Biomedical
Engineering. The SBEC serves a special purpose of encouraging student
participation by providing opportunities for students to present their research
through a student paper competition. In keeping with the emphasis on student
participation, the SBEC also plans to present student awards based on
performances in both paper competitions and presentations. Additionally, this
project will sponsor student registration fees and publication support. Due to
the venue?s location at UTEP, the forum will incorporate a diverse mix of
participants, particularly attracting those from the southern regions of the
United States and northern Mexico. This symposium will be of great educational
benefit and will inspire junior researchers and students within the Biomedical
Engineering field.
