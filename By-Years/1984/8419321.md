The objective of this research is to study the fundamental properties of
nonlinear wave propagation in superconducting magnets and to delineate the
mechanisms for acoustic noise in epoxy-bonded solenoid magnets. The study will
investigate acoustic emission data from large-scale magnets in conjunction with
data from ultrasonic experiments carried out on laboratory scale models. The
results of the theoretical and experimental studies will assess the potential
for using stress waves and vibrations as a means of monitoring the behavior of a
composite superconducting structure under intense magnetic forces. The results
will have a potential to predict, anticipate, and correct the causes of thermal
quenching of large superconducting magnets used in modern technologies such as
MHD, magnetic fusion and magnetic resonance.
