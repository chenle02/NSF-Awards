Glia maturation factor (GMF) is a brain protein first detected in Dr. Lim's
laboratory in 1972. The factor stimulates the proliferation and subsequent
differentiation of astrocytes and Schwann cells. Endogenous GMF is also found in
these cells, suggesting an autoregulatory function. Dr. Lim has recently
achieved the milestone of purifying, sequencing, and cloning of the GMF protein
along with the production of the recombinant growth factor which matches the
natural protein in all respects. The chemically defined factor is now designated
GMF-beta, in distinction from the cruder samples previously used. The pure
protein promotes the maturation of neurons as well as glia, and arrests the
growth of tumor cells of neuronal and glial origin. This research is a
continuation of Dr. Lim's on-going effort to employ immunology as a tool to
elucidate the mechanism of action of GMF-beta in the nervous system. Dr. Lim
plans to do the following experiments: (1) to develop an anti-idiotypic antibody
against GMF-receptors; (2) to demonstrate cell surface GMF-beta with antibodies
in order to prove the hypothesis that GMF exerts its action through
intercellular contact.
