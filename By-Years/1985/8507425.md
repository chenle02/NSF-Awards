This study involves the development of microprobes for characterization of
immobilized cell systems. Immobilized cells are in an environment which is
drastically different from that of free cells, and this is likely to change
their metabolic behavior. Studies on this microenvironmental effect have been
constrained by the limitations of experimental techniques in micro-scale. To
fill this need, this project is developing microprobes which are capable of
measuring redox potential and the concentrations of important cellular
metabolites in the immediate vicinity of the immobilized cells. These new
microprobes will provide new research capabilities, which will significantly
expand the scope of investigation into the immobilized cell systems.
