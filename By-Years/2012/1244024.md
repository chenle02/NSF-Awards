Professor Bruce Gibb at the University of New Orleans is supported by the
Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division to study the supramolecular chemistry of self-assembling systems in
aqueous solution and to devise chemically complex systems possessing unusual
properties. The first aim of this project is to investigate new separation
protocols that utilize selective molecular encapsulation. In these systems,
supramolecular structures encapsulate selected targets of complex chemical
mixtures, isolating them from the bulk reactive environment. The second aim is
to devise multi-(supra)molecular systems that evolve to equilibrium slowly and
demonstrate unusual relationships between the components and the net overall
state of the system.

The proposed studies investigate the properties of nano-sized capsules that are
formed in water. The capsules trap other molecules within their interior and,
much like familiar capsules for drug formulations, engender a physical
separation between what is within the capsule and what lies outside. At the
molecular level this separation leads to many unusual phenomena, two of which
are being investigated in this program of study. They are: 1) New ways to bring
about the separation of chemicals that cannot be separated by current
technologies, with impact in areas such as biological and dietary science; 2)
Complex chemical systems whose overall properties are greater than the sum of
their parts. Complex systems demonstrate emergence, or properties and phenomena
that only arise through synergism. Life-forms are considered complex systems,
and the proposed studies will aid in disentangling the complex intertwining of
different processes. The research project will offer a stimulating research
environment for the education and training of students, including members of the
underrepresented groups.
