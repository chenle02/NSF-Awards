This engineering education research project will investigate the effectiveness
of several different interventions designed to retain disabled veterans in
engineering degree programs. A comparative study that looks at a range of
characteristics related to retention in engineering will be done, and the
results analyzed using the theoretical frameworks of social cognitive career
theory and self-efficacy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and
importance of this project arise from the project's ability to inform other
efforts aimed at engaging disabled veterans in career retraining, or all
veterans in obtaining STEM degrees as well as the potential impact on the STEM
workforce. This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the
frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities
and expertise. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by
creating results and research that are useful for society by informing
educational policy and practices.
