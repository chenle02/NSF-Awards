In this International Research Experience for Students (IRES) project supported
by the Americas Program of the Office of International Science and Engineering,
Dr. James R. Mihelcic of Michigan Technological University will involve an
international investigation led by the PI, to be held at a site in La Paz,
Bolivia, Coroico, in partnership with Dr. Nathan Reents of ACDI/VOCA Bolivia, a
non-profit organization, and Dr. Santiago Morales, of the Bolivian Technological
University. The research focuses on sustainable development engineering
education. This experience will allow students to engage sustainability and
appropriate technology principles in a way that is useful and meaningful, and to
collaborate with students and community members in a developing country,
fostering values of global community service while forging collaborative
relationships of the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project directly benefits
society through the project's focus on community needs. The goal of the project
is to foster the development of engineering students who value service to local
and global communities while creating innovative and appropriate ideas,
technologies and services for people in need of safe water, sanitation, air
quality and affordable technology. &lt;br/&gt;
