This project is a study of the mechanisms controlling the air-sea flux of
soluble gases - in particular chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's), carbon dioxide, and
oxygen - in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the Southern Ocean. There are
three objectives to the study: (1) a better understanding of the influence of
mesoscale oceanic processes on tracer transport, and how to represent those
processes in coarse resolution models; (2) the development of an innovative
diagnostic approach to evaluating air-sea gas fluxes rooted in our understanding
of the relationship between air-sea fluxes, ocean transports and biogeochemical
transformations, and (3) testing this approach against explicit models of
southern ocean biogeochemical cycles and apply it to observations to yield
independent estimates air-sea carbon and oxygen flux. An existing global model
will be used as a testbed. This model currently represents key biogeochemical
processes with idealized parameterizations, however these are sufficient for an
initial test of the basic assumptions of this diagnostic approach. The continued
development of the global biogeochemical model will occur in parallel with this
diagnostic work. This approach has great potential practical utility in
supplementing current methods of estimating air-sea gas fluxes in the Antarctic
Circumpolar Current. It will provide an explicit description of the connections
between physical and biogeochemical processes, and will significantly improve
the prognostic capabilities of such models in general.
