This project is an outgrowth of a project previously funded by OTIC to develop a
method for environment micro-compartment genomics (EMCG) of DNA particles and if
this method is successful for RNA, it has potential important applications not
only in marine RNA virus research but also in public health and epidemiology.
Current methods are not sensitive enough to detect small RNA viruses making
quantification of RNA viruses in marine samples difficult. Methods for direct
quantification are needed to verify the numbers in marine habitats. RNA viruses
and virus-like particles in the ocean, play a major role in microbial ecology
and evolution. The ability to analyses of individual RNA viruses would
potentially be transformative in oceanography as well as public health and
epidemiology. As a result of this Bigelow Laboratory’s Single Cell Genomics
Center (SCGC) would provide this analysis as a service to the global research
community. The PI’s will also mentor an undergraduate student and provide
advanced courses Bioinformatics of Microbial Single Cells and Aquatic Flow
Cytometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The role of RNA viruses is even less understood
than those of DNA-containing extracellular genetic elements, due to technical
challenges. The PIs have previous OTIC funding to develop environment micro-
compartment genomics (EMCG) of DNA particles Early results of this project
suggests that a modification of the EMCG methods may enable genomic sequencing
of both DNA and RNA particles, thus addressing this pressing need. The PIs
request EAGER funding to develop a novel, microencapsulation-based technology
for whole genome sequencing of RNA viruses from the ocean, with potential
applications in other environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
