This SGER project will explore the substrate scopes of the newly discovered
catalytic, highly stereoselective aldehyde olefination reaction. While
transforming an aldehyde carbonyl group into a C-C double bond is a ubiquitous
organic reaction, the development of a catalytic aldehyde olefination reaction
without employing either Ph3P or Bu3As is significantly lacking. Without
employing the phosphine-based and/or phosphonate-based reagents, the new
catalytic aldehyde olefination reaction holds great promises to become an
environmentally more friendly reaction. Studies to further expand the substrate
scopes of the catalytic aldehyde olefination reaction will be undertaken. Design
and screening of additional ligands with different metals will be carried out to
identify new, and potentially more active catalysts.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research of Professor Yun-Ming Lin of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Toledo. Professor Yun-Ming Lin 's research efforts focus on the
development of new catalytic methods for constructing C-C and carbon-heteroatom
bonds. Such chemistry will contribute to environmentally benign methods for
chemical synthesis because less chemical wastes will be produced. Successful
development of the catalytic methods will have a positive impact on synthesis in
the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries.
