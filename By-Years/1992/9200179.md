This award provides funds to the Department of Biology at Princeton University
to continue a successful Research Experiences for Undergraduates SITE.
Advertising for the program will begin with the mailing of information packets
to over 200 institutions nationwide. Special efforts will be made to recruit
students from underrepresented groups, including 1) mailing packets to the
Directors of the MARC program as well as to institutions with substantial
populations of minority students, 2) attending annual meetings of minority
students in the MARC Program and those from institutions in California, 3)
establishing sister relationships with two minority colleges (Spelman and
Lincoln Colleges) to facilitate participation of their students in the Princeton
REU program, and 4) visiting several other schools whose students are
predominantly from underrepresented groups. The REU program at Princeton is
modeled after the undergraduate curriculum in molecular biology, which has a
strong research component. A faculty committee will select the participants, who
will confer extensively with the faculty advisor of their choosing to formulate
a detailed research plan. From mid-June to mid-August students will conduct
original research with close guidance and supervision from their faculty advisor
and will have many opportunities for scientific discussions. The program will
culminate in a poster session, at which all participants will present their
research results to the entire Department.
