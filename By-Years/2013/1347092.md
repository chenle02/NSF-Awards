This EAR Geoinformatics Program grant will support development of a suite of
open source tools to allow users of Light detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data the
ability to create point clouds and derivative products by starting at the raw
LiDAR observations (i.e. range, angle, intensity, position, attitude), which is
currently not possible using existing archived datasets and software. Broad
objectives of this proposal are (a) to empower the researcher to exploit and
tailor LiDAR post-processing to optimize data quality and meet science driven
spatial and accuracy requirements and (b) to empower the scientist to focus on
science questions without the need to consider time-consuming reformatting, data
storage georeferencing and error estimation tasks. The developed tools would be
amendable to both processing and analysis of airborne LiDAR, mobile laser
scanning (MLS) observations, and static terrestrial (tripod) LiDAR data and
would allow for tools to process full waveform observations. Scientific
applications of high resolution LIDAR surface mapping span the fields of
geomorphology, geodesy, hydrology, forestry, and resource management to name a
few. The number of geoscientists employing LIDAR mapping for research is growing
rapidly. A graduate student will be supported by this project and the resultant
software will be distributed to users through the OpenTopography web portal and
will be open source. Training with the developed tool set will be conducted
through planned focused Earth science and remote sensing
workshops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***
