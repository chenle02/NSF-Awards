DMS 9705599 Approaches to the Analysis and Visualization of Massive Data Sets
David Rocke Summary Analysis and visualization of massive data sets is an
important problem which has only recently become relevant. We now have the
ability to generate massive amounts of data from areas as diverse as satellite
imagery and the human genome project. Computer hardware has progressed to the
point where data sets of a scale from hundreds of gigabytes to terabytes can be
stored, and data can be retrieved from them, but the challenge of analysis and
visualization has only just begun to be met. This workshop will bring together
scientists who generate massive data sets in astrophysics, environmental
science, geophysics, and other areas and mathematical scientists from a broad
array of backgrounds who can develop methods to attack these problems. The
invitees will include specialists in statistics, statistical computing,
statistical graphics, smooth and combinatorial optimization, computational
geometry, databases, and visualization, as well as astrophysics, geophysics, and
environmental science. The product of this workshop will include not just a
collection of papers but also a white paper presenting an agenda for attacking
these important and salient problems.
