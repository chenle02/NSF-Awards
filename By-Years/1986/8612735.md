The construction of carbon-carbon bonds remains as a key challenge in the
construction of new organic molecules. Implicit in this challenge is the
achievement of selectivity in forming the new bond. This research will
investigate new reaction pathways for the selective introduction of carbon-
carbon bonds into acyclic systems. The desired selectivity will be sought in the
selective formation of carbanions via a heteroatom-assisted deprotonation. New
reaction types which will be studied include: (1) the direct beta-lithiation of
vinyl and dienyl ethers; (2) the diastereoselective deprotonation of acyclic
protons in systems other than sulfoxides; (3) the intramolecular addition of
unstabilized carbanions to ketones and aldehydes. The products which result from
these reactions are often unique structures which will lend themselves to
numerous stereoselective transformations. For example, the first class of
asymmetric dienes to exhibit complete pi-face selectivity in the Diels-Alder
reaction will be available through the directed deprotonation of dienyl ethers.
Whenever possible models will be proposed and tested in an effort to delineate
the exact effect that nearby heteroatoms have on the selectivity of
deprotonation. Based on this knowledge, heteroatom-assisted deprotonations can
be rationally extended to new systems rendering it an even more powerful method
for selective bond construction.
