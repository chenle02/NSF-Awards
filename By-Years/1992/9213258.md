To date, many analyses of national policies treat those policies as evolving
out of the distinctive needs, conflicts, and histories of national societies.
Over the past two decades, sociological theorists have moved towards an emphasis
on the economic interdependency of states and the functioning of states as part
of a world system. In this context, diffusion processes, that is, the
transmission of policies across social actors, can be seen as central to the way
national policy making is constrained and informed by a larger social,
political, and cultural environment. This proposal will use event-history
analyses of national policies in environmental protection to investigate the
world-wide adoption of national policies. These models will permit the
estimation of effects related to the susceptibility of the potential adopter to
external influences, the infectiousness of external sources of diffusion, and
the social proximity of the potential adopter to the source of diffusion. This
project will contribute to our understanding of the timing of the adoption of
national policies based on understandings of (1) the ways that relationships
among nation- states as well as internal forces speed or retard diffusion of
policies, (2) the ways that international organizations help produce similar
policies, and (3) the ways that the timing and characteristics of policies
affect the rates of diffusion. This project will make an important social
scientific contribution to our understanding of the human dimensions of global
environmental change, and it should provide us with new insights into the
potential uses and limitations of event-history analyses.
