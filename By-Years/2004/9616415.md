Abstract EEC-9616415 An important need exists to improve the understanding of
the musculoskeletal system of the human body to be able to design and
manufacture implants that mimie human motions. Research with computers,
engineering analysis, and simulation and engineering design techniques could
contribute to better health and be valuable to rehabilitation and manufacturers
of inplants. The Colorado School of Mines in collaboration with the Rose
Musculoskeletal Research Laboratory and the University of Colorado's Medical
School will hold an industry/university planning meeting to determine the
economic viability of forming an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
for Musculoskeletal System Analysis. The proposed I/UCRC research agenda will
study the kinematics of joints, concentrating on the knee with projects on
"Image-Based Sensing," "Portable Sensing Systems," "Modeling and Simulation,"
and "Advanced Biomaterials."
