Boston University intends to buy a Thinking Machines Corporation Connection
Machine, Model CM-5 to enhance Boston University's massively parallel scientific
computing environment. This award is for the purchase of a 20 Gigabyte CM-5 disk
array unit. The equipment will be used to support research in molecular dynamics
simulation of freezing, simulation of neural networks, quantum chemistry
calculations, high energy physics particle tracking simulations, plasma
simulations and chaos in N-body systems. Computationally-based research which
requires high precision solutions of large systems of ordinary differential
equations and /or large matrix systems, will be pursued on-site at Boston
University in its enhanced massively parallel scientific computing environment.
Its acquisition of a Thinking Machines' CM-5 Machine, and from this award, a 20
Gigabyte CM-5 disk array unit, will enable Boston University to support projects
in molecular dynamics, neural networks, quantum chemistry, particle tracking and
plasma simulation.
