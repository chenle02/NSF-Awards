This award to subsidize travel, conference, and housing expenses for students
participating in the Senseval-3 workshop, held in conjunction with the
Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) meeting on July 25-26, 2004, in
Barcelona, Spain. ACL is the primary international organization for researchers
in the field of computational linguistics, and Senseval is a major event and
international meeting for the ACL Special Interest Group on the Lexicon (ACL-
SIGLEX).

The main purpose of Senseval-3 is to analyze and discuss the results of systems
participating in the Senseval-3 evaluations, held in March-April 2004. Fourteen
different tasks are organized part of Senseval-3, to conduct evaluations of
systems that perform automatic semantic analysis of text, including: word sense
disambiguation for various languages, identification of semantic roles, logic
forms, multilingual annotations, subcategorization acquisition. The
participating students will be supported to participate in this international
evaluation exercise for their systems and have the potential to gain invaluable
feedback from the senior participants.
