The research develops techniques that simplify the design and verification of
fault-tolerant protocols for distributed computing systems. Protocol designers
provided with the abstraction of a virtual system with perfect processor
synchronization, reliable communication, and simple processor failures.
Protocols written for this virtual system are translated into protocols that run
correctly in "real" systems with unsynchronized processors, unreliable
communication, and more complex failures. This methodology shields the designer
from several aspects of the underlying system complexity; protocols are designed
and verified for the simpler virtual system, and then run by simulation in the
more complex underlying system.
