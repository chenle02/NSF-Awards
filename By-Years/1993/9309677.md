9309677 Smith This grant will support research to improve 2-D ultrasonic
transducers by using opto-electronic transmitter technology to replace power
amplifiers and coaxial cables. Low power diode lasers, optical fibers and photo
conductive switches will be used in the new system. This research will be aimed
at determining if the photo-conductive switches can be optimized for this
application. This research is important since it has the potential to eliminate
the bulky transducer cables now used with high density ultrasonic arrays and
thus allow the systems to be more flexible and to consist of more transmit
channels. ***
