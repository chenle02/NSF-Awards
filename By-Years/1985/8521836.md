The understanding of contamination in clean industries, such as electronics,
optical fabrication, and pharmaceuticals, is becoming a limiting factor in the
development of advanced technologies. The goal of this workshop is the
communication of contamination research needs in private industry to academic
and other researchers with the capability to develop new approaches. The
association of the workshop with the Instritute of Environmental Sciences Annual
Technical Meeting to be held at the AMFAC Hotel in Dallas, Texas, May 5-9, 1986,
will foster good attendance. The IES meeting atracts over 700 professionals in
contamination control and has a large exhibition of instrumentation and
equipment. The proposed workshop will provide an interdisciplinary forum to
allow focusing of research resources in the next several years. Proceedings of
the workshop will be widely distributed.
