This award supports research on the variability of the East Asian Monsoon (EAM)
from the recent through the late Pleistocene on centennial to millennial scales
using speleothems from Buddha and Jingdong Caves in central China. High-
resolution measurements from the cave sites will be collected and measured to
provide information on temperature, moisture, and vegetation over the past
330,000 years. The researchers will utilize a newly developed mass balance model
for Strontium isotopes to demonstrate its validity as a paleomonsoon proxy. The
results will be compared with published records (i.e. Chinese loess, marine
oxygen isotopes and Greenland ice) to examine the response of the EAM during
periods of rapid climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will broadly
impact the science community by helping develop a paleoclimate proxy that could
increase climate data available from cave systems. The research project will
also contribute to the training of undergraduate students and encourage
international collaboration with Chinese scientists.
