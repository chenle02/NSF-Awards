This research will address the study of the atmosphere's hydrological cycle in
relation to the variability of monsoons and climate. Through use of isentropic
analysis, a study of the hydrological cycle will be carried out over a four year
period from 1985 through 88. The purpose of the research is to gain insight on
the planetary scale of the exchange of water vapor in global monsoonal
circulations and to study the relation of this exchange to the climatic
distribution of heat sources and sinks. This period includes the extended El
Nino episode of 1986-88 and the recent drought of 1988. This research is
important because it attempts to clarify the role of the water cycle and heating
in climate processes and so seeks to increase understanding of the climate
system.
