9307762 Ernst Dr. Ernst will carry out a program of research in mathematical
gravitational physics. He will employ techniques devised by I. Hauser and
himself to determine the spacetime distortion that takes place when arbitrarily
specified gravitational plane waves collide, and to determine the spacetime
curvature associated with spinning masses when the gravitational potential is
specified arbitrarily on the axis of rotation. He will also study the possible
application of similar techniques to physical problems that are less idealized.
Purely analytical methods will be supplemented by numerical computation and
graphical display whenever the complexity of the problem demands such an
approach. The attempt to solve ever more realistic gravitational problems using
the general theory of relativity should continue to spawn new mathematical
techniques that can be applied as well to other nonlinear physical theories, and
which should provide a deeper insight into nonlinear phenomena in general. ***
