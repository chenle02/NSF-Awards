The investigator proposes to study human behavior in dynamic bargaining games
with constant costs of delay in complete information settings. The predictive
validity of the most widely accepted game-theoretic solution to this case --
subgame prefect equilibrium -- will be tested, and it shall be observed in what
way, if at all, subjects' behavior systematically violates the normative
solution. The project is based on preliminary theoretical and experimental work
in this area. The investigator plans to enlarge the scope of his previous
studies along three dimensions. The investigator shall compare bargaining with
finite vs. infinite horizons, bargaining with or without a quitting move, and
bargaining over a deficit vs. bargaining with a surplus. These experiments are
designed to answer questions regarding fairness, greed, and the robustness of
subgame organization in a variety of isomorphic bargaining representations
derived from various task transformations.
