Jameson/Abstract ATM-9419523 The objectives of this research are: (1) to
validate recent advances in radar techniques for estimating the rainfall rate
(R) and rain water content (W) by comparing independent estimates of R, W and
the mass weighted mean drop diameter Dm computed using VHF (and sometimes
coincident UHF) profiler measurements of the drop size distribution to
simultaneous estimates in the same sampling volumes calculated using
measurements form the Bureau of Meteorological Research Centre (BMRC) C-band
polarization radar located near Darwin, Australia; (2) to explore the merit of
using measurements of the differential phase between horizontal and vertical
polarizations to correct for the effects of attenuation on C-band radar power
measurements, to compare theoretical and experimental relations between the
specific differential phase and attenuation coefficients, and to look for the
effect of cloud attenuation by using C-ban polarization radar measurements in
storms near Darwin.
