A workshop on "Drought Research into the Third Millennium" will be conducted in
Washington, D.C. The objectives of this meeting is to determine: the state-of-
the-art in drought prediction; the state of integration of the available
knowledge; the extent of usage of results from research; the improvements in
managing droughts achieved by the United States and other countries; and the
research agenda for scientists and engineers during the coming decade. The
recommendations resulting from the workshop will be considered for inclusion
into the Natural and Manmade Hazards Mitigation program.
