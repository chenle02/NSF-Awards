Richard Stratt of Brown University is supported by an award from the Theoretical
and Computational Chemistry program for research to develop theoretical and
computational methods to simulate and understand ultrafast spectroscopic studies
of solvation dynamics. These studies are focused on investigating the response
of the solution to electronic excitation and invoke a three-time portrait of the
solution dynamics rather than the traditional two-time picture.

With the advent of ultrafast lasers, scientists are now able to study the
details of solvent reorganization that occurs whenever a chemical reaction takes
place. This work is helping to broaden our understanding of exactly how those
processes occur. In addition to the scientific broader impact, the work is
having a broader impact societally through Stratt's efforts in communicating the
value and excitement of scientific research to the public through a series of
general interest presentations.
