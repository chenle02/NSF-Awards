9308726 Jackson Many of the tasks demanded by evolving software-maintenance,
reverse engineering, restructuring, etc.-depend on analysis. Large programs
confound any attempt at hand analysis, so research has focused on tools that
analyze programs automatically. Broadly speaking, two kinds of tools have been
proposed: knowledge-based tools that can associate properties of program
components with notions from the problem domain, and compilerlike tools that
determine relationships among components by calculating dependencies, slices,
module hierarchies, etc. Each approach has disadvantages. The knowledge-based
tools, because they only associate problem domain notions with components
informally, cannot provide rigorous analysis; answers to queries tend to be more
like hints than sound inferences. The compiler-like tools are confined to low-
level analysis of the code, so the queries, and their responses, must be
formulated in terms of code constructs alone. This work combines some of the
advantages of both approaches. The key idea is contextual abstraction. The user
specifies an abstraction relationship between program components and problem
domain notions. A variety of analyses then becomes possible by interpreting
properties of the code in problem domain terms. And because the abstraction
relationship is formal, the analyses are rigorous and can include, for example,
partial verification. ***
