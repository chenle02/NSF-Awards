ESI 94-53892 Deborah Bryant Educational Development Center Newton, MA Associates
in Residence at EDC EDC seeks to address the problem of broadening the base of
mathematics educators who can design and then execute successful teacher
enhancement projects--especially projects originating from ethnic and geographic
communities hitherto under-served by NSF. To this end, EDC plans to develop an
"associates-in-residence" program that would allow mathematics educators to
spend a non-trivial period of time at EDC in order to observe and participate in
the life of some of EDC's on-going teacher enhancement projects . Such a
residential program would serve to provide the associates with both the
intellectual, as well as the "nuts and bolts" background needed to design and
direct viable projects of their own. The present project is a 6-month planning
project that includes a small pilot version of such a program. The project
invites 2 mathematics educators from under- represented and under-served groups
to spend 5 weeks at EDC during Summer 1994 to observe and participate in the
work of 3 of its teacher enhancement projects. In addition, project staff
provides support to the 2 associates in designing their own projects, and
writing proposals to fund them. The in-kind contributions from non-NSF sources
equal 8% of NSF's contribution.
