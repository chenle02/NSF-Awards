Moore (OCE-9712298) ABSTRACT Moore, Shaw- OCE 9711298 The impact of submarine
groundwater discharges (SGWD) on the coastal ocean has been suggested to be
quite significant for a variety of chemical cycles and biogeochemical processes
in the near shore region. Data however to quantify and chemically characterize
these groundwater fluxes are difficult to obtain and are lacking in ocean and
hydrological sciences. The lead PI Moore has already shown that the key to
determining the scale of SGWD are measurements of short-lived radium isotopes,
223Ra and 224Ra, and the longer lived 226Ra. The association with the second PI
Shaw, adds the important expertise to measure Ba and stable trace elements, so
that the PI's can better evaluate the influence of these groundwater fluxes on a
broad range of trace elements and nutrients that are of wider interest to the
marine sciences, hyrological sciences and coastal management communities. The
PI's propose to place bounds on the fluxes and inputs of groundwaters using a
regional sampling approach. During the project, field sampling will be conducted
on three major cruises in the South Atlantic Bight between North Carolina and
Florida. Shorter cruises are proposed to respond to specific drought, storm or
rainfall events. Groundwater investigations utilizing existing wells near these
study sites are also proposed. Overall, the combination of their unique tracer
measurements and ancillary data will allow the PI's to evaluate the impact of
goundwater fluxes on the coastal oceans, and the important controls on the
strengths and composition of these fluxes.
