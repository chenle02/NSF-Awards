*** 9318773 Tuzhilin More and more application domains, from financial market
analysis to weather prediction, from monitoring supermarket purchases to
monitoring satellite images, are becoming increasingly data-intensive. For this
reason, the area of knowledge discovery in databases has recently attracted much
interest of database researchers. Since many data mining applications are
temporal in nature, it is important to study the problems of pattern discovery
in the temporal database context. The purpose of this project is to (1) develop
a framework for the characterization and classification of temporal patterns;
(2) identify and characterize various types of pattern discovery problems within
the proposed framework; (3) evaluate the applicability of existing techniques
from artificial intelligence, operations research, signal processing,
statistical time-series analysis, and other related disciplines to the problems
from part (2), and to develop new temporal pattern discovery techniques,
whenever necessary -- also these techniques should be made more efficient, if
possible; and (4) parallelize the discovery algorithms in order to make them
computationally feasible; this is important because temporal pattern discovery
problems typically deal with large volumes of data. As a result of this project,
a system will be developed that helps a user to discover knowledge from a large
volume of temporal data. This research will provide a better theoretical
understanding of the problems of pattern discovery in temporal databases, as
well as provide some practical tools for finding patterns in temporal data.
Potential applications of this work include financial, marketing, and medical
applications, among others. ***
