This research has two over-arching goals: (1) to determine the geohistorical
factors that control the distribution of Caribbean inshore fishes and (2) to
improve the scientific basis for conservation of fishes, particularly in the
Caribbean coastal zone. It arises from the discovery that many Caribbean fishes
have distribution s that conform to ancient geotectonic features rather than to
current ecological barriers. Consequently, it is expected that analysis of
distribution patterns will be informative about the origin of the Antillean
fauna and about processes that were fundamental in the formation of the
Caribbean Basin. The project proposes to survey the poorly known inshore fish
faunas of selected regions in the Caribbean Basin to delimit areas of endemism
of both inshore and freshwater fishes on the Caribbean Tectonic Plate, and to
infer general patterns of area relationships based on the interrelationships of
the fishes. The sampling program that will address the biogeographic points
above is precisely the same as that needed to develop management plans for
Caribbean fishes. In order to maximize the project's contribution to
conservation of fishes, surveys will be directed at areas where marine
biodiversity preserves are under development, but where shorefish biodiversity
has not yet been adequately assessed. The project will result in taxonomic
references, keys for identification, and analyses of geographic variation that
are needed for marine fish management.
