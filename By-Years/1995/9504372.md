The goal of this research is to develop a system which automatically generates
and animates conversations between multiple cooperative agents with appropriate
and synchronized speech, intonation, facial expressions, and hand gestures. The
research is based on theory which addresses relations and coordinations between
these channels. The significance of this research is to provide a three-
dimensional computer animation testbed for cooperative conversation theories.
Human-machine interaction and training systems need more interactive and
cooperative synthetic agents. Conversations are created by a dialogue planner
that produces the text as well as the intonation of the utterances. The
speaker/listener relationship, the content of text, the intonation and the
undertaken actions all determine facial expressions, lip motions, eye gaze, head
motion, and arm gesture generators. This project will focus on domains in which
agents must propose and agree on abstract plans, and may have to motivate and
carry out physical actions and refer to objects in their physical environment
during conversation.
