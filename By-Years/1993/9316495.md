9316495 Carmichael This award provides 71% of the funding necessary for the
acquisition of a new electron microprobe that will be installed and operated in
the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the University of California-
Berkeley. The University is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary
to acquire this instrument. The electron microprobe is a versatile electron beam
instrument capable of accurate analysis of chemical composition of solids for
major element constituents to trace elements and has an analytical spatial
resolution on the sample target of a micrometer. The new UC-Berkeley electron
microprobe will be primarily used by research groups in the Department of
Geology and Geophysics, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, other campus and off-
campus groups with research needs for microanalysis of solids. ***
