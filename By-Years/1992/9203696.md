This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Fellowship in Plant Biology.
The applicant received his Ph.D. in biophysics at the University of California
at Berkeley. He proposes to carry out his fellowship research ion the
laboratories of Dr. Michael Freeling and Dr. Russell Jones at University of
California at Berkeley. The research entitled "The role of calcium as an
effector of growth in maize primary root gravitropism: physiological and genetic
studies" concerns the genetic and cellular basis for gravitropism. The research
will broaden the training of the PI into plant genetics, molecular biology and
cell biology.
