ABSTRACT Xu 9624890 This work was awarded under the CAREER program and includes
objectives for both research and education. The research plan addresses the
mechanisms of laser-material interactions and the possibilities for novel laser-
assisted materials processing techniques. In-situ diagnostic techniques to
determine the properties of laser-induced plasmas will be developed and a
"particulate-free" pulsed laser deposition technique will be explored. In
addition, in situ diagnostics for measuring the temperature field, fluid flow,
and melt front propagation during laser micromachining are planned. A combined
numerical and experimental approach will be applied to understanding the phase
change process and a novel "clean" micromachining process will be developed. The
educational plan includes the development of an instructional "Laser-Assisted
Microscale Materials Processing Laboratory" for undergraduates. In addition, two
undergraduate/graduate courses entitled "Laser processing in Manufacturing," and
"Photothermal Non-Destructive Evaluation" will be developed.
