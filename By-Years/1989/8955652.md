The Ohio State University will initiate a ten-week, commuter and residential,
multidisciplinary, Young Scholars project for 20 students in grades 11-12. To
achieve the goal of encouraging highly-talented high school juniors and seniors
to choose careers in the sciences, Ohio State proposes: 1) to place annually 20
students from the Central Ohio area into summer research positions in
laboratories primarily within the three Ohio State University Colleges of
Biological Sciences, Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and Medicine; 2) to
provide these students with information on science career options, requirements,
and planning; 3) to introduce them to the dilemmas of scientific ethics; and 4)
to provide a follow- up that includes two 'alumni' meetings in the first year,
continued contact through a longitudinal evaluation effort, and supplementary
career support through the start of their undergraduate careers. The impact of
this program on student participants will also be assessed.
