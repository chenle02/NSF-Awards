Many cities in the U.S. are faced with the problem of combined sewer overflows
(CSOs). Combined sewers carry a mixture of municipal sewage and storm runoff.
During storm conditions, the capacity of such sewers (and/or the associated
treatment plants) may be exceeded and the combined sewage must be released to
the environment untreated. Real-time control of the combined sewage conveyance
system is a potential low cost solution to the problem. Regulating gates and
pumps can be manipulated to maximize storage of peak loads within the system to
minimize the CSOs during each storm event. The problem described above is the
design of a control algorithm for a large-scale system. The PI plans to adapt
Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategies and develop a control scheme for the
Metropolitan West Seattle sewage collection system. The ultimate test of his
control scheme will be on this real, full scale facility. Specifically the
project involves: (1) optimization of the dynamic response of a plant in which
there are many manipulated variables and many output variables, (2) forecasting
of unmeasured plant disturbances, (3) accounting for inequality constraints on
most output variables, and (4) incorporating plant dynamics that include
integrator states, nonlinear characteristics, and lags and time delays.
