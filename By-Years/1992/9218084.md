Klemola Hanson Galactic Structure and Kinematics from Absolute Proper Motions.
The study of the motions of various classes of stars is fundamental to an
understanding of our Galaxy. Proper motions provide the observational basis for
the study of solar motions, galactic rotation, and velocity dispersions, and for
the statistical determination of stellar distances and luminosities. The Lick
Northern Proper Motion (NPM) program meets many of these basic observational
needs by providing absolute proper motions covering the northern two thirds of
the sky. The NPM is now bearing fruit after more than 40 years of work. First
epoch photography began in 1947; second epoch photography was completed in 1988.
Measurements and reductions for proper motions, positions, and photometry in the
sky outside the Milky Way began in 1975 and will be competed in 1992. This award
supports several long awaited applications of the NPM absolute proper motions to
outstanding problems in galactic structure and kinematics. These include a
definitive study of solar motion and galactic rotation, a powerful probe of
changing stellar populations and kinematics away from the galactic plane, and a
massive new study of RR Lyrae type star luminosities and kinematics. This award
will also support publication of the Lick NPM Catalog and advance work on the
final part of the NPM program.
