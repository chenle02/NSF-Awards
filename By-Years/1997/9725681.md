9725681 Goldstein The PIs are studying the Grande Comore Island, in the western
Indian ocean, to test the importance of shallow level lithospheric mantle
contributions to oceanic island volcanism. The PIs have shown that the isotopic
variations of the shield building lavas reflect plume-lithosphere interactions.
The PIs will extend their study by analyzing He and Os isotopes and directly
characterize the isotopic composition of the lithospheric mantle beneath the
Grande Comore, through a geochemical and isotopic study of mantle derived
xenoliths. They will extend the study to the older islands of the Comores
Archipelago.
