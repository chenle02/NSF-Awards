97-05494 Cowie Samoan land snails are severely threatened by habitat
destruction, introduction of alien species for (failed) "biological control,"
and other human activities. The largest and most important collections of such
snails are housed at the Bishop Museum (16,000 lots) and the Field Museum (850
lots). Conservation efforts to prevent further decline of snail populations
require timely knowledge of the status and distribution of the species, and a
means for local resource managers to recognize them. This project will result in
an online database of existing collections of the Samoan snails, the curation
and databasing of additional backlogged collections, and the collection of new
specimen lots. In addition, a simple field guide will be produced so that
conservation and land-management personnel in both American and Western Samoa,
as well as classes from the American Samoa Community College and the general
public ("ecotourists"), can identify snails. Further, synoptic reference
collections will be built and deposited in Pago Pago and Apia, thus increasing
the scientific infrastructure in Samoa. A graduate student, supported by this
award, will be trained in molluscan taxonomy, museum practices, and collections
databasing, which will contribute new expertise to the science of malacology.
This project is being funded cooperatively by the Biotic Surveys & Inventories
Program (BIO) and the International Program (SBE) of the NSF.
