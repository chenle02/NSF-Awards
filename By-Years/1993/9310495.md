9310495 Becker The usual assumption in most discussions over time is that
choices today are not directly dependent on choices in the past. The assumption
of independence is not "nonsense," for it usefully simplifies many problems that
are not crucially affected by dependencies over time. But the assumption has
discouraged economists from grappling with other issues of considerable
significance -- including addictions, work habits, preference formation, why
children support their elderly parents, preference solutions to the problem of
future commitments, and the evolution and stability of institutions. This
project considers how a person's current preferences depend on past experiences,
and on the behavior of others. The influence of the past is illustrated by
habitual behavior, defined as behavior that displays a positive relation between
the past and current consumptions of a good, such as drugs. The influence of
others is illustrated by peer pressure, which may induce a teenager to start
smoking. In essence, therefore, the project will consider the rational formation
of preferences. The process is "rational" in the sense that a person is assumed
to try to anticipate the consequences for his future preferences of what he does
now, including groups with which he associates. The assumption of forward-
looking and consistent behavior provides rules and implications that determine
how preferences evolve over time, and in which groups. This work tries to
contribute to our knowledge of these processes. ***
