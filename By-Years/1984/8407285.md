Multi-dimensional signal processing involves the processing of signals which
depend on more than one independent variable. Signals received by an array of
sensors represent a class of problems in which advantage can be gained by multi-
dimensional signal processing. The array can be comprised of spatially
distributed sensors or it can be synthesized by a single sensor mounted on a
moving platform. This research program is directed at three important areas:
signal synthesis and reconstruction from partial Fourier domain information,
multi-dimensional spectral estimation, and short time processing of multi-
dimensional signals. There are a number of important issues that will be
explored in each of these areas; in many instances, the research focuses on the
study and development of algorithms and a number of potential directions for
applications.
