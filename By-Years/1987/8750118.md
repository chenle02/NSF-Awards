A novel interdisciplinary Neurochemistry/Neuropharmacology laboratory is being
introduced into the Neuroscience curriculum at Oberlin College. The High
Performance Liquid Chromatograph (HPLC) is being used to bring better
chromatographic techniques into this laboratory. At the same time, improved
centrifugation assay techniques are being added. With a tissue homogenizer to
produce rapid and uniform cell disruption of large tissue samples prior to HPLC
and centrifugation assays, a full array of biochemical research techniques for
examining the nervous system is becoming available to this program. Adding a
laboratory in Neurochemistry/Neuropharmacology to the curriculum allows students
to apply the knowledge and skills they have acquired in basic Biology and
Chemistry courses to issues and problems in Neuroscience; increases the
sophistication of undergraduate research that is being undertaken; gives
students a broader exposure to the approaches and methodologies currently used
in the Neurosciences; attracts to the program students (particularly students
with an interest in Chemistry) who previously have had little contact with the
Neurosciences, and demonstrates the interdisciplinary nature of research in the
Neurosciences.
