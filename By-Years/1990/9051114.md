This project restructures three courses in the electrical engineering curriculum
to give an orderly progression through digital signal processing (DSP) into
digital image processing (DIP) while adequately covering the usual material
found in these courses. Electric Circuits II now provides sufficient background
for students to design and implement real-time digital filters on a DSP chip.
Mathematics for Engineers contains enough discrete transform theory for students
to utilize computational DSP software effectively while the course in
Communication Systems develops DIP through digital image display and information
extraction. The curriculum developments have been made possible through the
establishment of an applied DSP laboratory that has been created with personal
computers. These together with DSP microprocessors, headphones, microphones and
cameras for sound and image inputs and outputs permit DSP/DIP experiences as an
integral part of the courses. The award is being matched by an equal amount from
the principal investigator's institution.
