A unifying theme in this project is the asymptotic behavior of given equations
as the domain approaches a "degenerate" region in the limit. The considered
problems are nonlinear variational or partial differential equations, and the
degeneracy in question can take various forms: loss of dimension, loss of
regularity, or unboundedness. The first set of questions relates to the
mathematical theory of nonlinear elasticity, which studies large mechanical
deformations of three-dimensional elastic bodies. The investigator undertakes a
long-term research program, with the scope of: deriving lower-dimensional shell
theories through the methods of Gamma-convergence and understanding their
connections with the geometry of the mid-surface, analyzing the (infinitesimal)
isometries of surfaces and the effects of rigidity on the derived theories,
studying nonlinear phenomena such as buckling and blistering for a given shell
under compression (one application is related to plant growth). The second set
of questions in this project relates to fluid dynamics. Boundary irregularities
of various structures and scales are considered in the limit when the boundary
behavior becomes degenerate. Other problems concern traveling fronts in
combustion in unbounded channels, and the dynamics of solutions with large
initial data under the Navier boundary conditions in thin three-dimensional
shells.

Because elastic thin (or otherwise "degenerate") objects of various geometries
are ubiquitous in the physical world, the precise understanding of laws
governing their equilibria has many potential applications. For example, many
growing tissues (leaves, flowers, or marine invertebrates) exhibit complicated
configurations during their free growth and one would like to reproduce them
with man-made means. A related long-standing problem in the mathematical theory
of elasticity is to rigorously predict theories of such lower-dimensional
objects starting from the nonlinear theory of full three-dimensional objects.
For plates, a very recent effort has lead to rigorous justification of a
hierarchy of such theories, depending on the magnitude of the applied forces and
resulting in stretching, crumpling, bending, or a combination of these. For
shells (when the mid-surface is curved), despite extensive use of their ad hoc
generalizations in the literature and engineering applications, much less is
known from the mathematical point of view. The investigator identifies several
nonlinear problems in continuum mechanics of solids and fluid dynamics,
naturally posed in specific degenerate domains, with the intention of rigorously
understanding the behavior of the system based on general principles. At the
heart of the program are interesting connections between calculus of variations,
differential equations, geometry, material science, fluid dynamics, numerical
analysis, and even biology. They have a potential to deliver useful observations
in e.g. structural mechanics, while integrating the goal of exposing scientific
results to a broader community at various education levels.
