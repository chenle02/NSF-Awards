9419764 HUMPHREY The Secretary of the Navy has been designated the Executive
Agent of the Department of Defense (DoD) for the logistic support functions for
the U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP). The Commander, Naval Air Systems Command
(NAVAIR) is the designated coordinating agency for all matters dealing with the
procurement and maintenance of the LC-130 aircraft owned by NSF and operated by
VXE-6, the Navy Squadron which provides Antarctic support. Mr. John C. Papuchis
is the NAVAIR individual responsible for financial matters associated with
support for the NSF LC-130s under provisions of the Memorandum of Agreement
(DPP-76-10886) between the DoD and the NSF. The aircraft support provided by the
DoD includes, but is not limited to, contracting for the procurement of new
aircraft, overhaul and upgrades to existing aircraft, integrated logistic
aircraft parts support, aircraft configuration control, and publication support.
Congress authorized the procurement of an LC-130 for the USAP in 1993. NAVAIR
will coordinate the purchase of this aircraft with a budget of $49,360,000, all
of which was provided in an earlier transfer. This action calls for the transfer
of $1,500,000 from NAVAIR to the NSF to support the purchase of GFE by the Air
Force Systems Command (ASC) for that new aircraft.
