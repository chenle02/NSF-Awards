Dissertation research will investigate the evolutionary processes underlying
patterns of variation in wild populations of the House Sparrow. The populations
included in the present study afford four major points of interest: (i) most
were only recently started by humans 100-150 years ago, (ii) they have since
experienced complex historical processes involving effective size fluctuations,
(iii) they are well-represented in museum collections, and (iv) large amounts of
historical data document the actual introductions. Research will compare museum
specimens between locales (controlling for time) and across time (controlling
for locale) for a suite of genotypic and phenotypic characters in an effort to
reconstruct historical demography and assess the opportunities for chance and
selection to influence overall evolutionary dynamics.

The study will synthesize ancient DNA techniques and new statistical methods
designed for analyzing temporally spaced data. Results will help guide future
evolutionary studies of species where the available genetic and demographic data
are limited. The research will also provide insights into the potential adaptive
responses of species to climate change. Laboratory methods will continue to
involve students with interests in molecular biology by providing training in
high-throughput genotyping and data analysis.
