The goal of this project is to increase the number and quality of nuclear
physics experiments for students at Gustavus Adolphus College. The current
apparatus for experimental nuclear physics has some major shortcomings: there is
only one computerized multi channel analyzer, there is no equipment for beta
spectroscopy or high-resolution gamma spectroscopy, and no equipment for fast
timing experiments. This grant will eliminate these problems by allowing
acquisition of an additional multi channel analyzer, a thick surface barrier
detector, a HPGe detector, several scintillators, and fast NIM electronics. The
addition of this equipment will allow development of many new and innovative
experiments and will significantly enhance the nuclear physics component of our
current upper-division Experimental Modern Physics course. It will also be
essential in the regularized offering of a Nuclear Physics course.
