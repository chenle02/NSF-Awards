The proposal is to support a "Capitol Area Theory Seminar, 1988-1989" which will
provide funds for senior researchers in computer science theory to visit the
area and interact with the community of younger computer science theory
researchers there. Twelve speakers in diverse fields of theoretical computer
science will be invited to speak at an area-wide seminar, and interact with the
theoretical computer science researchers in the area. There is a set of gifted
young computer science theoreticians in the capitol area and a lack of senior
researchers to act as guides or mentors. This point makes the area unique
compared to other areas where there are concentrations of computer science
theory researchers. Thus the proposer saw a strong need for senior personnel to
visit the area to "be in residence" for the benefit of the younger researchers.
This argument was strongly supported by the reviewers. Professor Cherniavsky is
well-qualified to organize the seminar series as he is well known and respected
in the computer science theory community.
