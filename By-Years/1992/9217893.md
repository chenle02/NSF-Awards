Professor Jerome Percus is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to perform theoretical studies in five specific
areas including: 1) equilibrium theory of classical continuum fluids, simple and
complex; 2) the corresponding theory of lattice gasses on networks of varying
complexity; 3) electron fluids, atomic and molecular, principally at zero
temperature; 4) the nonequilibrium theory of random sequential adsorption; and
5) stationary clock-regulated queuing networks. A common thread starting to
appear in these diverse fields of research is that of hierarchical structure,
calling for a multi-level description and strongly influencing the framework in
which more empirical studies will be made. %%% Complex systems consisting of
strongly interacting molecules in condensed phases are still not well understood
from a theoretical point of view. Much of the current line of research consists
of theories based on simplified models which capture the salient features of the
more complex systems they represent. Percus' research on such models will help
to elucidate the important physical characteristics of such complex systems.
