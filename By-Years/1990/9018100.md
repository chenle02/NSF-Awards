The Eocene echinoid fauna of Africa is among the richest in the world with 145
nominal species of spatangoids from all Eocene stages. Preliminary analyses of
spatangoid distributions in Egypt suggest that there existed in the Eocene
geographic regions with distinct echinoid communities, and that these were a
result of differences in sediment type in different regions. Burrowing
echinoids, particularly spatangoids, have test features whose functional
relationship with the sediment in which they live is well understood. I propose
to analyze functional morphology of Egyptian and other African species to
determine their substrate preferences. The proportions of species with specific
sediment preferences in the fauna of each sampling locality will be plotted to
see if any geographic distribution of sediment corresponds to the apparent
faunal distinctiveness and rocks containing them will confirm inferences of
sedimentary facies from echinoid morphology. Inferences about the causes for
biogeographic distributions on a global scale require stratigraphically and
ecologically well understood samples such as will be generated by this research.
