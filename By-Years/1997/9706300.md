9706300 Geissman The Indian-Asian collision zone is the type locality of a
continent-continent collision, and studies of this zone reveal the tectonic
processes of such collisions that are not obtainable in more ancient collision
systems. Of particular concern is the controversy between the hypotheses of
extrusion and rotation, in this case of blocks of Asian crust . Is the
shortening of the Asian crust accomplished by extrusion of wedge-shaped blocks
of crust, or by rotation-aided movement of these blocks. This study will address
this issue by both structural and paleomagnetic approaches. The field structural
and associated kinematic studies will allow testing of the extrusion models, and
the paleomagnetic studies will allow testing of the rotational studies. Together
both hypotheses can be tested for this critical region of southwest China, and
will provide a strong context for the interpretation of more ancient mountain
belts where structural overprinting have made these questions much more
difficult to address.
