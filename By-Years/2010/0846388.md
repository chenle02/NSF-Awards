This CAREER proposal describes a research program that will explore the
opportunities for new discoveries at the Large Hadron Collider(LHC) at CERN
using the Compact Muon Solenoid(CMS) detector. With pp collisions at 14 TeV, the
LHC is expected to open a vast new window on elementary particle physics
phenomena. The intellectual merit of this work includes the exploration of the
Higgs particle or of other new particles that could appear in extensions of the
Standard Model, as well as the understanding of the pixel detector. The research
program presented here is a three-pronged plan to explore beyond-the-Standard-
Model physics by studying the light Higgs particle through tau lepton channels,
to participate in the commissioning, calibration, and operation of the CMS pixel
detector, and to develop upgrade strategies for CMS tracking. Discovery of the
Higgs boson and the subsequent exploration of its properties are key goals of
the CMS experiment. This is experimentally challenging and requires a detailed
understanding of the detector performance, particularly of the pixel vertex
detector. The broader impact of this proposal includes bringing the excitement
and challenges of experimental particle physics to faculty and students at local
community colleges. A pilot program with Cornell students analyzing CLEO data as
part of an undergraduate course in particle physics has been very successful.
The program described here is truly transformational. The Principle Investigator
further develops these tools and makes them available to a broader community of
small local 2-year community colleges, thereby providing suitable training for
both the teaching faculty and the students involved, so they can participate in
actual data analysis.
