The principal investigator will study problems in geometric tomography and
develop methods to reconstruct the geometry of convex bodies from projections.
In particular he will explore new directions in the algorithmic aspects of
reconstructing convex bodies and polytopes from X-rays, their interactive
determination from X-rays, and the classification of intersection bodies. Two
undergraduate students will work on parts of the project under the direction of
the principal investigator. This award will support research in the general area
of integral geometry. The geometry of a set may often be analyzed and described
by a decomposition of the set into slices. The geometry of the slices is often
fairly simple and easy to describe. The main difficulty in the analysis is
usually the reconstruction of the underlying geometric features of the entire
set from the geometry of the slices. One well know application of this area of
mathematics is the CAT scan.
