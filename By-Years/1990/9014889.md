This research will study the temperature of the solar corona and the density of
solar chromospheric spicules through observations of their continuous spectra
carried out at the total solar eclipse of the Sun on July 11, 1991. Accurate
determinations of the intensities of certain spectral lines can lead to an
independent determination of coronal electron temperatures. Total solar eclipses
allow one to measure the solar emission as a function of altitude above the
solar limb. From this emission it is possible to deduce the temperature and the
density of the chromosphere. The physical conditions that are deduced will be
useful for improving models for small chromospheric structures.
