This research is in the area of group representation theory. The principal
investigator will develop an algebraic harmonic analysis to transfer the
representation theory of semisimple groups to the representation theory of Hecke
algebras. The central problem to be considered in this project is the Lusztig
conjecture which states that certain invariants attached to an algebraic group
can be calculated from polynomials. This is a difficult and central problem in
group theory. It also has implications in other areas of mathematics.
