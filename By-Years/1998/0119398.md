An advanced numerical cloud model will be used to simulate the types of storms
observed in the Severe Thunderstorm Electrification and Precipitation Study
(STEPS) of the summer of 2000. The three-dimensional dynamic simulation model
includes detailed microphysical, electrical, and lightning parameterizations and
produces realistic storms and lightning in simulations of several types of
thunderstorms. Observations during STEPS were among the most complete ever taken
for electrification studies. They included polarimetric radar measurements,
dual-Doppler measurements, three- dimensional lightning flash patterns obtained
by the Lightning Mapping Array, in-situ cloud and electrical measurements
obtained by instrumented balloons and a storm-penetrating aircraft, and surface
observations from a mobile mesoscale network. The data will be compared with
simulations to improve the understanding of interactions among kinematics,
precipitation production, and electrification in severe storms. Examples of the
topics to be investigated are (1) the influence of vertical air motions and
precipitation on the production of lightning; (2) the influence of storm type
(e.g., unicell, multicell, supercell) on flash rates and other lightning
characteristics; (3) conditions attendant to the production of unusual lightning
activity, such as exceptionally high flash rates or positive cloud-to-ground
lightning. It is expected that the research will lead to ways of using lightning
data to help diagnose and forecast severe weather.
