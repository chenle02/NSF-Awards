This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop
a novel technology that will enable non-surgical treatment of gallstone disease.
Symptomatic gallstone disease occurs when gallstones obstruct the outlet of the
gallbladder and prevent the flow of bile. Obstruction can result in significant
pain and if left untreated can lead to dangerous infections. The most common and
effective treatment for gallstone disease today is surgical removal of the
gallbladder, or cholecystectomy. Unfortunately, many patients are not eligible
for surgery due to other complicating medical conditions or very old age, and
the surgery itself can have complications. This project will develop a catheter-
implanted device contained within the gallbladder to prevent stones from
reaching the outlet. The procedure is quick and requires only local anesthesia,
making it safe for elderly and sick patients. This project will finalize the
design of the device, evaluate its safety in an animal study, evaluate its
biocompatibility with biologic, chemical, and mechanical tests, and transfer the
design to a manufacturable product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
impact/commercial potential of this project includes helping gallstone disease
patients who are not eligible for surgery, providing an alternative for patients
who prefer not to have surgery, and significantly decreasing overall healthcare
costs. While gallbladder surgery is currently the standard of care for
symptomatic gallstone disease, surgery is not without risks ? complications can
occur from general anesthesia or the surgical procedure, and post-operative pain
and digestive disorders are common. The new proposed procedure is expected to be
faster and safer than the current standard of care. In addition, the proposed
device enables patients to keep their gallbladders, maintaining normal digestive
function. Considering the large population of patients with symptomatic
gallstone disease (approximately 1.3 million annually in the U.S.), the
decreased procedure time, recovery time, and overall healthcare costs could be
very significant.
