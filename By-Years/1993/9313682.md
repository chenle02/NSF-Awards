This research is designed to take advantage of a suite of low probability and
ephemeral physical environmental conditions that should allow the significant
extension of data sets having to do with the effects of an urbanizing landscape
on a lake ecosystem. Historical data sets are available for comparison of lake
behavior attributable to this cold season's peculiar set of conditions. It is
expected that significant changes will be observed in the patterns of
streamborne nutrient inputs to the lake. Even more interesting, however, is the
possibility of using the data for the evaluation of "bottom up" versus "top
down" assertions that currently abound in the aquatic ecology community. Studies
of the type represented by this project provide the foundation for better
understanding and, therefore, the better management of aquatic resources. It can
be expected that the work will be important not only within the sphere of
fundamental aquatic science but also to water resource managers involved in
decisions regarding water quality and fisheries.
