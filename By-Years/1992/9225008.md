Probabilistic considerations arise in the analysis of algorithms in at least
two ways. (1) First, in a randomized algorithm the outcomes of random events are
used to determine the progress of the algorithm. Randomization is now a standard
tool of the computer scientist. (2) A second problem area has instances from
some probability distribution and looks to understanding the average performance
of a particular algorithm, which is often far better than its worst case. Both
aspects are extremely important and this work addresses a number of problems in
these two areas. In the area of randomized algorithms, these topics are
investigated; (a) random walks on graphs and their application to problems of
computing volume; (b) finding edge disjoint paths in expander graphs; (c)
counting problems and a randomized dual simplex algorithm; (d) applications of
sphere separators in parallel algorithms; and (e) randomized heuristics. In the
area of probabilistic analysis, random instances of: (f) the satisfiability
problem; (g) graph matching problems; and (h) Hamilton cycle and traveling
salesman problems, are considered; as well as (i) the study of explicit
constructions for the token distribution problem.
