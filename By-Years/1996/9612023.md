The project will refine and evaluate a design for a 100 Teraops multiprocessor
system organized as a hierarchy of processors-and-memory system subsystem (HPAM)
by carefully considering its technological feasibility along with the usability
of the programming environment, in the context of important representative
applications. A programming environment capable of supporting a combination of
automatic translation of standard programs, user-specified machine specific
programs or optimizations, and library-based programming is to be investigated.
Two classes of applications will be considered: time-constrained, fixed-size
problems and large-scale, complex problems. The first consists of scientific
simulations used with interactive immersive visualization systems. The second
includes the recently introduced SPEChpc96 benchmarks and 2D/3D finite-element
modeling applications.
