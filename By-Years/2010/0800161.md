CMMI - 0800161 Large Deformation and Instability in Soft Active
Materials&lt;br/&gt;Suo, Zhigang Harvard University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Soft
materials, such as elastomers and gels, can be made active in that they can
greatly change shape and volume in response to diverse stimuli. For example, a
dielectric elastomer may strain more than 100% under an electric field. As
another example, a gel may imbibe solvent molecules and swell thousand times its
initial volume. These soft active materials (SAMs) are being developed in
diverse technologies, including muscle-like actuators, drug delivery, and tissue
engineering. This project will formulate field theories for SAMs subject to
mechanical, electrical, and chemical loads. The theories will build on
principles of nonlinear continuum mechanics, electrostatics, thermodynamics and
kinetics. The project will link the field theories to experimental observations
and to molecular models. &lt;br/&gt;One conspicuous hole in the courses of
mechanics and materials is the lack of a substantive coverage of soft materials.
The standard fare has not gone much beyond rubber elasticity. This hole may be
filled through basic research in the context of emerging technologies. The PI
has begun to incorporate recent advances in the mechanics of SAMs into a
graduate course. The lecture notes have been placed online, and read by many
people off the campus. In addition, SAMs are enabling many significant
applications. Applications such as drug delivery and tissue engineering aim to
address the long term societal needs for better health care. This project will
help to bring the discipline of mechanics to participate in the creation of the
technologies that will enhance the quality of our lives.&lt;br/&gt;
