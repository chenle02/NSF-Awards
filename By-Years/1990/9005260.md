This award will provide one-half the cost of acquiring a laser fusion source
mass spectrometer system for argon 40/39 dating in earth sciences research. The
instrument will be operated and maintained in the Berkeley Geochronology Center
of the Institute of Human Origins. The Institute of Human Origins is committed
to providing the remaining funds required. The single-crystal laser fusion mass
spectrometer will be the second such instrument available to the earth science
community in the U.S. The capabilities of this system constitute a dramatic
improvement in the precision and accuracy of dates for geological and
anthropological samples.
