Movements of daily living, such as reaching for a glass of water or pushing an
elevator button, are motor acts that most of us perform easily and without
conscious consideration of how they are executed. However, it takes considerable
time for children to learn to reach and aim accurately for objects. Also, these
movements, which seem to be so easy for young and healthy individuals, can
become difficult for older adults and patients with motor disorders. This
suggests that the organization of aiming movements is not a simple task for the
central nervous system. One of the observations that supports this assumption is
that the final stage of aiming movements when performed by elderly individuals
and Parkinson's patients usually includes "submovements" represented by a number
of small inflections in movement profile that are hardly noticeable in movements
of young adults. These submovements have always been interpreted as corrections
performed to achieve required accuracy at the target. This research is based on
the hypothesis that another factor, which emerges from mechanical properties of
the arm, might also contribute to the submovement phenomenon. In this view, to
terminate hand motion at the target, energy developed for movement production
has to be dissipated, and this might require a specific control strategy that
causes submovements. To investigate the role of this factor, the structure of
aiming movements that require termination at the target will be compared to the
structure of continuous point-to-point movements. The continuous movements will
be from the initial point to the target and back to the initial point, and
therefore they will not require termination of motion at the target. The effect
of the motion termination factor will be enhanced by using a solid target that
helps to terminate motion passively and a flexible target that requires active
termination of motion. The study will be useful both for understanding basic
principles of human movement control and for investigation of factors underlying
dysfunction caused by age and motor disorders.
