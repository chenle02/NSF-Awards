The proposed research is intended to answer several questions of noncommutative
geometry, symplectic geometry, and microlocal analysis. In particular, I will
continue my research on index theorems. I will work on a generalization of the
Atiyah-Singer index theorem from pseudo-differential to Fourier integral
operators and on a connection of the new index theorems of Connes and Moscovici
to the general index theorem for deformation quantizations. I will also work on
a more general theory of characteristic classes. This should lead, in
particular, to a generalization of the Chern-Simons classes from local systems
to arbitrary D-modules. This, in turn, should lead to better understanding and
generalization of Riemann-Roch theorems for determinants of cohomology. Another
direction of my research will be the theory of modules over deformed algebra of
functions on a symplectic manifold. First, I intend to define a new category of
modules with some additional structure; it should be related to the Fukaya
category. The former should be regarded as a local limit of the former. Next
step would be to make this category non-local and therefore even more closely
related to the Fukaya category.

My research deals with several related topics. One is noncommutative geometry,
much of it consists of the usual calculus, but carried out in such a way that
the identity xy=yx is no longer valid. We refer to algebraic systems in which
this is the case as noncommutative spaces. The other is deformation
quantization, namely the study of the examples and structure of noncommutative
spaces, rather than of laws and rules of noncommutative calculus. The word
deformation refers to the fact that one obtains these noncommutative spaces by
taking a usual (curved, higher-dimensional) space and changing it a little bit
in noncommutative direction. (The word quantization is used because the passage
from the classical to the quantum mechanics is the principal example). Yet
another direction of my research is index theory, which is a discipline linking
the number of solutions of systems of equations (differential, integral, etc.)
to the topological complexity of underlying spaces. It is deeply related to
noncommutative geometry because two operations that you can apply to a function,
multiplication by x and derivation, do not commute.
