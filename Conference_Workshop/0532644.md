Special Year in Mathematical Logic, University of Florida, 2006-2007

The special year in mathematical logic will be devoted to the exploration of
various channels of communication between several fields of logic as well as the
rest of the mathematical sciences. Mathematical logic is entering a phase of
increasingly intense conversation with other parts of mathematics. In one
workshop, we will concentrate on the relationship between computability,
effective descriptive set theory and computable analysis on one hand and
numerical methods and analysis on the other, such as the study of effectively
closed sets and effectivity of reals and real functions. Potential special
topics will include algorithmic randomness, quantum computation, reverse
mathematics. The second workshop will relate the current trends in definable
forcing and determinacy with measure theory, potential theory and dynamical
systems, as well as with the games used in biomathematics or economics. Special
topics include Borel equivalence relations and definable forcing. The third
workshop will further explore the connections between singular cardinals and
inner models. Recent work on large cardinals and inner models has helped to
advance the frontier of set theory and its applications to mathematics.

The special year will bring together leading scientists from many areas of
mathematical logic, in an effort to advance our understanding of this
fundamental discipline. Just as mathematics is the language of science and
provides the foundation of science, so logic is the language of mathematics and
provides the foundation of mathematics. The subject of logic has its roots in
classical philosophy and today has branches in many disciplines, including
mathematics and philosophy, as well as computer science, linguistics, and law.
Logic is used in expert systems which, for example, help doctors diagnose
illness with the aid of computers. Current research on hybrid algorithms is
using logic in the development of software which will map out the flight plan of
an airplane in real time. While the program is based in the mathematics
department, other departments, including philosophy and computer science, will
also participate. The broader impact of the project includes an emphasis on
participation of graduate students, junior researchers and women mathematicians.
There will also be a focus on participants from the Southeast region. We will
publish proceedings of the work presented during the special year.
