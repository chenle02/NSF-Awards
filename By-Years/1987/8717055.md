A three-week trip will be undertaken to visit the sites of three major
landslides occurred in Colombia (November, 1985), in Peru (March, 1987), and in
Ecuador (March, 1987). The purpose of this visit is to meet with national
experts in each country and with their help identify three field trip sites in
regions underlain by residual and pyroclastic soils where catastrophic
landslides have taken place. Data will be gathered at these sites, and the bases
will be laid for cooperative research to study these large mass movements using
the latest geological and geomechanical methods of detection and analysis. From
this initial activity studies on the stabililty of natural slopes potentially
unstable and international cooperation for developing methods for the mitigation
of landslide damage will emerge.
