This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will support the
development and preliminary evaluation of low-cost, high-performance,
environmentally-clean proton exchange membranes (PEMs). The project involves the
manufacture of PEMs using a patented hot filament chemical vapor deposition
process, depositing ultra-thin fluorinated sulfonic acid polymer films directly
onto inexpensive membrane substrates. Structure-property-processing
relationships will be established and compared with performance with
commercially-available membranes, measuring electrical conductivity, relevant
gas/liquid permeability and acid capacity, characterizing chemical composition
and stability, and identifying the significance of polymerization parameters.
The results will enable selection of suitable polymer chemistries for
optimization, aggressive evaluation and testing of the PEMs in membrane
electrode assemblies (MEAs) in Phase II. Ultimately, rapid, integrated process
for fabricating composite MEAs through the deposition of multiple functional
layers will be developed, in a manner analogous to the manufacture of
microchips. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The market potential for fuel cells is
massive, with PEMs and more broadly MEA components constituting a significant
portion of the overall market share.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
