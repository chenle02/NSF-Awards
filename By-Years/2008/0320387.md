With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Iowa will acquire an X-ray
photoelectron spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of
areas: a) novel synthetic methods for patterning silicon surfaces; b) design of
molecular precursor routes to inorganic materials; c) surface characterization
of atmospheric particulates; and d) characterization of iron surfaces in
environmental applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The X-ray photoelectron
spectrometer (XPS) is used for chemical analysis. It irradiates a sample with a
beam of monochromatic X-rays and the energies of the resulting photoelectrons
are measured and related to specific elements. XPS often plays a crucial role in
defining the system under study. The work to be carried out by these
investigators represents a highly coherent attack on a range of issues at the
forefront of materials chemistry and environmental chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
