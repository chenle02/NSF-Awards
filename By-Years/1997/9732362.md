The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Northern Arizona University will
offer a summer research program for six students recruited nationwide. Minority
students and students from colleges and universities without doctoral programs
are especially encouraged to apply. Application materials are available from
Terence.Blows@nau.edu the program will run for eight weeks in the summer, with
each student working on an individual project tailored to their own mathematical
background. The subject areas, which are to be widely interpreted are Applied
Mathematics, Combinatorics and Statistics. Descriptions of projects available
for the coming summer appear on the department's homepage at
http://odin.math.nau.edu/ As well as carrying out their research, students will
participate in seminar series and will each give a fifty minute presentation.
Also, at the end of the program, each student will write up their work in a form
suitable for publication.
