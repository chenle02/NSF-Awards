The Doctoral Consortium funded by this project is a three-day event to be held
in conjunction with the IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and
Gesture Recognition to be held on March 21-23, 2011, in Santa Barbara,
California. Attendees include graduate students nearing completion of their
dissertations who have been accepted to the consortium. Each recent Ph.D.
graduate or soon to be graduate chosen to participate in the consortium is
paired with a senior researcher who serves as his/her mentor during the
conference. Each participant also presents his/her research at a doctoral
Consortium luncheon open to participants and mentors and also presents his/her
research in a poster session open to all attendees of the conference.
Participants also have a travel budget to defray all or part of their expenses
incurred in attending the conference and consortium. The consortium provides
talented young researchers the opportunity to discuss their work formally and
informally with both their peers and senior researchers. These interactions with
others coming from different research labs with different viewpoints typically
strengthen the ability of young researchers to communicate the value of their
own work and to set their work more clearly in the broader context of the
research field as a whole.
