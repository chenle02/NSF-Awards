DMI-9703531 Eager This research project is to apply kinetic models of
infiltration of powder materials to the more complicated systems and joint
geometry of practical applications. The first objective is to experimentally
determine the different combinations of the powder interlayers as well as the
number and relative thickness of the interlayers. Next, with the aid of three
dimensional printing (3DP) techniques, the powder interlayers will be patterned
to regulate the local bonding areas, and to further reduce the residual stress
in the joint. Computer modeling will be applied to calculate the level of
residual stress in the interlayers, and provide indispensable information on
selecting the powder interlayers and their geometries (patterning). Finally, a
new bonding agent other than Ag-Cu-Ti will be developed. Such an alloy will
provide improved heat and corrosion resistance as compared to the Ag-based
alloys. Success of the research will create a better level of understanding of
the physics and chemistry of advanced materials joining. By integrating designs
of structures with joint configurations, this research will provide useful tools
for the applications of advanced engineering materials.
