This research is a feasibility study for the application of oxygen isotopes for
interpretation of environmental changes that followed the uplift of the Isthmus
of Panama. Recent molluscs shells off the Pacific and Atlantic coasts will be
analysed in an attempt to distinguish the different environmental regimes.
Should differences be recorded in the shell's isotopic record, subsequent
research with fossil shells will be viable. Funding will enable pilot project
that will strengthen subsequent proposal from this PI.
