The purpose of this project has been the revision of the first year chemistry
laboratory curriculum at the college to include new and revised experiments
which make use of microcomputers to record and process experimental data. The
equipment which was acquired includes 10 computer data acquisition and
processing workstations, and an Fourier Transform Infrared spectrophotometer
with data analysis computer and spectral analysis software. The data acquisition
workstations are being used in experiments involving pH and potentiometric
titrations, chemical kinetics, and thermochemistry. The infrared
spectrophotometer and dedicated computer is being used to analyze the reactants
and products of organic reactions which are being introduced into the first year
curriculum which more realistically represents modern chemical laboratory work,
and therefore better educates science and engineering students in the principles
and practices of modern chemistry. The institution is contributing to the
project in an amount equal to the NSF funds.
