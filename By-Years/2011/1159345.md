This engineering education research project seeks to understand the motivations
and contributions of engineers who return from industry positions to pursue
Ph.D. degrees. This project hypothesizes that such students can play key roles
in building bridges between academia and industry, and may play important roles
in the innovation ecosystem. By helping to increase understanding of this
student population, the proposed research can help universities recruit, retain,
and maximize the potential of such students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
significance and importance of this project will be to impact academic policy
and recruitment strategies, as well as contribute to research-based best
practices. If the project is successful, the research can have broad impact on
the research community, innovation policy, as well as government programs
designed to support student research. This project overlaps with NSF's strategic
goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering
workforce with new capabilities and expertise. Additionally NSF's goal of
innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are
useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.
