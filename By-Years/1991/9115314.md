The objective is to investigate the effect of coupling between the flow and
transport of a fluid, which is commercially available 'gasoline', in a porous
medium consisting of Monterey No. 30 standard sand. A three dimensional finite
element code will be developed based on (n+2) coupled differential equations for
oil/water flow with n chemical species transport. The interphase mass transfer
rate expression will be the focus of this research and parameterization of this
by flume experiment. The computer code to be developed will have pre and post
processors so that it can be readily utilized for field applications concerning
problems of leaking underground storage tanks.
