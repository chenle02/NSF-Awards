This award provides some travel, publicity, and publication support for a
conference to advance international understanding of the implications of
changing interactions among universities, industries and government in support
for research. Conference activities will take place in New York City and in
Purchase, New York. The New York Academy of Sciences (NYAS) is a co-organizer of
the conference, and the Science Policy Association of NYAS is organizing a
special session on problems of university-industry-government relations in
metropolitan regions like New York City, London, Paris and Tokyo. The award
broadens student and speaker participation and publicity for and outreach from
this activity. It provides visibility and stimulus for this research area among
U.S. researchers, an important follow-up and follow-on to the first conference,
which was held in Amsterdam in January 1996. Results should help to structure
research topics in this area and provide background information to assist
decision makers concerned to evaluate the implications of business-university-
industry relations for research and for economic development. Publication plans
also help to assure broad dissemination to an influential and interdisciplinary
audience.
