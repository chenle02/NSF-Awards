This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer
Phase I project will develop ultrananocrystalline diamond (UNCD®) as a high
frequency structural layer for piezoelectrically-transduced micromachined RF
resonators for MHz-GHz applications in wireless telecommunication systems.
Diamond, in theory, is the ideal RF MEMS resonator material, having the extreme
bulk properties of high acoustic velocity, hardness, thermal stability, and
linearity, combined with the surface properties of low stiction and desirable
surface chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diamond MEMS resonators can enable MEMS
RF devices for civilian and military applications and allow for the direct
integration of MEMS with microelectronics. With the potential for 100× reduction
in size and power consumption relative to existing technologies while extending
the performance of "radio on a chip" systems into the GHz, the RF MEMS market is
forecasted at $1.1 billion by 2010. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
