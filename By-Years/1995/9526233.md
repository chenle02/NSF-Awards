9526233 Menke This research is an ancillary experiment to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge
in Iceland Experiment (MARIE) volcanic hazard assessment survey being planned by
European scientists for the mid-Atlantic plate boundary in North Iceland, which
is also an area of seismic activity. Several seismic arrays will be deployed
that supplement the European coverage and which are directed to using shear
waves to define the deep crustal segmentation of the plate boundary. The
critical questions are whether lower crustal shear wave attenuation, which is
taken as a proxy for temperature, varies along the ridge-parallel direction and
whether this variation is related to the central volcanoes that express the
surficial segmentation, and/or to heat transport across the Moho. This research
is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
