This is a proposal for the purchase of equipment to enhance NSF- sponsored
research on affinity foam separations of biomolecules and protein absorption
studies at gas-liquid interfaces. The requested UV recording spectrophotometer
will be used for measuring the spectra of protein mixtures and in performing
kinetic assays. The Langmuir film balance will enable simultaneous measurements
of surface pressure and excess surface concentration. The requested upgrade of
an existing Perkin-Elmer isocratic, refractive-index detector HPLC system will
enable the gel permeation HPLC analysis of protein mixtures. A 12-month grant is
recommended in the amount of $52,067, all from FY87 funds.
