During conjugal plasmid transfer the movement of plasmid DNA across the donor
cell membrane and wall systems is accomplished through the activities of Type IV
transport systems. The VirB complex of Agrobacterium tumefaciens is the
prototypical membrane localized Type IV transport complex. In addition to its
role in plant transformation, the VirB complex can support the conjugal transfer
of plasmid RSF1010 between agrobacteria. The goals of this project were
developed in response to an unexpected finding: expression of specific subsets
of the VirB proteins in a recipient Agrobacterium strain increases the frequency
of virB-mediated conjugal RSF1010 transfer into it by over three orders of
magnitude. This is intriguing because the mechanism by which Type IV transport
substrates cross the recipient cell envelope are not clear. The specific aims of
the work are to identify genes in A. tumefaciens that are, along with the VirB
proteins, required for the increase in the capacity to serve as a conjugal
recipient. Additionally, cellular and molecular analysis of the mutant
recipients will be carried out, focusing on novel strategies to analyze mating
pair formation as well as experiments to examine the expression, localization
and role of the identified proteins in the recipient phenotype. In relation to
the broader impact of the research, plasmid conjugal transfer is the most
prevalent means of antibiotic resistance spread in a wide variety of
environments ranging from soil to hospital intensive care units. Yet the role of
the recipient cell is poorly understood, particularly in systems that require
solid surfaces for successful mating. Defining how the recipient affects the
efficiency of transfer has implications for microbial ecology and population
biology as well as the more medically oriented problem of antibiotic resistance.
