The objective of this GOALI program is to demonstrate optically functional
surfaces by (i) employment of a deposition technique that allows for tailorable
refractive indices and by (ii) lithographically structuring of refractive-index-
controlled surfaces. The benefits resulting from such optically functional
surfaces will be demonstrated in photo-voltaic solar cells and light-emitting
diodes. The program is a collaborative effort with Magnolia Solar Company, a
company committed to conduct joint research in optically-functional-surface
technology and commercializing it for photo-voltaic applications.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In optical sciences, the refractive index of a medium is
the most fundamental quantity and it is desirable to control both the (i)
refractive index profile as well as (ii) the surface geometry (structure). The
intellectual merit of the proposed project lies in the demonstration of a new
class of optically functional surfaces, and in the employment of these surfaces
in photo-voltaic solar cells and light-emitting diodes. Due to the fundamental
nature of the refractive index, tailorable-refractive-index films are
anticipated to be transformative with far-reaching
impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational goals are (i) training and
furthering of the intellectual growth of graduate students, (ii) raising the
interest of undergraduate students particularly of domestic students and
involvement of these students in leading-edge research, (iii) allowing students
to work side-by-side with engineers from our partner company, and (iv)
increasing participation of disadvantaged and underrepresented groups. The new
research direction, including the application of new optical materials to
devices, provides a great opportunity for students to be educated and trained in
an exciting field.
