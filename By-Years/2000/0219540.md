The sheer size of the World-Wide Web mandates the provision of portals,
hotlists, and other catalogs that organize Web content in a domain-oriented
manner. However, the quality of the information contained is subject to
degradation as content changes, sites reorganize, and host connectivity
fluctuates. Simply detecting that a resource has changed is easy, but
determining whether that change is significant requires understanding of the
context in which the resource is used. This project will improve the stability
of collections of Web pages, allowing the development of predictable collections
that overcome the inherent instability of the World-Wide &lt;br/&gt;Web. To
accomplish this goal, the project will investigate the applicability of semantic
descriptors provided by collection creators and implicit contextual information
extracted from the collection.&lt;br/&gt;
