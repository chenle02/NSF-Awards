This award from the Synthetic Organic Program will support the research of Dr.
James P. Ferris of the Department of Chemistry at Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute. Dr. Ferris will continue his studies on the origin of life by
focusing on the nature of prebiotic RNA and how it was synthesized under
conditions present on the early Earth. Dr. Ferris will study those factors which
are important in clay mineral catalysis with the goal of forming higher
molecular weight oligomers. Montmorillonite containing varying amounts of
Fe(OH)3 or iron oxide polymorphs will be screened for catalytic properties as
will clays containing aluminate, ferric oxide and n-alkyltrimethylammonium
pillars. Also, a series of montmorillonites with different exchangeble cations
will be prepared, physically characterized and probed for catalytic activity.
Studies will continue on the effect of structure of various monomers on oligomer
formation.
