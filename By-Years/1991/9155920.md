We propose to develop an investigative-type biology laboratory for non-majors
based on commonly held misconceptions about life science. Each laboratory
session will center on a single naive preconception commonly held by students.
The students will formulate a null hypothesis and design and perform experiments
to test this preconception. Students will obtain results which conflict with
their preconceptions, allowing them to discover for themselves that logical
experiments do not support their naive beliefs. Improvement in general
scientific literacy should occur as a result of active student participation in
all phases of this unique process. This new investigative approach will require
an intensive graduate assistant training program for successful implementation.
