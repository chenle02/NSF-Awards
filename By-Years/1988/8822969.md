An examination of Lagrangian chaos caused by barotropic currents will be
accomplished by this project. This will be done by using kinematic models with
prescribed Eulerian currents. An alternative mechanism for dispersion within
estuaries is a potential result of this study; i.e. dispersion without
turbulence in the system.
