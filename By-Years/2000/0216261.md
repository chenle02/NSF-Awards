With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Harold W.
Pinnick and colleagues at West Virginia State College will acquire an
inductively-coupled plasma (ICP) atomic emission spectrometer for metal analysis
on environmental samples. They plan to investigate naturally-occurring metal
ions, their concentrations and anthropogenic metal contamination in aquatic and
terrestrial environments. The overall goal is to understand the chemistry that
occurs at abandoned coal mine sites in West Virginia, as a first step to
designing and implementing remediation.

Inductively-coupled plasma spectroscopy is an effective technique for
determining the presence of trace elements and their concentrations. It provides
a rapid and quantitative determination of a large number of heavy metals in a
variety of sample types. It can ascertain metal concentrations in the parts per
billion range, and it can determine at least 35 elements simultaneously within
minutes. The availability of an ICP will enhance the educational experience of
the undergraduate students attending West Virginia State College
