Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0307274&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: Douglas N. Arnold&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Institute for
Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) is&lt;br/&gt;initiating a program to
partner with established academic&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians who seek to increase
the impact of their research&lt;br/&gt;and to take up research problems in areas
of significant&lt;br/&gt;application. The New Directions program consists of two
major&lt;br/&gt;activities: the New Directions Visiting Professorships,
which&lt;br/&gt;will support established academic mathematicians to visit the
IMA&lt;br/&gt;for a period of several months, immersing themselves in
the&lt;br/&gt;annual thematic program, learning new mathematics
and&lt;br/&gt;applications, connecting their research with important
problems,&lt;br/&gt;and establishing new contacts and collaborations; and the
New&lt;br/&gt;Directions Short Courses, two-week intensive courses
for&lt;br/&gt;mathematics faculty members that address active and
developing&lt;br/&gt;areas of application. The first short course in June 2003
is&lt;br/&gt;devoted to Cellular Physiology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary
mission of the Institute for Mathematics and its&lt;br/&gt;Applications (IMA) is
to increase the impact of mathematics by&lt;br/&gt;fostering interdisciplinary
research, linking mathematics of the&lt;br/&gt;highest caliber and important
scientific and technological&lt;br/&gt;problems from other disciplines and
industry. This award to the&lt;br/&gt;IMA helps support visitors who are
established researchers in&lt;br/&gt;mathematics and who seek to broaden their
research into emerging&lt;br/&gt;areas of application. Information about
upcoming programs,&lt;br/&gt;selection criteria for New Directions
professorships and&lt;br/&gt;workshops, and application forms are available on
the World Wide&lt;br/&gt;Web at http://www.ima.umn.edu/.&lt;br/&gt;
