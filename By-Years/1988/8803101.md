This award provides funds for modification of a cell sorter (FACS) in the James
A. Baker Institute at Cornell. Modifications include a new laser and a VAX 3600
computer with A/D converter for data acquisition and analysis. The new lazer
will increase the utility and accuracy of the instrument, while the new
computing arrangement will upgrade the rate and quality of data analysis. Cell
sorting has been a key technique in understanding important aspects of cell
biology and development, especially that of white blood cells. The Baker
Institute machine, one of two instruments at Cornell, is heavily used by a
number of investigators. These modifications, in particular the new computer,
will provide an instrument with state of the art capability.
