Parallel algorithms will be developed for general nonlinear programs as well as
for linear and quadratic programs. Emphasis will be placed on the recently
proposed idea of constraint distribution among parallel processors as well as
inexact and exact matrix splitting methods for the linear complementarity
problem. Applications of mathematical programming to pattern recognition and
neural networks will also be made, where the potential of optimization
algorithms has not been fully realized. Particular attention will be given to
medical diagnostic problems, some of which have been successfully solved by
linear programming. Mathematical theory that is needed for the above algorithms
and applications will be developed and sharpened. An important and promising
area to be focused on is that of error bounds for various types of mathematical
programs.
