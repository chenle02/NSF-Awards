The project seeks to build a framework for evolutionary and systematic work in
the rhabditid nematodes, a globally distributed group of free-living terrestrial
roundworms. This project focuses on two species groups (clades), Eurhabditis and
Pleiorhabditis. The primary objectives are to resolve evolutionary trees using
multigene sequences; to elucidate the evolution of morphological characters in
order to determine which features best diagnose different taxonomic groups; and
to build an online database and key in order to make all this information freely
and globally available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their diversity, significant role
in organic decomposition, usefulness as bioindicators, the associations they
make with other species, and the sheer abundance of species and individuals make
rhabditid nematodes an important taxon, yet it is one of the neediest for
systematic work and data-sharing resources. This project provides a systematic
framework for a growing number of comparative and evolutionary studies of
rhabditid development, behavior, reproduction, and genome structure and
function, because the group includes the model genetic organism Caenorhabditis
elegans and "satellite" models such as Pristionchus pacificus, Oscheius tipulae,
and others. In the process of this project, graduate and undergraduate students
and a postdoctoral researcher will be trained in rhabditid systematics,
preventing the extinction of expertise in this field.&lt;br/&gt;
