The National Association of Mathematians' MATHFest is a conference designed to
expose undergraduate mathematical science majors from minority serving
institutions, primarily HBCUs, to the possibility of attending graduate school
and exposing them to career opportunities in the mathematicalsciences. MATHFest
2010 will be at Miami Dade College in Miami, FL on November 18-20. The main
goals of the conference are:

-- To address the shortage of minority mathematicians by encouraging minority
students to get advanced degrees in the mathematical sciences -- Provide role
models -- Give the undergraduate students an opportunity to make a presentation
-- Familiarize the students with graduate schools -- Make the students aware of
career opportunities in the mathematical sciences

To achieve these goals, MATHFest offers undergraduate presentations, a graduate
faculty panel, a graduate student panel, an industrial mathematician panel, and
an informal session called spotlight on a mathematician. Among the conference
attendants are high achieving students in the mathematical sciences from about a
fourth of the HBCUs. Small institution will have proportionally small
mathematics programs, leaving mathematics students in an isolated situation on
their campuses. Hence, these institutions graduate one or two mathematics majors
a year. The conference is a time when students from these schools will see
approximately 120 students that are doing the same things and are in similar
situations.
