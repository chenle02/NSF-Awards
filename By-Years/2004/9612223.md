Proposal No: 9612223 Proposal Type: Research Planning Grant Principal
Investigator: Constance A. Schall Affiliation: University of Tulsa The
investigator proposes to initiate research in the area of nucleation of protein
crystals. This is an important area with tremendous applications in protein
purification, structure determination etc. However, protein crystallization is
still an art, to a large extent, and it is important that new researchers bring
scientific rationales to the phenomenon thereby allowing technological
exploitation. The investigator qualifications are excellent at this stage of
research experience and maturity. The institutional facilities are appropriate,
but the university has not done much to encourage research activity by providing
a start up package for the PI. It is disappointing that the PI has to purchase
even basic research instrumentation (mixer, analytical balance) from the grant;
the institution should have helped in this regard. Nevertheless, this is a
worthy PI who has shown promise in her graduate work, and the grant should
foster the development of her research career. The program officer recommends
funding of this proposal.
