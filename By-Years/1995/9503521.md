influences several fundamental ecological processes in the sea, e.g.,
recruitment, fecundity, and population growth rate. Chemical communication is
also crucial to locating conspecifics, recognizing potential mates, and
transferring sperm. Despite the evolutionary significance of these chemical
signals, little is known about the type of molecules employed and the basis for
discrimination. The main objectives of this research are: 1)to identify one
class of chemicals (=glycoproteins) responsible for mate recognition in marine
copepods, 2) to investigate their range of polymorphism within and between
species, and 3) to examine their role in the maintenance of productive isolation
among species.
