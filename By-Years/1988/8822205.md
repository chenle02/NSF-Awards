This is an AIT-CCNAA collaborative project to gather data on the retentry
adjustment of Taiwan scientists and engineers who have studied abroad. This is a
renewal study proposed by Drs. Paul Pederson and Anne Pederson, Syracuse
University and Professor Hwang Kwang-Kuo, National Taiwan University and
Professor Cherng Lin-Lin, National Chung-Hsing University. Taiwan is a primary
country of origin for foreign students in the U.S. We need to know how they use
their education when they return. More importantly, as Taiwan is becoming
increasingly competitive in >high-technology products, we need to know how and
where the Taiwanese are applying their U.S. S&amp;E training. This project can
provide this critical information.
