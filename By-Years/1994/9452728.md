9452728 Ebert-May Northern Arizona University will initiate a five week Young
Scholars Program (YSP) with a Mathematics and Science Teaching Perspectives
(MSTP) in the fields of ecology and environmental science for 35 students and 7
teachers. The program is designed as a cooperative effort among seven states in
the Rocky Region: Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Utah, and
Wyoming. Research teams are composed of 35 high potential rising 10th and 11th
grade students, high school teachers, and scientists. Students and teachers will
work at a long-term ecological research site in Arizona during the summer, and
then return to their states to work on interdisciplinary research problems at
their respective school research site with assistance from university scientists
and scientists from their states.
