9302102 Jabbari The objective of this research is to develop robust control
algorithms and methods for active and hybrid control systems for civil
engineering structures subjected to environmental loads, such as earthquakes,
strong wind gusts, waves, etc. These methods will account for uncertainty in
parameter identification and modeling uncertainties for the structure. The
methods will also ensure the reliability of the control system when a number of
sensors and/or actuators fail. The reliability of the control system refers to
the ability of the control system, as driven by the control algorithm, to stay
stable and provide certain prescribed level of performance in case of sensor
and/or actuator failure. The control algorithms for will consider the
compensation of time delays, optimal number and location of sensors and
actuators, static output feedback and acceleration feedback. ***
