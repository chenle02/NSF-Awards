This project will continue the development of a new theory of learning in which
the progress of students learning over time is modeled probabilistically as a
Markov stochastic process. This theory is designed to provide responses to key
questions about learning processes such as : What is the distribution of the
knowledge states at the beginning of a particular grade in school, such as grade
4? What are the most frequently traveled learning paths? What are the easiest
items for a student to learn given a particular knowledge state? How long does
it take, on the average, for a student with a particular learning rate to go
from one knowledge state to another? Do the students in school district A tend
to follow different paths from those in school district B? This theory is a
potentially powerful tool for the precise monitoring of students' learning.
However, crucial work remains to be done for this theory to be easily applied by
practitioners. So far it has been applied only to the special case of a single
test given at a particular time. The cases of two or more tests (on the same
sample of students) raise a number of technical issues (some of which are
related to parameter estimations) which will be addressed in the research. The
PI will also conduct an application of the theory.
