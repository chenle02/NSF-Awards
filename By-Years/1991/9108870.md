CICNet, a midlevel network supplying high level connectivity to the
universities of the Committee on Institutional Cooperation (CIC) (which includes
the universities of Ohio State, Michigan State, University of Michigan, Indiana
University, University of Chicago, Purdue University, University of Illinois,
Northwestern University, Universtiy of Wisconsin, University of Minnesota, and
University of Iowa) and establishing cooperative working agreements with
intrastate networks in its region, will be provided funding to support the
continued operation of the CICNet data network. The primary focus of this
project is to improve the technological and operational aspects of CICNet and
extend and expand the value of CICNet and of the many resources to which it
provides access. The initial award to the University of Illinois for the start
of CICNet has provided two years of operation during which time CICNet has
provided high bandwidth connectivity (1.544 milliion bits per second) for the
midlevel region from Ohio to Minnesota to the NSFNET Nationwide Backbone
Network. This renewal outlines the continuation of the operation of this network
as well as the expansion of network information services with a special emphasis
on end-user orientation.***//
