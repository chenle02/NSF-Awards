Neuroscience has made enormous progress during the past half century as new
tools and technological advances have made it possible to ask increasingly
specific questions about the structure and function of neurons, synapses,
proteins, and genes. Progress has been slower in understanding the organization
and function of circuits, networks, and brain systems. And in that context, it
is sometimes overlooked how important it is to have an account of cognition
itself ? perception, attention, memory, language, and the organization of
action. One wants to understand its components and to understand how the
components of cognition can be related to brain substrates. The work proposed
herein addresses a fundamental issue about how the brain has organized its
memory functions. The issue is whether short-term and long-term memory are
indeed distinct entities, such that short-term memory is independent of the
hippocampus (and related structures); or whether an exception to that principle
exists in the case of spatial cognition. It is a deep and fundamental matter. Do
the hippocampus and related structures have online, computational functions? Or
are these structures in fact needed only when short-term memory capacity has
been exceeded. To evaluate these two perspectives, five studies are proposed in
individuals with hippocampal lesions (or larger lesions that include related
structures) using navigation in open space, virtual reality, as well as a test
of spatial imagining. Parallel work on path integration is proposed for rats
with selective lesions of the hippocampal, entorhinal, or parietal cortex.
Understanding the relationship between memory and spatial cognition is
fundamental to understanding how the brain has organized its memory functions.
