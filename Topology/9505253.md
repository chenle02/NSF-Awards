9505253 Gabai The investigation focuses on several of the central open problems
in three-dimensional manifold topology. E.g., is the homeomorphism type of a
hyperbolic three-manifold determined by its homotopy type? Is a hyperbolic
metric on a closed 3-manifold unique up to isotopy? Is every closed irreducible
aspherical 3-manifold covered by 3-space? Do theorems about Haken manifolds or
3-manifolds with taut foliations generalize to manifolds with essential
laminations? A three-dimensional manifold is a space M with the following
property. Any sufficiently small observer in M believes that he is living in
standard three-dimensional space. This assumes that the observer is nearsighted,
i.e. his vision is restricted to small distances. Despite the fact that
3-manifolds have an extremely simple local structure, their global structures
are in general quite complex. Though great efforts have been made in this
century to understand the nature of 3-manifolds and much progress has been made
these last 40 years, mathematicians still appear to be quite far from a complete
understanding. This project addresses some of the most fundamental open problems
in the subject. ***
