This project's intent is the procurement of equipment to support process control
research at the University of Utah. Specifically, an MSC 1000 Parallel
Processing Computer will be purchased and dedicated to initiating and developing
a series of innovative computer-man interface research projects in process
control. Initial research will focus on enhanced process control of a nuclear
reactor system.
