This Oceanographic Instrumentation acquisition project is provided under the NSF
Research for Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) guidelines. The Maine Maritime
Academy, on behalf of a consortium of Maine research and educational
institutions, was awarded a Charter Party Agreement in 1988 to operate the NSF-
owned research vessel ARGO MAINE (formerly R/V CAYUSE). The Academy will acquire
a shore-based sideband communications radio and will upgrade and make
operational a CTD / Rosette system that has been donated to the Academy by a
private company. The CTD collects information on seawater conductivity and
temperature as it is lowered through the water column. The Rosette system
collects discrete water samples from specific depths for later analysis. Both
are very basic pieces of seagoing equipment and are widely used by oceanographic
institutions. The requested upgrades will bring the systems up to modern
scientific specifications. The equipment will be used on the ship for the
Academy's educational programs and for research projects of Consortium members
and visiting investigators.
