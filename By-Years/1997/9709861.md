Different types of auctions (e.g., Dutch versus English) vary in the time they
take to establish a price. Transactions costs will therefore differ across
auction types. This research proposes to build on a data set the PI s have
assembled on automobile auctions, adding auctions in which only dealers are
allowed to bid as well as data on number of bidders. Databases on art and horse
auctions will also be compiled. Preliminary empirical analyses of how these
various auction markets perform and on the role of transactions costs in their
operation will be conducted.
