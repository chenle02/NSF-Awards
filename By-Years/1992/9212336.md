The Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Utah will purchase
computer automated and controlled triaxial and oedometric equipment for testing
soil specimens. This equipment will be dedicated to support research in
engineering. The equipment will be used for several research projects, including
in particular: 1. Stress-State Analysis in Unsaturated Soils; 2. Chemical
Stabilization of Soils; 3. In Situ Stabilization of Soils; 4. Study of Playas
and Desert Basins; 5. Permeability in Marine Sediments; 6. Ground Water
Monitoring.
