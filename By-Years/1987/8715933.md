Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) spectroscopy is a technique used by chemists to
study the properties of molecules having an electronic configuration containing
unpaired electrons. In this manner, the structures of a wide variety of
intermediates can be understood. The Department of Chemistry at the University
of California, Santa Barbara will use this award that is joint-funded by the
Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program, the Biology Instrumentation Program,
and the Instrumentation for Materials Research Program to help acquire an ESR
spectrometer. Some of the areas of research that will be enhanced by the
acquisition include: 1) Mechanisms of biochemically important oxidation-
reduction reactions 2) Metallo-protein studies 3) Design, synthesis, and
characterization of new microporous hosts 4) Characterization of ferromagnetic
metal molecular intermediates 5) Nucleophilic aromatic substitution 6)
Photoreactions of metal complexes 7) Studies related to the 1,3-diyl trapping
reaction.
