This research exploits confidential Consumer Price Index (CPI) micro data, to
study two issues---quality improvements for consumer goods and movements in
firms' marginal costs and price markups due to temporary product stockouts over
market fluctuations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first part of the research
studies the sensitivity of consumer price inflation and, quality growth, to
treatment of the price increases associated with the introduction of new models
of consumer durables. The BLS' resampling method can be exploited to gain
information on how quantities sold change with model turnovers. This information
is then used to gauge how much of price increases for new goods should be
attributed to quality improvements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second part of the
research shows how information on temporary product stockouts, provide more
direct information on how firms' cost and prices behave over the market cycle
than existing methods. The stockout data are available for a much wider and more
disaggregate set of goods than data on finished inventories. The research shows
how price markups can either be attributed to price stickiness or active price
adjustments by sellers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results of this research have
important policy implications. The ability to break price increases between
quality improvements and consumer price inflation is central to the goals of
collecting information on prices. The results can directly inform measurement of
price increases used to judge changes in standards of living. The results can
yield suggestions for revisions of BLS methods or suggestions for additional
statistics the BLS could make available. The results of the research could also
have an effect on how inflation should be measured. This could affect the
determination of cost living adjustments in wage contracts, social security
payments, insurance, and ultimately the rate of inflation itself.&lt;br/&gt;
