This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Peter Rossky of the University of
Texas, Austin, is supported by an award from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry program to carry out research on quantum mechanical simulation of
chemical dynamics in condensed phases. The research focuses on three project
areas 1) the study of anionic water clusters, i.e. a water cluster with an extra
electron; 2) the further development of an approximate method to include quantum
effects in molecular dynamics simulations; 3) the study of the electronic and
nuclear dynamics of conjugated organic polymers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
techniques developed by the PI and his research group are enhancing the ability
of molecular modeling to be used as a tool in critical areas such as advanced
materials design, pharmeceutical discovery and nanoscale enginering. The study
of anionic clusters promises to increase our understanding of important
atmospheric processes, while the applications to organic polymers provides
insights needed to develop new photovoltaic materials.
