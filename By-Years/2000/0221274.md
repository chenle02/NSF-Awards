0221274&lt;br/&gt;Kirchhoff&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Pan-American Advanced
Studies Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by the NSF and the Department
of Energy (DOE), will engage graduate and post-doctoral students in an intensive
ten days of activities focusing on presentations by leading experts in green
chemistry, discussions on policy and economic factors driving green chemistry,
group problem-solving sessions, and hands-on laboratory experiments. Organized
by Dr. Mary Kirchhoff of the Green Chemistry Institute of the American Chemical
society and Dr. Patrick Moyna of the Universidad de la Republica in Montevideo,
Uruguay, this PASI will be held at the National University of Uruguay from July
6-17, 2003 and will feature case studies and interactive discussions between
participants and lecturers. The proposed activities will provide participants
with a foundation in green chemistry and will demonstrate the applicability of
green chemistry principles to different branches of chemistry, as well as to
specific industrial sectors. In addition, this PASI will help to establish a
network of scientists throughout the Americas who can promote green chemistry
through their teaching, research, and industrial involvement. &lt;br/&gt;
