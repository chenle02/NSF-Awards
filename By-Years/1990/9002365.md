The goal of this research is to obtain temperature sensitive yeast mutants in
which mRNA exit from the nucleus is blocked at the restrictive temperature.
After mutagenesis of selected yeast strains, mutants will be selected through a
series of screening procedures designed to eliminate those which are simply
temperature sensitive for protein synthesis or amino acid uptake, and to
identify those which continue to synthesize mRNA but do not allow it to exit the
nucleus at the non-permissive temperature. Although transport of molecules into
and out of the cell nucleus is critical for the life of a cell, the mechanisms
regulating such transport are not understood. Furthermore, despite the central
importance of messenger-RNA exit for all eukaryotic cells, a genetic approach to
this fundamental problem of cell function has not previously been taken. Success
in obtaining temperature sensitive messenger-RNA exit mutants would therefore
provide important new tools that would permit analysis of the molecular basis of
this process.
