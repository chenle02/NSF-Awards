This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is for the
development of platinum catalysts for hydrogen/air proton-exchange membrane fuel
cells. The proposed catalysts will be more active than the current catalysts.
The goal is to develop advanced fuel cell catalysts that are sufficiently active
to meet DOE's goal for precious metal loading for fuel cells.

More active Platinum catalysts will help commercialize hydrogen/air proton-
exchange membrane fuel cells for vehicle and low- to medium-power generator
applications. Fuel cell manufacturers and users will benefit greatly if the
proposed research becomes successful.
