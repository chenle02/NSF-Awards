9521341 Davison The study will examine stress-tolerance in two major groups of
perennial intertidal macroalgae, the red and brown seaweeds. The research will
test the hypothesis that active oxygen is involved in emersion stress of
intertidal seaweeds. Damage due to active oxygen will be determined in stress-
tolerant and stress- susceptible species exposed to emersion stress by measuring
the peroxidation of membrane lipids. Plants will be grown in laboratory culture
under conditions that increase their ability to withstand emersion stress. If
the research hypothesis is correct, increases in stress tolerance should be
associated with increased levels of antioxidants and/or protective enzymes. The
proposed research will also determine if intertidal seaweeds express specific
stress-proteins in response to emersion stress. The results of the physiological
studies will be used to design field experiments to measure the occurrence and
importance of sublethal emersion stress in natural communities and to compare
the allocation of resources to stress-tolerance in low and high shore species.
This research represents one of the first attempts to understand the processes
that confer stress tolerance in intertidal seaweeds and will provide valuable
insights into the ecology and physiology of these plants. Information on the
mechanism of stress tolerance will allow ecologists to assess the costs of
stress tolerance and relate these to reproductive output, growth and competitive
ability. ***
