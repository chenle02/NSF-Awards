In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of
the Chemistry Division, Merola will study oxidative addition reactions of
alkanes to an iridium complex and investigate the chemistry of the resulting
complexes. The goal is to develop a catalyst for the homogeneous conversion of
certain hydrocarbons into more useful chemicals, an endeavor that, if
successful, would have important industrial applications. The oxidative addition
reactions of a variety of E-H substrates (E = H,B,C,N,O) to iridium/phosphine
complexes will be investigated. The reaction chemistry of the resulting E-Ir-H
compounds, especially insertion of unsaturated molecules, will be studied. In
this way important information concerning fundamental processes occurring at the
metal center will be gathered. The knowledge gained from both parts of the study
will provide valuable leads for developing systems for C-H activation and
functionalization, catalytic hydroboration, catalytic amination, and the
catalytic addition of a number of other E-H compounds to unsaturates.
