Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) spectroscopy allows chemists to conduct extremely
precise high resolution studies on materials containing unpaired electrons
(paramagnetic compounds). Such studies reveal information on molecular structure
that is unavailable by any other technique. This award from the Chemistry Shared
Instrumentation Program will help the Department of Chemistry at Columbia
University to acquire an ESR spectrometer. The areas of chemical research that
will be enhanced by the acquisition include the following: 1) Development and
application of inorganic complexes to probe biopolymers 2) Preparation of stable
radicals and diradicals 3) Design of molecules and experiments to probe electron
and charge transfer processes 4) Use of magnetic field, magnetic isotope and
magnetic resonance effects on photochemical processes 5) ESR methods for the
study of free radical gas phase chemical reactions.
