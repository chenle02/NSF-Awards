The primary objective of this grant is to build a strong research collaboration
between the PI in the mathematics department, and the geophysics research group
at Boise State University. This&lt;br/&gt;collaboration will serve as the
prototype for a new internal program to build teaching and&lt;br/&gt;research
collaborations between applied mathematicians and science and engineering
faculty. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will begin the collaboration by attending
courses, research group meetings, and assisting in in field experiments. The
PI's primary collaborator will be Professor Partha Routh, and they will work on
both forward and inverse aspects of estimating three-dimensional distributions
of complex resistivity from electrical measurements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boise
State University, and its mathematics department, are growing and building
graduate programs in response to regional needs. The development of this cross-
disciplinary research program&lt;br/&gt;is an effective strategy for increasing
both undergraduate and graduate research
opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This IGMS project is jointly supported by
the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of
Mathematical Sciences (DMS).
