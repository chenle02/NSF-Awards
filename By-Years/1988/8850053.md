The University of the Sacred Heart, Santurce Campus, will offer a summer
residential program followed by a school year follow-up component for 15
economically disadvantaged students from the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico public
school system. Students entering grades 9, 10, 11 and 12 will be selected
through carefully designed screening procedures. Outreach efforts will be made
to female and handicapped students. The project focus is interdisciplinary and
stresses the development of basic investigation and research skills. Through
lectures on scientific issues and contact with different specialists,
participants will be presented with a broad spectrum of science and mathematics
careers from which to choose. The project also seeks to make a positive
contribution to the improvement of the teaching of science and math in the
Island's public school system by offering seminars to the teachers of
participants.
