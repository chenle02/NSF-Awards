9523572 Gluhovsky The study of fundamental aspects of atmospheric systems is
made difficult by the fact that these systems are nonlinear and sometimes
chaotic in nature. Accordingly, numerical systems (known as low order models)
that lend themselves to relatively simple mathematical solutions while still
maintaining the fundamental characteristics of the atmospheric flows are
valuable research tools for understanding the underlying physics. Preliminary
studies by the Principal Investigators indicate that low order models of
atmospheric phenomena may be presented in the form of mathematical systems known
in classical mechanics as Volterra gyrostats. In this project, low order models
for mesoscale cellular convection will be developed in the form of systems of
coupled gyrostats. This will promote understanding of this complex phenomenon as
well as the demonstrating the fundamental role that coupled gyrostats could play
in the study of geophysical fluid dynamics. ***
