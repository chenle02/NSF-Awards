This proposal seeks funding to study radon radiation level at the Homestake Mine
and to gather information that the National Underground Laboratory Committee
needs for converting the Homestake Mine to a National Laboratory. The tasks
SDSMT proposes have to be done this calendar year because the Mine closes by
January 1 of 2002. After that time, access to the mine is impossible.
