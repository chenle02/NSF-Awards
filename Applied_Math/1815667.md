Swarming is a commonly observed complex biological and sociological phenomenon.
The internal interaction mechanism attracts a lot of attention in physics,
engineering, biology, and social sciences. This project is devoted to developing
a unified mathematical theory towards the understanding of the swarming
dynamics, as well as other nonlocal models that share similar structures. These
models are widely considered in fluid mechanics, meteorology, astrophysics,
biology, and ecology. The study of the regularity and singularity formations of
these equations will provide a firm theoretical foundation for these
applications, and also help consolidate the validity of these models in
describing the natural phenomena.

The research will focus on understanding the nonlinear and nonlocal phenomena
in swarming dynamics, and models having related structures in fluid mechanics.
Three different but related models will be investigated. The first model is the
Euler-Alignment system, which describes the flocking behavior in animal swarms.
The goal is to develop a robust toolbox to analyze the nonlocal alignment
operator and its balance with the drift nonlinearity. Similar behaviors are also
observed in other fluid equations including porous medium flow, and surface
quasi-geostrophic equations, which will be investigated using the same
analytical techniques. The second model is the 2D inviscid Boussinesq equations.
The global regularity is one of the outstanding problems in fluid dynamics. The
idea is to construct solutions to capture the possible singularity formation,
starting from some modified versions of the equations. The third model is the
kinetic swarming system. The aim is to investigate the important relation
between the kinetic equation and a variety of hydrodynamic limits. In
particular, different alignment operators will be considered at the kinetic
level. They are expected to lead to different macroscopic limits. All these
three sub-projects will advance the mathematical understanding of nonlocal PDEs
and related applications. They will also provide education and training to
graduate and undergraduate students in this active field.
