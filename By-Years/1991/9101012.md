Under this collaborative project between Thomas Carleson, University of Idaho,
and Xiao Jim, South China University of Technology, the corrosion inhibiting
properties of materials derived from plants which are indigenous only in Asia
will be investigated. The materials involved have been isolated by researchers
at South China University of Technology, and have proven to have significant
corrosion inhibition properties. Under this project, characterization of the
materials will occur at the University of Idaho, bringing expertise in
electrochemical engineering and access to characterization equipment to bear on
the question of how these materials inhibit corrosion. This collaboration may
lead to development of greatly improved corrosion inhibition agents from natural
materials, replacing more costly materials derived from petroleum. This project
is supported under the U.S.-China Cooperative Science Program.
