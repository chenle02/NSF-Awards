This three-year project will prepare 50 elementary teachers throughout North
Carolina to serve as leaders in mathematics instruction. Twenty- five teams of
two teachers each will participate in 2 three-week summer workshops focusing on
mathematics content, pedagogy, and curriculum. The instructors for the workshops
will be nationally known mathematics educators, and the topics will include
numeration and number theory, geometry, measurement, computation, probability
and statistics, and pre- algebra. Special attention will be paid to the National
Council for Teachers of Mathematics Standards, to problem-solving, and to
assessment. There will be additional short workshops during the academic year,
and the third summer will include a one-week workshop on leadership issues.
Participants will present inservice workshops in their own school systems during
the first two years of the project and, during the first two years of the
project and, during the third year, throughout the state. The state and the
local school districts are contributing as cost- sharing an amount equal to 73%
of the NSF award.
