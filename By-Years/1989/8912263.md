As more women move into administrative positions traditionally held by men, the
often resulting strains they encounter attract wider notice and research on the
reasons for greater or lesser strain becomes all the more important. This
research focuses on a case (female administrators in a religious denomination)
where many of the duties and expectations incumbent on those in administrative
positions are associated with the traditional prerogatives reserved to men. When
women step into such positions, even though a long-term labor shortage of
interested males makes that necessary, the strains in working relationships on
the job are apparently increased. This research will explore in depth the ways
these strains develop and the means developed to deal with them, using a
combination of observational and interviewing methods. The findings from this
research should offer insights into strains encountered as women enter other new
roles now open to them.
