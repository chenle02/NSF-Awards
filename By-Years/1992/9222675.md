This dissertation research project will enable the student researcher to
complete a dissertation which examines the intersections of feminist theory and
social studies of science as applied to research in biomechanics and related
fields. The proposed research is a study of the scientific and technical
practice of researchers in biomechanics and related fields. The study will focus
on practices in setting research priorities, modelling, and representation, and
how patterns of authority and the relations between gender and power affect
these practices. The project will bridge two gaps in contemporary science and
technology studies: (1) between formally sociological studies of laboratories
and institutions and culturally oriented studies of representations in science;
and (2) between feminist criticisms of science and theories of science,
technology and society. Particularly, the study will focus on (1) the
intersection of representations in scientific practice and larger cultural
metaphors of body as machine; (2) the practices, such as filtering, selection,
and ordering, that go into the measurement and mathematization of natural
objects; (3) the general organization of knowledge work in science and
engineering. This modest grant will allow the student to travel to several
initial and three new research sites in order to conduct the necessary
interviews and observations. The dissertation should be completed by December,
1993.
