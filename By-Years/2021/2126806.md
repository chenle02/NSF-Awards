This project will provide partial support for the International Symposium on
Lattice Field Theory. The symposium will be hosted by researchers at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and will be held virtually between June 26
and June 30, 2021. The International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory is an
important community forum with a scientific focus on numerical, and in
particular lattice methods, used to study the properties of strongly interacting
quantum systems. Particular emphasis will be placed on the study of Quantum
Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of the strong interactions in the Standard
Model of particle physics. The conference typically attracts 500+ participants
and offers opportunities to its participants for sharing scientific discoveries,
as well a robust educational program for graduate and junior postdoctoral
researchers, and public outreach events aimed at broadening participation in
physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
