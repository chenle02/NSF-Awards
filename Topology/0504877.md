Some of the topics that will be studied include: the topology of quasiconformal
deformation spaces, classification of projective structures, infinitely
generated Kleinian groups and new approaches to the density conjecture for
geometrically finite Kleinian groups.

A 3-manifold is a mathematical object of fundamental interest. For example the
space we live in is a 3-manifold. Most 3-manifolds are hyperbolic. That is they
have a metric of constant curvature equal to -1. In this project the principal
investigator will study 3-manifolds that carry whole families of hyperbolic
metrics. These deformation spaces have an extremely complicated structure that
resembles the more well known Mandelbrot set. The principal investigator will
also study complex projective structures on surfaces. Projective structures are
intimately related to hyperbolic 3-manifolds and results about one object often
lead to results about the other.
