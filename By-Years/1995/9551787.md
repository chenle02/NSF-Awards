The traditional introductory algebra-based physics course at the university
suffers from two major weaknesses: lack of proper connection between lecture and
laboratory and the poor math preparation of the students. The first problem is
being attacked by combining lecture and lab into a single 2-hour session, three
times a week. The second problem is aggravated by the fact that the traditional
course begins with mechanics, for which the requisite math includes vectors,
limits, derivatives, and integrals. This problem of math preparation is being
combatted by reordering the syllabus, putting optics and waves before mechanics
in the fall semester. A number of our traditional lab exercises are being
updated, and new labs in fiber-optic coupling, the optics of rainbows, and voice
transmission are being added in order to make this new beginning much more
exciting for the students.
