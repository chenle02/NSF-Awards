The objective of the project is to investigate the fundamental physical
mechanisms of substorms and associated particle entry by means of 3-D
electromagnetic particle simulations with time-varying solar wind parameters.
The 3-D EM particle simulations self-consistently include microscopic kinetic
effects and can thus provide insight into important basic problems such as
reconnection, tail current evolution and instabilities, and the spatial
development of the substorm.
