DePaul University, in partnership with Loyola University Chicago, the University
of Illinois Chicago and the Chicago Public School District (CPS), proposes a
project -- Accelerate ECS4ALL -- that will create a robust peer-coaching model
to support the growing number of novice Exploring Computer Science (ECS)
teachers in Chicago and across the country. Over the last few years, under the
Taste of Computing project and CPS' CS4All initiative, over 100 teachers have
participated in the ECS Professional Development, over 60% of CPS high schools
are now offering the ECS curriculum, and approximately 7,000 students are taking
the course each year. Of these students, 43% are female, 41% African American,
and 43% Hispanic, significantly increasing exposure to CS among traditionally
underrepresented populations. Peer coaching is needed now to sustain these
successes, ensuring that novice teachers are able to fully embrace the guided-
inquiry, equitable pedagogical approach of ECS and live it in their classrooms.

A Coach in Development Program will be developed and 15-20 experienced ECS
teachers will participate in the program before being deployed as peer coaches
in CPS high schools. They will, for example, observe classrooms through visits
and video recordings, and work with teachers on reflecting, planning, goal-
framing, and analysis of student work. The project will also support recruiting
efforts targeted at teachers and administrators to facilitate 100% enrollment of
CPS schools in CS4ALL.
