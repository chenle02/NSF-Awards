Reifsnyder 9320268 The Department of State will combine funding from the
National Science Foundation with funding from other Federal agencies in an
overall U.S. contribution to the 1993 activities of the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change (IPCC). This will support the work of the IPCC Secretariat to
produce the IPCC's Second Assessment Report (scheduled for publication in late
1995) and to support the participation of scientists from developing countries
in meetings of IPCC Working Groups and Subgroups which have been assigned
responsibilities for preparing inputs, especially on scientific issues, for the
Second Assess- ment Report. The Second Assessment Report will include three
focussed assessments. The first will address science as in the First Assessment.
However, the second will cover both impacts and response options (rather than
"strategies") and the third will address "cross-cutting economic and other
issues". The science assessment will address: carbon dioxide and the carbon
cycle; other greenhouse gases; aerosols; radiative forcing; and methodologies
for developing national inventories of net emissions.
