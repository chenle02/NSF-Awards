Wainger/Seeger DMS-9501040 The proposed research will deal with several problems
in classical analysis related to integral operators, Fourier integral operators,
averages over curves and surfaces, maximal functions, functions of the Laplacian
on Riemannian manifolds, and the interrelation between these topics.
Mathematical research in harmonic analysis seeks to study the fine structure of
mathematical functions and their underlying domains of definition. The tools
developed by this work bring out hidden relationships not ordinarily detected by
more classical methods.
