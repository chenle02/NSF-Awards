A grant has been awarded to Baruch College under the direction of Dr. Edward
Tucker for the acquisition of an inverted microscope and ancillary digital
imaging equipment, a micropipette puller, and a micromanipulator for a plant
microinjection/calcium imaging facility. Projects will include investigation of
the role of calcium in mitosis and as a second messenger in light and hormone
signaling. While microinjection and calcium imaging in animals is a routine
procedure, in plants these techniques require special technical skills. This
facility supported by this grant will be one of a few worldwide where moss cells
are microinjected. It will fulfill a demand for a facility where Baruch College
moss microinjection experiments can be carried out, and where collaborators from
around the world can be trained in moss transformation and microinjection.
