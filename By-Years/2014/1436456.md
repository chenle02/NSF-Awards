This dissertation examines whether host country immigration policies shape the
discourses and organizational alliances of worldwide advocacy groups. The
project analyses the case of specific diaspora in Western Europe and the United
States. Drawing on internet documents, website hyperlinks and social media
affiliations, it uses cross-national comparison to examine: (1) the effects of
host country immigration policies on the discourses and network structure of
diaspora advocacy organizations; (2) the social media affiliations with these
discourses among the host country diaspora population; and (3) the ethnic
identities and participation of diaspora activists in these host countries.

This study analyzes over four thousand active websites associated with diasporic
advocacy in two dozen countries. Comparative analysis examines how host country
immigration policies shape the prevalence of these different discourses (e.g.
ethnic autonomy and separatism), the affiliation rates among the host country
population and the network structure of hyperlinks among websites that indicate
alliances and divides among these advocacy groups. Finally, we examine whether
these organizational patterns are linked to rates of violence by and against
diaspora in these countries. This research has implications for theoretical
development and use by stakeholders relative to similar cases.
