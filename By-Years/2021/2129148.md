The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses poor long-term public health outcomes
stemming from lifestyle choices through an intuitive and effective tool to
analyze and optimize their sleep, exercise, nutrition, and mental health. The
technology will guide users through an individualized health and well-being
analysis based on real-time data that presents an individualized baseline and
heat map that helps individuals determine which lifestyle behaviors are most
beneficial or detrimental towards their holistic health. This personalized
approach seeks to establish new habits, interventions, medications, diets, etc.
This tool may help people to live longer and more fulfilled lives with fewer
health concerns and costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project determines the viability of objective
measurement of health metrics (heart rate, blood pressure, sleep cycles, and
exercise) through the integration of already-existent technologies including,
but not limited to, wearables and “smart” technologies such as Smart Scales and
Smart Blood Pressure cuffs. Additionally, this project will determine the
viability of using subjective inputs surrounding diet, mood, and exercise and
the ability to draw meaningful correlations between both subjective and
objective inputs. This project will develop and validate methods to integrate
these two data streams into a health scoring system that may be used to improve
physical and mental health and fitness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
