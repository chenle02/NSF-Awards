The program will bring together two exciting, but previously separate,
approaches to the study of environmental biology: modeling and experimental
investigation of processes, versus the analysis of spatial pattern. The first
approach (strongly represented among UCSB's biologists) seeks to understand the
dynamics of ecological systems by analyzing the mechanisms that determine the
dynamics of populations, communities and ecosystems. The second approach is well
represented among geographers at UCSB and involves an impressive range of
techniques aimed at analyzing pattern over a very large range of spatial scales.
We propose a program involving which takes advantage of the potentially strong
synergism among quantitative geography, and experimental and theoretical
ecology. The program involves (a) new cross-disciplinary courses, (b) mechanisms
and funding for students to gain industrial experience, and (c) opportunities
for thesis research in collaboration with off-campus organizations. Matching
funds have been offered from industry and from a state-funded program in
toxicology. To promote greater minority student enrollment in the program, we
propose a consortial relationship between UCSB and California State University,
Los Angeles (CSULA), a designated Minority Undergraduate Institution that grants
Bachelor's and Master's degrees, but not the PhD degree. Our efforts will focus
on students in CSULA's Environmental Research and Education Center, whose acting
head is an accomplished ecologist with expertise in the research theme we
propose, and with experience in developing minority student research groups.
