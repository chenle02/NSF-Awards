Students are using a new laboratory equipped with Macintosh IIcx and Everex 3000
computers in sophomore level courses required of mathematics majors. The
computer experience in a team project setting is providing valuable training for
majors and is expected to attract more able and inquisitive students into
mathematics. The institution will contribute an amount equal to the award.//
