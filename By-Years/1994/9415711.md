This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research in
condensed matter physics between Ivan K. Schuller of the University o California
San Diego, and Alain Gilabert of the University of Nice. The objective of their
research is to investigate the properties of superconducting layers with an
insulating layer between them. They will study the coupling of vortices, using
an intervening medium, in order to develop and characterize new superconding
devices. The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration his expertise in
sample preparation and growth and characterization of high quality multilayer
superconducting and magnetic materials. This is complemented by the French
investigator's abilities in theory and experiment. The calculations for the
devices and the testing of the new material will occur in France. Studies of
superconducting vortices are important to both basic and applied research. This
will advance our knowledge of a novel state of matter and could lead to improved
performance of superconducting devices in a magnetic field.
