This is a no-cost award to Dr. Alan Chave of the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution to support a U.S.-Japan Cooperative Research Project with Professor
Junzo Kasahara of the University of Tokyo. The project allows Japanese
scientists to participate in work on an extensive submarine cable system
covering the North Pacific. One segment of the Trans Pacific-1 (TPC-1) running
from Guam to Japan is currently in scientific powered service, and is under
joint U.S.-Japanese ownership. It is anticipated that the remainder of TPC-1
extending to Hawaii as well as two cables stretching from Hawaii to the mainland
United States will be used for passive monitoring of the geoelectric field in
the near future.
