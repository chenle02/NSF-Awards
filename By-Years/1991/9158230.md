This award provides support for Dr. Bernard Bauer through the National Science
Foundation's Presidential Young Investigator Program. The objective of this
program is to provide research support for some of the nation's most outstanding
and promising young science and engineering faculty members. The awards are
intended to improve the capability of U.S. academic institutions to respond to
the demand for highly qualified scientists and engineers for academic and
industrial research and teaching. This award will allow Dr. Bauer to continue
his research in geomorphic processes, especially the mechanisms by which fluids
sculpt landforms. The investigator has been a leader in adapting models and
analytic techniques originally developed in coastal studies for use in analyses
of streams. He will continue this synthetic research through detailed
explorations of the influence of wave-like fluid oscillations within streams on
stream banks, expanding on the unidirectional flow models that currently form
the basis for most models of channel morphology. This research will include a
series of experimental and empirical analyses that focus on application to
stream-channel erosion and deposition of beach-equilibrium models, which include
measurements of wave height, steepness, skewness, and orbital velocity. Time-
series analyses of data gathered by electromagnetic current meters and
submersible pressure sensors will provide more accurate estimates of the
relative significance of oscillatory motions and unidirectional flows on stream-
channel erosion and deposition. In addition to enhancing general understandings
of fluid dynamics and channel morphology, this research will provide practical
information for analyses of the differential impacts of alternate discharge
regimes when stream flow is regulated by dams or other flow-control structures.
