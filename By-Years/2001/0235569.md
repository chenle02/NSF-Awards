The brain underlies the ability to perceive, process and retain information and
to formulate novel outputs and behaviors. How neuronal circuits of the brain
develop is of considerable interest and importance. During the development of
the nervous system, the axon's growing tip, the growth cone, steers the axon
over long distances to form the basic outlines of a neural circuit. A next
essential step is for the axon terminus to make a transition from a growth cone
suited for navigation to a synaptic terminal designed for neuron to neuron
signaling in a neural circuit. Little is known about this step in development.
In the developing visual system of the fruitfully, Drosophila melanogaster, the
axon termini of photoreceptor neurons switch from growth cones to synaptic
terminals. An essential signal for this switch appears to be provided by local
glial cells that the growth cones first interact with when arriving in the
brain. This signal turns on the expression of a protein that controls that
activity of the photoreceptor synapse in neuron-to-neuron communication. A goal
of this proposal is to understand the mechanism of this novel control of
synaptic protein expression by glial cells, and more broadly, the mechanisms by
which glia control the transition of a growth cone to a synaptic terminal. This
work will increase our understanding of the development of neural circuits and
the regulation of their activity. This project will be performed as a
collaborative effort between the laboratory and a local high school science
class. The laboratory will build on existing high school science outreach
programs to establish a collaborative relationship. Through lectures, group
meetings, workshops and summer internships, students will be directly involved
in the progress of the research project. This will be a most effective way to
translate scientific research at the university level into broader science
literacy, and an understanding of science in terms of method and
career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
