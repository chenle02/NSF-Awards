9632686 Davis In this project, the PI will oversee the organization of a
workshop to address the future of climate-related physical oceanographic
research. The ocean's role in climate has been a central theme in the World
Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE), and is expected to be a crucial ingredient
of a major international effort to study Climate Variability (CLIVAR). To date,
planning for CLIVAR has been complex and multi-disciplinary, with three
manageable subprograms emerging, focusing, respectively, on seasonal to
interannual time scales, decadal to centennial time scales, and anthropogenic
climate change. This workshop will complement the separate-timescale,
multidisciplinary international planning with an oceanographic program, Ocean
CLIVAR, that spans all three components. The objectives are to engage a broad
segment of the community to identify the key oceanographic questions that need
to be answered to meet the objectives of the multi-disciplinary science plan for
CLIVAR, and to develop an implementation plan to answer these questions. A
single workshop, with three subgroups focused on sustained observations,
modeling, and process studies will be convened. A report will be produced for
community comment and to provide input for a U.S. contribution to the
international CLIVAR workshops, the first of which is scheduled for September,
1996. After completion of the international planning effort, an implementation
plan for Ocean CLIVAR will be developed. ***
