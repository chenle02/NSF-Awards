Fagin The objectives of this research are: 1. a quantitative analysis of the
computational requirements of multimedia, and 2. the development of new system
architectures based on this analysis. The methods to be employed are: 1.
Performance analysis of multimedia applications on a 100 Mb/s fiber optic
network of workstations, 2. Performance comparisons of solid-state and
conventional disk storage in client-server networked video applications, 3.
Computational profiling of existing standard multimedia algorithms, 4. The
evaluation of prototype designs using FPGA (field- programmable gate array)
emulation, and 5. The construction and evaluation of complete board-level
systems at the Thayer Rapid Prototyping Facility.
