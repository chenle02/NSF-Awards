To restore a valuable instrumental resource for X-ray data collection required
for three-dimensional crystal structure determination to "state-of-the-art"
status, it is proposed to upgrade an existing, single area detector system to
the conventional dual-detector configuration with motorized detector goniometry,
and to provide instrumentation for data collection at cryogenic temperatures.
These modifications to the facility will greatly enhance its use in a broad
spectrum of projects in the area of protein structure-function relationships,
including structure determinations and analyses of enzymes involved in protein
synthesis (translation) and intermediary metabolism, the mechanism of
cooperativity in hemoglobin, gene products from the AIDS virus, and respiratory
oxygen transport.
