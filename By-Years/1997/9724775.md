INT 9724775 Berry This is a cooperative research project between Prof. James
Berry, Department of Biological Sciences, State University of New York at
Buffalo, and Dr. William C. Taylor, Division of Plant Industry, CSIRO, Canberra,
Australia. Also included in the project is Ms. Amy C. Corey, graduate student
working with Professor Berry. The senior investigators share complementary
knowledge and research experience in different C4 plants. The unique
photosynthetic qualities of C4 plants make them an important object of study.
The investigators will analyze amaranath transcriptional and post-transcription
reporter gene constructs in transgenic Flaveria bidentis, a transformable C4
transformation system. This will provide new information about processes which
regulate cell type-specific and light mediated gene expression, and aid in the
further development of amaranth for agriculture and industry.
