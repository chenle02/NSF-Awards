The research will contribute to our knowledge and understanding of heat transfer
in a decomposing material in several ways: First, an analytical model will be
formulated and applied to study the effects of certain key properties such as
thermochemical expansion, porosity, permeability, etc. The experimental portion
of the work will lead to empirical relations for the expansion, porosity, pore
surface area, and permeability as a function of the stage of thermal
decomposition. The materials used in the study include some that are currently
employed in engineering practice, so that the benefits of the research should be
immediate.
