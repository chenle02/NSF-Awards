The purpose of this project is to improve understanding of the basic science of
turbulence in a plasma. Turbulence is the complex dynamics of a fluid or gas
resulting from nonlinear forces that span a wide range of scales in space and
time. Many important effects emerge from turbulence, such as mixing and rapid
transport of heat and energy; this influences terrestrial fluids as well as
electrically conducting gases, or plasmas, in space and on the sun. Turbulence
is usually not uniform in space â€“ it tends to quickly self-organize into
irregularly shaped "cells." Inside these cells the plasma is typically
quiescent, but the thin boundaries between cells are highly active with
sometimes explosive results. Processes causing this self-organization and
formation of the cell boundaries are studied in this project. This effort will
support a post-doctoral researcher and advance understanding of many observed
space plasma phenomena, including solar flares and variability of turbulence in
the solar wind, thus contributing to the science underlying space
weather.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Relaxation processes, turbulence cascade and
dissipation mechanisms are each an important area of study in plasma physics and
its applications. However these are most frequently studied separately. The
fundamental hypothesis advanced in this project is that the nature of the
intermittent cascade, and the dissipation that it leads to, are strongly
influenced by specific relaxation processes that originate at the energy
containing scales. In particular, local relaxation leads to spatial
cellularization, and the associated spatial nonuniformity controls the formation
of coherent structures, where dissipation is expected to be greatly enhanced.
This has been studied, although incompletely, in fluid plasma models such as
magnetohydrodynamics, but is poorly understood in fully kinetic plasma models to
be considered within this project. Establishing such fundamental connections as
parameters are changed to vary among modes of relaxation will advance
understanding of fundamental plasma physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
