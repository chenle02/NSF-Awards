Case Western Reserve University has been awarded a grant to hold a workshop from
September 28th-October 3rd, 2003 on the Island of Santorini in Greece with the
aim of bringing together a very broad group of researchers to integrate their
very disparate data sets to solve some very basic and fundamental problems in
biology. Specifically, the main focus will be resolving a model for looking at
the multidimensional nature of protein function in time, space and context. A
large part of this involves specifically determining how to combine disparate
sets of data on sequence, structure, pathways, networks and function. The
conference will include many young and early career researchers.
