Four to six experiments in Computational Physics will be added to a senior
physics laboratory. Students will be spared the task of writing computer
programs. Instead, commercial software will be used as primary tools. The
inclusion of the studies of chaos in non-linear dynamics, orbit simulation of
spacecraft under the influence of both the earth and the moon, etc will enrich
the experience of the students and acquaint them with a practical approach to
"real world" problems.
