This proposal requests funding to initiate a fall term REU site in the various
disciplines of coastal marine sciences at the Dauphin Island Sea Lab, Alabama.
Seven undergraduates with career interests in coastal marine sciences are to be
recruited each year to conduct research at the Dauphin Island Sea Lab. Each
student is paired with a research scientist or faculty advisor, chosen to
reflect the student's interests and background. The program cmnsists of a
variety of scientific lectures, discussion groups, and a cruise with the
intention of providing students a broad research experience.
