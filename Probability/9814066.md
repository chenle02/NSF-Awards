9814066 Pinsky This award provides support for a workshop on mathematical
finance. The workshop will be held in conjunction with the Twentieth Midwest
Probability Colloquium. The Colloquium attracts 75-100 researchers in
mathematical probability theory, mostly from the universities in the greater
midwest area but also from more distant locations. This workshop will provide
researchers in probability with the opportunity to learn more about its
applications to mathematical finance. NSF funds will be used primarily for
travel support with emphasis placed on encouraging attendance by junior
researchers and members of underrepresented groups.
