Dynamics originated in physics to model movement of particles in a space in
continuous or discrete time. Abstract topological dynamics extends the notion of
time from the groups of real numbers and integers to arbitrary, possibly
infinite-dimensional, topological groups, and restricts the space to be bounded
and to contain all its limit points. Abstract topological dynamics encompasses
methods from and applications into numerous areas of mathematics. This project
mainly investigates its intimate relationship with combinatorics, in particular,
Ramsey theory. Every topological group admits a natural representation as a
group of symmetries of some mathematical structure. It turns out that wild
dynamical behaviour of the group corresponds to chaotic behaviour of the
corresponding structure, that is, lack of Ramsey phenomena, and tamer dynamical
behaviour corresponds to a bounded number of patterns approximating the
undelying structure. This relationship is a rich source of questions both on the
level of general theory and concrete examples. The intent of the project is to
address both hand in hand while isolating instances suitable for undergraduate
and graduate research.

To a great extent, dynamical behaviour of a topological group can be read from
its minimal flows, in particular from the projectively largest one, the
universal minimal flow. It has previously been studied by functional analytical
means, whereas the PI developed a dual approach via ultrafilters, for groups of
automorphisms of discrete structure, and more generally near ultrafilters for
general topological groups. The corresponding Ramsey phenomena have a direct
translation into the ultrafilter language as well and clarify the connection
between dynamics and combinatorics. The goal is to continue studying universal
minimal flows via (near) ultrafilters in general, such as what topological
spaces can be the universal minimal flows, as well as concrete examples of
groups and underlying structures that lead the direction of the theory, for
example, whether groups of automorphisms of discrete structures exhibit all
possible dynamical behaviour, or whether metric structure (allowing for small
error) bring in new phenomena.
