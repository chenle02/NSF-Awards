This project will develop an original latent variable estimator to scale Supreme
Court opinions in a "case space." Systematic study of the determinants and
consequences of judicially-created policy have been hampered by the lack of
systematic, quantitative measures of legal doctrine. The project will develop a
theoretical model of the location of cases and opinions in an underlying "case
space" as a function of citations to past cases. Taking advantage of the common
law method used in American jurisprudence, the factual components of cases and
the legal components of the various opinions written in the course of disposing
of the cases will be systematically estimated. Original data will be collected
on factual and legal links - citations - among cases to which the estimator will
be applied. The method and data will allow scholars to better address the
theoretical questions that dominate the literature. For example, the method will
allow for new tests of theories of bargaining on collegial courts, theories of
the influence of extra-judicial actors on the creation of legal policy, and
theories of the effects of Supreme Court appointments.

The project will have broad implications for the study of democratic political
institutions. First and most directly, the research will shed light onto the
systematic patterns in judicial policy making by providing a quantitative
measure of judicial policy. Second, the project will allow future researchers to
answer many of the outstanding questions about the constraints under which
courts decide cases and the path along which the law develops. For example, a
significant question in political science concerns the extent to which judicial
decisions are effective protections for minority rights and the extent to which
the courts are constrained by majoritarian politics. With a systematic measure
of the policies created by judicial opinions, better assessments can be made of
how judges shape the law and the extent to which lower courts and extra-judicial
officials comply with the courts' decisions. It also will be possible to gain
better insight into the forces that drive judicial policy.
