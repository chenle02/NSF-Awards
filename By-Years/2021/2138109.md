Heath LeFevre is awarded an NSF Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending
Postdoctoral Research Fellowship to conduct a program of research and education
at the University of Michigan – Ann Arbor. LeFevre will study High-Energy
Density (HED) plasmas at the Omega and Omega EP laser facilities at the
University of Rochester. The project aims to understand and measure coupling
between intense electromagnetic radiation and an HED plasma, a plasma with
particularly high particle density and temperature. The regime where effects of
strong coupling on emission and absorption of radiation in HED plasmas is not
well studied and is important to the physics of white dwarf stars and type Ia
supernova, as well as for inertial confinement fusion plasmas. Along with the
research, LeFevre will conduct outreach, recruiting, and mentoring efforts aimed
at increasing the diversity of students studying plasma physics.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study explores strongly coupled, radiation flux
dominated plasmas, which are relevant to inertial confinement fusion, white
dwarf stars, and type Ia supernova. This is a physics regime that is difficult
to model and therefore the experimental results to be obtained at the University
of Rochester’s high energy laser facilities are of fundamental interest to
astrophysics and HED science research. Comparing results of these experiments
with available radiation hydrodynamics, atomic kinetics, and radiation transport
codes will quantify the effects of radiation coupling in these plasmas. This
study will be able to eliminate common sources of uncertainty and error in HED
physics models due to its use of multiple facilities and experimental
conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
