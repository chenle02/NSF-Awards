This award will provide support for participants, especially women, graduate
students, postdocs, and young faculty, in the third "Pingree Park Dynamics
Workshop" that will be held at the Pingree Park campus of Colorado State
University from August 2-7, 2010.

This conference, the subject matter of which falls under the general heading of
topological, measure-theoretic, and smooth dynamical systems, will focus on
three principal themes: (1) orbit equivalence theory, (2) descriptive set theory
as it relates to dynamical systems, and (3) smooth ergodic theory. All three
represent extremely active areas of current dynamical systems research. The
format of the workshop is such that young people will have ample opportunities
to speak and otherwise be engaged in the various conference activities.
