This project will attempt to develop more advanced designs for artifical neural
networks which can learn from experience how to predict of filter streams of
inputs over time. The work will build upon novel designs developed under a
previous NSF grant, which are being tested in applications such as blind
deconvolution and interference cancelling in nonstationary communication
channels (e.g., making cellular phones work better), identification and control
of nonlinear plants, prediction of financial time-series and classification of
time varying patterns such as speech recognition and transient signal processing
(radar, sonar, biological). The basic approach will be to deepen the theoretical
understanding of the limitations of the existing designs in these applications,
and to develop new general-purpose designs--rooted in an exploration of basic
theory--to overcome these limitations. Among the theoretical issues given
priority are the problem of mixing discrete and continuous variables in the
context, the problem of time-warping (e.g. different speakers speaking at
different speeds), and the problems of robustness over time.
