Accurate weather forecasting in the vicinity of major mountain ranges is an
extremely difficult meteorological problem. Interactions between large-scale
weather systems and mountainous regions often spawn complex mesoscale weather
patterns. Efforts to forecast the development of these weather patterns are
limited by deficiencies in understanding of the physical processes governing
mesoscale circulations in complex terrain. Additionally, mesoscale orographic
effects also influence the global circulation through the action of "gravity
wave drag". Errors in the parameterization of gravity-wave drag in global- scale
models are believed to be a major source of error in extended range forecasts.
Under previous support from the National Science Foundation, the Principal
Investigator has studied airflow over mountains with the immediate goal of
extending understanding of the dynamics of orographically generated mesoscale
disturbances and the interaction between these disturbances and the large
synoptic-scale flow. He proposes to use a combination of theory, numerical
models and observations to continue this line of research. The ultimate goal is
to increase fundamental understanding leading to improved weather forecasts and
climate models by developing a more accurate parameterization of gravity- wave
drag.//
