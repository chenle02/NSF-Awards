This proposal is for continued NSF support of a well-established series of
summer workshops in Geometric Topology. Specifically, the proposal requests
support for the 24th 25th and 26th Annual Workshops in Geometric Topology to be
held in the summers of 2007, 2008 and 2009. The workshops will be advertised
nationally with NSF funding primarily used to support the travel of active
research mathematicians without current NSF support and graduate students
working in geometric topology. Each of the colleges and universities involved
with hosting a workshop has pledged additional funds that will be used, among
other things, to cover all costs of the principal speakers. The 2007 workshop
will be held in Grand Rapids, Michigan on June 28-30, with Calvin College
serving as host. Ian Agol of the University of Illinois at Chicago has agreed to
be the principal speaker. The 2008 workshop will be hosted by Brigham Young
University, and the 2009 workshop will be held in Milwaukee with the University
of Wisconsin-Milwaukee hosting.
