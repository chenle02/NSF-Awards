9415898 Giese This is a numerical study of mesoscale eddies that occasionally
(but regularly) develop in the eastern tropical North Pacific, which can be
detected in TOPEX altimeter data. Three generation mechanisms for these eddies
will be investigated: (1) the intense, primarily wintertime, wind events that
blow at near-hurricane strength from the Atlantic to the Pacific through
mountain passes; (2) instabilities of the equatorial currents; and, (3) a
seasonally modulated instability at the eastern end of the North Equatorial
Counter Current. These process-oriented numerical studies will be carried out
using two models, the reduced gravity model of Chang and the GFDL Modular Ocean
Model (MOM). ***
