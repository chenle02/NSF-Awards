Testing behavioral evolution in response to ecological change in the village
weaverbird (Ploceus cucullatus).&lt;br/&gt;PI: Prof. Robert B.
Payne&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: David C. Lahti&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Behavior can evolve
by natural selection, but testing this in wild populations is often difficult or
impossible. The village weaverbird Ploceus cucullatus is a choice candidate for
such a test, because historical events have fortuitously set the stage for an
effective experiment. In the village weaverbird's home range in Africa, the
diederik cuckoo Chrysococcyx caprius lays its eggs in weaverbirds' nests ("brood
parasitism"). A hatched cuckoo promptly removes the weaverbird eggs or young
from the nest. In 1999 and 2000, Lahti found that village weaverbirds throughout
Africa eject from their nests eggs that are dissimilar from their own in color
and spotting pattern, a behavior which is an effective defense against cuckoo
parasitism. Their discrimination ability is finely tuned, which is necessary
because the diederik cuckoo eggs mimic the appearance of weaverbird eggs.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Humans introduced the village weaverbird from Africa into
two islands where parasitic cuckoos do not exist: Mauritius, in the Indian
Ocean, a century ago, and Hispaniola, in the Caribbean, about two centuries ago.
Today there are large populations of the weaverbird in both places. Lahti will
test quantitatively whether the weaverbirds' ability to discriminate against
dissimilar eggs has declined in these two populations by "playing the cuckoo"
and experimentally placing eggs into their nests. This experiment effectively
imitates the environmental dangers of the weaverbirds' home range in a place
where those dangers don't exist anymore. In this way the researchers can
determine whether and to what extent the behaviors that evolved as a defense
against those dangers have declined, since they are no longer
needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
