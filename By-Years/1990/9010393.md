Most engineering mathematics is appropriate for representing a single object
under a single operating condition. Mechanical designers, however, must reason
simultaneously about many design possibilities; that is, sets of objects under
sets of operating conditions. Previous work has produced a formalism for
performing such inferences, called the labeled interval calculus. This formalism
has been empirically validated in a mechanical design compiler, a program which
for a wide range of design problems accepts mechanical schematics,
specifications, and utility functions, and returns catalog numbers for optimal
implementations. However, the tested version of the calculus is relatively
complex, and has been only partially analyzed mathematically. The researcher
seeks to simplify the calculus, develop precise definitions for all its terms
and proofs for all its inferences, and clarify a number of issues surrounding
it. This will enable the development of more powerful and reliable compilers, as
well as furthering the basic understanding of design reasoning.
