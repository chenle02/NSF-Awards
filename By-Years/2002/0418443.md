The sharp decline in fertility in many of the world's wealthier countries in
recent years has led to reproduction rates that are so low that, in the absence
of massive in-migration, they threaten to dramatically reduce national
populations and to lead to severe demographic imbalances. These in turn have
major economic implications, not least the prospect of a rapidly aging
population in which a smaller and smaller proportion of the population is of
working age. This project examines one of the most extreme instances of
contemporary fertility decline, the case of Italy, by employing an innovative
approach bringing together anthropologists, sociologists, and demographers. The
Italian case is particularly instructive because it appears to contradict
current theories of the conditions that promote very low fertility. These tend
to attribute very low fertility either to the impact of women working outside
the home (yet in Italy rates of women's work outside the home remain relatively
low) or to changes in values away from those centered on the family (yet Italy
is by all accounts one of the most heavily family-centered societies in the
west). Fieldwork is to be conducted in four Italian cities spread throughout the
country, combining participant observation and interviewing, aimed at shedding
light on how fertility decisions are currently being made. At the same time,
major national Italian social surveys are to be examined to test existing
theories and to help formulate a better understanding of the forces that lead to
very low fertility.

The broader impact of this new knowledge will be to inform citizens and
governments of the circumstances in which the world's wealthier countries
experience fertility so low that it produces a major economic threat to national
well-being. Governments have, with mixed success, sought measures to ensure that
fertility remains high enough to prevent such population decline. This project
will help identify what approaches are likely to be most successful in
preventing population decline.
