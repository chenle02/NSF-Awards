This award provides support for the Modern Mathematics Workshop, which will be
held in conjunction with the 2010 SACNAS National Conference in Anaheim,
California, on September 29-30, 2010. The award provides partial support of
faculty and post-docs to participate in a two-day workshop which describes the
mathematical underpinning of the upcoming 2011-2012 year programs at a
consortium of US- based Mathematics Institutes. The American Institute of
Mathematics (AIM), the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications (IMA), the
Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM), the Mathematical Biosciences
Institute (MBI), the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI), the Park
City Mathematics Institute (PCMI), and the Statistical and Applied Mathematical
Sciences Institute (SAMSI) have all agreed to host the two-day workshop. By
joining together, they aim to make the Workshop attendees feel welcome to
participate in their programs, and become familiar with all the opportunities
that the Mathematics Institutes offer.

The Workshop will also feature a speaker who will address the underrepresented
minority undergraduates in a three-hour mini-course. The speaker will encourage
students to see the various ways in which mathematics acts as the glue among the
STEM sciences.
