James Collman of Stanford University is supported by the Inorganic,
Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program for research on redox
reactions (involving both electron- and atom-transfer mechanisms) of transition-
metal poryphrin complexes. Interest will be centered on redox reactions
involving more than one electron. Investigations of reductions of dioxygen by
dinuclear porphrin complexes involving two dissimilar metals will be continued.
Four-electron oxidations of organic complexes by chlorite ion, catalyzed by
porphrin complexes will be studied, as well as related electrochemical
reactions. Hetrometallic dinuclear porphrin (and related) complexes of second
and third row transition elements will be prepared and characterized by several
methods in order to ellucidate novel types of metal-metal multiple
bond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oxidation-reduction reactions involving the transfer
of several electrons from reductant to oxidant are not rare in nature or in
technological applications, but such reactions have been studied relatively
infrequently. Building on achievements of the prior period of NSF support, the
PI has identified several diverse types of multi-equivalent redox reactions, all
of which involve transition metal porphrin complexes as catalysts or reactants.
There is a strong probability that increased understanding of such multi-
electron redox reactions will have important technological and scientific
applications. Four-electron oxidations by chlorite ion, to be studied in this
program, are regarded as especially promising.
