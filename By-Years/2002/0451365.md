This SGER award will fund a young investigator as she works to develop a richer
model of mechanism design. This branch of economic theory has multiple
applications in labor economics, industrial economics, and public economics. Her
goal is to introduce a new element into the theory; she will build and analyze a
model in which a principal specifies a payment rule for several agents, but
retains the ability to change the payment rule at a later date.

The award will fund the PI as she works to determine if the basic research
approach is sound. Introducing non-commitment into multi-agent mechanism design
should have important implications for how to otpimally design auctions, how to
design efficient payment and promotion schemes, and how to develop a system of
sanctions and rewards to achieve desired public policy outcomes.
