9627196 LaBar Explorations is an 8,200 sq. ft. permanent exhibition containing
about 70 educational components that will stimulate interest in and
understanding of the ways that science and technology are extending the ability
to examine and understand the Earth, its oceans and the universe. The exhibit
design gives equal priority to science content and learning via high-tech device
components, interweaving experiences to help the public understand cutting edge
technologies, the scientific principles behind them, and how technology is used
to advance scientific knowledge. To ensure accessibility to the Hispanic
community, graphics and multimedia programs will be presented in English and
Spanish. Strategies for addressing the language needs of other non-English
speaking visitors are employed. It is expected that the engineering designs and
solutions developed for these exhibits will advance the informal science
learning profession buy contributing significantly to one of the top challenges
faced by science museum exhibit designers today - the interpretation of advanced
technological tools and capabilities to a broad museum public with diverse
technical literacy skills.
