With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and
support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor
Miroslav Peric from California State University Northridge and colleagues Radha
Ranganathan and Jussi Eloranta have acquired an X-band electron paramagnetic
resonance (EPR) spectrometer. This instrument will allow research in a variety
of fields such as those that provide insight on how biologically relevant
species behave as well as advance environmental studies. In general, an EPR
spectrometer yields detailed information on the geometric and electronic
structure of molecular and solid state materials. It is also used to obtain
information about the lifetimes of free radicals, short-lived, highly reactive
species involved in valuable chemical transformations as well as the initiation
of pathological tumor growth. These studies impact a number of areas, from the
synthesis of inorganic and organic molecules to the development of new solid
state materials to compounds of magnetic and biological interest. Employing
examples inspired from ongoing research, this instrument is an integral part of
research and teaching at California State University Northridge. The instrument
provides students with outstanding practical experience in modern
instrumentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is aimed at enhancing research
and education at all levels, especially in areas such as studying (a)
translational and rotational diffusion of spin nitroxide probes in protein-
phospholipid aggregates and ionic liquids; (b) mechanistic and kinetic studies
of radical intermediates in wastewater treatment; (c) physicochemical
characterization of molecular aggregates; (d) electron rich aromatic and diene
interactions with electron-poor imidazolium compounds; (e) bimolecular
collisions in low-viscosity liquids and (f) solute jump diffusion in supercooled
water.
