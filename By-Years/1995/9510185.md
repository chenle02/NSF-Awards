9510185 Belitz The objective of this project is to enhance the current
understanding of condensed matter systems that are subject to quenched disorder.
Specific systems to be studied include quantum ferromagnets, magnets in random
fields, disordered superconductors, and doped semiconductors, as well as other
systems that undergo a metal-insulator transition. The methods that he uses
include the construction of effective field theories, renormalization group
techniques, and many-body perturbation theory. A successful completion of the
project will contribute to the understanding of an important area of condensed
matter physics and will train technical personnel with expertise in this field.
%%% The project deals with a variety of materials, such as those with a
transition between metallic and insulating phase. Such materials have frozen
into them defects of some type that will make the material insulating if their
presence is sufficiently strong. Examples include magnets, superconductors,
semiconductors, and metals, each with one or more special type of defects.
Often, defects are intentionally introduced into materials to give them desired
properties. The PI will use state-of-the-art theoretical methods to study such
phenomena. The PI carries on a fruitful collaboration with T. R. Kirkpatrick
from the University of Maryland. ***
