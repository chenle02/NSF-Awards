9310687 Roman A major goal of the U.S. JGOFS Arabian Sea Process Study is to
examine the role of this region in global biogeochemical fluxes, particularly in
sequestering carbon below the pycnocline. Mesozooplankton are important in this
process because they consume suspended material and facilitate its removal from
surface waters by the production of rapidly sinking (&gt; 200 m d-1) fecal
pellets. Because of this enhancement of the vertical flux of biogenic material,
mesozooplankton research is a "core" area of JGOFS. Dr. Roman will conduct
measurements of mesozooplankton biomass, grazing and fecal pellet production in
the Arabian Sea Program. The research goal is to determine the role of
mesozooplankton in biogenic flux in the Arabian Sea. The research objectives are
to: (1) estimate the biomass (C, N) of different size classes of mesozooplankton
(64-2000 um) in the Arabian Sea and to determine how this biomass is vertically
and horizontally distributed; (2) estimate the consumption of photosynthetically
fixed carbon by different size classes of mesozooplankton; (3) estimate the
consumption of heterotrophic carbon (ciliates and flagellates) by different size
classes of mesozooplankton; (4) estimate the potential rates of carbon and
nitrogen export in the form of fecal pellets by different size classes of
mesozooplankton; (5) determine the effect of suboxic waters on mesozooplankton
biomass and grazing.
