The proposal requests funds to purchase a Beckman ultracentrifuge. The
instrument will greatly benefit the research of six young members of the Biology
Departament at West Virginia University who are engaged in a variety of
molecular biological studies. Studies include: examination of the formation of
3-methyladenine in DNA and its repair at a biochemical and molecular level
including isolation of the gene for the repair enzyme 3MA-DNA glycosylase;
molecular analysis of the structure and regulation of the Drosophila gene
cubitus interruptus with the long-term goal of understanding the nature of
heterochromatin and euchromatin; molecular analysis of a developmentally
regulated actin gene in the sea urchin as a means of understanding temporal and
spatial gene regulation during development; characterization of the pheromones
involved in sexual differentiation and mutational and subsequent molecular
analysis of the genes involved in sexual development of the fungus Phycomyces
blakesleeanus; molecular analysis of the turtle delta-crystallin and tau-
crystallin genes with the goal of understanding how these proteins are produced
in such large quantities during lens differentiation; and investigation of
glycosyltransferase activity in cell membranes from cultured human colonic
epithelial cells and analysis of the mRNA population from colon tissue. Support
is strongly recommended.
