9727644 Strickland The Atlanta Urban Systemic Initiative (AUSI) proposes to
aggressively advance the educational system in mathematics science and
technology for all its students. The AUSI will accomplish this task through a
strategic plan adopted by the Atlanta Board of Education (ABE). The new
strategic plan includes provisions to provide all K-12 teachers of mathematics
and science with the knowledge, skills, curriculum, assessment, equipment, and
materials necessary to implement a standards-based mathematics and science
program for all students. Administrators, instructional specialists, counselors,
and paraprofessionals will be included in professional development activities to
ensure implementation of a standards-based approach to the teaching and learning
of mathematics and science. To facilitate this change district-wide policies
have been adopted to support reform activities. The ABE has reallocated
significant funding to support the integration of technology into the teaching
and learning of mathematics and science. Special efforts have also been
undertaken to garner and maintain support from the community to promote
educational reform and help sustain support and enrichment for all students. To
accomplish the goals of the new strategic plan, the AUSI will provide all APS
students with the fundamentals of mathematics and science so that their
understanding, ability, and academic achievement enables them to perform at or
above their peers from around the world while experiencing success in the 21st
century. Five objectives will support proposed goals: (1) the institution of a
stimulating learning environment which builds upon personal and cultural
experiences of each learner in achieving success in a standards-based approach
to the teaching and learning of mathematics and science; (2) an array of
assessment measures to gauge student progress; (3) continuous improvement in the
mathematics and science instructional workforce, inclusive of teachers,
administrators, and other school staff: (4) the adoption or mending of policies
and procedures to ensure implementation of AUSI; and (5) the development of a
community support system that actively engages all members of the learning
community in contributing to the mathematics and science achievement of all
students.
