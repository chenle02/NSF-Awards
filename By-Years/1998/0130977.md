Animals have internal biological clocks that enable them to coordinate
physiological and behavioral rhythms relative to the time of day, termed
circadian rhythms. In mammals, a key part of clock in the brain is the supra-
chiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. In nocturnal rodents, which are
widely used in the laboratory, the SCN is known to be important for the timing
of female reproductive behavior and a surge in the luteinizing hormone (LH) that
triggers ovulation. However very little is known about diurnal rodents, which
have evolved from nocturnal species. This project asks how the neural mechanisms
responsible for circadian control of the female reproductive cycle have changed
in diurnal compared to nocturnal rodents. The model animal is the unstriped Nile
grass rat, which is related to common laboratory rats, but has a virtually
complete reversal in the timing of a variety of events associated with female
reproduction, including morning instead of evening timing for both mating
behavior and for the surge in LH. Cytochemical, anatomical and behavioral
approaches will be used to distinguish whether the SCN itself changes signal
timing, whether there is instead a change in the timing of receptiveness of
target sites to SCN signals, or whether there is a change in the neuroanatomy
connecting SCN to different targets in nocturnal and diurnal species.&lt;br/&gt;
The results will have an impact beyond neuroendocrinology to chronobiology,
hypothalamic physiology, and evolutionary physiology. In addition, training of
students and researchers at several levels is an important part of the
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
