This proposal is for a Workshop on Forensic Authorship Identification that will
be held at the Brooklyn Law School. The workshop will bring together (1) leading
computer scientists and computational linguists from around the world, whose
work on authorship attribution has been yielding impressive results; (2)
American legal scholars who specialize in the admissibility of scientific
evidence in court; and (3) scholars specializing in statistical analysis. The
interdisciplinary workshop will include discussion of the algorithms being
developed and assessed, the error rates associated with these approaches, and
the theoretical contributions of linguistic and psychological sciences to
understanding forensic authorship identification. Legal experts will contribute
to discussion of the standards for admissibility of scientific evidence, and the
potential contributions of this area of forensic science to criminal and civil
practice.

The workshop will give scholars in the field the opportunity to present their
work to scholars in scientific evidence to determine how well the state of the
art stands up to current legal standards, and to spark theoretical, empirical,
and methodological innovation by sharing reactions with each other and hearing
from leading statisticians. Proceedings of the workshop will be published in
Brooklyn Law School's Journal of Law & Policy. A web platform for dissemination
of scholarship and information about authorship attribution in the courts will
also be developed and launched as part of this project.
