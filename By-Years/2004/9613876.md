Backbone Network Service (vBNS) and Collaborative Advanced Interagency Research
Network (CAIRN) for two years. Among the applications are the Virtual World Data
Server, Data Mining of Geophysical Data, UCLA Earth System Model, and
Distributed Real-Time Simulation. Collaborating sites could include the Cornell
Theory Center and San Diego Supercomputer Center.
