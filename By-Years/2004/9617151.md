Turnshek, David AST 96-17151 Dr. Turnshek will study quasars in collaboration
with astronomers in Moscow (Russia) and Tashkent (Uzbekistan) to monitor
brightness variations in quiescent QSOs and to correlate the variations with
other QSO properties. A sample of moderate redshift, i.e. z is in the range from
1.5 to 2.5, has some observations back to 1987, but entered a new phase with the
recent loan of the University of Pittsburgh CCD camera to Maidanak Observatory
in Uzbekistan.
