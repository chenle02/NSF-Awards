The objective of this project is to construct the first comprehensive loess
chronology for South Island, New Zealand. About 85-90 regions will be collected.
Dating analyses in the TL laboratory in Bellingham will be conducted. This
project will build upon the previous detailed testing of TL dating methods
conducted by the PI on loess from North Island. Further test will be conducted
on a few known-age South Island Loess samples (remote from sources of volcanic
feldspars in North Island), and extensive applications of reliable partial-
bleach procedures will be made to several undated key loess sections throughout
South Island. The resultant loess chronology will be related to the development
of associated Quaternary features such as marine terraces, glacial outwash
deposits and river terraces. TL dates for such features and for several buried
soils in the loess sequences will reveal the timing of environmental changes in
much of South Island, in the targeted time window of 20-200 ka.
