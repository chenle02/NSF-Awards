9612073 Houston Eight of the ten fastest growing cities in the U.S. are located
in the arid or semi-arid regions of the southwest. With the expected growth,
there is a need for supporting infrastructure including surface and subsurface
structures. For civil engineers, there is also a growing appreciation for the
different mechanical behavior of arid soils, including problems with soil
expansion, collapse, and wetting-induced slope instability. Some of the
associated failures can be catastrophic. Recent evaluations of existing
unsaturated flow models demonstrate that, although rates of infiltration can be
simulated fairly accurately with appropriate model calibration, the degree of
saturation and the in situ stresses are not well predicted. This research
addresses the need for improving arid-region geotechnical practice in estimating
the degree and extent of wetting, and quantifying the effect of that wetting on
soil behavior. The result of work will include practical design envelopes of
degree and extent of wetting, allowing the assessment of changes in saturation
due to urbanization or increased irrigation. The multidisciplinary team includes
PI's from geotechnical engineering, construction, and geology. The methodology
includes: (1) large-scale, deep field lysimeters, (2) collection, analysis, and
presentation of the extensive existing geotechnical and geoenvironmental data
assembled from reported information and practitioners files, and (3) unsaturated
soil testing for shear strength and compressibility in response-to-wetting,
including pore-air and pore-water pressure control and measurement. ***
