The project develops curriculum material that bridges the gap between digital
media (as a subfield of computer science) and digital art. The material is
arranged around a Primer of material relevant to both computer science and art
students; an advanced Computer Science (CS) Module emphasizing the mathematics
and technology underlying digital media; and an advanced Art Module emphasizing
aesthetics and design. The learning units topic areas are digital imaging,
audio, and video and multimedia programming. The material is web-based and text-
based and is divided in a fine-grained manner into recombined topics,
interactive exercises, and demonstrations. The material emphasizes concepts over
application programs and is designed to promote the students' informed use of
digital media tools. The students' ability to synthesize what they have learned
is incorporated in the assessment of pedagogical effectiveness. Content
analysis, the development of a learning hierarchy, and the non-linear linking of
concepts are also assessed. The material is used either for courses or faculty
development at schools ranging from the elementary to university level. The
material is tested in four sites: a university with large digital media courses,
a largely-minority university, a community college, and a technology-magnet high
school. Professional development workshops are for elementary, middle, and high
school teachers. The material is further disseminated through commercial and
academic publication.
