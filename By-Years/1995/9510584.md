This proposal for a Research Planning Grant is intended to carry out research
on how time is defined and used. Results will be used to plan a follow-up study
about perceptions of fairness in work allocations and how these may affect life
course transitions. It adds to theories about family stability and to
generalizations about the demography of the life course by its focus on the
importance of the time it takes to fulfill work and family obligations. Existing
data sources at both the national and state level are analyzed to expand
definitions of time use and the scope of how time use may affect important life
course events. Focus group interviews with both men and women will be conducted
to explore the meanings that subjects attribute to how they use time,
particularly with respect to fairness in the allocation of household
responsibilities by gender. The results of the quantitative analysis and the
focus group interviews will form the basis for the design of a new study,
directly concerned with how beliefs about gender roles are associated with
conflict between household partners and how beliefs affect transitions to
marriage, cohabitation, or divorce. The prevalence of households where two
adults work outside the home, along with the customary demands in running a
household, are important for the formation of the family's social capital.
Although the division of labor within the household begins with tasks, this
research promises new insights into how the family functions by focusing on how
much time those tasks take. With time the critical variable, the investigator
will be able to move to a consideration of beliefs about fairness in the
allocation of tasks, and their relation to interfamilial conflict and familial
stability.
