This three year project, sponsored by Bridgewater State College, will provide a
three week summer program each year for three years for teachers of science and
mathematics. Teachers of mathematics will be taught science and teachers of
science will be taught mathematics so that science and mathematics will be
integrated in the science and mathematics courses. Sixty teachers from the state
of Massachusetts will be selected each year, 30 in mathematics and 30 in
science. Teachers from grades 10-12 will participate the first year, teachers in
grades 7-9 the second year and teachers in grades 9-11 in the third year.
Teachers will be selected in teams and are expected to carryout inservice
activities upon return to the schools. There will be nine follow-up sessions
which will support and assess the participants' activities in the classroom and
their efforts in leadership activities. Matching funds from the college and the
schools amount to more than 26% of the NSF grant.
