0324081&lt;br/&gt;Cvetic&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year award for US-UK
cooperative research involves the University of Pennsylvania, Texas A&amp;M
University, and the University of Cambridge's Newton Institute. The project
concentrates on aspects of gravitational physics and the implications of
M-theory. M-theory is a candidate for a unified quantum theory of gravity with
all other forces in nature. This effort builds on existing research programs of
U.S. physicists, M. Cvetic and Christopher Pope, and British theoretician Gary
Gibbons. They plan to investigate fundamental aspects of gravitational physics
with emphasis on special holonomy spaces and their implications for M-theory
dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Pennsylvania and Texas A&amp;M
researchers bring to this collaboration expertise in approaches to gravitational
physics based on particle physics and high energy physics. This is complemented
by the British researcher's expertise in gravitational physics and supergravity
techniques applied to black hole physics. Their complementary work will
contribute toward furthering M-theory as a complete theory of fundamental
particle physics and all forces in nature. This work has applications in the
physics of black holes and superstring duality.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
