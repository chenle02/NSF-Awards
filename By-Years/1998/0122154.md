ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE UPPER NEWPORT BAY PROJECT: A COLLABORATIVE
APPROACH TO GEOSCIENCE EDUCATION IN THE ORANGE COUNTY COMMUNITY PROJECT SUMMARY
FOR A GEOSCIENCE EDUCATION PROPOSAL&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project begins to
establish Chapman University as the leader in providing the critical scientific
data needed for responsible policy decisions concerning the Upper Newport Bay
(UNB). UNB serves as Orange County's most visible natural environment.
Surrounded by high-density urban development, the Bay receives pollutants from
urban and agricultural run-off, marinas, storm water, nurseries, and creeks.
Recent development in the area has focused public interest on potential impacts
in the estuary. Yet, the Bay has no centralized environmental data repository.
This project establishes a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) database of
scientific (mostly geochemical) data for the Upper Newport Bay in Orange County,
California, in a manner that maximizes geoscience education in the community.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project establishes a Geographic Information Systems
(GIS) teaching laboratory at Chapman University, and develops a unit aimed at
future elementary and intermediate (K-8) school teachers that will combine
geoscience field and laboratory investigations with use of GIS
technology.&lt;br/&gt;Term projects in two upper division Environmental Sciences
courses give students the opportunity to do field and laboratory research
applied towards a tangible product. A pilot program is designed to give high
school science students, teachers, and potential future secondary school
teachers an opportunity to do applied field and laboratory research leading
to&lt;br/&gt;the presentation of valuable data,&lt;br/&gt;
