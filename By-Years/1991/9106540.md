Debugging of real-time distributed software systems is difficult because of
timing constraints imposed on them and because of their non-deterministic
behavior. Conventional static analysis methods are not adequate to deal with the
violation of timing constraints which are inherent in real-time distributed
software systems. This research develops a dynamic analysis method which uses
recorded run-time information to debug these kinds of timing errors. Based on
this approach, a non-interference monitoring architecture will be developed to
collect the process-level and the function-level program execution data of a
target real-time distributed system. Different-leveled logical views can be
reconstructed from this collected run-time information. The dynamic analysis
method will then be developed to analyze the timing behavior of real-time
distributed software systems.
