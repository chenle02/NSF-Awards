This project is awarding at least 20 scholarships to academically talented but
financially needy students who are pursuing a physics degree at the University
of Arkansas. Recruitment efforts are targeting both entering freshman and
community college students who are transferring to the university and seeking
baccalaureate degrees. Support structures for participants include mentoring of
scholars by faculty, peer-mentoring, a flourishing Society of Physics Students
club, a strong student-centered advising program and a research-based
introductory physics sequence designed to serve as a cohort-building vehicle.
This program will build upon student support structures developed by successful
MSP and CSEMS grants to encourage students majoring in physics to persist in the
major and become effective members of the workforce. The University of Arkansas
serves a large population of students from low socioeconomic status (low-SES)
and this project promises to increase diversity in a discipline where
historically few students are identified as from a low-SES.
