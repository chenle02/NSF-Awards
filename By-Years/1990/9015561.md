One important aim of Computational Neural Science which studies information
processing brains and adopts neural parallel computational strategies to digital
information processing, is to narrow the gap between the high density of neurons
and synapses found in brains and the low density in today's computational
models. In this respect the Connection Machine, a massive parallel computer with
a large storage capacity per processor, provides an ideal research tool. The
researchers will exploit this new machine to narrow the gap between current
models of the brain and reality. This work will be highly computational in
nature, but it will bring together concepts and techniques from disparate
disciplines, names Neurobiology, Computer Science, and Computational Physics.
