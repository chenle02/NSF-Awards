The research proposed in this application is to develop new and improved old
methods for obtaining evolutionary information from the multitude of protein and
nucleic acid sequences that result from the revolutionary new techniques in
molecular biology. These include the construction of phylogenetic trees, the
formulation of ancestral genes and gene products, the detecting and formulating
of unequal crossover events, gene conversions and hybridization, the examination
of mutagenic events and frequencies during evolution, the study of restrictions
imposed upon evolutionary development by structure- function relationships, and
the application of the principles derived therefrom to the study of population
genetics.
