Funds are provided to acquire hardware and software that will enhance the
capability and use of the UNIDATA system at Northern Illinois University (NIU).
By providing meteorological data services and software for the interactive
display and analysis of these data, the UNIDATA system is used for teaching and
research at the undergraduate and graduate level. A major goal of this project
is upgrade to the latest version of PC- McIDAS software. This requires increased
computer power and a change in operating systems, e.g. from DOS to OS/2. These
upgrades and conversions will all NIU to continue as a strong contributing
member of the UNIDATA community.
