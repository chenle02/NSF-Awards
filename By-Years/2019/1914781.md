The Arctic is warming on average twice as rapidly as the rest of the planet,
resulting in substantial declines in sea ice coverage and other changes in the
Arctic environment with implications for the global climate system. One major
limitation in our understanding of these changes is a relative lack of
environmental data in the high Arctic, particularly in winter. These challenges
motivate the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic
Climate (MOSAiC), the largest multinational scientific expedition ever
undertaken in the Arctic. Operating from the German icebreaker R/V Polarstern as
it drifts with sea ice over the period from Fall 2019-Fall 2020, scientists from
more than 17 nations will collect a wide range of physical, chemical, and
biological measurements of the surface ocean and sea ice, surface trace gas and
energy flow, bulk meteorological parameters, vertical profiling, and aerosol and
cloud characterization. This project is one element of MOSAiC and focuses on
questions surrounding reactive halogen sources and their impacts on the
atmospheric chemistry of ozone, mercury, reactive nitrogen and volatile organic
compounds (VOCs); it will provide the most northerly, complete annual record of
these gas compounds ever obtained. This study is being conducted by scientists
from the US, UK, Netherlands, France, and Australia in collaboration with the
broader MOSAiC collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High time resolution
observations (minutes to 1.5 hours) will be acquired for atmospheric ozone (by a
UV absorption monitor; commercial TEI), gaseous elemental mercury (GEM;
commercial Tekran), non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC), oxygenated VOCs (oVOCs),
halogenated VOCs (hVOCs) (all with a custom-made enrichment system and gas
chromatography and spectroscopy), oxidized nitrogen species (differentiated into
nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2)), and the sum of reactive gaseous
nitrogen (NOy); custom-built chemiluminescence analyzer). Data will be
thoroughly quality controlled, including by intercomparison with NOAA and the
University of East Anglia, UK, calibration scales. Data will be shared with
MOSAiC partners and submitted to the Arctic Data Center for free access and use
by the research community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
