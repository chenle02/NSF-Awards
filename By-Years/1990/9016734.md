This research is centered on the application of complex vector valued signal
set-membership weighted recursive least squares (SM- WRLS) algorithms to
problems of current interest and the understanding of the basic operational
principles of SM-WRLS with regard to adaptation strategies, data selection
criteria (optimal and suboptimal) and computational efficiency. Efficient
computational algorithms which can ultimately be implemented using systolic
processing are also investigated. Component tasks include: 1) neural network
learning algorithms; 2) speech and image coding, and 3) general developments and
performance evaluation.
