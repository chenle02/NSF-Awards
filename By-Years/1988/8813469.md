This award supports cooperative research in relativity between Ezra Newman,
Jeffrey Winicour and others in the physics department at the University of
Pittsburgh and Reinaldo Gleiser, Victor Hamity and Carlos Kozameh, all of the
Faculty of Mathematics, Astronomy and Physics of the National University of
Cordoba, Argentina. They will study four areas in general relativity: global
structure of gravitational fields, Yang-Mills theory (the holonomic operator and
soluble groups), techniques for the generation of solutions to the Einstein
equations and finally, a numerical investigation of general relativity for
comparison with analytic solutions of the full Einstein equation. The
cooperation between these two institutions began in 1980 and has since grown
steadily and has led to several highly regarded joint papers. This formal
collaboration will further strengthen that relationship.
