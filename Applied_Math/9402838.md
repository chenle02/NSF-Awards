9402838 Russell This project involves analytical and computational studies of
global (in the state space) control and stabilization problems for the Korteweg
- de Vries and related partial differential equations. Both point (boundary) and
distributed control modes will be considered. Advanced computational and
symbolic processing capabilities will be employed in the investigation of
conservation laws for closed loop processes in order to obtain a priori bounds
on solutions. This will permit a careful analysis of the transients and
asymptotic behavior of the controlled system. Solutions of the Korteweg - de
Vries, and other, related, nonlinear partial differential equations
characteristically include solitary waves, called solitons. These waves occur in
numerous applications, including meteorology and oceanography, fiber-optic
signal transmission, chemical transport and diffusion processes, and many
others. Questions of interest which will be addressed by the research to be
undertaken in this project include energy attenuation in solitary waves, stable
creation of solitary waves, and analysis of repeater type amplification of
solitary waves. This research will include both mathematical analyses of the
processes under investigation and computer based process simulation.
