9706359 Buseck This research will utilize high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy and complementary techniques to recover information that resides in
the structural distortions, non-stoichiometry, interfaces, precipitates,
gradational structures, and other "defects" in minerals. Topics to be studied
include: (1) the unusual carbon-rich minerals associated with the reducing
environments of Shunga, Russia, (2) interstratified vermiculite-smectite formed
during chlorite alteration, (3) non-cubic ?pyrite, (4) maghemitization in ocean-
floor basalts, (5) Lorentz microscopy, and (6) chemical imaging at the unit cell
scale. The unique combination of an outstanding facility with cooperating
scientists in cognate disciplines will help the pursuit of important
mineralogical developments and applications of high-resolution.
