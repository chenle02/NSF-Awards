This project continues research begun under an earlier NSF grant on the
dynamics and learning in multistage games. Since experiments, oligopoly
experiments, bargaining experiments, committee experiments, and experiments in
many other settings studied by social scientists are conducted by multi-stage
games, a better understanding of these dynamics is critical to the kinds of
inferences that can be made from the data. This project develops a unified
theoretical and econometric approach with a structure that permits the rigorous
analysis of diverse experimental data from multi-stage games. The theoretical
development involves modification of standard game theoretic analysis by
introducing random errors in actions (trembles) and beliefs (home-made priors
and non-Bayesian updating). Different specifications of these random components,
including assumptions about the degree to which subjects take errors into
account in their own decision making, lead to several classes of models which
can be rigorously evaluated and compared using data from simple experimental
games. These alternative models can also be used to rigorously analyze - for the
first time - data from earlier experiments that offer descriptive evidence about
what appear to be systematic departures from fully rational behavior.
