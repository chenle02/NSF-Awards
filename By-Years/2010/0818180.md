This Communicating Research to Public Audiences (CRPA) proposal is based upon
Dr. Donald DePaolo's research utilizing deep drilling technology to create a
continuous rock record of the lavas ejected from Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano
(#9528544 "Collaborative Research: Scientific Drilling in Hawaii: Physics and
Chemistry of Mantle Plumes" and # 0408521 "Structure of the Hawaiian Mantle
Plume: Geochemical-isotopic mapping using post-shield lavas"). The CRPA request
will support the production of a half-hour documentary film and podcast-based
tour of the geology of Hawaii's famous volcano for both actual and virtual
visitors to Hawaii, as well as a supporting web site. The film will be produced
by Earth Images Foundation, distributed by Bullfrog Films, and evaluated by
Diana Curiel.
