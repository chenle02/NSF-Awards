Professor Sandner will launch an experimental investigation of one of the most
fundamental and important problems in atomic- physics: the three-body Coulomb
problem. He will excite the two outer electrons of alkaline earth atoms to very
high- lying Rydberg states so as to produce a positively charged core
interacting with two negatively charged electrons. The atomic spectroscopy of
these double excited states will be used to interpret the motion of the three-
particle Coulomb interactions.
