9307877 Singh This proposed project utilizes the PI's prior experiences in
preparing ceramic matrix composites (CMC) of unique microstructures and
controlled interfacial properties with novel processing techniques. Crack growth
studies will be performed within a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) equipped
with a mechanical loading stage. Fracture experiments will be done in a 3-point
flexure mode. Fiber bridging stress will be measured by Laser Raman Spectroscopy
(LRS). The mechanism of crack growth and in situ measurements of the local
stress-displacement relations will be incorporated into an analytical model
based on the cohesive crack approach. The objective of this study is to provide
a comprehensive but fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of fracture and
crack propagation in fiber reinforced ceramic matrix composites (FRCMC). %%%
This proposed project seeks to understand the fundamental mechanisms of fracture
and crack propagation in fiber reinforced ceramic matrix composites (FRCMC). It
starts with uniquely prepared CMC with controlled interfacial properties and
microstructures. A Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) equipped with a mechanical
loading stage allows the study of its crack growth behaviors in situ. Testing
with a 3-point flexure mode provides information to practical applications.
finally, the fiber bridging stress will be measured with the use of Laser Raman
spectroscopy. This comprehensive project offers the useful information in the
design of materials for specific applications. ***
