9318383 Spilhaus This award will support participant support costs for
attendance at the Chapman Conference on The Physics of the Magnetopause, to be
held in San Diego, California, March 14-18, 1994. Chapman Conferences are
topical meetings sponsored by the American Geophysical Union and are designed to
promote opportunities not normally available through the format of larger
meetings. The magnetopause is the outer boundary of the magnetosphere and is the
site of many complex plasma phenomena. Understanding these processes is
important in explaining the entry of solar wind plasma into the magnetosphere.
The conference will bring together leading experts and students to discuss
current research and future efforts. ***
