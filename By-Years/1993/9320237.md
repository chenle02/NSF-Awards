ABSTRACT P.I. Marian Dagosto SBR- 9320237 Similarities in the post-cranial
skeletons of early fossil primates and extant prosimians have led earlier
researchers to conclude that the earliest primates moved about in similar ways
to current prosimians. However, very few features of the skeleton have been
reliably correlated with specific positional behaviors in living forms, so that
the inferred behaviors of extinct early primates remain unclear, making it
difficult to interpret evolutionary change in primate postcranial morphology
from a functional perspective. More than any other element of the skeleton, the
hand and wrist do reflect clear adapations to different locomotor patterns.
Precise biomechanical models incorporating specific variation in wrist
morphology can be formulated to reconstruct positional/locomotor behaviors in
fossil primates and to document their phylogenetic patterns of change. This
dissertation research, using video, dissection of cadaver specimens, and
measurement of primate wrists in skeletal collections, will reveal historical
transitions in primate wrist morphology and positional behavior. ***
