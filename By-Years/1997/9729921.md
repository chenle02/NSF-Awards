This award contributes to the development of an exhibit commemorating the 150th
anniversary of the founding of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science (AAAS). The exhibit uses the history of AAAS as a prism to examine the
history of American science, communicating in a clear and engaging manner both
the highlights of that history and the role played by the AAAS. The exhibit will
first be presented at the AAAS annual meeting in Philadelphia, in February 1998,
then will be installed in the public space of the organization's headquarters in
Washington, D.C. The exhibit will be open to the public through the celebration
of the AAAS's Founders' Day (in September 1998), and perhaps longer. School
groups, people from the Washington science and policy communities, members of
the media, and the broader public will be encouraged to visit through a
publicity campaign that will include notices and articles in the newspapers and
on television and radio.
