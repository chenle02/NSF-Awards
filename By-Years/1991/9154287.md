This project gives 40 participants from the southwestern section of the country
intensive exposure to personal productivity and teaching enhancement software
applicable to undergraduate physics courses. The workshop is conducted by
experts from New Mexico State University, which has a program to introduce more
computer usage to its undergraduate curriculum. The participants are selected
from two and four year colleges from the region with preference given to those
from institutions serving significant numbers of Hispanic and Native American
students. During the week the participants listen to experts discuss and
demonstrate the capabilities of various computer programs. In the afternoons,
the participants actually use the software to create applications for their own
courses. A newsletter produced from the applications created by the participants
insures that good ideas are given wide distribution. The objective of the
workshop is to introduce a significant number of undergraduate faculty to the
capabilities and operation of various computer programs which can enhance the
teaching of their courses.
