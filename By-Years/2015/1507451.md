Abandoned properties in cities attract illicit occupants that negatively
contribute to the community safety and growth. These urban blights decrease
property values and contribute to the growth of criminal activities. Government
agencies have tried many years to curb the rate of abandoned properties. They
are met with mixed results. The proposed technology is an auction-based platform
for tangible and intangible resources. The particular focus is intangible
resources, such as volunteerism, after-school hours, technical know-hows, legal
advisers, Open Source contributions, and public data sources. The intended
target is for solving urban vacant lot problem in large cities by mobilizing
otherwise "invisible resources" with fair compensation they deserve. In other
words, The proposed mobile/web service should enable this relatively untapped
resource pool to surface solving larger economic problems. Similar model has
been tested by now the Ecommerce giant Alibaba in China who succeeded in the
small business B2B market where there are serious lacks in credit, trust and
logistics infrastructures.

This I-Corps team proposes to tackle the urban vacant lot problems using an Open
Resource Market (ORM) approach by trading tangible and intangible resources via
an auction engine in the form of a non-profit organization. The key idea is to
direct and accelerate resource developments in multiple forms towards social
harmony and prosperity. Unlike existing online trading portals, such as Ebay,
Ubid, and others, this team proposes to include volunteered times and efforts,
market promotions to traditional service or goods exchanges. A special feature
of the proposed project is the fusion of public data with private resources. The
proposed work will integrate government Open Data sources with crime data
sources, geo spatial data sources, and economic data analytics to stimulate open
resource exposure, exchange and development.
