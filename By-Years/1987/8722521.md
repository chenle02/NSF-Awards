This research will study the buckling loads and buckled states of nonlinearly
elastic non-isotropic circular plates when subjected to a uniform pressure on
their edge. Numerical methods for these highly singular problems will be
designed and analysed using continuation methods and numerical bifurcation
theory. The work should clarify the nature of singularities present in the
linear theory of non-isotropic structures. This research will lead to
improvements in the understanding and technology of buckling of nonlinearly
elastic non-isentropic plates. Non-isotropic structures have applications in the
casting of metals and in the manufacture of composite materials.
