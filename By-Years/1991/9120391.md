The objective of this study is to address key aspects of research and
commercialization of biobased products derived from agricultural and forestry
resources. Biobased industrial products are chemicals and materials derived from
renewable resources and include such items as biodegradable plastics, chemical
feedstocks, adsorbent polymers, cosmetic ingredients, waxes, lubicants, resins,
gums, and pharmaceuticals. A committee of about 12 experts will examine key
issues dealing with research and commercialization, and address future biobased
product opportunities offered by advances in biotechnology and the chemical and
material sciences. Workshops dealing with key research and commercialization
aspects will be held to augment the information base of the committee. A final
report will provide an authoritative perspective on biobased products and
guidance for future actions by government, industry and academia during the next
decade.
