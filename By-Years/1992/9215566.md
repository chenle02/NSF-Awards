In this project, the Method of Moments is used to solve the acoustic field
problems with mixed boundary conditions. At present, these problems are solved
using a combination of finite element method (FEM), and the boundary element
method, since no single method can handle both types of boundary conditions
(finite and infinite domains). The Method of Moments has been widely used so far
for solving both differential and integral formulations of electromagnetic field
problems. The simple and flexible nature of the method make it ideally suited
for solution of complex acoustic field problems typically encountered in
aerospace and automotive systems.*** //
