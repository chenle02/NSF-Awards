The Chemical Catalyis Program of the Chemistry Division of the National Science
Foundation will support the research program of Professor Mikhail Zamkov at
Bowling Green State University. Professor Zamkov and his students will combine
novel synthesis strategies for the formation of composite charge-separating
nanoparticles coupled with metallic catalyst particles, with ultra-fast
spectroscopy of photoinduced charge transfer processes at the interfaces in
these particles. This work will address the nature of charge transfer across
these heterojunction interfaces, contributing to the basic understanding of
electron dynamics in these nanomaterials. Such nanomaterial systems show promise
for use as photocatalysts in water splitting reactions for the production of
hydrogen and other solar fuels. The work of this project will serve to train
students in the fundamental physics and chemistry of sustainable energy
technologies, as well as to provide the foundation for the development of these
possibly important catalytic materials.
