The new program in astronomy and astrophysics includes new courses, faculty, an
observatory dome, and an astronomy laboratory in the newly renovated science
buildings. For the first time, an advanced course on astrophysics and an
introductory astronomy laboratory are being offered. In these courses, students
are gaining experience in astronomical techniques, ranging from simple exercises
to advanced experiments. The success of the new astronomy program strongly
depends on the quality of the projects that can be offered, which subsequently
depend on the quality of instrumentation available. The combination of a DFM
16'' f/8 Cassegrain telescope, SBIG ST-8 CCD imaging camera, high-resolution
spectrograph, modern computer controls and operating systems, and data analysis
software are making it possible for students to gain experience previously
available only to students in large astronomy departments. The DFM telescope has
been specifically chosen for the observatory because it gives flexibility for
instrumentation choices. It is designed and installed for immediate maximum
performance in pointing, guiding, and focusing, guaranteed for workmanship, and
comes with remote observing equipment and a simple, user-friendly operating
system. Furthermore, the 16" telescope is ideal for an urban location, since it
has good light gathering capabilities for observing both bright and faint
objects. Sky brightness can also be subtracted in CCD exposures. With a good CCD
camera and high-resolution spectrograph, the department can provide a very wide
range of introductory exercises and advanced experiments in astronomy, as well
as independent research projects for the advanced students. These observatory
facilities also support projects and exercises in planetary geology, physical
chemistry, electronics, and optics.
