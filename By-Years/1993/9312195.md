9312195 Ruden Future electronics technology will rely on electronics devices
whose principles of operation are very different from those of current devices.
As the critical dimensions shrink into the so-called mesoscopic range, phenomena
such as quantum coherence and tunneling will dominate the characteristics of
structures which may contain only few electrons. It is the underlying vision of
this proposal that the transfer of electrons between nanostructures and the
coupling of the electrons within these structures via Coulomb interactions are
of crucial importance for possible future applications, e.g. high speed random
access memory. One coupling mechanism of the electrons within closely spaced
nanostructures, and specifically quantum wires, is due to wavefunction overlap,
i.e. tunneling. A second coupling mechanism involving the Coulomb interaction
between the electrons and the associated exchange interaction. Our primary goals
are -to demonstrate and anayze new phenomena that occur when two quantum wires
are placed in close proximity so that there is strong coupling. -to explore new
concepts for computation or data storage based on instabilities in coupled
quantum wires that were recently predicted independently by Wu and Ruden and by
Gold. The reseach proposed includes work on the theory of quantum structures, on
materials growth, nanoscale device fabrication, and extensive characterization.
In particular, we will explore experimentally and theoretically the electronic
structure and transport properties of quantum wires in III-V semiconductor
heterostructures. ***
