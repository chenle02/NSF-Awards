9402922 Sparks In this project the PIs will investigate magma migration and
various scales of mantle flow. They will perform 2- and 3-D numerical modelling
to address questions concerned with melt channelling and focusing. They will use
a time-efficient gridding technique (Fast Adaptive Composite gridding) to obtain
high resolution at various scales that may be needed.
