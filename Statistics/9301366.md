The large number of univariate distributions that have been thoroughly studied
sometimes have been developed for use in statistical analyses of data; other
distribution arise from natural probabilistic or physical considerations, from
statistical properties or as limiting distributions. Most of the well-known
distributions arise in more than one way. Although univariate distributions
provide information about individual measurements, they cannot facilitate
studies of relationships between measurements. In many situations in the
physical, biological, economic sciences it is just these relationships that are
of interest, for which multivariate distributions are required. The goal of this
proposal is to contribute to the understanding of multivariate versions of the
well-known univariate theory. This subject is particularly timely because recent
increases in computational and computer graphics capabilities have made the use
of multivariate distributions much more broadly practical. Multivariate models
are now particularly understood in terms of underlying structures that unite
many multivariate families into cohesive units. Meaningful derivations of
multivariate distributions can shed light on which models to use in different
applications. A consequence of this research is that flexible models useful in
describing multivariate data will become available.
