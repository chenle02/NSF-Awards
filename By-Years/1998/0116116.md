Brookhaven National Laboratory is hosting a workshop on May 30-31, 2001 to
promote the formation of research partnerships between college and university
faculty in designated EPSCoR states and the scientific staff from Department of
Energy (DOE) laboratories and facilities. The workshop is sponsored by the DOE
Office of Basic Energy Sciences EPSCoR program and is co-sponsored by the
National Science Foundation EPSCoR Program. The primary objective of the meeting
is to provide a forum for research scientists from EPSCoR states to: (1) report
advances in EPSCoR funded research activities, (2) update their knowledge of
Department of Energy programs and initiatives, (3) learn about BNL National User
Faciliti4es and research directions, (5) develop plans for future research
projects, and (6) learn about DOE laboratory opportunities for training and
hands-on research experience for undergraduate, graduate, postdoctoral fellows
and new faculty.
