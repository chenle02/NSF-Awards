Through the Accentuating the Integration of Mathematics and Science (AIMS)
program, Fayetteville State University will evaluate variables that contribute
to low graduation rates and the steady decline of underrepresented minorities
majoring in the mathematics and science fields. Comprehensive approaches will be
developed to enhance student performance and progress in mathematics, computer
science, chemistry, physics, and biology.

The infrastructure enhancement plan will include the following components: (1)
mathematics and science curriculum reform, improvement of gateway courses, and
research training; (2) strengthening partnerships with industry, government, and
other academic institutions to enhance the development of research programs on
campus; (3) faculty development focusing on teaching/learning models,
instructional delivery and assessment; and, (3) evaluation and dissemination of
project outcomes and best practices.
