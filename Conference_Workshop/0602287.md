The Southwest Center for Arithmetic Geometry was founded in 1997 with support
from an NSF Group Infrastructure Grant, and renewed in 2002 with a grant from
the Infrastructure program. The main activity of the Southwest Center is the
Arizona Winter School (AWS), an annual meeting which has become a prominent
national event, and which provides high-level training and research experience
for graduate students in arithmetic geometry. The AWS is an intensive five-day
meeting, organized around a different central topic each year, which features a
set of courses by leading and emerging experts. The AWS is not a traditional
conference: the speakers organize courses of four lectures, with lecture notes
provided in advance, and propose projects for graduate students to work on
during the meeting. Each speaker hosts working sessions nightly during the
meeting, and on the last day the students present their findings to the entire
group. The result is a particularly intense and focused five days of
mathematical activity for both students and speakers.

At the Winter School, connections among peers are forged, and mentoring
relationships between students and senior researchers are developed. As has been
the case at previous Winter Schools, subsequent collaborations between
participants at all levels are the norm. In addition to continuing this
successful program, the PIs (including three new PIs, all AWS alumni) will
introduce new features to these annual activities. The PIs propose to add a
post-doctoral training component to the Winter School, by assigning to each
graduate student group a post-doctoral mentor to oversee their investigations.
In addition to well-edited lecture notes and video recordings of lectures, the
PIs will add new forms of content to the Center's web site, including discussion
forums and periodic updates of topics from previous years. By sharing reusable
content from the Winter Schools through the Southwest Center web site, the
efforts of the Winter School participants will be available to all
mathematicians indefinitely. Since our site will contain a thorough record of
each Winter School, the dialogues begun at the Winter School will be extended to
the greater mathematical community.
