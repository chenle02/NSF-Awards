This dissertation will research state effects on union demands and the climate
of nonparticipation in Britain, France, and Germany between 1871 and 1975. The
student will collect and quantify qualitative data on state strategies and union
power. The longitudinal data analysis will employ interrupted time- series and
two-stage least squares models.
