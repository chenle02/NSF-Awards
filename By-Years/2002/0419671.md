This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project proposes to
develop a new composite to be used in hip replacements. The composite includes
variable diameter ceramic fibers in bone cement.

The commercial application of this project will be in the field of orthopedics .
The use of minimally invasive orthopedic implants, using injectable, polymer
based biomaterials with high strength and stress resistance, will offer a new
approach to treating orthopedic fractures and ailments.
