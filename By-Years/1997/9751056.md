Through this project, the Chemistry Department obtains a 300-MHz superconducting
Nuclear Magnetic Spectrometer (NMR). The Department of Chemistry has redeveloped
its curriculum and requires the completion of a laboratory component as part of
each course of the chemistry curriculum, with the goal of progressively
expanding the repertoire of techniques and building laboratory facility. The
addition of a 300-MHz NMR instrument enhances all levels of classes as well as
the undergraduate research program. The project begins with the basic operation
of the instrument in the general chemistry course and integrates NMR throughout
the subsequent curriculum. A progression of experiments unified by the theme of
modern chemical applications is introduced in the curriculum. *
