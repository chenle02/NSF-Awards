laboratory summer class of students who have completed eighth grade, and working
with university mathematicians to better understand the mathematics concepts
woven into the new curriculum. During the following school year, the teachers
will be given the time and support necessary for them to assume leadership in
the incorporation of the new curriculum in their schools. In subsequent years
