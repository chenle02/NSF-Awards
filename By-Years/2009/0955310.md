The objective is to develop a new communications and computation architecture
that overlays the electric power grid to enable the real time control needed for
reliable and economic operation. The increasing frequency of measurements and
the resulting volume of real time data are being constrained by the
communications-computation infrastructure that was originally designed in the
60s. The new architecture should be able to take advantage of the higher
communications and computation speeds but also be flexible to accommodate more
sophisticated wide area controls and network analysis tools.

The intellectual merit is in the interdisciplinary marriage of the evolving
communications and database technologies with the new power grid controls and
operational tools needed for the reliability and efficiency of the electric
supply. These smart grid requirements are a challenge to the traditional methods
of development of visualization, monitoring and control of the grid. The
resulting architecture must be flexible enough to be useful for several decades
of evolving technologies.

The broader impacts of this research pertain to the implementation of the 21st
century electric grid that enables the incorporation of renewable energy sources
while minimizing environmental impacts. This has to be done while increasing the
reliability, security and the efficiency of electric supply so that the economic
growth needed for society is not impeded. The results of this research can be
incorporated into existing courses and the simulations can be used for grid
demonstrations in the recruitment of new students.
