9614780 Wernicke The southern Great Basin, western US, is among the most highly
extended regions in the world, and has been the site of the development of
concepts of extreme extension and models of how extension is compensated.
Previous research has led to the development of a large-scale three-dimensional
kinematic model of the evolution of the southern Great Basin since 36 Ma. The
model makes numerous detailed predictions regarding the compatibility of
structural, stratigraphic, paleothermal and paleomagnetic signatures between
various specific blocks. This project will test aspects of this model in the
northern Spring Mountains and the Grapevine Mountains. Results are expected to
help established the applicability of the overall model to the southern.
