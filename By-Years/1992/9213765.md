The molecular events that culminate in exocytosis are unknown although recent
work has suggested that small G-proteins regulate the movement and targeting of
membranous structures and processes (membrane-trafficking) including exocytosis.
Among the distinctive modifications of G-proteins that regulate cyclic
interactions of these proteins with cellular membranes are polyisoprenylation
and fatty-acylation of C-terminal Cys residues. Certain snake venom
phospholipase A2 enzymes are extremely potent neurotoxins at the presynaptic
terminal and block neurotransmitter release without structural damage to the
nerve ending. The hypothesis to be tested is that these venoms may act to modify
the small G-proteins and thereby block the exocytotic process of
neurotransmitter release. This research has the potential for increasing
understanding of exocytosis and providing molecular tools for the study of
neurotransmission and exocytosis in a wide variety of cells and tissues.
