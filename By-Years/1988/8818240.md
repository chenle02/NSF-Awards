Multiple tubulin genes and mechanisms of posttranslational modification are
thought to establish the properties and functions of microtubules in different
cell types, but the details are still not known for a single cell or microtubule
system. Avian erythrocytes contain a unique cytoskeletal structure, the marginal
band, which is composed of one of these isotypes. The goal is to characterize
tubulin expression and the structure of the erythrocyte tubulin gene in chicken
erythrocytes and determine if a constitutive tubulin found in undifferentiated
erythroblasts can substitute for the specific isotype during the formation of
this unique cytoskeletal structure. Specific aims are to (1) characterize the
pattern of expression of constitutive and specific tubulins during erythrocyte
differentiation; (2) analyze the gene of the specific tubulin for enhancer
elements that activate its expression; (3) analyze function by transfecting
cells with tubulin genes and examining cytoskeleton formation by immuno-light
and electron microscopy. NIH-3T3 cells will be transfected with constructs
containing the specific CB6 tubulin gene, and conversely early erythroblaslts
will be transfected with the constitutive CB3 tubulin gene to alter the ratio of
endogenous tubulin isotypes to determine if a constitutive isotype can
substitute in marginal band formation. A positive effect in band disruption will
imply a unique function for the specific tubulin gene. This project will address
the fundamental question of what, if any, is the functional distinction between
highly-similar isotypes of cellular proteins, encoded for by separate,
developmentally-regulated genes.
