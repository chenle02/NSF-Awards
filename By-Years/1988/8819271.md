Most free-swimming microorganisms swim in helices. Recent mathematical analyses
in this laboratory demonstrate that (1) microorganisms that swim in helices
rotate their bodies as they move forward, (2) the rotational and translational
velocities determine the radius and pitch of the helix, (3) changes in the
rotational velocity change the direction of the axis of the helix (the net
direction of motion), and (4) a microorganism can orient to a stimulus gradient
by changing its rotational velocity. These investigators have developed a
working prototype of a device that tracks the motion of microorganisms in three
dimensions. The goals of this project are to refine this device and the
techniques of data analysis required to track microorganisms accurately and
precisely. The motions of spermatozoa and a flagellate will be tracked to test
(1) whether they change their rate of rotation when stimulated, and (2) if the
resulting change of direction is sufficient to orient the organism to a stimulus
gradient. The results of this research may reveal a previously unknown mechanism
by which free-swimming microorganisms orient their direction of motion, i.e., by
changing their rate of rotation.
