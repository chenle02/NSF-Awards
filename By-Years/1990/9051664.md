This project is intended to provide a laboratory facility for undergraduate
students to use existing commercial Geographical Information Systems (GIS) image
processing software and to develop new methods and techniques for managing
geographic data and information. The undergraduate curriculum in surveying
engineering is designed to provide a broad foundation in all of the major sub
disciplines of surveying. The overall theme which ties the discrete threads
together throughout the curriculum is the collection, management, analysis, and
dissemination of spatial information. The work performed in the laboratory
facility is central to this theme.
