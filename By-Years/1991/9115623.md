This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in astrophysics
between W. Lothar Frommhold of the University of Texas at Austin and Jean-Pierre
Bouanich and others at the University of Paris (South). The objective of their
research is to improve understanding of the physics of collision induced
absorption processes at the fundamental molecular level. Dr. Frommhold is a
recognized leader in the theoretical aspects of collision induced absorption.
His group in Texas has produced computations of absorption spectra of hydrogen
molecular pairs. This is complemented by the French group's excellent
experimental record in laboratory measurements of collision induced absorption.
The Texas group proposes to compare their theoretical results with the high
quality measurements of the French group. In the process, significant and
reliable new data will be obtained. The project is of major interest to
astrophysicists specializing in the atmosphere of outer planets and cool stars
where hydrogen and helium are major elements. The verification of the
theoretical work in collision induced absorption will advance our understanding
of the process and its application to star formation in collapsing clouds.
