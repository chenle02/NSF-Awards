This two-year project will develop, test, and document a model for school-wide
change in the teaching of elementary and middle school mathematics, with the
goal of promoting instruction that is consistent with the California Mathematics
Framework and the NCTM Standards. Led by project staff and sixteen teachers
serving as "math leadership candidates," five elementary schools and four middle
schools in California will conclude a five-year staff development program that
was begun with state and local funding. Each summer, the mathematics leadership
candidates will attend one-week institutes to prepare them for their leadership
roles. All teachers in the participating schools will, at district expense, take
a one-week course on mathematics content and methodology offered by Marilyn
Burns Associates. During the academic years, the mathematics leadership
candidates will meet regularly with project staff and will provide monthly
inservice sessions to the entire staff of the participating schools. Products of
the project will include a Mathematics Leadership Guide. The California State
Department of Education, the Alameda County Office of Education, and the
participating school districts are contributing as cost-sharing an amount equal
to 88% of the NSF award.
