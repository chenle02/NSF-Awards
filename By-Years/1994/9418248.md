9418248 Davis This research is to study the core-mantle boundary by means of
seismic array analysis. The new methods to be used include the directional
determination ability of arrays and signal processing techniques developed in
the RADAR community. Data from several seismic arrays throughout the world will
be used to explore the topography and reflective properties of the core-mantle
boundary, which is a key feature in the development of competing mantle
convection models. The results of this study will be compared with earlier
tomographic work based upon travel-time analysis alone. *** ??
