The proposed work will focus on the continental slope of the MARGINS' Source-to-
Sink focus site offshore Waipaoa with three broad questions in mind: 1) whether
the main depocenter has changed during the late Holocene; 2) are sediment
gravity flows a significant mode of dispersal, and thus do tectonic features on
the margin serve as conduits; and 3) does active intra-slope sediment
redistribution overwhelm the large terrestrial input signals. The project will
conduct a Chirp seismic survey and obtain cores, augmented by existing multibeam
data. Sediment accumulation and mixing rates will be studied with short half-
life radio-nucleides. Tephra layers may also provide critical
chronology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
