The goal of the project is to provide field instrumentation for use in a variety
of undergraduate courses (primarily, Plant Community Analysis; secondarily,
Forest Science, General Ecology, and Plant Physiology). The equipment request
includes one laptop microcomputer and six complete dataloggers and a portable
photosynthesis system. The equipment is for use in a series of carefully
tailored field and greenhouse experiments that provide students with: 1)
exposure to modern instrumentation and field methods, 2) the notion that this
equipment is interfaceable with microcomputers (for data downloading and
analysis), 3) an opportunity to synthesize complex data from multiple sources
and think more critically about community structure and organization, and 4) to
stress the scientific method and design of experiments.
