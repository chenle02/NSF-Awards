This research aims at studying bottlenecks related to chip inputs/outputs,
memory bandwidth, memory size, and data dependencies in special-purpose
computers for signal processing application. The goal is to theoretically
quantify these problems and systematically ease them through algorithm design,
algorithm transformation, and joint design of architectures and algorithms.
Research is carried out on identifying the nature of problems in signal
processing applications and experimenting with applications related to video
compression and continuous-speech recognition. Real-time signal processing
systems often lack proper tradeoffs among performance requirements, costs goals,
and VLSI technological limitations. There is a strong need to study dedicated or
application- specific architectures that are very efficient for the given
application. This research addresses the issues related to the bottlenecks that
arise in the implementation of application-specific signal processing systems.
It extends previous work, which mainly addressed problems related to throughput.
Results obtained allow better design tradeoffs in the design of special-purpose
signal processing systems.
