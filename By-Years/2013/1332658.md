Monodispersed (uniform size) magnetic nanocrystals have been successfully
applied in high energy density magnet, data storage and biotechnology
applications. However, it has remained a challenge to achieve the ordered
structure needed in a large scale due to different types of planar defects in
the nanocrystals. The objective of this project is to produce and study
metastable, epitaxially stabilized rare-earth-free magnetic ferrous nanocrystals
using bottom-up core/shell interdiffusion process with nanoscale precision. High
energy density magnetic nanocomposites will be developed through the self-
assembled exchange-coupling (magnetic interaction) of magnetically hard and soft
nanocrystals, which will be scaled up by high-throughput microwave processing.
The ultimate goal is to demonstrate a bottom-up manufacturing strategy to
discover rare-earth-free high-energy density magnetic nanomaterials.

This study will represent a versatile nanomanufacturing route for magnetic alloy
nanocrystals with unprecedented control of their structures, and create a
rational pathway for manipulating bottom-up assembly-controlled exchange-
coupling processes. In addition, discovering rare-earth-free high energy density
nanomagnets from low cost elements, such as iron and nickel, represent a
critical part of present and future sustainable high energy density
applications, including smaller, lighter and more efficient motors and
generators, as well as non-invasive magnetic hyperthermia biotechnology. A
successfully developed ferrous based spring nanomagnets will (1) reduce the U.S.
dependence on rare-earth imports; (2) reduce cost and improve efficiency of high
energy density applications; and (3) establish U.S. leadership in a wide
adoption of green energy technologies. In addition, the benefit to society is
that successful results will lead to advances in earth abundant materials and
environmentally benign manufacturing applications.
