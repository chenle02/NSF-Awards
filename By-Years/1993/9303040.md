In the past, this conference has brought together academic, industrial, and
government researchers with interests in the principles and practices of
biochemical engineering. This conference series has served as a mechanism to
communicate important developments and directions of significance to biochemical
engineers. Biochemical Engineering VIII will continue this tradition with
sessions planned to update ongoing areas of interest as well as to highlight
emerging areas. Funds are to be used to partially defray expenses for academic
participants.
