In this project, the PI's will to continue the study of physical processes on
the Amazon shelf as part of A Multidisciplinary Amazon Shelf SEDiment Study
(AMASSEDS). Moored, shipboard, drifter, and satellite data have been collected
over a period of two years to investigate the geological, chemical, and physical
processes that control the distributions and fluxes of fresh water, salt, and
sediment across the Amazon shelf. Specific focus is on tides, frontal dynamics,
wind-driven motions, and the influence of the North Brazil Current on the
currents, hydro- graphy, and suspended sediment distributions on the shelf.
Collaborative efforts address the role of physical processes in controlling the
distributions and fluxes of sediments and chemicals in the water column, and
across the sediment-water interface.
