Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will include
studies&lt;br/&gt;of supersymmetry and other new theories of fundamental
particle&lt;br/&gt;interactions. Supersymmetry is a promising idea which
predicts the&lt;br/&gt;existence of many new heavy subatomic particles. The
properties of these&lt;br/&gt;particles, including their masses and the rates at
which they decay into&lt;br/&gt;other particles, will be studied under a variety
of different theoretical&lt;br/&gt;assumptions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The
resulting predictions are important because they will affect both&lt;br/&gt;the
planning and the analysis of many present and future experiments
that&lt;br/&gt;search for new particles. These studies are of central importance
for&lt;br/&gt;understanding the behavior of particle physics involving
interactions at&lt;br/&gt;very high energies. They will also impact on our
understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;physics of the very early universe, when the
particles under consideration&lt;br/&gt;would have been plentiful.
