Finding constant curvature metrics on 3-manifolds has been one of the central
problems in low-dimensional topology ever since the geometrization conjecture
was proposed. The main focus of the project is to construct constant curvature
metrics on triangulated closed 3-manifolds using a variational approach where
the energy functional is the volume. Starting with a triangulation of a closed
3-manifold, the PI introduces the concept of angle structures on 3-simplexes and
on triangulations. These are generalizations of the concepts introduced by
Casson and Rivin for compact 3-manifold with non-empty tori boundary. An angle
structure on a tetrahedron is an assignment of a dihedral angle to each edge of
the tetrahedron so that each vertex triangle becomes a spherical triangle. For
instance all spherical, Euclidean and hyperbolic tetrahedra are angle
structures. An angle structure on a triangulated closed 3-manifold is a
realization of each 3-simplex by an angle structure so that the sum of dihedral
angles at each edge is 360-degree. The space of all angle structures on a fixed
triangulated manifold is an open bounded convex polytope. The PI has shown that
there is a natural notion of volume of angle structures which generalizes the
notion of volume of tetrahedra in hyperbolic and spherical. The main focus of
the project is on the local maximum point of the volume. The PI has established
that the volume can be extended continuously to the compact closure of the space
of all angle structures. This, in particular, established a conjecture of John
Milnor on the volume of simplexes in classical geometry. It has also been shown
that if the volume has a local maximum point in the space of all angle
structures, then either the manifold has a constant curvature metric, or the
manifold contains a very special 2-sphere or real projective plane. The main
focus of the project is to study the maximum point of the volume at the boundary
of the space of all angle structures.

The physical universe is 3-dimensional. In mathematics, 3-dimensional spaces
are called 3-manifolds. The study of 3-manifolds is one of the most important
problems in geometry and topology. Understanding geometric shapes of the
3-dimensional spaces is of vital importance theoretically and practically. In
1978, William Thurston made a revolutionary conjecture which lists the best
geometry structure a 3-dimensional space can have, i.e., he conjectured the best
shape a 3-dimensional space can take. He also verified the conjecture for a vast
class of 3-dimensional spaces. Recent work of R. Hamilton and G. Perelman may
have solved conjecture. However, for a 3-dimensional space, how to find
algorithmically the best shape of a 3-dimensional space is still open. The goal
of this proposal is to construct the algorithm. The PI has already made
progresses in this direction. The successful completion of the proposal will
have applications not only in mathematics, but also in computer graphics and
computational general relativity.
