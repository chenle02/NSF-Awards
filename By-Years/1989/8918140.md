Ion motion in inorganic glasses will be studied. The ion-ion correlation (via
exponent n) and the so-called two level systems (TLS) parameters will be related
to material characteristics. This will be done by investigating the effect of a
systematic variation of composition on ac electrical and nuclear spin relaxation
(NSR) behavior. The localized ion movement will be characterized using
dielectric relaxation, NSR, and ionic thermocurrent. These techniques combined
with dc conductivity and tracer diffusion will allow a critical investigation of
various activation energies.
