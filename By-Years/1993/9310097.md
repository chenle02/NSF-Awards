9310097 Kraus The focus of this research is the use of a photochemical
alternative to the Lewis acid catalyzed Friedel-Crafts processes used in the
production of compounds such as diazepam, zomepirac, acebutolol, ibuprofen and
doxepin. A second project involves the development of polymer-supported reagents
to supplant chromic acid for the oxidation of alcohols to ketones. %%% With this
Environmentally Benign Chemical Synthesis and Processing award, the Synthetic
Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. George A. Kraus of the
Department of Chemistry at Iowa State University. Dr. Kraus will focus his work
on a photochemical alternatives to commercial scale reactions now requiring
aluminum chloride or chromic acid as key reagents. The approach would eliminate
the production of vast quantities of toxic by-products. ***
