This action funds Ella Revzin of University of Illinois-Chicago to conduct a
research project, entitled "A bootstrap procedure for linear mixed models under
weak heterogeneity assumption," during the summer of 2012 at Soochow University
Center for Advanced Statistics and Econometrics Research in Suzhou,
Jiangsu,China. The host scientist is Dr. Lijian Yang.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is development of a simple
statistical method for testing the significance of parameter estimates of a
Linear Mixed Model for longitudinal and panel data. The proposed bootstrapping
procedure applies to a very general class of Linear Model specifications and
provides better accuracy than asymptotic methods.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
