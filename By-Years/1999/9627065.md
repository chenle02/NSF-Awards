This research includes a quantitative X-ray resonant magnetic scattering study
of the magnetic phase behavior of the HoPr site- random thin film alloy as
function of concentration. The study entails: o chemical and magnetic structural
characterization of HoPr samples ranging in concentration of 20%Pr/80%Ho to
80%Pr/20%Ho to elucidate the RKKY indirect magnetic exchange interaction in the
rare earth elements. o Studies of magnetic wavevector and the magnetic order
parameter of Ho and Pr atoms separately, by tuning the incident energy at the Ho
LIIIedge and Pr LIIedge. o Measurement of the induced moments on the Pr atoms.
The research also includes characterization of the interfaces in the
semiconductor system InAs/GaSb, by X-ray reflectivity and anomalous scattering.
This artificially grown quantum heterojunction, has received considerable
research attention, due to the potential application for optical and electronic
devices. The interactive activities include: teaching two courses in project
WISE; collaborating with Prof. Emilio Mendez on semiconductor research, and
interacting with Prof. Richard Gambino on new magnetic materials and Prof. Peter
Stephens on synchrotron related projects; acting as advisor and mentor to the
female students in physics; and presenting a formal graduate seminar in X-ray
magnetic scattering.
