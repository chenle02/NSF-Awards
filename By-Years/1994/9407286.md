9407286 Graham This project is on research to improve the bioremediation of
halogenated compounds by increasing the expression and activity of the soluble
methane monooxygenase (sMMO) enzyme in methanotrophic bacteria. The strategy is
to culture wild-type and mutant strains of bacteria in various copper, nitrogen,
and oxygen environments, while monitoring sMMO and nitrogenase expression and
activity. The co-oxidation rates of a variety of environmental pollutants will
be quantified for selected strains, with attention to the influence of nitrogen
limitation. These pollutants include halogenated ethanes, halomethanes and
selected pesticides. Finally, the expression and activity patterns will be
related to the environmental conditions by a model which will be used to develop
reactor designs. ***
