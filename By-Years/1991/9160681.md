The basic idea behind the proposed research is to establish multiple spatial
channels at the same "frequency" - Spatial-Division Multiple Access - using
parameter estimation techniques from array processing. Phase I efforts will
include the development of accurate software models of the electromagnetic
environment, extensive simulation studies using the ESPRIT algorithm and other
parameter estimation algorithms, and the development of signal detection,
estimation, and demodulation techniques which can be used to accomplish the
channel assignment. These efforts will culminate in the specification of an
experimental system which will be used to test the proposed techniques in a
realistic environment.
