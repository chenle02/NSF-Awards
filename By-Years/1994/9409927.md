9409927 Braddock-Wilking U. of Missouri - St. Louis Dr. Janet Braddock-Wilking,
Chemistry Department, University of Missouri - St. Louis, is supported by the
Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division with a Research Planning Grant to develop synthetic routes to
polyhedral cage compounds of silicon containing peripheral transition metal
substituents. First, a series of (trichlorosilyl)metal complexes will be
generated by the oxidative addition of trichlorosilane to electron-rich
transition metal complexes. These metal-silyl compounds will then be reductively
coupled using various reducing agents to afford the metal substituted polyhedral
silicon clusters. New silicon nuclear magnetic resonance techniques will be
developed to facilitate the characterization of these compounds. Silicon is one
of the most useful materials available in modern technology, for example,
silicon wafers are central to a large portion of the electronics industry.
However, very little attention has been devoted to the design of precursors
which would permit very small silicon crystals with well defined sizes or
silicon with specific surface properties to be easily obtained. In this research
a new class of compounds will be prepared in which a small number of silicon
atoms are joined to one another to make "cages" of specific sizes and
geometries. Surrounding the silicon cages will be a sheath of another metal.
Ultimately, these compounds are envisioned as precursors for small
"nanoclusters" of silicon and for thin films of metal-silicides.
