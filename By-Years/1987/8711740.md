This is a proposal that is concerned with the efficiency of power producing
systems. Conventional turbines operate at high rotational speeds which impose
high stresses on the blades, so that the use of exotic blading materials for
high-temperature, heightened-efficiency operation is not yet a reality. Another
approach is to use positive displacement expanders which operate at much lower
speeds and have smaller diameters, with much lower resulting stresses. In the
proposal, helical rotor expanders will be studied as candidates for power
cycles. Geometric and thermodynamic modeling will be performed. Application will
be made to several power systems of practical importance.
