The project is implementing a comprehensive, integrated, multi-layered approach
for increasing the number of STEM majors across the State of Washington by
coordinating articulation and matriculation between the Washington MESA
Community College Program, the University of Washington, and Washington State
University. The comprehensive approach is being achieved through established
synergy and strong institutional support at the partner colleges and
universities. The project, a follow-on to a prior STEP award, is (1) expanding
its focus from engineering to all STEM disciplines while strongly emphasizing
the inclusion of underrepresented students, (2) increasing the number of
community colleges active in the consortium, (3) standardizing the retention and
transfer services and activities by migrating towards the successful MESA
Community College STEM transfer model, (4) institutionalizing the MESA academic
support model for STEM transfers at participating community colleges, and (5)
replicating the successful components and services of the MESA K-20 Pathway
across Washington. They are disseminating the project's findings and best
practices at professional technical society meetings and through organizations
such as the National Action Council of Minority Engineering Program
Administrators (NAMEPA), Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native
Americans in the Sciences (SACNAS), and National Society of Black Engineers
(NSBE). A workforce development center at the University of Washington is
monitoring progress towards the project goals by collecting and analyzing data
on the number of students and their grades, retention and transfer rates, self
confidence levels, and impressions of program effectiveness. Broader impacts
include a major focus on increasing the participation of underrepresented
minority students and the dissemination of the projects' approaches and
evaluation results.
