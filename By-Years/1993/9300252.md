This project will bring seven students per year to the Computer Science
Engineering Department's Architecture and Parallel Processing Laboratory at the
University of Texas at Arlington. The focus of recruiting will be on upper
division women, minority, and disabled students, with special emphasis on
institutions in the Dallas/Fort Worth area that lack research facilities. The
program will extend over a three year period. The students will investigate
problems related to parallel program development, debugging, scheduling, and
performance profiling.
