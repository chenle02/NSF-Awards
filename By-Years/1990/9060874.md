The objective of this project is to examine the feasibility of using a wire mesh
coated with a base-metal catalyst for removal and oxidation of soot from the
exhaust of diesel engines. A number of base-metal catalysts are examined with
respect to their oxidation efficiency and ease of application to a steel mesh.
This approach promises an inexpensive, effective, and efficient means of
controlling particulates from small and large diesel engines used in
transportation systems. Such control is mandated by the Clean Air Act, but
effective technology to accomplish this is lacking.
