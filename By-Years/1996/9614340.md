9614340 Thurlow The Mount Washington Observatory will produce a nationally
syndicated, short-format radio series on the weather over a three year period.
The request is for a declining amount in each of the three years with the
project becoming self-sustaining at the end of that period. The daily, two-
minute programs present facts about and explanations of the physical processes
in all levels of the atmosphere, the nature of meteorological systems, weather
observation and forecasting, and first- and second-hand accounts relating the
effect weather and climate have on people. During a fifteen month pilot stage,
Weatherwise (Title to be changed to The Weather Notebook) has been carried on
115 public and commercial stations. The NSF grant will provide the producers
with the resources needed to expand carriage with a goal of carriage on at least
225 stations, to implement formative and summative evaluation, to upgrade
production, to increase promotion, and to make ancillary material available to
the public. The ancillary materials will include a printed weather notebook
which serves as a field guide for listeners in which they can make their own
weather observations and draw conclusions, an educational weather poster, The
Weather Notebook transcripts and study suggestions, and a weather observation
exhibit at the Mount Washington Observatory Museum. The PI for the project will
be David Thurlow of the Mount Washington Observatory who will serve as writer,
host, and program coordinator. The producer will be Douglas Mayer whose previous
experience includes with NPR on Car Talk. Evaluation will be conducted by RMC
Research Corporation.
