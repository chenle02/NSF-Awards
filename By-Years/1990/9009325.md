In a honey bee colony, the workers are physiologically capable of laying eggs
that develop into males, but in colonies with a queen nearly all reproduction,
both males and females, is through the queen. This seemingly conflicts with the
genetic interest of individual workers, who are more closely related to their
own sons than to their mother's sons, and might thus gain greater evolutionary
fitness by laying eggs themselves. Dr. Visscher's research will examine what
interactions underlie the lack of worker reproduction, and will test the
hypothesis that this colony-level cooperation in reproduction is the result of
mutual "policing" by sister workers. "Policing," or bees preventing the
reproduction of their sisters in favor of their mother, may raise the costs and
lower the potential benefits of attempting personal reproduction, so that the
inherently conflicting interests of workers are realigned. This "forced
cooperation" in turn would facilitate further evolution of cooperative behavior,
enhancing selection for workers to increase their inclusive fitness by
increasing colony resources through cooperation, rather than manipulating colony
resources toward their personal reproduction. Honey bees are of economic
importance as producers of honey and especially as pollinators of many
agricultural crops. Dr. Visscher's research will contribute to knowlege of their
reproductive biology, which may prove useful in bee breeding or in genetic
control of honey bees with undesirable traits, such as Africanized honey bees.
This research also will contribute to the general theory of social behavior.
Understanding how genetic conflicts among individuals in an insect society are
resolved will shed light on how highly cooperative social behavior has evolved.
