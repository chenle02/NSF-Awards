This is the first year of a postdoctoral fellowship award to Dr. Michael
Raftery. Dr. Raftery received his Ph.D. for work with Alexander Pines at
Berkeley. He will be working with Robin Hochstrasser at Pennsylvania in order to
learn about the application of ultrafast infrared laser spectroscopy to the
study of energy transfer at the surface of adsorbates on metals and
semiconductor nanoclusters. This represents a new direction for which Dr Raftery
is well-prepared from his graduate studies applying NMR to motions at surfaces.
%%% This is the first year of a postdoctoral fellowship award to Dr. Michael
Raftery. He will be studying basic properties of adsorbates. These materials
have the potential of improving the quality and performance of electrical
circuits and could have a wide range of applications to the miniaturization of
electronics.
