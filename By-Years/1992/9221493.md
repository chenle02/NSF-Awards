This award provides support for the travel of Dr. William Randle of the
University of Georgia to conduct cooperative research with Dr. Jane Elizabeth
Lancaster of the newly instituted New Zealand Crown Research Institute for Crop
and Food Research. The research will investigate biochemical aspects of sulfur
partitioning in the onion (Allium cepa). The presence of sulfur compounds in
onions is of importance in determining flavor intensity. The research will
describe how sulfur is differentially mobilized and partitioned among cultivars
in a plant expending considerable energy in sulfur metabolism, will determine
sulfur-compound accumulation in the flavor biosynthetic pathway, and will
describe the role of flavor enzymes in differential flavor intensity. The
project joins the complementary skills of Dr. Randle as a geneticist and plant
breeder and those of Dr. Lancaster in the biochemistry and physiology of sulfur
compounds. Since the principal investigators work in different hemispheres, two
crops of onions can be produced under natural photoperiods in a single year.
Travel by Dr. Lancaster to the University of Georgia will be funded through the
New Zealand Ministry of Research, Science and Technology (MORST).
