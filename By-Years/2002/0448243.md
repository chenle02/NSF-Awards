This project's ultimate goal is to explain protein-RNA conformational
dynamics.For efficient catalysis, information from the Escherichia coli
methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS) anticodon binding domain must be transmitted
to a remote active site upon interaction with the enzyme's cognate tRNA.
Biochemical evidence suggests this signaling event requires changes in both RNA
and protein structure. Such long-range conformational changes are probably very
common in macromolecular machines, such as ribosomes and spliceosomes, and,
therefore, of fundamental biological importance, yet they remain virtually
unexplored. The MetRS model system, amenable to detailed, quantitative analysis,
will help to remedy this gap. Mutagenetic, kinetic, and spectroscopic approaches
will be used to investigate how a specific peptide component at the domain
interface of MetRS contributes to inter-domain communication. In addition,
crystallography will be used to observe structural differences between MetRS in
complex with its cognate tRNA and substrate analogs and with unliganded enyzme.
Results obtained in this interdisciplinary study will contribute to a new
understanding of inter-domain communication in aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and to
general knowledge about signaling mechanisms in enzymes with distant ligand-
binding and catalytic active sites.

Broader Impacts: The project will engage undergraduate and graduate education at
the interface of biology, chemistry, and physics at Wake Forest University. The
PI carries her knowledge of, and enthusiasm for, science research to ongoing
outreach programs in local public schools. The biotechnology focus of these
teacher workshops and student enrichment activities strengthens local efforts to
motivate and to train rural and urban high school graduates to pursue
postsecondary science careers. These efforts enhance both the PI's career
development in research and education and the community's scientific awareness
and training with an eye toward economic growth.
