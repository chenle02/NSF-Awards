9351051 Reeves A Gemini 200 NMR with capabilities for both proton and carbon
spectra is being used in the sophomore organic course, instrumental analysis,
physical chemistry, spectroscopy, and undergraduate research. Work stations are
providing the multi- user capabilities needed for successful undergraduate
classroom (laboratory) teachings. Initially, students are developing the ability
to handle the computer-interfaced NMR instrument and to analyze proton, carbon,
and 2-D spectra. They are continuing on to carry out more complex NMR
experiments and to use the instrument in their senior research projects. ***
