The principal investigator will study a variety of problems raised by current
experiments on parametrically driven surface waves performed in circular and
square geometries. Several models for physical systems appear to exhibit
bifurcations that are non-generic in the context of their natural geometric
symmetry in that the effective symmetry of the bifurcation is larger than the
natural symmetry. These studies will attempt to explain these apparent hidden
symmetries. The analysis of nonlinear hydrodynamic waves is important because of
their wide spread occurrence in nature and because such analyses can serve as a
prototype for other situations.
