This award will provide 52% of the funds required for the upgrade of the
electron microprobe instrument operated by the Department of Earth & Planetary
Sciences at Washington University. The University is committed to providing the
remaining funds needed for the upgrade. The microanalytical quantitative
analysis capabilities of the electron microprobe is used by a large number of
researchers and their students at Washington University in research projects in
petrology, the crustal evolution of West Greenland, lunar and terrestrial
volcanic petrology, and materials science. In addition, the microprobe
laboratory is available as a regional facility to investigators (including
students) from the PEW Consortium colleges (Beloit, Carleton, Grinnell, Hope,
Kalamazoo, Knox, Macalester, Rhodes, St. Olaf, and Trinity), and other
institutions including Saint Louis University, U of Missouri-Rolla, U of
Missouri- Columbia, University of Arkansas, and Auburn University.
