Reverse engineering is the process of estimating the shape of an artifact from
position points scanned over the surface of the object. There are many practical
applications that start with a model for a part and need to acquire a
representation of a modified version of the part. Reverse engineering is
obtaining the parameters of the model so that the shape can be related to its
functional properties. This project will develop an experimental system during a
summer internship for reverse engineering a class of parts that can be modeled
as graph surfaces, and consist of planar and free-form surface patches with
holes. During the course of this summer internship, the principal investigator
and a graduate student will work at the industrial site to implement algorithms
for the tasks that have been identified in this project, and will refine the
ideas through discussions with industrial colleagues.
