This award is made under the Small Grants for Exploratory Research Program to
enable the investigator to collect perishable information on the consequences of
the issuance of a tsunami warning in the United States following the October 4,
1994 earthquake that occurred off the coast of Hokkaido, Japan. The investigator
will identify and document the communication processes, information
transmission, and resulting decisions which occurred during the period that the
tsunami warning was in effect. The warning was issued for four states:
California, Oregon, Washington and Hawaii. The project will compare the
notification and information transmission processes in the four states.
