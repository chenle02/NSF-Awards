This award provides modest partial support to facilitate a sabbatical visit to
Denmark by Professor Jeffry V. Mallow of Loyola University of Chicago. His host
will be Professor Karin Beyer of Roskilde University Center, Roskilde, Denmark.
They share a background in physics and a research interest in the sociology and
psychology of science education, particularly the phenomenon of science
avoidance by women. Dr. Mallow developed a clinic based program to address
science avoidance, while Dr. Beyer's work has emphasized the modification of
classroom interactions. Semester-long reciprocal visits will permit them to
pursue joint research in this important field. They plan to examine data already
acquired on the respective techniques, and to investigate which aspects are
transferable to the school system of the other country. They also intend to
investigate the development of a hybrid technique combining the science anxiety
clinic with classroom intervention. Gender differences in the decision to study
science and mathematics have been recognized for many years. There is a
substantial body of literature now on reactions to mathematics, but less so for
the sciences. Some progress has been made in seeking ways to change girls'
avoidance of science. Recognition and study of the problem has become
internationalized, and results of the research have begun to find application
both in the classroom and in the training of teachers. The collaborators in the
curent proposal are among those actively seeking to advance this field, where
exchanges of experience have proven to be quite valuable.
