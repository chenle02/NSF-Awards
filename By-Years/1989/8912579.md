This research investigates experimentally and theoretically wave-current
interactions in shallow water. Laboratory experiments will be performed in a
three- dimensional wave basin. Steady currents will be generated over a sloping
beach. Small amplitude waves will be generated with different frequencies and
angles of incidence. Measurements of current velocity and wave amplitudes will
be made in detail with and without wave- current interactions. Laboratory data
will be analyzed and used to verify the existing theories and to serve as an
impetus for new theoretical investigations. Theoretical studies will be focused
on the understanding of the steady current system under the influence of
oscillatory waves. Particularly, the stability of the current-wave system will
be examined. Efforts will be also made to develop numerical models describing
the wave- current interaction systems.
