The growth and value of the Internet today are fueled by a variety of wireless
edge networks including WiFi access points in homes and public places, wireless
local area networks (WLANs) in workplaces, cellular data services such as 3G,
multi-hop wireless mesh networks, wireless sensor networks, mobile ad hoc
networks (MANETs), and delay-tolerant networks (DTNs). This diversity poses
fundamental challenges to traditional network protocols that are fragile under
highly fluctuating loss, delay, and topology characteristics, and completely
break down in disruption-prone environments. The diversity increases management
complexity?a network administrator must pick from an intimidating number of
protocol options and optimizations tuned to one environment have to be re-
engineered in a different environment?stifling innovation and the long-term
value of interconnecting diverse wireless edge networks.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal is to architect, analyze, and
implement a simple network protocol stack that ensures robust performance across
diverse wireless edge networks. The key insight is to incorporate uncertainty as
a first-class design concern. We adopt an unusual approach: instead of trying to
make protocols in otherwise well-connected environments robust to intermittent
fluctuations or disruptions, we design for an extreme point in the design
space?an always-partitioned network or a DTN?and work back from those insights
to ensure robust performance of protocols even in well-connected mesh
networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
