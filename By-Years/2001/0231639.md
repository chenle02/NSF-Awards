This research is being done in conjunction with IIS-9731990, which is
being&lt;br/&gt;performed by Michael Pazzani in the Information and Computer
Science&lt;br/&gt;Department at the University of California, Irvine. The
research is&lt;br/&gt;concerned with intelligent decision aids that can be
developed by data&lt;br/&gt;mining techniques. Experience has determined that
such systems can learn&lt;br/&gt;accurate models, but that experts in areas
where those models are used in&lt;br/&gt;decision aids are often reluctant to
trust them because they do not, for&lt;br/&gt;instance, use the same tests
intermediate conclusions or abstractions that&lt;br/&gt;the experts have grown
to trust. Or they do not use certain factors at all&lt;br/&gt;that experts feel
to be relevant. Experts also want models that are stable&lt;br/&gt;under small
changes in the data being analyzed. Psychologists have&lt;br/&gt;discovered
factors that simplify the learning, understanding, and&lt;br/&gt;communication
of category and process information by humans. This research&lt;br/&gt;seeks to
explore these psychological principles in light of the output
of&lt;br/&gt;existing KDD algorithms and then go on to develop and evaluate new
KDD&lt;br/&gt;algorithms that will provide output that is easy for people to
learn , use,&lt;br/&gt;and communicate to others. With the results of this
research, it should be&lt;br/&gt;possible to make such decision aids more "human
centered", so that they&lt;br/&gt;will be used more often and more effectively
in practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.gatech.edu/psychology/faculty.htm&l
