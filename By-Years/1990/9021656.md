The primary focus of this research is to process taxonomic data as they relate
to the taxonomic hierarchy and to biological classifications. Information-
processing models will be developed for such important issues as interactions
between classifications, efficient representation of classifications in a shared
and distributed environment, common frameworks for developing the taxonomic
hierarchy across disciplines, and various query- processing strategies for
hierarchic taxonomic databases. These information-processing models will lead to
the development of a conceptual framework for designing and implementing
databases for taxonomic information. A prototype taxonomic database system will
be built on the foundation of these new concepts. Recursive relation structure
and a new idea on defining views for recursive relations will facilitate the
implementation approach.
