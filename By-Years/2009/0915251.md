TITLE: Spectral analysis, spectral algorithms, and beyond

Spectral algorithms and spectral analysis form the basis for some of the most
efficient and effective techniques in areas ranging from machine learning to
scientific computing, from graphics to data mining, and from collaborative
filtering to VLSI design. They also play a prominent role in combinatorial
optimization, where they are used in algorithms for graph partitioning and
constraint satisfaction. Despite the apparent utility of spectral techniques and
the intense effort devoted to their analysis, our ability to reason about them
rigorously is still very limited. This project addresses the development of an
algorithmically-centered theory of spectral analysis which draws upon tools from
contemporary mathematics, and is inspired by experimental evidence which has, so
far, eluded a satisfactory theoretical explanation. The project also addresses
the relative power of spectral methods from the viewpoint of computational
complexity. This involves the both the study of what cannot be done using only
information about eigenvalues and eigenvectors, as well as what can be achieved
by combining spectral analysis with classical combinatorial approaches, like
computation of graph flows.
