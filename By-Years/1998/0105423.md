New, powerful ME-coefficient measurement techniques are used to study the
effects of strain and dislocations in epitaxial magnetic nano-dots. The effects
of limited lateral dimensions on strain relief and on ME effects are examined by
using interferometric lithography to make highly-regular patterned arrays of
magnetic dots and ovals having lateral feature sizes down to 25 nm and thickness
from 2 to 20 nm. The program focuses on epitaxial Ni80 Fe20 and cobalt films on
Cu-buffered Si (001), materials important for many magnetic thin film
applications. The characterization of the film and dot arrays makes use of (a)
synchrotron x-ray diffraction at BNL to determine strain, (b) torque
magnetometry to characterize magnetic anisotropy, (c) vibrating sample
magnetometry to determine saturation magnetization and Curie temperature, (d)
differential capacitance measurements of first-order and second-order ME
coupling coefficients, as well as (e) UHV and cryogenic magnetic force
microscopy (in collaboration with the University of Basal), and scanning
electron and transmission electron microscopy. Strain and ME coupling
coefficient measurements on arrays at these small dimensions will provide
important information for reliable processing of magnetic thin film devices.
Further, the magnetic dots will mimic the behavior of grains in polycrystalline
materials where grain boundaries provide some relief of intra-grain epitaxial
misfit strain. %%% This study has excellent potential for advances in science
with relevance to new technology in spintronics as well as magnetic random
access memories. ***
