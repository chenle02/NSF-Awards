9727890 Kilpatrick The University of Georgia has a one-year award to publish a
monograph that formulates a concise and explicit statement of the research and
theoretical bases for the standards in the three National Council of Teachers of
Mathematics (NCTM) standards documents. This project is opportunely timed to
coincide with the forthcoming revision of the curriculum, teaching, and
assessment standards-a project termed Standards 2000. Underlying assumptions
that relate to student learning, instructional practice, assessment practice,
teacher development, system change, and the nature of mathematics will be made
explicit in the monograph. Moreover, this publication will not only document
claims made in Standards 2000 but offer contrasting views. With a group of
mathematics educators, mathematicians, teachers, educational theorists and
researchers, and the Standards 2000 working-group leaders, the principal
investigator will convene a three-day conference to structure a publication that
will be accessible to classroom teachers. It will allow the writers of Standards
2000 to link their work to a complementary document containing a detailed
discussion of relevant research and citations of the literature. While intended
primarily for mathematics teachers, the monograph is designed to reach a much
wider audience that includes policy makers, administrators, supervisors,
mathematicians, and teacher educators. A formal review process is in place to
ensure that these diverse voices are heard. Plans will be developed for
utilizing the World Wide Web to get feedback from an even wider audience before
a final draft is offered for publication and subsequent distribution. The
project will provide a much-needed, succinct, and clearly formulated statement
of theory and research relevant to Standards 2000.
