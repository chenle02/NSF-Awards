Performance feedback, which is essential to learning, may be compromised in
interracial contexts by a positive bias. Previous work by the PI shows that
Whites provide less criticism and more praise to Blacks than to Whites for work
of equal merit. The current research program is designed to determine the cause
of this positive feedback bias. Specifically, it tests whether the bias is
motivated by Whites' efforts to protect their own egalitarian self-images. These
egalitarian motives have been implicated as a cause of out-group deference in
other contexts, and the PI's earlier studies strongly hinted that these motives
might affect interracial feedback. However, the influence of egalitarian motives
on interracial feedback has not yet been directly tested.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funded research includes two experiments that test
whether egalitarian self-image concerns contribute to the positive feedback
bias. Study 1 will test whether the feedback bias is decreased when feedback
suppliers' egalitarianism has been validated. Study 2 will test whether the
feedback bias is increased when feedback supplier's egalitarianism has been
challenged, especially by the race-related content of the work being evaluated.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In addition to testing the egalitarian motive hypothesis,
these studies will explore whether the positive feedback bias applies to
minorities other than Blacks (specifically Latinos). The studies will also test
whether teacher trainees, who will regularly deliver academic feedback upon
assumption of their teaching duties, demonstrate the positive bias. This
research may help us understand the positive feedback bias and why minority
students are chronically under-challenged. This bias may erode minority
students' faith in praise they legitimately earn. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
