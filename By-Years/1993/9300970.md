This Americas Program award will partially support travel expenses of a group
of mathematicians from the Caribbean region and from Latin America to a
workshop/conference on representation theory of groups and finite- dimensional
algebras, sponsored by the Caribbean Mathematics Foundation, (CMF). The workshop
will take place in Curacao, Netherlands Antilles, August 4 - 13, 1993. Dr. Jorge
Martinez, University of Florida, Gainesville, is the organizer, with Dr.
Geoffrey R. Robinson, University of Florida as coorganizer. The workshop will
consist of survey lectures, presenting an introduction to Representation Theory
of Groups and Finite Dimensional Algebras. The main objective of the workshop is
to contribute to the development of mathematics in the region by adding to the
knowledge and background of the participating young researchers and students.
The proceedings of this workshop/conference will be published, and several
volumes of the work will be made available, free of charge, to individuals and
libraries in the Region. The program will bring together mathematicians from the
developed mathematical community and their colleagues from the Caribbean region
and Latin America. Among the speakers are several eminent mathematicians who are
at the cutting edge of research in the field. From the international
perspective, benefits will include establishment of dialogue and communication
for future research collaboration between mathematicians from different
countries; promotion of the international exchange of scientific knowledge; and
strengthening of the mathematical infrastructure of the countries of the region
through linkages to prominent researchers and mathematical institutes in
developed countries.
