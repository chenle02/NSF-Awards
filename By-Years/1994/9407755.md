9407755 Warde 1. Design, fabricate and characterize 2-D arrays of GaAs-based
optoelectronic circuits in which each pixel consists of an optical detector,
transistor logic and analog decision circuits, and a light modulation or
generation element. Initially, ferroelectric liquid crystals will be used for
light modulation element and ultimately, laser diodes will be used for light
generation. Nearest neighbor interpixel electrical communication and local
configuration memory will also be incorporated. 2. Build versatile hybrid
optical processors by employing these arrays of OEICs cascaded in conjunction
with in-house fabricated high efficiency computer-generated holograms, a 2-D
detector array and an electronic controller. 3. Characterize these optical
processors and demonstrate their operation in systems for solving difficult
pattern recognition tasks. In specific, these OEIC processors will be programmed
with algorithms implementing unconstrained handwritten character and word
recognition functions we have developed. ***
