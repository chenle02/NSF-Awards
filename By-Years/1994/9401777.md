9401777 Soffer Two main topics will be investigated. In the Cauchy problem for
the nonlinear wave equation, the results of Ginibre-Soffer- Velo on the critical
power nonlinear wave equation which are complete for the radial case will be
further developed to include the general data. It is based on applying new
Lebesgue pth power bounds which allow the control of the p-norm of a function in
terms of singular weighted norms and partial regularity. In the theory of three
body dispersive systems a new class of dilations, deformed by various partitions
of unity to cluster decompositions will be used. This will allow proofs of local
decay and other spectral properties of three body dispersive equations. Modern
physics, quantum mechanics and relativity, is a product of the twentieth
century. It is founded firmly in the last century's attempt to address the
microstructure of matter and to come to grips with the concept of action-at-a
distance, electro-magnetism, and heat radiation. The mathematical foundations
for these developments collectively called mathematical physics, ranges from
detailed analysis of Schroedinger operators, which governs the dynamics of
particles, to unified field theory, which attempts to unite the four known
forces into a single force. ***
