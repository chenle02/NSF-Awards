Professor de la Llave will study several maximal operators that control many
problems. In dynamical systems, he will investigate cocycle equations and their
applications to rigidity problems, and computational Kolmogorov . Arnold . Moser
theory. He will also develop methods to obtain numerically accurate lower bounds
for Schrodinger operators. This research project concetrates on several
questions in mathematical analysis that are relevant to dynamical systems and to
the N.body problem in quantum mechanics. A wide variety of methods will be used.
On the one hand, regularity problems will be approached by the traditional
methods of hard analysis, defining appropriate spaces and proving sharp
estimates for operators acting on them. On the other hand, the research will
systematically use computers, not only as a heuristic aid but also in a
framework being developed by de la Llave and others for automating the routine
parts of proofs of analytic estimates. This will make it possible to employ
proof strategies inaccessible to a human mathematician just because of the large
amount of elementary work involved.
