This research addresses a new solder application method, using ink-jet printing
technology, to produce and place molten solder droplets onto various substrates.
Ink-jet based solder deposition would be low cost (no masks or screens are
required), flexible (the image is stored and formed digitally), suitable for
manufacturing environment (does not operate in a vacuum like liquid metal ion
systems), highly repeatable, and high resolution. Specific applications would
include formation of solder bumps on integrated circuits for TAB or flip-chip
interconnection, or selective application of top metallization for fine pitch
surface mount assembly, chip-on-board (COB), or multichip modules (MCM's).
Direct-write solder technology would be ideal for rework, including both chip or
package replacement, and metallization or personalization of circuitry for high
density interconnection (HDI) substrates.
