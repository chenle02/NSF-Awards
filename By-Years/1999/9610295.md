This projects seeks efficient algorithms for learning complex concepts from
examples and other kinds of information. A major focus on the "other kinds of
information" that may serve to reduce the computational difficulty of learning
complex concepts, including queries to a teacher, advantageous order of
presentation of examples, the presence of related concepts, and constraits
imposed by real-world situations (e.g., robot navigation, language learning).
New models of interaction between a teacher and a learner will be developed and
explored. Techniques from computational complexity, the theory of automata and
formal languages, the analysis of algorithms, and cryptography will be used to
define and explore models of efficient learnability.
