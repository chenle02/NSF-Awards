This project will investigate a new approach to learning models of dynamical
systems for use in advanced reinforcement learning architectures. It will
develop a method by which a reinforcement learning system can learn multiple
time scale models and use them as the basis for hierarchical learning and
planning. the project(s objectives are to develop the mathematical theory of
this approach, to examine its relationship to control theory and to behavioral
and neural models of learning, and to demonstrate its effectiveness in a number
of simulated learning tasks. The significance of the project for engineeirng is
that the use of TD models will be major generalization of RL architectures,
making them much more widely applicable. It also has the possibility of
establshing the utility of TD modesl for system identification in more
conventional adaptive control. The project also has implication for our
understanding of animal learning able to model indirect and direct associations
and their interactions in a mathematically principled way. An Additinoal impact
of this research will be t o strengthen links between engineering, artifical
intellegence, and biological studies of learning, thereby contributng to all
three areas by facilitating a transfer of concepts and methods.
