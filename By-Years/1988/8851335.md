The equipment obtained through this project is enabling this institution to
provide an appropriate theoretical and practical background for students
enrolling in a Biotechnology minor that addresses both the need for entry-level
technicians in the growing field of biotechnology and the preparation of
undergraduates who will go on to pursue advanced academic degrees. The new minor
includes three laboratory courses (Molecular Biology Laboratory, Tissue Culture
Techniques, and Protein Laboratory Techniques) that are designed to give each
student substantial amounts of "hands-on" experience in basic and specialized
techniques in these areas. Grant funds are being used to purchase essential
equipment of three types: (a) small equipment needed to equip four student
stations (four students/station); (b) several intensive-use items such as HPLCs
and laminar flow hoods; and (c) specialty equipment that will introduce
undergraduates to "state-of-the-art" technology (e.g., a DNA synthesizer). Such
equipment is providing for a smooth sequence of offerings, ranging from "special
topic" experiences for only a few students to the complete courses with labs
that are essential to creating a well defined curriculum. This biotechnology
program is regarded as having good potential for becoming a national model that
can be replicated in other institutions. The grantee institution is matching the
NSF award with an equal sum obtained from non-Federal sources.
