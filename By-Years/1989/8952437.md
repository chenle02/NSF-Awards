The advanced laboratory sequence serves students having a variety of final
goals; graduate school, industrial employment and teaching. Accordingly, a wide
variety of experiments and teaching modes are used in this sequence. To ensure
the quality of this sequence in a context of rapid developments in modern
instrumentation, we must add experiments that expose the students to
measurements which: (i) produce large volumes of data requiring detailed
analysis, (ii) are examples of modern technologies, and (iii) require more than
a perfunctory interaction with computers. Purchase of rf equipment and digital
oscilloscopes will enable pulsed NMR and second-sound experiments to produce
large-volume, high-quality data. Purchase of fiber optics components and certain
accessories for an existing high-vacuum thin film evaporator will enable the
development of experiments illustrating aspects of the modern technologies of
fiber optics, thin film fabrication and thin-film properties, and vacuum
techniques. Purchase of PC's will permit the automation of some experiments, the
introduction of Fourier transform techniques, and increase student access to
data analysis facilities. Purchase of logic analyzers permits a critical
examination of experiment-computer interfacing requirements.
