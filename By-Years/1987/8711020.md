This proposal is for an International Group Travel Grant to enable twenty
prominent American scientists to participate in an on-going US-USSR Binational
Symposium on Laser Optics of Condensed Matter. The topic of the conference is an
important area of research where both US and USSR scientists have made
significant progress. A $15,000 travel grant is recommended with the highest
priority.
