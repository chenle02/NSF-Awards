This work will determine experimentally the partitioning behavior of Sc, Y, La,
Sm, Lu, and Ni between ortho- and clino pyroxene and a range of natural mafic
silicate magmas. Previous investigations have been on synthetic, rather than
natural, melts and at higher temperature. The information obtained will help us
to interpret the way that natural magmatic systems have evolved as they rose
within the earth.
