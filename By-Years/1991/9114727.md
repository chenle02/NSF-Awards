This is a project to initiate a field program to determine the pattern of
strain accumulation across the Juan de Fuca ridge by establishing and repeatedly
resurveying a network of benchmarks in the vicinity of the ridge crest. the
system involves interrogation of precision acooustic transponders from a
near.bottom towed survey vehicle and use of the resulting range measurements to
determine the internal geometry of the array.
