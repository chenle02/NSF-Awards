Jayendran Rasaiah of the Chemistry Department of the University of Maine at
Orono is funded jointly by the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division and the Office of Experimental Programs to Stimulate Competitive
Research, to study the dynamics and structure of ionic solutions and polar
fluids. In this research the mobility of ions in solution will be investigated
by molecular dynamics, the phase transitions in polar fluids by Gibbs ensemble
simulations, the dynamics of the electric double layer by integral equations,
and the theory of bolaform electrolytes using integral equations. This research
should produce new insights in the understanding of transport and equilibrium
properties of electrolytes in systems of biological and technological relevance.
