1438255&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed work is to study the
propulsion of biological cells that utilize their extremely deformable membrane
to move. Cells can deform and extend a protrusion, called pseudopod, by
streaming flow internally in a particular direction of the cell membrane, and
the pseudopod is used to move the cell. This is a proposal to study the
pseudopod-based propulsion of deformable cells from a fluid mechanical viewpoint
using a combination of high-fidelity computational modeling, theoretical
analysis and experimental measurements. In terms of impact on health, the
project may provide a mechanistic understanding of how to inhibit propulsive
mechanisms of malignant cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While fluid mechanical
analysis of the streaming flow has been carried out recently in plant cells,
which are non-deforming and non-propulsive, the relationship between the
streaming flow, pseudopod dynamics, and motor activity is unknown in deformable
cells. The co-PIs propose to develop a multiscale, 3D computational model of the
interface deformation driven by molecular motors. The model will predict
simultaneously the dynamic cell shape, the flow field, and motor activity. In
parallel, micro-PIV experiments will be performed in live amoeboid cells to
extract the 2-component quasi-instantaneous intra-cellular velocity field. Using
analysis of the simulation and experimental data, the nature and origin of the
streaming flow in deforming cells, and its relation to pseudopod dynamics will
be explored.&lt;br/&gt;This award by the Fluid Dynamics Program of the CBET
