Optimization in engineering design is an important aspect of the design process.
It aims at a more efficient and rational allocation of resources resulting in
improved productivity. This research aims at extension of local monotonicity to
optimal design of large systems of mechanical components which are encountered
very often in mechanical design. The idea of decomposition theory will be used
to break down a large-scale nonlinearly constrained design optimization problem
into a collection of small problems. These small problems will then be optimized
and their solutions coordinated in a prescribed manner, leading to the solution
to the original problem. Problems arising from the design and/or application of
mechanical systems will be used as guiding examples. The result of this work
will complement the existing numerical optimization techniques, in particular
those which are used for solving large-scale constrained nonlinear optimization
problems.
