ABSTRACT DMS - 0204985 PI: Borthwick

The principal investigator will study spectral geometry in three basic contexts.
For smooth infinite-volume hyperbolic manifolds (without cusps), he will study
the question of finiteness of classes of surfaces with the same resonance set,
refine techniques involving determinants that he and his co-authors have already
developed, and study resonances as functions of the deformation space of a
hyperbolic structure. For the more general class of asymptotically hyperbolic
manifolds, the main goal is to analyze the determinants and relative
determinants and use them to derive geometric constraints from resonance data.
The techniques developed will be applied to define determinants and obtain
constraints for exterior domains in two and three dimensions as well. A final
goal is to understand the basic spectral theory of a broader class of negatively
curved surfaces. Here the objectives are to determine the essential spectrum and
prove a limiting absorption principle which will characterize the essential
spectrum and lead towards the establishment of a scattering theory.

Geometric spectral theory lies at the interface of the fields of differential
geometry and mathematical physics. In physical theories such as quantum
mechanics or wave propagation, one can draw a natural distinction between
geometric properties of a system, meaning the underlying structure, and analytic
properties, which reflect how the physics of the system behaves. Analytic
properties, of which the spectrum is a prime example, are generally the aspects
of a system most readily determined by experiment (for example, component colors
of light emitted by stars, or frequency spikes in a radar scan). In many
physical applications, the basic goal is to derive information about the
geometric structure from the spectral data. The PI will pursue this goal in
settings for which one already has good sources of conjectures and mathematical
tools. Understanding the spectral theory of these cases will provide new
geometric invariants of interest in differential geometry, while developing
intuition for problems of a more applied nature.
