The Center for Environmental Research and Education at the State University of
New York at Buffalo was established to coordinate and enhance ongoing research
and education activities concerned with environmental problems of the Great
Lakes Basin. Some of the activities of this center include basic and applied
research, educational training in environmental science, and developing
collaborative interactions between the Center and local, state and federal
governmental agencies as well as industrial corporations and community groups
concerned with environmental issues. This award allows the Center to renovate
over 5000 gross square feet to be used by researchers and students of the
environmental sciences, focusing on issues like chemical contamination, toxic
effects of anthropogenic organic chemical contamination on ecosystems and
humans, and water ecology and pollutant effect on fish and wildlife. Finally,
this renovation project fosters basic research and training in one of the
Nation's strategic research areas, environmental science.
