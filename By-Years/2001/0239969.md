A workshop entitled NSF-EC: From Nanomaterials to Nanotechnology will provide an
opportunity for U.S. scientists and engineers to address together with their
European colleagues nanomaterials research activities in four thematic areas:
Nano-Chemistry to include nanoparticle, nanotube and nanowire formation and
properties; Nano-materials research activities to include atomic and molecular
assembly into functional materials; Nano-biosystems research to include
nanomaterials in bioengineering activities; and nano-devices to include
nanomagnetics, nanoelectronics, nanophotonics and sensors. In addition to
presentations by both National Science Foundation (NSF) and European Community
(EC) participants in each of these four theme areas, two roundtable discussions
will cover issues such as the differences between U.S. and European
nanotechnology development, and the role of the academic lab in addressing
priority areas such as nanomaterials scale-up challenges. The outcome for the
workshop will be a report co-authored by participants highlighting opportunities
in basic nanomaterials research for US-EC collaborations.

Nanotechnology research enables discoveries and innovations over a broad range
of academic and industrial areas of high priority to the United States. This is
the last in a series of five nanotechnology workshops jointly organized by the
U.S. National Science Foundation and the European Commission to define the
broader context for possible NSF-EC materials research collaborations. A
significant emphasis on the societal impact of nanoscience and nanotechnology
has been a focus of these workshops.
