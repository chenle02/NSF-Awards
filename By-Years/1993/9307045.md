This project studies fundamental network problems, including maximum, minimum-
cost, and multicommodity flow problems, shortest paths problems, minimum cut
problems, and the assignment problem. These are classical combinatorial
optimization problems that have numerous applications. Designing efficient
algorithms and understanding combinatorial structure of these problems is
important from a theoretical point of view because these problems are very basic
to the field, and from a practical point of view because instances of these
problems need to be solved. There is interest in extending the results of this
work to related problems, such as linear programming. The research has three
interrelated components: (1) the first involves a better understanding of
combinatorial structure of these problems; (2) the second involves development
of new algorithms that improve currently known bounds on the problem complexity;
and (3) the third involves experimental evaluation of the currently existing and
newly developed algorithms. The worst-case theoretical efficiency does not
always correspond to practical efficiency. Experimental evaluation of existing
and newly developed algorithms for some of the problems is of interest. The
experimental research also motivates theoretical research by identifying
subproblems and data structures needed by the implementations and by suggesting
variations of algorithms which may be more efficient than the original variants
originating in theoretical research.
