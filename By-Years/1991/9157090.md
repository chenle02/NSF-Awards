Research in the areas of micromechanics modelling, finite elements and fracture
mechanics as they relate to composite material systems will be performed. Of
particular interest is the design, including shape optimization, of fiber-
reinforced and laminated, ceramic or metal matrix structural composite
components with optimum microstructure. This approach bridges the micro- and
macro- mechanical composite behavior and requires the use of both theoretical
and non-linear finite element analyses.
