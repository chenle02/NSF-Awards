The goal of this work is to understand certain aspects of how light interacts
with the condensed phase. The emphasis is on understanding fundamental processes
and making the fundamental inventions that are expected to feed into areas of
technological interest. This research is aimed at using Raman Spectroscopic
methods to learn more detail about intermolecular interactions and dynamical
processes in solids. Picosecond laser experiments also will be carried out to
help determine mechanisms of energy disposal in organic solids using a new
method of impurity pumping. This approach, combined with experiments that use
direct pumping of vibrational overtone states with infrared radiation, is
expected to yield new information about energy relaxation pathways in the ground
states of organic materials. Proton transfer will be examined by means of time
resolved spectroscopy.
