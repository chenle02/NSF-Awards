This research takes a new approach to understanding the changes occurring in
solution chemistry during localized corrosion. Ion chromatography is employed to
probe the progression of solution chemistry within occluded cells. Ion
chromatography is capable of detecting nanogram quantities of a wide variety of
ions in solution volumes as low as 10 microliters. This technique permits the
analysis of changes in solution chemistry at localized corrosion sites such as
in crevices. New insights can be obtained into the fundamental processes that
control corrosion pit formation and propagation. Surface analysis techniques
(Auger spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) are used to examine
the composition of passive films and surface corrosion layers that form before
and after the onset of corrosion. %%% Localized corrosion of metals and alloys
in aqueous environments is an especially damaging form of environmental attack.
It has generally been accepted that the cause of the initiation and propagation
of a localized corrosion site is the formation of a highly aggressive
environment in an occluded cell that comprises the area of attack. Understanding
obtained from the approach described in this study could have a significant
impact on the development of strategies for mitigating pitting and crevice
corrosion.
