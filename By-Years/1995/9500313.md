9500313 Majetich Metal and alloy nanocrystals prepared in a carbon arc are
interesting candidates for magnetic applications in xerography, magnetic
resonance imaging, ferrofluids, data storage, and magnetic inks. Preliminary
results demonstrate three potential advantages over existing materials: 1) the
carbon coating prevents oxidation, 2) this process may be more efficient than
other methods for preparing nanoparticles in the 10-100 nm size range, and 3)
alloy nanoparticles with large magnetocrystalline anisotropy show room
temperature magnetic stability. The research will explore scientific questions
critical to the technical applications of these nanoparticles. One thrust area
includes experiments to understand the formation of the carbon coating, and to
correlate reaction parameters and particle morphology. This knowledge is used to
optimize the growth process and to scale up production, both of which are
essential for commercialization. The second thrust area focus as on magnetic
characterization. Theoretical models of fine particle magnets are used to design
nanoparticles with room temperature hysteresis required for data storage. After
generation in the carbon are, the magnetic behavior of the nanoparticles are
studied with DC and AC magnetometry, thermomagnetic analysis, Mossbauer
spectroscopy, zero field NMR, and magnetic circular dichroism. The results are
compared with technical benchmarks for the different applications to determine
which possibilities are promising. New experimental data for alloy nanocrystals
are compared with fine particle magnetism predictions to expand the fundamental
understanding of hysteresis and switching rates in monodomain magnets.
