This award provides support for a portion of the work of the Arcadia project.
Arcadia is a major, joint research effort the aim of which is to gain
fundamental understandings about desirable architectures for the integration of
software tools into environments and particularly in support of software
testing, analysis and evaluation. Arcadia is an experimental research project
which aims to gain these understandings through the creation and experimental
evaluation of an actual environment prototype--Arcadia-1. A key innovative
feature of the approach being taken by Arcadia is to consider software processes
to be items of software themselves and to view an environment as a mechanism for
specifying, compiling and interpreting these processes, using software workers
as intepretation primitives. The University of Colorado's participation in the
Arcadia project will focus on formalisms and media for the expression of
software processes--an activity which is referred to as process programming--on
architectures and implementations of environments for the support of process
programming and on the creation, integration and evaluation of software testing,
analysis and evaluation tools. Major experimental research efforts are needed to
provide basic understandings of overall software development environments. The
Arcadia project is a significant effort toward achieving those understandings.
