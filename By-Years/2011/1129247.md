The Cyber Defense Education and Training (C-DET) Scholarship Program offered by
Norfolk State University (NSU) Information Assurance, Research, Education and
Development Institute (IA-REDI) is a Federal Cyber Service: Scholarship for
Service (SFS) program which is supporting three cohorts of undergraduate and
graduate students in Information Assurance (IA).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Highly
trained NSU IA-REDI faculty with expertise in information assurance are serving
as instructors and mentors for the SFS Scholars. C-DET Scholars are engaging in
cutting edge research projects and have access to state of the art equipment and
IA industry leaders. The goals of this project include: (a) Guiding students in
obtaining meaningful summer internships and permanent placement in the Federal
Government. (b) Providing mentoring and close monitoring to ensure their success
in the program. (c) Involving students in research projects and requiring
presentations on IA topics to faculty and peers in an active seminar series. (d)
Providing scholarship recipients with opportunities to interact with IA experts
from industry and academia via guest lectures and industry tours. (e) Engaging
scholarship recipients in organizations such as the Information Assurance Club,
and competitions such as the Mid-Atlantic Regional Collegiate Cyber Defense
Competition (CCDC) and the Digital Forensics Challenge
(DC3).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is having an immediate impact on the
cybersecurity capabilities of the federal workforce by providing graduates with
security skills to federal agencies. NSU's Computer Science Department consists
of approximately 300 undergraduate and graduate students of which 90% belong to
various minority groups. The establishment of this scholarship program is having
an immediate impact on increasing the number of trained IA professionals from
under-represented groups entering the Federal Cyber Service program. The project
is conducting IA awareness and education activities involving high school
students through various departmental and university liaison programs.
