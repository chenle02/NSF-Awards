9730586 Unruh PRISMS (Physics Resources and Instructional Strategies for
Motivating Students) is a series of physics activities designed to engage high
school students and their teachers in constructivist learning of physics in the
context of everyday and interesting phenomena. The activities employ the
learning cycle and address student preconceptions. Students explore physical
phenomena, find patterns and relationships and develop explanations and
interpretations for how nature works. PRISMS has been disseminated in the
National Diffusion Network and via teacher workshops. The PRISMS activities are
to be revised to more completely address the National Science Education
Standards. New activities demonstrate connections to other disciplines, increase
the level of inquiry by introducing longer term projects and requiring
communication to parents and other students, and incorporate technological
design and educational technologies. Authentic assessments and rubrics for their
use are developed. Activities are also available in Spanish. Teachers are
involved in the development of the materials and in the pilot and field-testing.
The materials are commercially disseminated.
