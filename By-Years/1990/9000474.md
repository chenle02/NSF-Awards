This project addresses causes of urban homicide rates. The PI will draw
hypotheses from four competing theoretical perspec- tives: (1) Subculture of
violence, the idea that areas with high homicide rates are characterized by a
higher expected (or tolera- ted) level of violence; (2) Socioeconomic, the idea
that violence is a consequence of material deprivation, such as homicides
connected with robbery; (3) Punishment and deterrence, the idea that homicide
rates rise and fall with changes in certainty and severity of punishment; (4)
Life patterns, a more complex idea involving motivation, opportunities, and lack
of effective guardians such as police. Each theory has strong proponents, but
data seldom have been applied to compare the predictive success of each. Part of
the reason for the lack of empirical verifica- tion has been the difficulty of
obtaining longitudinal data. This project uses matched areas, with a 30-year
time span, to estimate a model incorporating hypotheses from all four theories.
The results should permit assessment of contribution of the factors specified in
each theory, and understanding conditions under which each theoretical process
is most likely to appear.
