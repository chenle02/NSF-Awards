This grant is to support a dissertation project. The purpose of the project is
to develop and analyze a dynamic structural model of investment behavior using
data on the timber purchase and harvest decisions of wood products firms in the
Pacific Northwest. The project has three goals: first, to better understand the
determinants of firm investment, particularly the effects of uncertainty, and
asymmetric adjustment costs; second, to extend the rapidly growing literature on
methods of solving and estimating models of this type; and finally, to further
enlighten the policy discussion now taking place about the relative importance
of environmental and economic factors in the future use of forest lands. A
tractable econometric model will be derived which is closely connected to theory
and which incorporates important features of the industry. A rich and extensive
data set will then be used to estimate the model and recover structural
parameters.
