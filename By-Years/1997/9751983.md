The Integrated Natural Resources Technology Program demonstrates an
interdisciplinary approach to educating technically advanced field technicians
for ecosystem-based management. The program differs from traditional natural
resources and resource-related programs that focus on individual disciplines
such as forestry, fisheries or wildlife. Instead, the project embodies a systems
perspective to information gathering, data analysis, and ecosystem management.
The program, a two-year, high-tech technician curriculum with a three-year
option for students transferring to a four-year institution is: 1 ) developing,
implementing, evaluating, and disseminating an outcome-driven curriculum; 2)
developing and implementing a Summer Institute to assist community college
faculty in adopting an integrated perspective; and 3) developing and
implementing integrated field experiences. It has strong support from local
public and private natural resources employers and from education--the program
articulates with three university and two high school natural resources
programs. The program has identified skills to be acquired by students in the
program, conducted an employability survey to ensure these skills meet employer
needs and that jobs are available, developed curriculum framework, and acquired
agreements to collaborate with employers in developing cooperative work
experiences.
