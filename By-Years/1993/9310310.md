9310310 Perepezko A detailed examination of the kinetics and mechanics involved
in heterogeneous nucleation will be performed using Monte Carlo-type computer
simulations employing massively parallel computers. These simulations will be
used as a part of an on-going experimental and theoretical project aimed at
determining the effect of interface structure and dynamics on the formation of
secondary solid phases at the primary solid-melt interface. These simulations
will be an integral part of the study, and results obtained will take an active
role in determining future experimental efforts.
