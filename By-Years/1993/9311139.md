9311139 Kirkpatrick Several species of lizards from the South Pacific have green
blood. This green coloration is the result of the accumulation of the bile
pigment biliverdin. Bile pigments are toxic to virtually all vertebrates
producing the pathological condition known as jaundice. An understanding of how
these lizards are able to withstand large concentrations of biliverdin may
provide insight into the pathological nature of bile pigments in other
vertebrates including humans. This same group of lizards has evolved several
different types of adhesive toe pads. These toe pads are so adhesive that they
can climb on smooth vertical surfaces such as glass. By measuring the adhesive
abilities of different microstructures for different species we can understand
the relationship between different morphologies and mechanisms of adhesion.
Knowledge of the evolutionary relationships of these lizards is critical to
understanding patterns of morphological and physiological evolution. ***
