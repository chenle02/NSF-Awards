This research will contribute to the theory of insect-plant interactions by
examining patterns of insect attack in host plant hybrid zones. Communities of
gall-forming wasps and leaf-mining moths will be examined in 15 oak hybrid zones
in Mexico and the Southwestern United States. Densities of insects on hybrid
trees will be compared to those on non-hybrid trees. The research will elucidate
factors that influence insect attack in plant hybrid zones. Factors to be
examined include: geographic structure of hybrid zones, taxonomic relationships
between parental oak species, and morphological relationships between parental
oak species. Mechanistic hypotheses will be formulated that explain differences
in insect attack between hybrid and non-hybrid plants. Important insights will
be gained into how insect faunas accrue on host plants. These ideas will
contribute to understanding whether hybrid zones act as a sink for herbivores,
an important issue in plant-herbivore interaction theory. From an applied
perspective, results of the research will bear directly on key questions
regarding the response of herbivorous insects to genetically altered crop plants
and hybrid zones which may be near agricultural areas.
