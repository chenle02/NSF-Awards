The research program is designed to explore how the properties of genes and the
stability of regions within genes are influenced by neighboring DNA sequences.
Bacterial intradiol dioxygenase genes, the subjects of the investigation, share
common ancestry and have undergone numerous rearrangements during their
evolutionary divergence. Rearrangements might be expected to lead to the
physical separation of independently transcribed genes, but the chromosomal
position of divergent oxygenase genes has been conserved within different
supraoperonic clusters. Selective forces favoring the clustering of genes will
be explored by examining the physiological and genetic consequences of directed
transposition of oxygenase genes from one cluster to another. Transposition can
lead to genetic instability, and a possible source of instability is sequence-
directed mutation, a process that can lead to deletions between regions of DNA
sequence repetition. The extent to which sequence-directed mutations occur will
be explored by comparison of the DNA sequences of genes that have undergone
spontaneous mutation either in their normal location or after transposition to a
different cluster. Processes that lead to sequence-directed mutation also might
contribute to genetic repair, and this possibility will be explored by analysis
of DNA sequence of mutations that revert readily. Enzymatic activation of oxygen
is a fundamental biological process, and the genetic analysis of oxygenases will
increase our understanding of biochemical steps that direct the assimilation of
molecular oxygen into organic substrates. We plan to isolate mutant oxygenases
that are functional but altered in substrate specificity or in catalytic
efficiency,. Analysis of these proteins is likely to provide novel insight into
interactions between oxygenases and their substrates.
