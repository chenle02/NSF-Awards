A program of summer research for undergraduates will be carried out at the
University Research Reactor of the University of Missouri/Columbia. The
laboratory has a broad range of research projects, both pure and applied, with
the basic technique involved--neutron research--tying them together. A
particular effort will be made to involve minority students.
