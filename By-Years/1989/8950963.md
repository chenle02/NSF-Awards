This funding supports the acquisition of equipment to provide students the
opportunity to analyze and study the performance of internal combustion engines.
The goal is to provide the opportunity for students to observe and measure basic
phenomena and understand how these phenomena affect the performance of real,
complex systems. It further provides an understanding of the experimental
method, including statistical confidence, dynamic response of instruments and
performance characteristics of equipment. Internal combustion engines are chosen
because they attract the student's interest and students from many disciplines
can work together as a team. This award is being matched by an equal amount from
the principal investigator's institution.
