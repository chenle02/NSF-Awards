With this grant in Experimental Physical Chemistry, Dr. Butler will initiate a
series of studies which focus on investigating the nonadiabatic interactions
which dominate the evolution of chemical reactions on excited electronic
potential energy surfaces. The work will utilize polarized emission
spectroscopy, which measures the wavelength and polarization of photons emitted
during molecular dissociation, in conjunction with state-selective laser
excitation and product detection techniques. The studies are designed to
elucidate how the branching between energetically allowed decomposition channels
can be critically sensitive to the nature of the electronic surface accessed,
and the subsequent intramolecular energy transfer processes and nonadiabatic
interactions with other electroinc surfaces during dissociation. The
significance of the work lies in the potential for controlling the products of
chemical reactions via photoexcitation to particular electronic states. Numerous
examples include photoinduced reactions of molecules adsorbed on surfaces,
energy transfer in collisions of electronically excited or open shell atoms or
molecules, and bimolecular or unimolecular reaction in the gas phase or in
solution. As the work explores what molecular structural and dynamical factors
allow one to photoinduce a selective chemical reaction which would not occur
upon thermal excitation, the results could advance the development of new
methods of synthetic chemistry.
