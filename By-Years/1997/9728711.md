9728711 Kuo, Scot Wirtz, Denis The project will employ a novel optical device to
measure the viscoelastic properties of the cell cytoplasm and in vitro model
systems. This laser-based device, capable of "laser-deflection particle
tracking" (LDPT), measures two-dimensional Brownian movements of particles with
high temporal and dimensional resolution. Unlike "optical tweezers" techniques,
LDPT uses low energy laser illumination that does not perturb the particle being
observed. The technique will be used to make measurements on systems in which
cytoskeletal elements may considerably alter the viscoelastic properties of the
medium and affect particle movement. The specific aims are first to refine
methods of measurement and to establish a baseline by tracking polystyrene latex
spheres in reconstituted actin gels in vitro. This will be done in the presence
and absence of various actin-binding proteins (capZ, alpha-actinins, and
actophorin) which should significantly alter the viscoelastic properties of the
gels. Measurements will then be made on an in vivo system in which particles
will be tracked in the dynamic, actin-rich lamellae of COS7 cultured cells. The
technique has the potential of providing highly refined measurements of the
viscoelastic properties in localized regions of the cytoplasm which can be
directly related to the organization and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton in
these regions. The measurements would be physiologically relevant to directional
and force-dependent movement of vesicles and other organelles within the
cytoplasm.
