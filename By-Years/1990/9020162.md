The Herbarium of the San Diego Museum of Natural History contains more than
125,000 specimens, including more than 200 type specimens. This collection is an
important repository of plants representing the flora of the southwest U.S. and
Baja California. Dr. Geoffrey Levin, Curator in charge of the Herbarium, has
planned important improvements in the physical curation of these plant
specimens. New storage cabinets will be installed on compact storage rails,
thereby providing more efficient and safe storage without sacrificing access to
the specimens. The proposed compact storage will provide room for decades of
collection growth. The proposed collection improvement represents a long-term
plan for managing an important research resource. The community of research
biologists depends on herbarium collections such as this for reference
materials. Countless studies in ecology, evolution, biogeography, and global
change will draw crucial information from this collection. Future generations of
research depend on the care and growth of collections such as this.
