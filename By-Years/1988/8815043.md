This Scanning Photoemission Microscope (SPM) is designed to make use of the
soft x-ray undulator at the National Synchrotron Light Source. This is an
exciting new instrument, that will be unique in its ability to map surfaces with
sufficient spatial and energy resolution to show submicron features and chemical
shifts at the same time in an energy range that covers core levels of most of
the important elements of the periodic table. Preliminary experiments will be
done to test the system.
