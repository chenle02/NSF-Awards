This project involves paleomagnetic and rock magnetic studies in support of
research drilling of the moat deposits of the Creede caldera. These studies will
provide information relevant to the dating and correlation of cores from the
moat as well as information about the diagenetic conditions which affected the
sediments and volcanic rocks after deposition in the moat. The project represent
a collaboration between Kenneth L. Verosub of the University of California,
Davis, and Richard Reynolds and Joseph Rosenbaum of the United State Geological
Survey, Denver.
