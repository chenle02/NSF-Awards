Plants respond to various signals such as hormones, light and gravity. How
plants perceive and transduce these chemical and physical signals is not clearly
understood. Accumulating evidence indicates that calcium acts as a messenger in
signal transduction in plants. Many of the signal-induced responses are mediated
by calcium. Increased calcium can affect diverse physiological processes through
the action of calmodulin, a ubiquitous calcium- binding protein. Much of this
diversity in response in plants is believed to be achieved by the modulation of
the activity of the calcium and/or calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases.
Although calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphorylation is implicated in
regulating a number of cellular processes in plants, nothing is known about the
calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase(s) and its substrates. Dr. Poovaiah
has isolated several cDNA clones by immunoscreening the expression libraries
with the antibody produced to the sequence corresponding to alpha subunit of
animal calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. The principal
investigator proposes to perform biochemical analyses of the encoded protein to
verify its protein kinase activity, determine its mode of regulation by calcium
and calmodulin, and analyze its substrate specificity. Furthermore, Dr. Poovaiah
intends to use auxin resistant mutants of Arabidopsis and light- responsive corn
mutant to study the role of calcium/calmodulin- dependent protein kinase in
auxin and light signal transduction, respectively. The information derived from
these studies would be of immense value in understanding the role of
calcium/calmodulin- dependent protein kinase(s) in signal transduction in
plants.//
