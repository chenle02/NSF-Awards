The Conference on "The Genetics and Population Biology of Pare Plant
Conservation" is designed to serve as a working forum for scientists and plant
conservation practitioners. The majority of the intellectual preparation for the
Conference will be carried out over a six-to-eight- month period prior to the
1989 Conference meeting. A Lead Author will be assigned to each topic, to
summarize and review current theory, data, literature, and relevant ongoing
research as well as to solicit existing research results and comments form other
scientists in the field. These Lead Authors (and any colleagues they may choose
to include) will develop initial position papers for review by the Conference
Committee and the other participants in the Conference. After a cycle of editing
and revision (and discussion of their policy implications), these papers will
become the core presentations of the Conference, scheduled for March 1989 at the
Missouri Botanical Garden, St. Louis, Missouri. These and other papers presented
at the Conference will be published as Proceedings following the final meeting.
The expenses of the Lead Authors, Conference Committee, and major participants
will be covered by grant support to the greatest extent possible.
