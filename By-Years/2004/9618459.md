96-18459 Smith, Verne Dr. Smith plans a program of research which will increase
understanding of stellar nucleosynthesis and the early chemical evolution of our
Galaxy. His observational program will investigate stellar abundances in
globular clusters and the halo field of our Milky Way Galaxy, as well as in
field stars in the nearby Large Magellanic Cloud. A comparison of the detailed
abundance profiles among these populations will shed light on the formation and
relative star formation histories, and the resultant nucleosynthesis in these
stellar systems. Dr. Smith intends to increase sample sizes and quality to
address several particularly intriguing recent results: a) the observed
difference in r- process elemental abundance patterns between field halo and
globular cluster stars and b) the extent and nature o the variations in light
element abundances (e.g. C, N, O, Na) seen among samples in individual globular
clusters. The first result may suggest that there has been a segregation in
nucleosynthetic sites of the alpha-process versus the r- process elements in the
early galaxy. The second area of research is aimed at better understanding the
relative importance and cause of abundance variations due to internal stellar
mixing and/or primordial abundance effects. ***
