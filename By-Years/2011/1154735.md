Over the past two decades, a new spectroscopic technique called laser induced
breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) has been developed and has gained favor for in
situ field measurements in hostile environments. The goal of this proposal is to
build a LIBS system suitable for deployment on Alvin with pressure cases and
interfaces that are Alvin compatible. Once constructed, the PIs will re-validate
the laboratory measurements in a test tank. At the end of this phase, they
should have a working LIBS system that is compatible with Alvin, and that has
been validated in a real water environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work itself addressing the advancement of the
technology and the measurement environment are state-of-the-art research and
development. The system configuration and results in this harsh environment will
benefit other applications for real-time monitoring, including industrial
processes and space exploration. Additionally, the research will lead to several
student PhD dissertations, and collaborations among international research
teams.
