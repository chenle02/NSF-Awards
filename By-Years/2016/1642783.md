This project by Dr. Michael Krauss will complete the documentation and
presentation of existing materials on the Eyak language, which became extinct in
2008 when the last Native speaker passed away. Dr. Michael Krauss has focused
much of his career working with the remaining speakers of Eyak recording their
language in great detail. Krauss' work is, as one reviewer described it, of the
highest quality. Eyak is an important language because it occupies the space
between Athapaskan and Tlingit and a full analysis of Eyak will contribute to an
understanding of the linguistic relationships between North America and Asia.
The project focuses on archiving existing materials and completing the
dictionary, translation and transcription of texts and grammar for the future
access and use of scholars and the Eyak community alike.
