The mathematics department at Rancho Santiago College, a large, urban community
college, is building on the success of the department's curricular efforts to
further enhance student learning in mathematics. A computer classroom is being
used to provide a technologically-integrated curricular approach to all
Precalculus, Calculus, and Linear Algebra classes. The particular goals of the
effort are to: 1. infuse cooperative team building, active learning and
discovery-based learning into mathematics pedagogy to meet needs of students
with diverse learning styles; 2. use relevant application-based data and
problems to motivate student success and interest in mathematics; 3. incorporate
elements of reform calculus that emphasizes the relationship among data, graphs,
and functions into precalculus level courses; 4. provide students with computer
skills they will use in further studies.
