This Special Minority Award provides a year of support for Zane P. Gibbs, a
graduate student at Virginia Commonwealth University. The award will allow Mr.
Gibbs to finish his course work expeditiously and reach the research
participation phase sooner. This award is an integral part of the strategy of
the National Science Foundation to strengthen and increase minority
participation in the field of physics.
