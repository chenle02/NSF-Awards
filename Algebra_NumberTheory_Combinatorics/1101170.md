Representation theorists seek to quantify, analyze, and predict how a group of
motions---like rotations or reflections---act on physical and geometric objects.
The fundamental problem in geometric representation theory is to construct
representations using geometric tools. The fundamental problem in combinatorial
representation theory is to understand a representation explicitly in terms of
essential combinatorial parameters: for instance to decompose a given
representation into the fundamental building blocks of irreducible
representations. Both kinds of representation theorists seek to understand
representations, but a problem that may seem answered to geometric
representation theorists, such as `find a natural representation', is only
partially answered to combinatorial representation theorists, who seek to
`analyze explicitly a given representation'.

This proposal addresses several problems in geometric and combinatorial
representation theory, using tools from combinatorics, algebraic geometry, and
topology. The broader impact includes work in many other areas of mathematics,
including knot theory and commutative algebra, as well as fields like
mathematical physics. Educationally, the PI will establish programs for graduate
student retention and excellence, in both research and teaching.
