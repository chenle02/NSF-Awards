There has been an increasing interest in incorporating explicit spatial
structure into ecological models. This research will investigate the effect of
spatial structure on the dynamics of populations at the edges and borders of
their ranges. The investigators will develop analytic and numerical approaches
using methods from theoretical physics. They will study the spatial patterns
that develop at different types of population margins, and how these patterns
change when margins are either expanding or retreating. They will investigate
how the range of a population in one dimension (as along a stream or a
coastline) might differ from that of a two-dimensional population in an
identical environmental gradient. The investigators will also study the effect
of biotic factors, e.g. pathogens, on marginal populations, and whether margins
can act as host refugia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to
increase general understanding of the dynamics of population margins, as well as
to stimulate and direct the detailed study of such margins. In the past decade,
the spatial analysis of populations has been greatly facilitated by rapid
technical advances in mapping, remote sensing, and computation. A strong
theoretical basis for the spatial structure of population margins is an
essential guide for the interpretation of such data.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
