The University of Hawaii will initiate a 6-week residential Young Scholars
project for 26 students in grades ll-l2 in agricultural science. The goal of the
NSF Young Scholars Pacific Region Program is to increase the knowledge of high
ability high school students in the careers, philosophy and ethics, and research
methodology in the agricultural sciences. The Program will include both a summer
program and follow-up activities. The former will consist of four inter- related
learning experiences: classroom sessions; field trips; research projects under
the guidance of scientific mentors; and informal learning situations.
Participants, who will come from Hawaii, American Samoa, Guam, Micronesia, and
the Northern Marianas, will live in University of Hawaii dormitories and use the
facilities of the University and its College of Tropical Agriculture and Human
Resources. They will be selected on PSAT or SAT scores, high school grades,
recommendation from teachers or counselors, and students' essays. During the
academic year students will continue work on their research projects and
participate in a follow-up meeting.
