This award seeks to assist Brigham Young University (BYU) in joining the Center
for Visual and Decision Informatics (CVDI), an existing Industry University
Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC). The CVDI Center is currently made up of the
University of Louisiana at Lafayette, Drexel University, and Tampere University
of Technology. BYU will use this award to plan and prepare for the establishment
of the new site by hosting informational meetings for potential partners about
the benefits of membership in CVDI and the mechanics of the Center, attend the
scheduled CVDI's Industry Advisory Board meeting in April 2017, and prepare a
joint industry and university research agenda around the expertise of the site
and the needs/interests of industry partners. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BYU will
leverage its big data capstone class, where industry partners pitch their
projects to the students who then vote on their preferred projects and form
groups that are mentored throughout by company personnel. Through external
partners' mentoring, students are exposed to the realities of data analytics and
gain experience and skills that cannot be found in a strictly academic setting.
This, in turn, can prepare students for the workforce and improves their ability
to be effective contributors to science and engineering.
