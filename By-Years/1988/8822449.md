8822449 Reed Professors Reed and Blum will use the mathematical analysis,
computer simulation, and biological experimentation to continue research into:
(1) the mechanisms of axonal transport, (2) Diffusion probes of the
cytoskeleton, and to begin new projects on (3) Regulation of Metabolic Pathways,
and (4) Neural mechanisms for processing biosonar information. Professor H.
Layton will continue research on the time course of oscillations in the
tubuloglomerular feedback system of the mammalian kidney.
