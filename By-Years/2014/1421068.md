One of the key challenges in trustworthy computing is establishing trust in the
hardware layer, which is the execution platform of all software applications.
Modern multiprocessor system-on-chips employ many specialized components, and
scalable network-on-chips (NoC) are often deployed to efficiently connect these
components. In the light of these trends, this project investigates secure and
reliable computation, when the underlying NoC is
compromised.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project explores a range of threats posed
by a compromised NoC in current and future multiprocessor systems. The layered
security mechanisms in the multiprocessor firmware that can allow secure and
reliable computation by tolerating a compromised NoC are investigated. The
project enables trustworthy computing on next generation cost-effective hardware
platforms driven by seamless integration of third party hardware components.
Through educational activities, this project will disseminate vital skill sets
to future work force to engage in trustworthy computer design.
