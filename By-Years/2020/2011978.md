NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Today, the means to realize active and reversible
control over thermal conductivity in solid-state materials are extremely
limited, despite the strong demands from both the energy and electronics
industries for energy regulation. One promising strategy is to manipulate
reconfigurable interfaces in materials with substantial thermal resistances to
heat flow. This project advances the current fundamental understanding on the
thermal transport mechanisms across these reconfigurable interfaces. This
research has translational implications for a wide range of applications in the
sustainable energy infrastructure, such as waste-heat energy conversion, energy
harvesting, and solid-state cooling for integrated electronics. Research and
education are integrated through a focus on motivating and training students to
pursue science and engineering occupations, specifically in the areas of
materials for sustainable energy and advanced
electronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: Fundamental mechanisms on
how the thermal energy is transferred across reconfigurable domain walls in
ferroelectric materials is poorly understood. Therefore, the focus of the
project is to elucidate the roles of ferroelectric domain walls, especially
their spatial distribution (e.g., density, orientation, and shape anisotropy),
on the Kapitza resistance and thermal transport. Complementary theoretical and
experimental approaches are applied: (1) The anisotropic thermal conductivity of
ferroelectric thin films and single crystals are measured to reveal the
dependence of Kapitza resistance at domain walls on the domain structures and
temperature; (2) Molecular dynamics simulation is conducted to analyze how the
Kapitza resistance depends on the interactions of energy carriers (i.e.,
phonons) with domain walls. These research activities aim to advance the current
understanding on the microscopic thermal transport mechanisms in ferroelectric
materials. The outreach activities are developing cinematic 360 virtual-reality
laboratory tours to ‘teleport’ on-line K-12 students into the laboratory to
visualize materials research and applications in sustainable energy.
Undergraduate and graduate students are trained through interdisciplinary
research experiences to promote the importance and challenges of energy savings,
thermal management, and energy conversion in sustainable energy
infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
