This project will investigate the rates at which fine particles are delivered
to, and penetrate into, streambeds. Fine-particle deposition affects streambed
permeability, and thus directly impacts such processes as the sequestration of
sediment and contaminants in fluvial environments, microbially-constrained
aspects of geochemical cycles and larval recruitment at the sediment-water
interface. A detailed understanding of fine-particle deposition will (i) improve
boundary conditions for regional models of sediment and contaminant transport
and fate, and (ii) improve understanding of physical factors that constrain
benthic biogeochemical processes and related benthic biocomplexity. The PIs
propose to determine the degree to which weak bedload transport of a coarse
granular bed affects rates of deposition of silt-sized particles from dilute,
turbulent suspension. The proposed research will be conducted in a new flume now
under construction with expected completion by Summer 2004.
