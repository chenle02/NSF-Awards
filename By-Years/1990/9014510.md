NSF funds are requested to purchase enhancements to the instrument to facilitate
the use of a microscope imaging system by six research groups in the Department
of Biological Science. The quantitative fluorescence system will allow the
researchers to investigates a variety of new problems including the following:
the role of calcium in prolactin secretion by pituitary cells, the regulation of
the intracellular pH in molluscan myocytes, the role of calcium fluxes in the
regulation of gene expression in Chlamydonas, the distribution and potential
compartmentation of key proteins in brush border cells, the dynamics of
intrecellular magnesium in muscle fibers and finally the role of intracellular
pH in motility in amoeboid cells. The acquisition of the quantitative
fluorescence imaging system will have significant impact on these six groups,
all of which are externally funded.
