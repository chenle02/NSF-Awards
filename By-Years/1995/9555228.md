The study of ordinary differential equations is a core element of any curriculum
in engineering, computer science, or the physical sciences. This proposal
addresses the need for increased emphasis on computational methods in
differential equations education by establishing a World Wide Web server that
will provide materials to instructors and students. These materials will be
primarily computer-based examples illustrating analysis of physical and
biological systems using differential equations, and software for use in
conjunction with them. Provision will be made for submissions of exercises for
electronic publication on the server. The ultimate objective is to provide a
repository for instructional materials illustrating computational approaches in
the study of differential equations. A-1 NSF FORM 1358 (1194)
