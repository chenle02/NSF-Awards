This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of organic electrochemistry. This research program will prepare a
variety of new elctroactive polymer systems and will study the effects of their
atomic composition and molecular structure on the charge transport process. The
thrusts of this research program are (1) to understand the charge transport
process through polymer blend or composite films and (2) to fabricate electrodes
for the detection of biomolecules. Both of these thrusts are directed at
increasing the specificity of the interfacial process at polymer-modified
electrodes. This research may lead to the development of useful biomedical
sensors. This project will give Professor Chambers' students an unique
opportunity to participate in the interdisciplinary research which combines
organic chemistry, biochemistry, materials chemistry, and electrochemistry.
