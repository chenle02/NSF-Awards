Economists have distinguished between uncertainty about the state of economic
environment and uncertainty of economic agents about the decisions or planned
actions of agents with whom they are interacting (subjective and endogenous
uncertainty). Traditional general equilibrium models preclude this latter type
of uncertainty or reduce it to socially inconsequential levels through a number
of artificial assumptions. Relaxing these assumptions means that the possibility
of disequilibrium choices has to be taken seriously, both as an objective
possibility and as a possibility countenanced by economic agents; this in turn
paves the way for accounts of certain institutions and practices as structures
which evolve out of agents' attempts to cope with the resulting uncertainty.
These institutions and practices are what Dr. Sensat calls a "reification"
(making concrete an abstract idea). Reification can be criticized as a socially
specific barrier to practical rationality. Under this grant, Dr. Sensat will
reconstruct this thesis of social reification as follows: First, social
structures of reification will be characterized as socially specific modes of
response to the "subjective uncertainty" experienced by agents about the actions
of other agents with whom they are interacting. The characterization will
connect reification with certain game- theoretic equilibria on the one hand and
with the so-called "sunspot" equilibria of general equilibrium theory on the
other. these connections will reveal inherent limitations to the ability of
structures of reification to resolve subjective uncertainty in an optimal way.
Second, structures of social planning will be defined and compared with
structures of reification with respect to feasibility, efficiency and incentive
compatibility. Third, the new concept of reification will be used in a critique
of exploitation as based on an ideal of rational agency rather than a claim of
distributive justice. The project promises to increase our understanding of the
nature of rational agency in social contexts, the compatibility and relative
merits of economic planning and markets, and the nature of exploitative social
relationships.
