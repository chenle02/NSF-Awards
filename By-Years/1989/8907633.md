This is a Career Advancement Award supported under the Research Opportunities
for Women Program and the Political Science Program. The broad purpose of this
type of award is to enable promising female scholars the opportunity to increase
their research productivity and to contribute to their respective disciplines.
With this award, the investigator will develop expertise in and carry out a
study of weapons procurement. The central question of this research concerns the
production of workable weapons systems and the technology that is needed to
produce them. The political science contribution concerns an evaluation of the
relation between military needs and the production of workable systems. This
Career Advance Award will provide release time for the principal investigator
and allow her to do the requisite background research for the study. The award
will also enable the investigator to gain the technical skills necessary to
undertake this stream of research.
