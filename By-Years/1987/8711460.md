The proposed research concerns the formation of compounds between metals and the
elements sulfur, selenium and tellurium, which are members of a group
historically known as the chalcogens. This research project has already resulted
in the synthesis of a large number of interesting new compounds. Some of the
compounds are related to the hydrodesulfurization catalysts which are used for
cleaning up petroleum feedstocks, and the research is expected both to lead to a
better understanding of the action of these catalysts and to provide knowledge
necessary for the design of better catalysts. This proposal concerns
synthetic/reactivity studies on molecular complexes containing inorganic
chalcogen ligands, i.e. ligands consisting of 1-6 atoms of S, Se or Te. Despite
their simplicity (indeed possibly because of it) these ligands are versatile
reactivity centers. The project is broken down into three sections. First plans
are described making new inorganic chalcogenide anions of Ru, Rh, Nb, Ta, and
rare earth/actinide elements. The approach here is to develop new classes of
compounds using salt-forming reactions, typified by displacement of carboxylates
in tetracarboxylatedimetal compounds by inorganic chalcogen anions. The next
section concerns cyclopentadienyl metal sulfides as synthetic intermediates and
catalyst models. Particular emphasis is placed on the mechanisms of Cp*2Ru2S4
reactions. Extensions of this work include Cp*2Cr2O4 chemistry, cluster building
reactions, and electrophylic M=S functionalities. The closing section focuses on
simple metal complexes of thiophenes particularly as they relate to metal
sulfide reactivity.
