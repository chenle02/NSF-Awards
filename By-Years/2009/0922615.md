This is a project to construct and test a liquid hydrogen target at Ursinus
College for use with fast rare isotope beams. The design is based on an existing
target developed at RIKEN in Japan. The target will support the ongoing
experimental program of the PI at the National Superconducting Cyclotron
Laboratory (NSCL) focused on studies of collective and single-particle structure
of exotic nuclei. The target will also be made available for collaborative
experiments with Ursinus.

The broader impact of the project includes supporting an active research program
in nuclear structure on the Ursinus College campus. Ursinus College is a
national liberal arts college of about 1600 students with a long history of
strength in the sciences. This project will provide students opportunities to
apply their knowledge of physics outside the classroom, gain practical technical
skills, observe and participate in the operation of a nuclear accelerator
facility, and present their work to colleagues.
