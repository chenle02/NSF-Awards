Abstract EEC-9615738 Ku This three year award (the tenth year plus two-year
phase out) phases out the University of California, San Diego's
Industry/University Cooperative Research for Ultra-High Speed Circuits. The
Center continues to meet the renewal criteria of the I/UCRC Program. The
research program of the Center focuses in three areas: 1) Spread spectrum
communications and adaptive digital and image signal processing; 2) High
performance and high speed very large system integration algorithm - specific
integrated circuits design and 3) ultra-high speed integrated circuit device and
circuit development. Two women undergraduates are funded to augment the Center's
research. They will study; 1) a component of multi-carrier CDMA wireless
communication systems and 2) applications of DSP to broadband wireless
communications systems. Funding for an evaluator to study the
university/industry interaction occurring in the Center is provided in the third
year of this award. Additonal funding is provided in this award to augment the
Center's ongoing research program and to obtain a membership in the Center.
