The stiffness and moduli of plant stems and tissue samples can be measured from
natural frequencies of vibration (=fundamental frequency and higher harmonics).
By measuring shifts in these frequencies as a stem is cut and shortened in
length, and by comparing these shifts with those anticipated for different
geometries, the extent to which a stem's morphology conforms to one of many
competing geometric models can be determined. An apparatus has been designed
that can measure simultaneously all of the natural frequencies of a plant stem
of tissue sample. Funding is requested to purchase additional instrumentation
that will facilitate data gathering analysis. The equipment will allow the
collection of biomechanical data having bearing on plant structure, development,
ecology, and such practical aspects as stiffness and resistance to compression.
