This engineering education research project seeks to synthesize the results of
two prior NSF studies done at Pennsylvania State University: "Prototype to
Production: Conditions and Processes for Educating the Engineer of 2020" and
"Prototyping the Engineer of 2020: A 360-degree Study of Effective Education".
The proposed synthesis will enable audiences of educational administrators and
national policy makers to understand best practices that contribute to the goals
outlined in the National Academy of Engineering's "The Engineer of 2020" (2004)
and "Educating the Engineer of 2020" (2006). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
significance and importance of this project is to help ensure that best
practices in engineering education are broadly adopted by creating a channel for
such practices to flow to administrators and policy makers. This project
overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers by making
investments that lead to emerging new fields of engineering, or shifting
existing fields. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by
creating results and research that are useful for society by informing
educational policy and practices.
