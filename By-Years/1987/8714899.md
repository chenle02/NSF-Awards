This proposal is for the University of Michigan to act as host for the
Fourteenth Conference on Production Research and Technology. This is one of a
series of annual conferences which have been sponsored by the Production
Research Program (now the Manufacturing Systems Program) of the National Science
Foundation. The conferences serve several purposes. They permit assessment of
the research supported by the program. They aid in program planning. They
disseminate research results to other investigators in the research community,
and to potential users in industry. They also provide opportunities for
investigators who want to enter the program to find out what kind of research it
supports.
