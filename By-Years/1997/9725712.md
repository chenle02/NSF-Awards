9725712 Larson The boundary between the Cocos and North American plates is the
locus of numerous subduction earthquakes driven by a convergence velocity of 5-7
cm/yr. Most of the plate boundary has experienced ruptures in historic time -
with the exception of the Guerrero Coast. This project hopes to improve our
understanding of the subduction process and its potential for rupture by
conducting a series of geodetic measurements along the Guerrero Coast. The P.I.
and collaborators will combine GPS, levelling, and absolute gravity data to
provide optimal information on both vertical and horizontal crustal deformation.
The geodetic data, along with seismic data, will be used to model the Guerrero
dislocation and its defining characteristics. The scientific team includes
active collaboration of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM),
NOAA, and UNAVCO. ***
