Operator Theory and Inverse Problems

Abstract



The proposed research will focus on a few inverse problems: the uniqueness in
the multivariable moment problem, the best approximation of planar domains with
finitely many prescribed moments; the inverse spectral problem for the modulus
of the restriction operator between the Bergman spaces of two planar domains; a
renormalized Riesz transform with applications to image reconstruction in any
dimension. Methods of operator theory, function theory and approximation theory
will be combined in this work.

In many areas of modern activity it is required to reconstruct an entity from
partial, and sometimes distant and indirect, data. Inverse problems address such
specific questions. The proposed research will be concerned with a couple of
inverse problems arising for instance in tomography or in geophysics. To be more
specific, given a number of different angle X-rays of a body, we will propose a
constructive, optimal way of approximating, or sometimes reconstructing this
body.
