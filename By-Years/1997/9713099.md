This award, made to the National Academy of Sciences, provides continuing
support for the core activities of the Board of Chemical Sciences and
Technology. The Board plans and develops new projects germane to the broad
chemistry community, provides oversight of ongoing studies, and provides liaison
between federal agencies, universities, and the private sector on matters of
broad interest to chemistry and chemical engineering. Support of core activities
of the Board of Chemical Sciences and Technology ensures that the chemical
sciences community has a credible and independent entity representing its
interests across government, academia, and the private sector.
