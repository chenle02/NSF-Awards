9500445 Seymour The International Junior Investigator and Postdoctoral Fellows
Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twelve months
of research abroad at research centers of proven excellence. The program's
awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or
complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad. This
award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Joseph D.
Seymour to work with Dr. Paul T. Callaghan at Massey University. The
investigator proposes to use nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experimental
techniques to noninvasively probe the structure of sea ice. Laboratory
manufactured sea ice will be analyzed using NMR imaging and diffusion
measurements of protons in the entrapped brine of the sea ice. Images and
measurements of anisotropic and restricted diffusion will provide data on
laboratory sea ice morphology. The Antarctic work will be conducted using an NMR
system to measure magnetization relaxation parameters of sea ice core samples.
Use of the earth's field NMR system is an important dimension of this project
because of possible applications of the technique, ranging from on site sensors
to underground environmental hazard detection. The study is part of the New
Zealand Sea Ice Project, a collaboration involving four universities and a Crown
Research Institute, in which physical and mechanical measurements on sea ice are
made to advance understanding of sea ice physical properties. ***
