With shrinking feature size and increasing design complexity, the traditional
approach of designing large scale digital systems using a global synchronization
approach is facing a number of challenges. The vision of the proposed summer
school is to educate researchers and practitioners in self-timed or asynchronous
design—an alternative strategy that abandons the global clock signal in favor of
local synchronization. Doing so eliminates the scaling challenge, and more
importantly, permits VLSI system to adapt naturally to the largest source of
variability—in workload and application characteristics. The self-timed approach
has demonstrated benefits in a number of different areas, including reduced
power consumption and increased throughput by exploiting workload-dependent
optimizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This summer school is enabled by some very
recent developments in new electronic design automation tools that have native
support for asynchronous logic. The development of these tools was supported by
the DARPA Electronics Resurgence Initiative (ERI), and the tools are currently
in use at over a dozen organizations (both academic and industrial). These tools
will be used to support a unified and coherent approach to asynchronous
design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
