9314666 Mital The ease, quicknes, and economy of product manufacture are now
considered by many in industry and academia to form the basis of modern
manufacturing. These criteria, when applied collectively on the design stages of
a product, become known as Designing for Manufacturability (DFM). The current
DFM philosophy tends to overemphasize automation, of both the hard and flexible
kind. At least two major problem arise when designers attempt to implement this
philosophy in practice: (1) hard automation does not lend itself to frequent
changes in product design and (2) the cost of the automation option may be much
greater rhan the cost of manual or hybrid option. Ergonomics, which deals
primarily with the application of technology tol assist the human element in
human work, has an important role to play in the product design process. This
workshop explores the role of ergonomics in the overall DFM philosophy and how
it can assist designers more usuable, safer, reliable, and economical products.
