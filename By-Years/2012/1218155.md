This collaborative project addresses the need for ocean observational techniques
which was highlighted by the recent Deepwater Horizon incident. The proposed
project investigates heterogeneous ocean robots (including wave gliders,
unmanned surface vessels, and autonomous underwater vehicles) to detect and
monitor the propagation of oil plumes. Specific objectives include: 1) the
development of a distributed multi-robot cooperative deployment algorithm using
partial differential equation (PDE) based methods that match the oceanographic
model of oil transport, 2) the development of authentic dynamic model of the new
wave glider platform to incorporate in the cooperative control, and 3) assessing
the potential advantages of innovative algorithms through simulations and
experimental demonstration in a coastal experiment using a network of ocean
robot platforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed project will
provide novel algorithmic and software support for collective sensing, and
address a pressing real-world need for better sensing of underwater hydrocarbon
plumes. The techniques developed in the proposal will have long-term impacts in
underwater exploration such as oceanographic survey and energy production in
deep water. The results may also potentially benefit other environmental
monitoring tasks with underlying diffusion and advection processes, such as
weather event tracking and climate prediction. The planned work will integrate
research projects with education activities through robot-centric undergraduate
and graduate education, robotics competition, short course and workshop
development, and outreach to K-12 education. Partnering with the Stevens' Center
for Innovation in Engineering and Science Education, the project will showcase
the proposed research in the curriculum of the Stevens Build IT Underwater
Robotics Scale-Up for STEM Learning and Workforce Development Project awarded by
NSF.
