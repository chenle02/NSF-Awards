The literature on programming languages contains an abundance of informal claims
on the relative expressive power of programming languages and on the
expressibility or non-expressibility of programming constructs with respect to
programming languages. Despite tremendous progress in various subdisciplines,
programming language theory has not developed a formal framework for specifying
and verifying such statements. Consequently, it is also impossible to draw any
solid conclusions from such claims or to use them for an objective comparison of
programming languages. An investigation of the expressiveness of programming
languages has recently been initiated. Based on a first formalization of
expressibility, universal programming languages in a restricted setting can now
formally be distinguished and some of the informal claims in the literature can
be confirmed. More examples within the current framework will be explored in
order to broaden our perspective. From these examples, more meta-properties
about the formal framework will be deduced.
