Effective resource management algorithms are critical to the performance of a
computer system. This project will address open questions related to effective
resource management in parallel computer systems, using a combination of
experimental techniques, simulation, and analytical performance models. In
particular the project will investigate questions concerning high performance
parallel processor allocation policies, the interplay between parallel processor
allocation and memory management, the interplay between parallel programming
models and appropriate workloads for evaluating parallel resource management
algorithms, and the impact of workload characteristics on the performance of
particular parallel system resource management algorithms. The interactive
component of this project involves: (1) teaching two courses, one a graduate
seminar and one a core graduate or undergraduate course, (2) hosting a Northwest
Workshop on Academic Careers for Women, modeled after the recent Computing
Research Association (CRA) workshops of the same title, (3) participation in the
mentoring and outreach efforts of the Women in Engineering program at the
University Washington, and (4) joint research with Computer Science and
Engineering faculty and students at the University of Washington.
