Travel support is provided for a participant to attend an international
conference in Trondheim, Norway. The researcher has planned a visit to several
laboratories in addition to a discussion with a committee member who is
preparing a joint report with the investigator. The presence of a representative
from the United States to the international meeting is important because it will
enable the researcher to keep abreast of development in foreign countries.
