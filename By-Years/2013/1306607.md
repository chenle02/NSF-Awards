Investigating the impact of climatic stress on root chemistry using
spectroscopic techniques&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plant roots contribute a majority
of the carbon sequestered in terrestrial ecosystems. The stability of this
sequestered carbon is governed by the overall molecular identity of the litter
matrix. Projected increases in temperature and frequent droughts by the turn of
this century may impose severe moisture stress in plants, altering the plant
metabolic pathways resulting in unique metabolite profiles and biopolymer
chemistry of the roots. This unprecedented change in the structural chemistry
and composition (quality) of root biopolymers would further alter their
microbial symbiotic associations. The change in root biopolymer chemistry and
microbial associations would, in turn, alter the stability and turnover of root
carbon in soil. Advanced spectroscopic techniques and chemometric analyses are
promising tools to capture the climatic stress induced qualitative changes in
root chemistry and further help to predict root litter decomposition under
future climates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training objectives include attaining
proficiency in advanced spectroscopic and mass spectrometric analyses and
computational techniques. The project integrates physical science techniques
with biology to develop an interdisciplinary research program. The fellow will
actively recruit and mentor high school and undergraduate students through the
proposed research. Additionally, the fellow will give guest lectures and present
research in national and international conferences and disseminate findings of
the research through publications in peer-reviewed journals and to the non-
scientific community through popular science magazines.
