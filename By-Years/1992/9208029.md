Klein will study phenomena that occur in disordered systems. The topics
included are quantum spin systems in a random environment, contact and
percolation processes in a random environment, random Schroedinger operators,
and critical exponents for classical rotors. Shlosman will investigate
properties of low temperature random fields in statistical mechanics. The
multiphase structure of these fields is reflected in the unusual properties of
their large deviations probabilities, due to the phenomenon of formation of
crystals of different phases in typical large deviation configurations. Modern
physics, quantum mechanics and relativity, is a product of the twentieth
century. It is founded firmly in the last century's attempt to address the
microstructure of matter and to come to grips with the concepts of action-at-a
distance, electro-magnetism, and heat radiation. The mathematical foundations
for these developments, collectively called mathematical physics, ranges from
detailed analysis of Schroedinger operators, which governs the dynamics of
particles, to unified field theory, which attempts to unite the four known
forces into a single theory.
