This project will provide students with coherent, integrated, laboratory
experiences that build competence and interest in scientific psychology. The
proposal is for ten microcomputers, interfaces, and software to complement
current educational strengths in core psychology courses (General Psychology,
Statistics, and Research Methods), our content courses (Learning, Perception,
and Physiological) and our research courses (Research Seminar and Independent
Study). The computers will foster a programmatic curricular change. Students
will participate in experiments - first as subjects, then as analysts, then as
hypothesis builders, and finally as experimenters - to acquire the core
methodological and cognitive skills needed for scientific investigations in any
content area of psychology. Conducting empirical investigations and constructing
testable, quantitative, models of complex behaviors will foster students'
independence and self confidence.
