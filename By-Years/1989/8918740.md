This action provides partial support for the 8th International Congress on
Nitrogen Fixation. Its theme is "Achievements and Objectives in Nitrogen
fixation." The Congress deals with the process of nitrogen fixation. This occurs
either by the industrial Haber-Bosch process or through biological nitrogen
fixation mediated by the nitrogenase enzyme complex. Such biological nitrogen
fixation is found to occur in free-living organisms (such as Klebsiella) or in
symbiotic associations (usually with plants such as legumes or ferns). The
Congress thus integrates scientists from many different disciplines. Research
into processes of nitrogen fixation involves biological chemistry, biochemistry,
genetics, microbiology, plant breeding, molecular biology, ecology and forestry.
Scientists from different organizations representing academia, industry and
government are expected to attend. Past congresses attracted around 600
participants with a slight upward trend in overall attendance. The Congress is
planned to be integrative and forward looking. Both oral and poster sessions are
scheduled. Special review and integrative lectures are planned as are
provocative issue workshops.
