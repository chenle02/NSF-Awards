940925 Shaker We study a singular semilinear elliptic boundary value problem in
a bounded domain in the n dimensional real space. The importance of this problem
in scientific applications has been widely recognized (see W ). The motivation
for this proposal is three-fold. First we wish to generalize the existing
theorems by relaxing the coefficient function in the equation from being Holder
continuous to Lipschitz integrable. Second we are interested in possibilities of
achieving similar results for systems of equations. A third impetus proceeds
from our numerical results on the unit interval and unit square which have shown
that multigrid methods can provide an efficient means of solution for reasonable
choices of the coefficient function. However, an actual convergence proof for
the multigrid Full Approximation Scheme (FAS) is very hard to obtain and the
literature is remarkably sparse in the area of founding theory for the FAS
method. Our future research into solution methods for the discussed problems
will be to fill this gap and to investigate new and perhaps more efficient
techniques such as the Multilevel Projection (PML) methods to deal with this
type of nonlinear problems. ***
