Proposal Number: CBET 1463727 Institution: University of Cincinnati Title:
Student Travel Grant- 2015 National Combustion Meeting, Cincinnati, OH, May 17 -
20, 2014

The meeting is jointly hosted by the University of Cincinnati, the Central
States Section of the Combustion Institute, and General Electric Aviation. The
requested NSF funding is to partially offset the cost of participation by
students and post-doctoral researchers.

The Meeting draws researcher from academia, industry, and government and
private research organizations, focusing on all aspects of combustion and fire
phenomena including kinetics, flames, and reacting flows investigated using
various tools - theoretical, computational, and experimental. Student
participants will be exposed to the current status of the combustion research
will be on display. The students supported by this grant are required to present
their accepted papers and, as a result, will subsequently engage in many
discussions with their audience in particular and the community in general. The
meeting palys an important part in a young researcher's process of becoming a
mature researcher, which in time will serve them well in their career
development and in their ability in mentoring future researchers. The meeting
will feature a "Women in Combustion" event which encourages networking between
women in the field and provides opportunities for female graduate students to
meet role models and mentors in faculty, government and industrial positions. It
will also hold job fairs for students and post-doctoral researchers, which the
travel grant receiving students and post-docs are required to attend.
