The National Science Foundation is sponsoring its first National Conference on
Diversity in the Scientific Workforce, which is scheduled in Washington, DC on
September 24-27, 1992. The conference will focus attention on the Foundation's
role in the education of minorities who are underrepresented in science,
engineering and mathematics (SEM) fields. Conference activities will include
research presentations by 230 HRD project students. Morgan State University
proposes to coordinate student component activities including arranging student
travel and hotel accommodations and scheduling networking activities among
students and between students and scientists. The student component will
complement the planning and development of the NSF action plan by illustrating
the success of current NSF efforts in minority SEM education, thereby forming a
basis on which to build future strategies. Morgan would be assisted in these
tasks by Career Communications Group, Inc., a minority-owned firm that has
extensive experience in planning student career development activities.
