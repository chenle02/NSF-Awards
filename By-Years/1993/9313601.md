9313601 Policansky This award will enable the National Academy of Science (NAS)
to continue management of U.S. scientific participation in the international
Scientific Committee on Problems in the Environment (SCOPE), a committee of the
International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU). The objectives of SCOPE,
which was created in 1969) are: (1) to advance knowledge of (a) the influence of
humans on their environment and (b) the effects of environmental changes upon
people, their health, and their welfare, particularly those influences and
effects that are either global or are shared by several nations; and (2) to
serve as a council of scientists acting as a source of advice to governments and
intergovernmental bodies on issues concerning the environment. This award would
enable members of the U.S. National Committee for SCOPE, whose activities are
managed by the NAS, to continue their involvement in international projects
coordinated by SCOPE on sustainable development, biodiversity, and the effects
of increased ultraviolet radiation on biological systems.
