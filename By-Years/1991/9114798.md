Systematic studies of the subtribe Ecliptinae of the tribe Heliantheae
(Asteraceae), a group of about 500-600 species of the Southern and Eastern USA,
Mexico, Central and South America, Africa and Asia are proposed. The study will
focus on four major problems: elucidation of the major lineages and
relationships within the subtribe; clarification of the infrageneric taxonomy of
Verbesina, which is the most complex and taxonomically difficult genus of the
subtribe and the largest genus of tribe Heliantheae; resolution of generic
relationships and subtribal placement of Verbesian; and examination of the
patterns of evolution and radiation of Verbesina in South America. These goals
will be accomplished primarily be gathering chloroplast and nuclear ribosomal
DNA restriction site data, as well as chromosomal and morphological data.
Cladistic analysis of these diverse data sets will produce a phylogeny for the
subtribe and the largest genus in tribe Heliantheae. The results of these
studies, combined with recent cpDNA restriction site studies of the Ã•Heliantheae
(Kim et al. 1990a) will help clarify subtribal limits and relationships in one
of the largest tribes of the Asteraceae. Furthermore, at the infrageneric level
within Verbesina, the resulting phylogenies can then be used to construct a
modern infrageneric classification of the genus, as well as provide a basis for
resolving important biogeographical questions.
