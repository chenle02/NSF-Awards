The proposed political science research is to examine the intersection between
science and public policy in the Arctic. The proposed research will gather data
on two issues: oil/gas development and salmon fisheries in order to analyze the
role of science in policy advocacy in regional and transboundary policy systems.
Working in Alaska and Canada and basing their work on an advocacy coalition
model, the research will deepen the understanding of the influence of science
advocacy on public policy in the arena of natural resource development.
