This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at Bucknell University, an undergraduate institution,
acquire a 300 MHz NMR spectrometer which will be used in research investigations
in the following areas of chemistry: synthesis of cannabionoids and analogs,
asymmetric cycloalkenone synthesis, cycloadditions of heterodienes,
organometallic chemistry, cycloaddition reactions of o-quinone monimides with
heterocyclic systems, and preparation of inhibitors of lipoxygenase. Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to the
chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to
identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within
molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectroscopy is essential to chemists
who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are
useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
