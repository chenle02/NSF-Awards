The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a portable diagnostic system to identify pathogenic bacteria.
Currently, most diagnostic detection methods include growing cultures in vitro
coupled with antigen-based or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based detection
assays. However, these methods are often slow and ineffective, especially for
respiratory bacterial infections. The proposed technology is based on based on
optical scatter data combined with machine learning models and optimization. It
is a portable, automated approach that is designed to achieve rapid detection of
respiratory pathogens/bacteria with reduced classification times. The proposed
technology may have a broad impact on the health care industry and patient
outcomes, particularly respiratory infections in children and the elderly. In
addition, this technology has the potential to accelerate advances in clinical
diagnosis of pathogenic bacteria.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of a portable diagnostic system
for pathogenic bacteria detection and identification. The proposed technology
combines optical scatter data with machine learning models and optimization to
enable the evaluation and characterization of bacteria patterns and signatures.
The system is designed using light scattering of particles in the pathogenic
bacteria with the goal of providing a rapid, real-time, portable system for
detection and characterization of pathogenic bacteria. Preliminary results with
four different bacteria showed that optical signatures were obtained and that
different bacteria can be distinguished. The proposed system may be valuable to
clinicians and researchers for rapidly detecting the patterns of specific
bacterial infections.
