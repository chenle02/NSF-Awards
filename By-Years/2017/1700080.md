A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the
science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and
research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the
Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these
institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging,
rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that
may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational
appreciation for science and mathematics education. This project aligns directly
with that goal, and moreover will increase the body of knowledge on the genomics
of bacteriophages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of A'aniiih Nakoda College's
Science Education Alliance-Phage Hunters Advancing Genomics and Evolutionary
Science in Tribal Colleges and Universities (SEA-PHAGES in TCUs) Project are to
provide exciting professional development opportunities for STEM faculty, expand
research-based learning opportunities for STEM students, and build institutional
research capacity through participation in the SEA-PHAGES curriculum offered in
partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI). Faculty and
students will isolate, identify, sequence and analyze newly discovered
mycobacteriophages gathered from the local environment as part of a long-term,
nationwide study. Faculty at ANC will learn novel laboratory procedures,
participate in national training workshops, and enhance their research skills
and knowledge. Students at ANC will enroll in a two-semester sequence of
research-based STEM courses studying genomics and bioinformatics, gain valuable
hands-on laboratory experience, and participate in cutting edge research.
Knowledge and skills gathered through this project will result in the delivery
of new research-based STEM courses and curriculum and will provide a strong
foundation for future teaching and research in genomics, biotechnology and
bioinformatics at A'aniiih Nakoda College.
