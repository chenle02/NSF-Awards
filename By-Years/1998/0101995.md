This project is a five-year leadership development project in mathematics
educaton that addresses the need to retain qualified mathematics teachers in the
profession. The primary goal is to keep competent beginning and experienced K-12
teachers in the profession while increasing their ability to teach mathematics
effectively. The project is based at the University of Califonria, Santa
Barbara, and involves teachers and districts in Ventura and Santa Barbara
counties. In Project RENEW, two cohorts of 30 experienced teachers will received
36 days of professional development over a three-year period. These teachers,
called preceptors, will increase their knowledge of mathematics and mathematics
pedagogy, develop their leadership capabilities, and develop and implement
strategies to mentor three to five beginning teachers for a period of three
years. The plan is to involve the two cohorts of 30 teachers with two cohorts of
120 beginning teachers for a total of 300 teachers. A resource manual for
devloping teacher leadership for mentoring beginning teachers will be developed.
