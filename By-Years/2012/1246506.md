1246506&lt;br/&gt;Cotel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding will partially support
participant travel to the American Physical Society, Division of Fluid Dynamics,
65th Annual DFD Meeting 2012 in San Diego, CA, November 18-20, 2012. This is the
largest international annual meeting of fluid dynamicists in the world, with
2500 anticipated attendees. The meeting has been successfully run for over sixty
years. The intellectual merit of this conference lies in the exchange of
scientific ideas, presentations of cutting edge research and exposure to a
richly diverse array of topics in virtually every sub-discipline of fluid
dynamics. The broader impact will be to increase participation of students and
young scientists who would not otherwise be able to afford to travel to the
meeting and pay associated costs.
