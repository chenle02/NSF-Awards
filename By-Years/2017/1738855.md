Black Hills State University (BHSU) proposes a project--Expanding Pathways into
Computer Science across South Dakota (EPCS-SD)--that builds on a current pilot
project, extending its reach to profoundly rural regions and under-served
students throughout the state. The project will test and refine the pilot
project's professional development program, focusing on the nationally
disseminated high school curriculum Exploring Computer Science (ECS), in a
statewide setting. The program will be modified to support a more geographically
distributed group of teachers, the curriculum will be enhanced with additional
local relevance and cultural connections important to American Indian
communities, and new student recruitment and family engagement strategies will
be implemented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop a Research
Practitioner Partnership with a number of partners: teachers and administrators
from 20 South Dakota schools; faculty from BHSU and South Dakota School of Mines
and Technology; South Dakota GEAR UP (Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for
Undergraduate Programs), a joint effort of BHSU and South Dakota's Office of
Indian Education; and a nonprofit, Technology and Innovation in Education. The
research questions will evolve based on the needs of the practitioners but are
expected to focus on the extent to which the PD program succeeds in equipping
teachers to teach ECS effectively: To what degree does the suite of PD
components--together with the ECS curriculum itself--build teacher confidence
and competence in teaching computer science? and To what degree does
participation in the ECS course influence student beliefs and attitudes?
