This exploratory project is studying the use of mathematics and science
specialist teachers in elementary schools. The first four studies are in six
school districts in Washington State. They are characterizing and categorizing
the specialists, investigating the content knowledge, preparation and needs of
these teachers, determining their instructional effectiveness, and determining
their impact on student learning and attitudes towards mathematics and science.
The project is recruiting 25 specialists in math and 15 in science and comparing
them with equal numbers of matched non-specialist teachers. The fifth study is
conducting a survey of state educational agencies to determine the types of
specialist teaching models being used and how they are funded. The project is
directed by Western Washington University in partnership with the Mathematics
Education Collaboration.

The project is creating interview protocols for teachers and administrators, and
utilizing Learning Math for Teaching (University of Michigan) and Assessing
Teacher Learning About Science Teaching (ATLAST-Horizon Research). Classroom
observations are being conducted using the Reformed Teaching Observational
Protocol (RTOP-Arizona State University). Student measures include the
Washington State Measures of Student Progress in math and science, an instrument
to be created using items released by the National Assessment of Educational
Progress (NAEP), the Attitudes Towards Math Inventory, and the Modified
Attitudes Towards Science Inventory.

Project research results are being disseminated in mathematics and science
educational journals and conference presentations and are being posted on the
project website. Findings are be shared with the Educational Service Districts
in Washington State and other State agencies, as well as the National
Educational Association and the American Federation of Teachers.
