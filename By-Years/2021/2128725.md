Internet of things (IoT) produces a large influx of streaming data. The high
cost and long latency in shipping raw IoT data necessitates edge processing. The
objective of this project is to safeguard IoT data during edge processing. It
seeks to establish a trusted data path on the edge. As the data flows through
the path, the proposed edge system ensures 1) data confidentiality: IoT data is
only accessible to trusted parties; 2) integrity: all the data having arrived at
the edge is exactly manipulated according to the planned processing; 3)
verifiability: data flows and computations on the edge are verifiable to a
trusted cloud backend. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's research thrusts will
be tightly integrated with its education and outreach plan, educating students
on trustworthy computing scenarios as well as stimulating the public's interests
in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). There are plans to
contribute fresh contents to curriculum; enhance student maker activities with
in-situ IoT analytics; provide a summer course on IoT/Edge for local children;
and, present relevant outreach at community IoT events. As IoT is
revolutionizing modern society, the project aims toward more secure and
efficient intelligence driven by IoT data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
