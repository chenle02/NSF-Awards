Leucine zippers are formed when a pair of short alpha -helices in a pair of
protein molecules bind in a&lt;br/&gt;configuration called a coiled coil.
Leucine zippers and other coiled coils are abundant in nature;&lt;br/&gt;they
are found in about 10% of all proteins encoded in typical genomes, including
many important&lt;br/&gt;transcription factors. The project addresses two
complementary questions about leucine zippers.&lt;br/&gt;First, how do the
subunit interactions in the context of a specific leucine zipper from the
yeast&lt;br/&gt;transcription factor GCN4, control the specificity and stability
of zipper assembly. Different&lt;br/&gt;interactions will be engineered into the
GCN4 leucine zipper and characterized by biophysical&lt;br/&gt;assays including
equilibrium and stopped-flow circular dichroism, sedimentation equilibrium,
and&lt;br/&gt;X-ray crystallography. In addition, new biophysical assays for
leucine zipper assembly will be&lt;br/&gt;implemented based on analytical
ultracentrifugation and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy.&lt;br/&gt;Second,
the project will explore the diversity of coiled coils in a whole genome. Using
powerful&lt;br/&gt;genetic methods, the project will examine the specificity of
interactions among hundreds of&lt;br/&gt;naturally occurring, predicted coiled-
coils from the yeast genome that must coexist in the same
cell.&lt;br/&gt;Because of their small size and simple, repetitive structures,
leucine zippers have provided useful&lt;br/&gt;models for studying general
issues in how proteins fold. By combining research on
specific&lt;br/&gt;interactions with genome-wide studies of the properties of
many zippers, this project will test&lt;br/&gt;whether our understanding of
protein foldin is sufficient to illuminate the biology of a large
and&lt;br/&gt;widely distributed class of important proteins.
