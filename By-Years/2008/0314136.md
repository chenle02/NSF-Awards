The Cosmology Particles and Strings Summer School at the Institute for Advanced
Study fulfills a unique role in training advanced graduate students. The school
is for advanced graduate students in cosmology, particle theory and astrophysics
and it will give the students the benefit of an intensive cross disciplinary
experience. The school is expected to be an excellent mentoring experience for
these students by the leading experts in these three fields. The school will
enable people from smaller institutions to benefit from interactions with these
experts. Many of the lecturers will be women and minority scientists and every
effort will be made to have students from these two groups so that these
underrepresented groups will have excellent role models.
