Towson University establishes a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)
Site. The REU Site offers research projects in a broad area of materials and
chemistry research, including nanotechnology, thin film and sensor technology,
and solid state chemistry. Seven undergraduate students are recruited nationwide
every year for a nine-week summer research experience. The program also recruits
seven in-service teachers from the local region. Each teacher is paired with a
student. Students and teachers participate in an ethics course, workshops to
develop presentation skills, field trips, and social activities. The teachers
integrate their research experiences with curricular
activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-supported by the Division of
Materials Research, the Division of Chemistry, and the Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities of the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical
Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
