Earthquake engineering began in the early decades of the 20th century. Today, it
is rapidly losing those who pioneered in the development and evolution of
seismic design and earthquake hazard reduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to
capture the events that influenced the thinking behind today's engineering
theories and practices, the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute
inaugurated Connections, The EERI Oral History Series. Begun in 1994, limited
resources have prevented EERI from publishing many of the interviews that exist
only as rough audio tapes or from capturing the increasingly perishable
information that resides with the few remaining founders, while they are still
alive. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collectively, their histories provide one of the
few records of the way in which scientific and engineering knowledge has
developed over time and has influenced codes, practices, and society. Most
importantly, once published, their stories transmit the passion and commitment
that motivated them and help to attract a new generation of prospective leaders
in earthquake hazard reduction fields. &lt;br/&gt;
