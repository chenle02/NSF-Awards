CBET - 1510600&lt;br/&gt;PI: Washburn, Newell R.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hydraulic
cement is a major contributor to global carbon dioxide emissions into the
atmosphere. Low carbon dioxide cements are available but not widely used,
because they are difficult to process. This project will develop a new
superplasticizer that can be added to low-carbon dioxide hydraulic cement to
improve the cement's processing characteristics while reducing carbon dioxide
emissions. The new superplasticizer will be formulated using a process developed
by the PI in which synthetic polymers are grafted onto lignin, a biopolymer
derived from plants. Use of the new superplasticizer could reduce water use and
improve the performance of low-carbon dioxide cements, both of which would
reduce the environmental impact of construction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project will test the hypothesis that the complexity of lignin chemistry will
enable the superplasticizer to adsorb onto a broad range of low-carbon dioxide
cements. The project will identify chemistry-structure-property relationships
governing the dispersant properties of polymer-grafted lignin in tuning the
rheological properties of cementitious suspensions. The project will compare
lignin chemistries and grafting variables to determine how they affect aqueous
suspension properties, examine the adsorption of polymer-grafted lignin on
cement particles as a function of grafting variables and charge, and establish
effects of polymer-grafted lignin on the hydration of low-carbon dioxide cements
and the formation of high-strength cement phases.
