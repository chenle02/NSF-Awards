The phenomena of dislocation emission and movement in fiber- reinforced metals
due to thermal expansion mismatch and deformation of the metal matrix by slip
upon unidirectional straining is under study. Silver halides (AgCl and AgBr) are
used as model materials for investigating deformation in metal- matrix
composites. Silver halides can decorate dislocations at ambient temperatures,
allow elastic stresses to be imaged by birefringence are transparent, and deform
in a manner very similar to metals. Detailed information is obtained in three
dimensions about the stress field and dislocation structure in these model
systems.
