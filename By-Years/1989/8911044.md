This proposal examines the effects of prior beliefs and variations in
information acquisition behavior as keys to understanding risk perceptions among
english- and spanish- speaking farm workers in California. The project addresses
an important general concern in risk communication, which is that individual and
group differences have largely been left unaddressed by current models of risk
perception. As a result, little is known about the contribution of cultural
background, prior belief structures, or the consistency between risk messages
and prior beliefs to the effectiveness of risk communication strategies. These
topics are addressed in this project using a model of risk perceptions that
extends the current psychological paradigm by incorporating additional cultural
and behavioral concerns. This model then will be tested using a series of field
experiments that will explore individual differences in risk judgments not
associated with demographic characteristics. Pre-tests of several of the
experimentals already have been run, leading to refinements in the hypotheses as
well as data of interest on its own merit. The results of the study will include
both additions to general risk management decision making, leading to
improvements in the development of risk communication strategies, and additions
to specific knowledge concerning the risk perceptions of farm workers and their
understanding of pesticide hazards.
