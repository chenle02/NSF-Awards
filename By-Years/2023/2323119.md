This research project aims to uncover the intricate relationships between liquid
electrolytes and battery performance, which is crucial for developing next-
generation rechargeable batteries. By systematically varying the composition and
concentration of electrolytes, the team will identify optimal solutions. This
project aligns seamlessly with the Materials Genome Initiative, using high-
throughput advanced characterization, computational simulations, and machine
learning data-driven analysis to understand fundamental interactions of
electrolytes. With a focus on the long-term goal of developing high-performance,
safe, and sustainable energy storage solutions, this project holds tremendous
potential. Beyond technological advancements, the research outcomes will
contribute to STEM education and public awareness about energy storage,
fostering a brighter and greener future for all.

The fundamental interactions in the electrolyte directly determine the solvation
structures, kinetics, and battery performance of the bulk electrolytes.
Understanding the complex interactions and their correlation with electrolyte
performance is significant for exploring their working mechanisms and realizing
the rational design of battery electrolytes. The proposal aims to (1) gain a
good understanding of the solvation structure through high-throughput multimodal
characterization methods; (2) correlate the structure-property relationship by
studying transport properties through high-throughput computational screening
studies; (3) a machine learning-based data analysis platform will be created to
predict and identify battery properties by analyzing high-throughput structural
and simulation data.

This project is supported by the Division of Materials Research and the
