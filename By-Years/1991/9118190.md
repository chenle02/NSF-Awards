Synextensional sedimentary deposits provide an important record of the Earth's
surface response to crustal stretching. This project will use the synextensional
sedimentary rocks of the Colorado River extensional corridor to evaluate three
recently proposed models for detachment (extensional) fault evolution, and to
determine fault separation and paleogeography of the region. The results will
have important implications for continental extensional tectonics.
