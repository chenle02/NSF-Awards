With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program, the Department of Chemistry at Wayne State University will purchase a
Mass Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
including 1) the development of new nickel-catalyzed reactions and the total
synthesis of complex natural products; 2) the development of new metathesis-
based approaches to C-glycosides; 3) the total synthesis of pharmacologically
active natural products; 4) synthesis of complex carbohydrates and natural
products; 5) synthesis of natural products through biosynthetic pathway
engineering; and 6) the design and synthesis of enzyme and receptor inhibitors.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe
intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast
array of organic, bioorganic, and organometallic molecules. It is one of the
fastest growing and most widely used analytical instrumentation techniques.
Because of this, it is important for undergraduate and graduate students to be
exposed to the technique. Graduate students, undergraduate summer and postdocs
will use this instrument for their research. &lt;br/&gt;
