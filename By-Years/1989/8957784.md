This research is aimed at understanding the composition, origin and evolution of
the continental crust. The general approach used is the study of the geochemical
and isotopic composition of terrigenous sedimentary rocks. Results over the past
several years have shown that well behaved systematic behavior exists in the
geochemistry of terrigenous sediments that is controlled by a number of factors.
Included are sedimentary processes, such as weathering and diagenesis, and
provenance considerations, commonly related to plate tectonic associations. In
detail however, quantitative understanding of these controlling factors, at a
level that allows predictive modelling, remains elusive. The potential of this
research is great. The relationship between average sediment composition and
average upper crustal composition provides important constraints on overall
crustal composition and permits examination of such compositions through time.
The crust, generally considered to have been derived from the mantle is a major
geochemical reservoir for many elements and, accordingly, such study has direct
relevance for studies of mantle and bulk earth evolution. On a more practical
level, the study of trace element and isotopic composition in terrigenous
sedimentary rocks provides a great deal of additional information, required to
quantify relationships between sedimentation and tectonics, than is provided by
traditional approaches of sedimentary petrography.
