Gastrulation and dorsal-ventral axis formation in Drosophila are interrelated
processes which result from a complex hierarchy of maternal and zygotic gene
interactions. The product of a gene essential for these processes, the
maternally expressed gastrulation defective (gd) gene has been partially
characterized. The gd gene encodes three proteins present only in ovaries and
early embryos. These could arise through transcriptional or translational
regulation. The former possibility will be examined by nuclease protection
analysis of gd transcripts and the latter by metabolic labeling studies and by
immunoaffinity purifying and physically characterizing the three proteins. In
addition, the effect of mutations in other genes affecting dorsal-ventral
polarity on the gd proteins will be investigated. %%% The body plan of the
Drosophila larva is generated progressively during early stages of embryogenesis
through an interacting hierarchy of gene products. Dr. Konrad will characterize
one of these genes which will help to define the overall hierarchy of control.
