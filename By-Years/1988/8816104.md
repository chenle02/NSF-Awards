The objective of this research is a comparison between calculated and measured
vertical motions using the Flatland (ST) radar and a generalized omega equation.
The radar site near Champaign, Illinois, was selected to avoid orgraphically
induced vertical motions which compromise other existing sites in the U.S.
Various statistical methods will be employed using data from a single year. The
results should improve our knowledge of these new radars, particularly their
suitability for measuring synoptic scale vertical motion.
