Rhodes College request support from NSF for connection of its campus network to
SURAnet. SURAnet is the midlevel network located in the southeastern United
States. It will provide operations management and information services and it
will provide Rhodes College with a 56 thousand bits per second connection to the
NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone
network. The University needs greater functionality and network speed to be able
to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being
able to implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty research
will benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the school to
explore innovative educational resources.
