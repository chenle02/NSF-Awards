9412897 Paul, V. The University of Guam Marine Laboratory will build a housing
facility for accommodating visiting researchers including visiting graduate
students. The 2000 sq ft building will contain three bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a
kitchen, and a living area for dormitory style accommodations and a separate
suite with two bedrooms, one bath, and a kitchen for an apartment style unit.
Earlier support allowed the university to complete the architectural and
engineering plans for this building. Such a facility is considered extremely
important because 1) the institution is in an isolated academic environment and
visiting investigators are a valuable resource for interactions and new ideas,
and 2) skyrocketing rents and a serious housing shortage combine to make it
difficult to impossible to find adequate lodging for visitors staying less than
6 months. The University of Guam Laboratory supports the research of 8 full-time
faculty, numerous graduate and undergraduate students, as well as visiting
investigators. The research demands on facility have increased due to the
addition of new faculty at the laboratory, the recent establishment of
collaborative programs between the Marine Laboratory and the University of
Hawaii and the University of the Ryukyus (Okinawa, Japan), and the awareness of
the Marine Laboratory as a resource for coral reef research by over 550
scientists who attended the 7th International Coral Reef Symposium on Guam in
June 1992. The new building will allow the support of increasing numbers of
visiting scientists that wish to conduct research at the laboratory , which will
in turn enhance the research environment.
