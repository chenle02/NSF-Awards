This award supports a national two-day meeting in Fall 2003 that will bring
together researchers/educators supported in the Mathematical and Physical
Sciences Directorate (MPS) and K-12 teachers who have been involved with the
Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) activity in MPS. The purpose of this
meeting is to (1) to exchange ideas and reports on the impact of the RET program
on teachers, research scientists and K-12 students; (2) to examine the
effectiveness of RET as a professional development program; (3) to extend RET
opportunities to a more diverse range of teachers and schools; and (4) to expand
the professional community of teachers and researchers engaged in RET design and
evaluation.

The Research Experiences for Teachers activity provides enriching discovery-
based learning experiences for in-service and pre-service K-12 teachers at MPS-
supported REU Sites. RET was initiated at NSF in the Mathematical and Physical
Sciences Directorate in FY 1999 and since then, more than 1,000 K-12 teachers
have benefited from these research experiences. The proposed conference will
focus on how the impact of RET should be measured, and builds upon the Spring
2002 Bringing Research into the Science Classroom (BRISC) conference that was
supported under NSF award DMR-0135201.
