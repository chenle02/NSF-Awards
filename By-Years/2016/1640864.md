Big Data promises to have a positive impact on many aspects of our lives, but
assembling the data to answer questions or derive predictive models can be
challenging. Data scientists must typically go through multiple rounds of
curation, or 'wrangling,' where data are organized, refined, cleaned up, and
merged together before they can be analyzed. Curation is often slow and costly,
but is essential for obtaining useful and trustworthy answers. This project
develops a software tool called Vizier that aims to streamline data curation and
enable domain experts who do not have computer science expertise to curate their
own data. Easier curation magnifies the value of big data by enabling a wide
range of users to improve data quality, and in doing so benefits numerous types
of data-driven work in government, industry, and
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vizier features an intuitive interface combining
elements of notebooks and spreadsheets, allowing analysts to quickly see, edit,
and revise data. This capability is complemented by a framework for automated
data cleaning steps that are seamlessly integrated with manual curation
operations. The heart of Vizier is a system for managing uncertainty and
provenance of curation workflows and data, enabling the user to keep track of
higher-level curation operations as well as track the lineage of data. By
transparently maintaining the history of all the user's actions and their effect
on the curated data, Vizier enables regret-free exploration and curation where
any changes to the data and their transitive effects can be undone. By learning
from past curation histories, the system will also be able to provide users with
context-dependent recommendations for additional curation
actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award by the Advanced Cyberinfrastructure
