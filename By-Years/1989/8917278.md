The field of uncertainty modeling and analysis is presently in the definitive
state of intense research activity in almost all disciplines of engineering.
Probabilistic methods, Bayesian approaches, statistical techniques as well as
fuzzy logic and reasoning are currently being used by researches to deal with
uncertainty. Some of these methods are used by almost all sectors of the U.S.
research community, whereas other new methods continue to be mostly used by U.S.
researchers in academic institutions. On the other hand, in other countries,
especially Japan, researchers and engineers are currently using all these
methods more effectively in many engineering applications. The International
Symposium on Uncertainty Modeling and Analysis is organized based on the belief
that it is a timely event, which will provide the opportunity and needed
stimulus for U. S. researchers and engineers to interact with researchers and
engineers from other countries. The interaction and discussions among the
participants, and the resulting publications will benefit the research and
engineerting communites.
