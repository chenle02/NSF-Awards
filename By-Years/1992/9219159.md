This ongoing research has a long-term objective of developing a systematic body
of liquidus phase equilibrium data on model chemical systems relevant to the
origin and crystallization of the presumed early magma ocean and on the
generation of magmas from the Earth's mantle. The proposed projects will utilize
piston cylinder and multianvil techniques to determine the phase relationships
that control the melting behavior of model amphibolite-kyanite-quartz eclogite
at 3 GPa and the melting and crystallization behavior of model peridotite at
pressures from 7 - 16 GPa. Results of these studies will directly address
aspects of magma generation at subduction zones and will place additional
constraints on the formation and crystallization of a presumed early magma
ocean.
