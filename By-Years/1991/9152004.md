The goal of this project is to provide a learning environment that draws upon
students' natural curiosity to explore and observe. The stereoscopic brightfield
microscopes, phase contrast microscope with video attachments for
demonstrations, an IBM Info window Computer system with Laser Disk playback for
tutorials, and anatomical models, physiogrips and spectrophotometers allow the
overwhelmingly minority and female students served by the institution to obtain
hands-on experience that influences their decision to consider careers in
science and technology.
