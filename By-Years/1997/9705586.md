Grunow OPP 9705586 Abstract Geological and geophysical research sponsored by
the US Antarctic Program of the National Science Foundation along the Antarctic
margin has usually concentrated on the areas traditionally visited either by
ship, such as the Antarctic Peninsula and Ross Sea regions, or areas easily
accessible by aircraft from McMurdo Station. Limited access to much of the
margin has resulted in data sets and interpretations that are skewed toward
processes and events within and along the Ross and Weddell sea regions and West
Antarctica. This award supports a workshop with primary objectives of
identifying key scientific questions which could be addressed through cruises to
the Wilkes, Enderby and Queen Maud Land areas of the East Antarctic margin, and
assessing the level of interest within the US community of implementing research
cruise initiatives. Potential research objectives can be divided into the
following sub-disciplines: a) nearshore marine research with an emphasis on
paleoclimatic studies; b) continental shelf to oceanic crust marine research
stressing questions of Mesozoic breakup and rifting geometry; c) onshore pre-
Tertiary geological research looking at Gondwana assembly and breakup events;
and d) onshore Late Tertiary geological and geophysical studies, also primarily
of paleoclimatic significance. The unifying element between these disciplines is
the essential need to develop a circumpolar view of Antarctic earth sciences.
Implicit in this goal is cooperation of USAP efforts with other national
programs, particularly Australia and Japan. A secondary objective of the
workshop will be to coordinate a logistics plan which would mesh the scientific
goals of onshore and offshore programs in order to take full advantage of the
allocated ship-time.
