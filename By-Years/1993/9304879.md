Methods of analysis in structural geology parallel in many ways other fields of
design. For example, geologists are interested in describing quantitatively the
3-D form and history of deformed rocks and structures. Because of the
complexities of natural systems, conventional methods for such endeavors require
massive computer support and are generally beyond most investigators. This
project seeks to examine the theoretical basis and practical implementation of
Bezier tools for structural geology. Such tools have the potential of
revolutionizing this field because of their computational economy, i.e.,
structures can be described in simpler terms than can conventional techniques.
Practical implementation of these tools has been slow, however, and has thus not
reached the large pool of potential users, save for scientists employed by well-
heeled industrial concerns. This proposal seeks to examine the utility of Bezier
tools for structural geology and to bring these methods to the mainstream
through the development of public domain software.
