Dr. Elsa Reichmanis of the American Chemical Society (ACS) is supported by the
Chemistry Division Office of Special Projects and the Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities to organize a program at the National ACS meeting,
which will be held in Chicago in August, 2001. This program will consist of a
presentation by Willie Pearson of Wake Forest University, who will give an
overview of diversity issues and present data on women and under-represented
minorities. A panel discussion focussing on graduate school retention and under-
representation of women and minorities on university faculties will follow.
Panelists will include Hector Abruna (Cornell), Billy Joe Evans (U Michigan),
Paula Hammond (MIT), Judith Klinman (UC Berkely), Harry Morrison (Purdue U) and
Bradford Wayland (Penn).
