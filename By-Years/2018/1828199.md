This workshop brings together natural language processing (NLP) researchers
whose work contributes to the free flow of information on the Internet. It
should foster collaboration across disciplines, and between theoreticians and
practitioners working in academic or industrial settings. This workshop could
have a transformative impact on society by getting closer to achieving Internet
freedom in countries where accessing and sharing of information are strictly
controlled by censorship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topics of interest in this
workshop include censorship detection, censorship
circumvention&lt;br/&gt;techniques, linguistically inspired countermeasures for
Internet censorship, and techniques to&lt;br/&gt;empirically measure Internet
censorship across communication platforms. The workshop includes researchers
working in the field of NLP, computer science and social sciences. Graduate
students, faculty, and researchers from industry will
participate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
