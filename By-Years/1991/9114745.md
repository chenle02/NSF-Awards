High-temperature deformation of metal-matrix composites will be studied from the
micromechanics standpoint. The study will also include the influence of
distributed damage in the ductile matrix on the overall time-dependent behavior
of the material. Guided by the observations that most metallic constituents may
undergo both primary and secondary creep in addition to the usual elastic
deformation, and that the creep rate usually depends on stress nonlinearly, the
following four specific problems will be examined: (1) stress-strain relation of
the composite under a constant strain rate, (2) higher creep strain range, and
(4) the extension to a higher particle or fiber concentration. These studies
will be carried out with a special reference to the practical and potential
service environments. Whenever possible, simple macroscopic constitutive
theories which can reflect the essential features of these micromechanical
considerations will be developed for design and analysis. The aim is to
translate this scientific knowledge into use, so that the microstructures which
would provide the strongest creep resistance under the service conditions could
be identified.
