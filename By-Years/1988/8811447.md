Project involves the analysis of approximately 100 heat flow data points taken
during the Mariana Mounds ALVIN program in 1987. Measurements include 19
measurements along 5 short multi- penetration profiles, 11 gradient measurements
from piston cores and 85 temperature gradient measurements using the ALVIN
probe. Raw data will be processed to obtain actual temperatures, thermal
conductivity will be estimated from porosity profiles and existing data.
Estimates of advective flow rates will be obtained from temperature profile
curvatures. The heat flow data coupled with other data should help characterize
the Mariana Mounds hydrothermal system. %%% Seafloor hydrothermal systems are a
relatively recent discovery of fundamental importance. The heat flux from these
systems is an important factor in the global heat budget of the earth and the
chemical and mass flux has a significant effect on ocean chemistry, the
formation of ore deposits, and the development of biological communities. Little
is known about the details of the hydrologic regime of mound structures that are
often found at hydrothermal discharge zones. The work to be carried out in this
project will help address this problem.
