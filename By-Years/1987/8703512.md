Predation and interspecific competition can interact to determine the
distribution and abundance of species, but such interactions rarely have been
studied experimentally in terrestrial ecosystems. Dactylotum is an abundant
grasshopper in the grasslands of southeastern Arizona. It also is gaudily-
colored, apparently distasteful, and immune from predation by birds. Other
common grasshoppers in the proposed study area comprise the major prey of
breeding birds. They also potentially compete with Dactylotum for food and
habitat. Preliminary data indicate that birds can have a significant impact on
grasshopper populations, and that Dactylotum populations can be manipulated
effectively in the field. Replicated plots on a grassland preserve in
southeastern Arizona will be used to exclude 1) birds, or 2) Dactylotum, or 3)
both, or 4) neither. Grasshopper densities will be measured on the plots from
July to October for one pre-treatment and three post-treatment years. Results
will test hypotheses about the independent and interactive effects of bird
predation vs. interspecific competition upon the abundances of grasshoppers in
this semidesert grassland. Drs. Jane and Carl Bock will work jointly on these
experiments. Their excellent research records assure a productive endeavor.
