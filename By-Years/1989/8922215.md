This project will provide support for shipboard scientific support equipment for
the research vessel WECOMA, an NSF owned ship operated by Oregon State
University, and dedicated to use in support of ocean science research. The
Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds for ship equipment
deemed essential to the proper and safe conduct of ocean science research. This
Program provides support for such items as deck equipment including winch
systems for the deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational
equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin point
the location of research sites, communication equipment including radio
transceivers and satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data
communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats for transporting
scientists to and from data retrieval sites. The Project Director, Kennard
Palfrey is fully qualified to direct this project having had considerable
experience in overseeing the acquisition and installation of shipboard
equipment. The project will allow the institution to modify the coring winch for
increased line pull, acquire a block for improved wire handling, add a survey-
grade LORAN, restore AFRTS reception, and purchase a scintillation counter for
the radioisotope van.
