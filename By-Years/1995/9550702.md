9550702 Wu The proposed research would support new research in theoretical
physics at Prairie View A&M University. The research would focus on (1)
B-particle processes. The B-particle physics and CP violation work will be
devoted to finding methods to sort out the CP violating phases from the phases
which can interplay with them. Tests of CPT invariance and B decays with final
state baryons will also be studied. The computer simulation of physical
processes work will be aimed at creating an event generator of gluon-gluon
scattering which produces a top-anti-top pair plus two gluons. Four
undergraduate students will participate in the proposed work. ***
