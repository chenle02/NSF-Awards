This award supports the Fourth Pan-American Symposium on Experimental Physics to
be held in Bariloche, Argentina from November 6-10, 1989. The U.S. organizer is
Leon M. Lederman of Fermilab (Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory) and his
Argentinian counterpart is Mario A.J. Mariscotti of the University of Buenos
Aires. The main purpose of the Symposium is to review the status of high energy
particle physics (HEP) with emphasis on increased Latin American scientist
participation in the science and the associated technology. There will also be a
general survey of other fields of physics as well as such technology as
superconductivity, cryogenics, ultra-high vacuum and advanced electronics, all
closely related to HEP. Since scientists will attend from several Latin American
countries, the stimulation by and assistance of U.S. scientists and the
formation of HEP groups in Latin America will help fulfill the goals of the
Science in Developing Countries program.
