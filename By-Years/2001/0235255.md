All organisms must obtain a specific set of trace metals from their environment
yet these same metals, if present in excess, can lead to toxicity often by
catalyzing the formation of toxic free radicals. Iron and copper, in particular,
can aggravate oxidative stress by contributing to the generation of highly
reactive hydroxyl radicals. In contrast, manganese and zinc can actually protect
cells against oxidative stress. Bacillus subtilis contains two regulons that are
selectively induced by peroxide stress (PerR and OhrR) and at least two regulons
induced by nitric oxide (PerR and Fur). This project focuses on two regulators
that respond to reactive oxygen species: PerR and OhrR. The peroxide regulon
(PerR) repressor is structurally related to Fur but PerR functions
physiologically as a sensor of peroxidative stress, rather than metal ion
starvation. It is proposed that PerR, together with a metal bound cofactor,
reacts with hydrogen peroxide to generate an inactive repressor. The nature of
the change(s) in PerR that lead to derepression will be defined. The OhrR
protein contains a highly reactive cysteine residue that reacts with organic
peroxides to generate a cysteine-sulfenic acid derivative. This protein
modification inactivates the repressor leading to expression of an organic
hydroperoxide resistance gene. The effects of cysteine oxidation on OhrR
function will be investigated. The proposed studies will provide insights into
how proteins function as sensors of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species. The
presence of related regulators in diverse bacteria argues that the paradigms
established by a detailed characterization of these proteins will have far-
reaching implications.
