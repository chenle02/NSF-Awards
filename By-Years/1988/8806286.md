A Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) is being acquired. This will
be used in a number of research projects including studies of oxidative coupling
of methane to form ethane or ethylene, bimetallic catalysts, thin films,
oxidation or hydrogenation of carbon monoxide, and reactions at the liquid-
solid interface.
