This award support the model simulations of middle Pliocene climate using
paleoclimatic data derived from the time period. The researcher will use
Pliocene age terrestrial and marine data from the Pliocene Research,
Interpretation, and Synoptic Mapping (PRISM) project as input to a coupled
ocean-atmosphere General Circulation Model (GCM). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
rationale for the research is that the middle Pliocene was a time when the Earth
experienced global temperatures that are comparable to recent projections of
future climate due to increases in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse
gases. Specifically, high latitude warming (relative to the present) and a
reduced equator-to-pole temperature gradient dominated the middle
Pliocene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this proposed research
center on addressing a critical question regarding greenhouse gases (GHG)
concentrations and ocean temperatures. There is a desire on the part of the
scientific community to determine if there are any oceanic 'surprises' in terms
of heat transport or ocean circulation that track the increasing concentrations
of GHG in the atmosphere. Using data from a period of greater warmth on Earth,
in which geophysical boundary conditions are similar to the modern world, this
proposed research may help identify if there are any 'surprises' in basic
function of the heat carrying or circulatory properties of the ocean. When
completed, the data generated by this research will be made available to the
wider scientific community through publicly accessible databases.
