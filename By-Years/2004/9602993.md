9602993 Sites "CONSERVATION GENETICS OF AMAZON RIVER TURTLES, GENUS PODOCNEMIS
(PELOMEDUSIDAE)." The grant for cooperative research between Jack Sites of the
Department of Zoology, Brigham Young University, and Craig Moritz of the
Department of Zoology, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia, will
provide three months of support for Dr. Sites in Australia as part of a longer
visit. Sites will work in the Laboratory of Conservation Genetics, with C.
Moritz and N. FitzSimmons, to learn methods of microsatellite development and
analysis for application to an endangered reptile. Sites will screen several
nesting rookeries of the Amazon River Turtles (Podocnemis expansa and P.
unifilis) for mitochondrial (mtDNA) and nuclear (microsatellite) genetic markers
to estimate patterns and levels of female (mtDNA) and male (microsatellite) gene
flow within and between river basins in the Brazilian Amazon. Sites will learn
both new molecular methods which will strengthen his program, and benefit from
the pool of expertise available in the Moritz lab, especially their experience
in addressing similar questions in marine turtles. Moritz and FitzSimmons will
benefit from learning about the application of their methods to a new species of
colonial-nesting turtle, and by extension to conservation issues in the
Neotropics in general. Both will also meet the Brazilian coordinator of this
effort, Dr. Nelson J. da Silva, who has secured government permission for this
project, and has collected some of the samples. Sites will prepare a full
proposal for submission to the National Science Foundation from these data upon
completion of his stay.
