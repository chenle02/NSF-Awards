The PIs will attempt to understand why submarine slopes fail where and when they
do, through numerical modeling that will simulate the evolution of stresses and
fluid pressures (and flow) in sedimentary buildups. They propose to use Discrete
Element Methods (DEM) to model these processes, inputting laboratory and
borehole constraints such as shear strength, internal friction, density and
porosity and deriving internal friction, compressive and tensile shear
strengths, and elastic modulii through modeling. The focus of the study research
will be to attempt to understand the causes of failure in these environments,
which is difficult to accomplish through direct observation.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include graduate student training, support
of underrepresented groups in the Earth Sciences, K-12 outreach, enhanced
computational infrastructure, dissemination of results to the broader geohazards
community, and the societal benefits of understanding the risk associated with
submarine landslide hazards.&lt;br/&gt;
