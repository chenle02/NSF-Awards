9727623 Schwartz Animal communication in nature involves detection of important
signals in a noisy environment. In gray tree frog mating choruses calling males
attempt to attract mates, females must discriminate among large number of
competing calls and use this acoustic information to choose among competing
males making this an ideal setting in which to investigate such signal
discrimination in a noisy environment. The proposed research will also improve
our understanding of mate assessment in nature and competition among males.
Females of the gray treefrog base their choice of mate solely on acoustic
criteria. In the intensely competitive environment of a chorus, males change
their calls in a way that laboratory experiments suggestshould improve their
attractiveness. However, we don t know how well females can assess males in the
complex acoustic environment of a chorus or why certain patterns of calling are
preferred. Nor are the fine details of the vocal competition that occurs among
males or the relationship between these details and male condition understood.
This research, using field-based tests of female choice and laboratory studies
of male vocalizations, will help answer these questions in addition to
addressing the general problem of signal detection in a noisy environment.
Experiments will use a computer-based interactive playback system, that
constitutes a new methodology for application to studies of animal
communication.
