The Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships are awards to
recent recipients of doctoral degrees in the mathematical sciences. These awards
are a means of contributing to the future vitality of the scientific effort of
the nation. As researchers in the mathematical sciences expand their
interactions with other disciplines, and as the interplay increases between the
various areas of mathematics itself, opportunities for postdoctoral research and
training are becoming increasingly important. The fellowships are designed to
permit awardees to choose research environments that will have maximal impact on
their future scientific development. The fellowship is designed to provide 24
months of support divided into 18 academic-year months and 3 periods of two
summer months. The recipient may choose (1) the Research Fellowship option which
allows for full-time support for any 18 academic-year months in a three-year
period, in intervals not shorter than 3 consecutive months or (2) the Research
Instructorship option which allows the 18 months of academic year support to be
taken as 9 months of full-time support and 18 months of half-time support. Not
more than two months of summer support from this Fellowship may be received in
any calendar year. Avrim Blum will receive his doctoral degree from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and will pursue research in the area of
theoretical computer science, especially approximation algorithms and machine
learning theory, under the guidance of Merrick Furst at Carnegie-Mellon
University.
