This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of electroanalytical chemistry. The primary thrust of this activity
is develop normal and reverse pulse squarewave voltammetric techniques for
application to micro- and ultramicroelectrodes. These electrodes, which have
diameters less than 25 micrometers, are fabricated from platinum, carbon,
tungsten, and mercury-coated iridium. Use of them as voltammetric sensors
alleviates many of the electrical resistance restrictions that are encountered
with larger electrodes. The theory which describes the pulse voltammetric
responses expected at these electrodes is being developed by Dr. Osteryoung for
analytical and kinetic use. The application of pulse voltammetric techniques to
micro- and ultramicroelectrodes provides new, sensitive electrochemical
measurement technologies that should have broad application in trace analysis,
materials characterization, and in vivo studies of biosystems.
