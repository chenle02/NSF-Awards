The long term goal of this research is to understand the functional organization
and structural dynamics of the RecA and RecBCD enzymes in order to determine how
their many activities are coordinated in carrying out the overall process of
genetic recombination. The regions of these enzymes that are involved in
particular functions, e.g. DNA binding, ATP binding and hydrolysis, and
oligomeric contacts will be identified. Once regions of the proteins have been
identified as critical for a given function, a variety of mutagenic techniques
will be used, combined with appropriate genetic selections and screens, to
detail the structural requirements for that function. Resulting mutant proteins
will also be analyzed for their ability to undergo ligand-induced conformational
changes, a feature of many multifunctional enzymes which underlies their ability
to coordinate various catalytic activities. Further genetic analysis of the
relationship between protein structure and function will be performed by using a
number of the recombination deficient mutant proteins obtained in this study to
select androgenic second site revertants. The analyses of RecA and RecBCD will
serve to provide both a more detailed molecular description of genetic
recombination, as well as further insights into the mechanisms by which
multifunctional, oligomeric enzymes organize a variety of activities into an
ordered enzymatic process.
