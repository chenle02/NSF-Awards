The PIs will develop a novel middle atmosphere temperature lidar that uses
broadband tunable solid-state lasers and mesospheric iron as the fluorescence
tracer. This system will be rugged and reliable, capable of making observations
day and night, and capable of being deployed at remote sites or operated from
research aircraft. After its construction, the system will characterize the
thermal structure of the middle atmosphere to study iron and calcium in the
mesopause region, and study the influence of tides and planetary waves. These
observations will substantially improve the limited knowledge of middle
atmosphere temperatures, quantify the natural variability, provide crucial tests
of middle atmosphere circulation models, and significantly enhance understanding
of large scale waves and tides in this region. Finally, the Arctic temperature
observations planned will be the first made of the mesopause region at extreme
high latitudes.
