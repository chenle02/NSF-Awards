Partial support is provided for a symposium on Megatrends in Hydraulics, June 30
- July 2, 1985, at the Colorado State University. The two main objectives of the
Symposium on "Megatrends in Hydraulics" are to assess the state-of-the-art in a
variety of topics selected to cover a wide range of hydraulic engineering
interests and to plan future research directions in hydraulic engineering. The
purpose of the Symposium is to bring together internationally renowned
engineers, researchers, and scientists in the field of hydraulic engineering to
exchange the latest advances in the state-of-the-art, to focus on the assessment
of the current knowledge and to discuss future trends in hydraulic research. A
set of proceedings will be published including invited presentations, papers,
discussions, and comments on the topics of the symposium.
