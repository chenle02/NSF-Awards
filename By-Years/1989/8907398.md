This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of surface vibrational spectroscopy. High resolution vibrational
spectra of a variety of molecular species adsorbed on metal surfaces will be
measured using Fourier transform infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy
(FT-IRAS). The limits of IRAS will be extended: 1) to study adsorbate-substrate
vibrations; 2) to characterize the temperature dependence of vibrational line
shapes at temperatures as low as 10 K; 3) to characterize the line shapes of
overtones; 4) to characterize and analyze the influence of order-disorder phase
transitions on adsorbate lineshapes. Chemical systems to be studied include the
molecular species phosphorus trifluoride, carbon monoxide and ethylidyne on
single-crystal faces of platinum and nickel. The intrinsic lineshapes of
vibrational spectra contain information on adsorbate-adsorbate interactions, the
extent of vibrational coupling to other modes, and the lower bound of other
vibrational modes. The wide range of temperatures that will be employed in this
study and the possibility of freezing out phonon mechamisms will permit
discrimination among various competing mechanisms of line broadening.
