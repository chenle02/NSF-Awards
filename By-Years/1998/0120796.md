The proposed Compact High Performance Cooling Technologies Research Center will
address research and development needs of industries in the area of high-
performance heat removal from compact spaces. All product sectors in the
electronics industry (high-performance, Cost/Performance, Telecommunications,
Hand-held, Automotive, and Military/Avionics) face critical electronics cooling
challenges, and the Center brings together an excellent team of faculty to
address these needs. Faculty participants in the proposed Center are from the
Schools of Mechanical Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering and
Aeronautics and Astronautics at Purdue University, and contribute complimentary
competencies in heat transfer, microfluidics, microfabrication, mechatronics,
controls, acoustics, sensing and actuation, diagnostics and measurements, and
systems-level research.
