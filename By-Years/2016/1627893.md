This project examines the history of urban growth, legalization of urban
squatters, and its effects on developing communities. The research will examine
how different governments evaluated the issue of squatting and framed it to the
public; it will identify for whom and why states legalized squatting; and it
will assess the effects of legalization, including compliance and resistance.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research will be multi-method, including
archival research, quantitative analysis of community characteristics and state
responses, and qualitative interviews. The co-PI will remain on-site in two
locations for several months to collect these data. The research helps re-
theorize state-building, contributes to the literature on symbolic governance,
and identifies the effects of extending urban citizenship under differing
conditions.
