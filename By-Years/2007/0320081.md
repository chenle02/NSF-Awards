This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project offers a solution to the
fundamental challenge facing the designers of the physical layer of diagnostic
systems and scientific instruments. Many of these instruments currently monitor
and analyze signals and systems in the frequency domain, and are used in
virtually every technical endeavor. Currently these systems are compute-bound,
either in speed or area/power. The Phase I aims to develop an innovative
instrumentation technology, called GAUSS, that will achieve a new standard in
speed/power performance and, in the process, enable the development of new and
powerful test and measurement products. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the proposed
technology, engineers can rapidly enable system-on-a-chip (SoC) solutions for
the test and measurement market. Marketed as a semiconductor IP technology, the
GAUSS technology can be used to develop both high-end and embedded SoC
solutions. This powerful design paradigm will become available to design
engineers responsible for developing the physical layer of future diagnostic and
instrument products requiring ever increasing performance, lower cost margins,
and time-to-market advantages. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
