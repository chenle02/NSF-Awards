This project, in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry
Program, is a continuation of Professor Kenneth J. Klabunde's studies at Kansas
State University of applications of "free atoms" and small particles. Specific
topics to be investigated include 1) the use of metal atoms to produce novel
arenemetal complexes of novel ligands such as sigma- bonded silanes, 2) the
reaction of Group 2 metal atoms with alkyl or aryl halides to produce clusters
that conceptionally may be considered as a combination of an alkyl or aryl metal
halide with a small number (1-3) of additional metal atoms, 3) combination of
metal vapors of two elements to small bielement particles as metastable alloys
or mixtures, and 4) generation of colloids by deposition of metal vapors into
organic solvents and their applications in generating films of metals on
polymeric substrates. Condensation of gaseous metal atoms is rapidly becoming an
important method of generating new materials with many interesting and important
technological applications. This project is concerned with the fundamental
understanding of exactly how metal atoms combine together, and with other
reactive species, to give materials with specific properties.
