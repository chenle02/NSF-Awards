This project involves partial support for a topical conference on Geochemical
Self-Organization, to be held in late June, 1988. This emerging
interdisciplinary topic involves a wide variety of geological processes and
phenomena, including metamorphic banding, periodic zoning in crystals, and
Liesegang banding in authigenic sedimentary minerals. This conference will for
the first time bring together leading researchers in the field for a coherent
presentation of current research and future directions in this exciting field.
