Large - Eddy Simulation (LES) has served as a powerful tool for turbulence
research over the last two decades. Computers with ever increasing speed and
memory have also now made it possible to compute some turbulent flows using
Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS). The research on LES of separated turbulent
flows is proposed using parallel computing techniques. The study will determine
the turbulence statistics for these flows. The proposed computation is very
intensive in terms of memory and CPU time and, therefore, implementation on a
multi-processor computer should lead to development of an efficient algorithm.
The study will provide valuable experience and knowledge in the development of
numerical algorithms for LES of separated turbulent flows, which can then be
effectively applied to even more intensive computations using DNS of similar
flows. To approximate the spatial derivatives, a combination of fourth- order
finite-differences and spectral discretization will be used. Time derivatives
will be approximated by an implicit method. The proposed methods will be
implemented on CRAY- YMP8/864.
