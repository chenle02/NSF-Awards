This research involves various experiments which lead to information concerning
the dynamics of charge density wave (CDW) and spin density wave (SDW) ground
states. The collective mode ac response of CDW and SDW condensates will be
investigated in the radio, micro, millimeter and infrared spectral range, and
will emcompass a search for nonlinear excitations of the ground states. These
experiments will lead to information on the interplay between collective mode
and single particle excitations, including questions concerning the dynamics of
internal modes of the condensates. Experiments will also be conducted under the
joint application of dc and ac fields, in an attempt at exploring the
possibility of quantum phenomena which may arise at low temperatures in the
various broken symmetry ground states. The experiments will be conducted on
various inorganic and organic linear chain compounds. %%% This research involves
the study of the behavior of various types of new, ordered electron states of
solids, called the charge density wave and spin density wave states. The
electrical conductivity will be investigated as the function of frequency and of
applied electric fields. The objective is to examine the new type of nonlinear
transport phenomena which are due to the collective motion of these electron
states. Because of anomalous response, these materials may also serve as novel
detectors and generators, and these aspects of the field will also be examined.
The experiments will be conducted in various organic and inorganic materials
where such states develop.
