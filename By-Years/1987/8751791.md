The Girls Clubs of America (GCA) plans to develop over a three year period
informal science learning activities to increase the participation of women aged
14-18 in mathematics and science. These materials are part of an overall
program, "Operation SMART," that is a major national commitment by the Girls
Clubs of America to include science and mathematics education as a major
component of GCA activities at all age levels. Prior projects have developed and
implemented successful materials directed at elementary and middle school girls;
the present project extends this effort into the critically important high
school age years. The materials will be developed by project staff in
association with developers at the Educational Development Center (EDC), piloted
and tested in four Girls Clubs sites along with training chapters nationwide. A
publisher will be identified for national distribution and sales of activity
materials sets and a book-length publication designed for use by education
programs of other youth-serving organizations. A partnership with the Business
and Professional Women's Association (BPW/USA) and its 3400 local chapters and
with the AAAS Linkages Project will create many non-Girls Club sites.
Dissemination to other youth- serving organizations will be carried out through
the National Collaboration for Youth. As a result, Operation SMART's high school
age materials should reach several hundred thousand young women. Foundations and
businesses will provide substantial additional project support; approximately
51% of the total $ l.4 million project budget is requested from NSF.
