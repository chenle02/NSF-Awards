The project will concentrate on electrical impedance tomography and X-ray
tomography. Electrical impedance tomography is a non invasive method to
determine contrasts of conductivity in the human body. The main goals will be to
prove uniqueness in the two dimensional case and to develop efficient
reconstruction algorithms. The project also includes the anisotropic case of the
problem, i.e. the case in which the conductivity depends on direction. The aim
of this research is to understand the mechanisms of nonuniqueness as well as to
develop reconstruction algorithms. Also analogous questions for determining the
elastic properties of a material by making boundary measurements will be
studied. Problems in X-ray tomography where the integration is performed over a
3-dimensional set of lines will be considered. This work encounters applications
not only in medical imagery but also in nondestructive testing of machinery and
materials.
