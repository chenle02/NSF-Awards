A 1994 study by the Engineering Deans Council and Corporate Roundtable of the
American Society for Engineering Education concluded, "Today, engineering
colleges must not only provide their graduates with intellectual development and
superb technical capabilities, but following industry's lead, those colleges
must educate their students to work as part of teams, communicate well, and
understand the economic, social, environmental and international context of
their professional activities." This college, in partnership with major
engineering universities, is in a position to accomplish this goal. The college
is adding FORTRAN and Engineering Graphics to offer an emphasis in pre-
engineering. This project implements the two new courses and improves existing
courses by providing computer hardware and software. With a pre-engineering
program at the college, students are able to transfer to three universities
without loss of credit.
