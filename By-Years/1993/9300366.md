Two important directions provide the focus of this research. One goal is to
achieve high quantum efficiency photoluminescence from conjugated polymers in
solution and in solid thin films. Such highly efficient luminescent polymer
films are intended for use in light-emitting diodes (LEDs) fabricated from
conducting polymers. The other is to study high quantum efficiency charge
separation in conjugated polymer-"buckyball" composites and in p-n
heterojunctions made from conjugated polymer-"buckyball" bilayers. The
photoinduced charge transfer is analogous to the key step in artificial
photosynthesis. A deeper understanding of the science offers the potential for
low-cost efficient solar energy conversion from solar cells fabricated from such
heterojunctions. Conducting polymers are now available as materials with unique
properties: the important electronic and optical properties of semiconductors
and metals in combination with the attractive mechanical properties and the
processing advantages of polymers. The research will provide basic scientific
research on the quantum chemistry and physics of the pi-electrons in conjugated
polymers for LEDs and artificial photosynthesis.
