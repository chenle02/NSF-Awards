9521383 Nielson-Gammon This award supports investigations of the dynamics of
upper atmospheric troughs or short waves. These troughs trigger most
extratropical cyclogenesis, but the source for these short waves is not well
understood. The primary objectives are to determine the typical mechanism(s) of
formation of upper-level mobile troughs, to understand the nature of the
interaction between these troughs and high terrain, to explore the role of
extratropical cyclones in creating a distribution of potential vorticity that is
conducive to the growth and propagation of short-waves and the effect of such
fields on the cyclone development. The principal investigator will employ a
diagnostic technique known as piecewise potential vorticity inversion. Advances
in the understanding of upper-level troughs and their role in extratropical
cyclogenesis would be of considerable benefit to the improvement of weather
forecasting and climate simulations. ***
