GARMIRE The development of adequate or superior optical systems depends upon the
interaction of collaborators who have a detailed knowledge of materials and
device fabrication with those who have an overall view of what the optical
system should accomplish and how it should accomplish it. The presently proposed
effort concentrates upon the device and materials studies, particularly those
which involve a nonlinear interaction between the optical field and the
material. Such interactions and devices based upon them will play a crucial roll
in the realization of optical systems which go beyond communications. Increasing
the nonlinearity and the variety of materials which are likely candidates for
doing so, is one of the basic thrusts within the lightwave technology program.
The present effort is central to this thrust of the strategic plan for lightwave
technology. In addition to the materials studies, the grant will involve
nonlinear device studies including new means by which radiation can be
efficiently detected and structures which can guide radiation and provide
feedback.
