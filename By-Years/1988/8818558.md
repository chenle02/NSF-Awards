The Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) at Cornell University supports a broad
range of interactive and interdisciplinary materials research in six primary
thrust areas. The ceramics program which began in 1986 and developed rapidly
over the succeeding two years is now focussed on research in silicate ceramics
with a strong emphasis on synthesis, processing and properties of these
materials. The name of the mechanical properties thrust has been changed to
micromechanics of interfaces and composites to reflect its evolution from work
on the strength and failure modes of metals towards research on micromechanical
techniques and the properties of polymers and composites. The optical phenomena
thrust pursues the development of pulsed laser spectroscopy and its application
to the study of solids. The MRL supports the operation of the microkelvin
laboratory at Cornell; this includes a millikelvin research station as well as a
microkelvin facility. The low temperature group uses the microkelvin laboratory
for research on fundamental excitations and transport mechanisms in quantum
fluids, and on collective and single particle electron transport in condensed
matter. The novel phases and structures thrust combines theoretical and
experimental investigations of the microstructure of liquids and unusual
structures and phases in solids. Finally, the surfaces and interfaces thrust
brings together investigators with common interests in employing electron
microscopy and synchrotron radiation to study surface structure and transitions,
surface kinetics, and the structure, properties and control of interfaces. The
MRL also supports the development, operation and maintenance of major central
materials research facilities and provides seed funds for new faculty and high-
risk research related to its overall program. The program currently involves 52
faculty members, 8 postdoctoral research associates, 14 other technical and
scientific professionals, 36 graduate students, and 10 students in "Research
Experience for Undergraduates." The Cornell MRL is under the direction of
Professor Robert H. Silsbee.
