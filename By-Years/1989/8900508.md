The focus of research to be carried out under this REU site award will be the
applications of mathematics. Eight students will have the opportunity to use one
or more areas of mathematics in a meaningful way. These include the study of
mechanical or electrical devices whose behavior can be approximated by a
relatively simple dynamical system, e.g. a system of ordinary differential
equations, which can be expected to have interesting properties such as
periodicity or chaotic behavior. Other students will be introduced to problems
in number theory. In particular, problems of finding large primes and of
factoring large numbers will be investigated. This research will involve both
theoretical and computational work. Analytical and numerical models for the
evolution of mudwaves at the bottom of the ocean will be carried out. Students
will study existing models and learn about more realistic ways to represent
erosion and deposition in the ocean. These studies will be used to develop more
sophisticated models of these complex phenomena. Research will also be carried
out in theoretical population biology, using stochastic dynamic programming to
study behavioral problems in a evolutionary context. Students involved in this
area will learn the technique of dynamic programming from analytical and
numerical studies of simple (and largely unrealistic) foraging models, then
proceed to numerical experiments with models that are more realistic. A specific
goal will be to explore various aspects of dispersal behavior in insects.
Topological applications in chemistry and molecular biology will be used to
model configurations in large molecules, molecular systems and dynamical
processes in chemical reactions. Students will use knot theory to model DNA
enzyme reactions and study topological entanglements of large polymer molecules
in semicrystalline polymers.
