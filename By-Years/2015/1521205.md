The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
Transfer (STTR) project is to improve plant productivity by using a new
epigenetic plant breeding technology to improve crop yields. This new technology
optimizes epigenetic information in a plant to stimulate plant growth and vigor
in a manner similar to hybrid plant vigor. This proposal seeks to combine this
new method with traditional hybrids to increase plant yields. It is likely that
insights into the epigenetic mechanisms involved in plants improved by this
method will advance the understanding of the long-standing mystery of how
heterosis increases yields in hybrid plants. Commercially, higher yielding crops
are more profitable to farmers and seed producers, thereby increasing
profitability throughout the rural agricultural economies. More importantly,
these crops are better for the environment as they require less land, water,
fuel, and fertilizer than traditional crops for equivalent yields.

This STTR Phase I project proposes to test the hypothesis that the proposed
epigenetic technology can increase yields in hybrid corn. The project's goal is
to measure yields in field tests with the appropriate epigenetically improved
hybrids to test this hypothesis. The project's objectives are to develop two
sets of epigenetically modified corn plants to be crossed to heterotic parent
plants for hybrid testing. One population will utilize a naturally occurring
mutant in the Msh1 gene. The second population will be developed with RNAi
silencing methods. Both populations will be screened for optimal phenotypic and
molecular responses. Selected individual plants will be advanced for crossing in
a winter nursery to produce hybrid seed. This epigenetically improved hybrid
seed will be field tested for increased yields relative to control hybrid
plants. The anticipated result is that higher yields will be observed, thereby
demonstrating the breakthrough potential of this new technology.
