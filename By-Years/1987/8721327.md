The PI has done extensive, respected work in the past in studying the visual
system of the brain. She has also developed a new learning algorithm, alopex,
which is respected by those who know of it. In this project, she plans to build
and test an image processing and pattern recognition system based on this work.
A VLSI implementation will also be designed.
