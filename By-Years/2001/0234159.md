Studies of plant populations are critical for linking organism traits to
ecosystem function, and for understanding ecosystem response to climate change
and patterns of biodiversity. In perennial grasslands and other plant
communities, the belowground population of meristems (the bud bank) plays a
fundamental role in local plant population persistence and dynamics, and may
also determine community diversity, stability and invasibility. At the ecosystem
level, bud banks and meristem limitation can strongly influence patterns of
primary productivity and carbon dynamics and responses to environmental change.
This proposal tests hypotheses about the community and ecosystem consequences of
belowground meristems in grasslands. The specific objectives are to test the
hypotheses that 1) bud bank densities vary across precipitation gradients, 2)
meristem limitation constrains productivity responses in arid to semi-arid
grasslands, 3) bud banks and meristem density regulate the invasibility of
grassland plant communities to exotics, and 4) fire, grazing, and water
limitation regulate the patterns of bud bank populations in grasslands. The
densities, dynamics, composition and viability of belowground meristem
populations, aboveground populations, and patterns of aboveground net primary
productivity, will be measured over a 3-yr period across the Great Plains in 7
sites that vary in precipitation and productivity. The proposed cross-site
activities will include 3 LTER sites and enhance collaboration among grassland-
based research scientists within the central U.S. region. This research will
provide a better predictive understanding of how grassland ecosystems respond to
global climate change, invasion of exotic species, changing land management
(fire and grazing regimes).
