This proposal provides funds for the purchase of a combination laser-amplifier
system that would allow the PI to enhance her activities in the area of control
of molecular motion and quantum state character through coherence effects
inherent in the laser-molecule interaction. This control is achieved through the
exploitation of the Autler Townes splitting and electromagnetically induced
transparency in simple molecules. If successful, quantum control using these
coherence effects would complement control achieved through ultrafast laser
systems.
