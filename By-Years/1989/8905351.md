The Principal Investigator will continue his study of dynamical systems in one
real, or one complex variable. He will investigate structural changes as one
real parameter is varied. Renormalization group methods will be used to develop
a theoretical understanding of several computer-generated discoveries. Infinite
bifurcations will be studied via quasiconformal deformations. As energy is added
to many mechanical devices, the system begins to oscillate. As the energy is
increased further, many nonlinear yet simple devices double their oscillation
frequency. Still more energy results in another doubling. This succession of
frequency doubling "bifurcations" continues as more energy is added until, just
past the Feigenbaum limit, the system goes chaotic. The Principal Investigator
will build on his mathematical theory which explains exactly how such frequency
doubling evolves at the onset of chaos.
