9526146 Overbye The ability to transfer power on a transmission system is
dependent upon a number of factors, with arguably the most constraining being
the requirement to maintain system integrity following the occurrence of any of
a plausible set of contingencies. That is, if a particular contingency should
occur, there must be a viable plan to return the system to a secure operating
point. Having such a plan permits basecase operation at higher levels of power
transfer since should the contingency occur, one knows how to restore the system
to a secure operating point; not having these plans requires more constrained
operation. For an unsolvable contingent case, if effective control action is not
taken quickly enough following the contingency that pushed the system into the
unsolvable state, the system will experience a dynamic voltage collapse.
Research in this area will investigate the dynamic consequences of
unsolvability, with the aim of developing computationally tractable methods for
determining an optimal set of controls to restore such a case to secure
operation. ***
