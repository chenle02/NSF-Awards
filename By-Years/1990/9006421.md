Two projects, one to analyze heat transfer from a surface with a low superheat
via a spray cooling method, and the second to measure soot particle size and
dynamics in diffusion flames, will be strengthened by the addition of a Phase
Doppler Particle Analyzer (PD PA). The PDPA is capable of measuring
simultaneously the particle size, one velocity component, number density,
particle volume flux and flow rate in a liquid spray or in a diffusion flame.
This equipment should improve the quantitative understanding of heat transfer,
and specifically critical heat flux, in spray cooling, and of soot formation and
diffusion flame structures.
