The axion is one of many particles in physics which are believed to exist for
theoretical reasons but which have never been detected experimentally. This
grant will enable the development of search techniques which will either reveal
the existence of the axion or rule it out. The axion could play a role in two of
the most important problems in particle physics. First, the axion could make up
the `cold dark matter` of the universe. Much of the mass of the universe may be
in the form of `cold dark matter which is not directly detectable. Second, the
axion's existence would explain why the strong force conserves certain
symmetries of nature while the weak force does not.
