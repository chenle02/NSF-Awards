This grant provides airfare for fifteen U.S. scientists to attend the Fifth
International Symposium on Robotics Research in Tokyo, Japan. ISSR is a high-
quality conference that rotates between the U.S., Japan, and Western Europe, and
is an effective means of initiating collaboratory research and exchange visits.
The call for papers was open this year in order to broaden participation.
Airfare awards will be distributed among authors of top-ranked papers who lack
travel funds, plus one or two distinguished attendees invited by the Editorial
Advisory Board of the International Journal of Robotics Research. The symposium
will be conducted in a single track to facilitate cross-disciplinary
interchange, and recipients of travel grants will contribute to a summary report
and a description of visited research facilities.
