HRD- 0401697&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computational Biology at Howard
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Howard University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Louis
W. Shapiro&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With National Science Foundation support, Howard
University will develop concentrations in computational biology in the
institution's current doctoral programs in biology and mathematics. The
concentration will consist of six courses plus the dissertation.
Interdisciplinary research teams with faculty and Ph.D. students in mathematics
and biology will also be formed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of
the HBCU-RISE project lies in its interdisciplinary nature, and its ability to
bridge the intellectual differences between the quantitative and the life
sciences to prepare graduate students who are conversant in both disciplines and
expert in at least one. These students will be at the leading edge of the
emerging field of computational biology, and will also be trained to communicate
their research in an interdisciplinary environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Howard
University's record of graduating African American Ph.D.s in life and
quantitative sciences is unparalleled. This HBCU-RISE supported project will
take Howard's tradition of doctoral education for underrepresented minorities to
a new level of endeavor, both diversifying the scientific and academic workforce
and ensuring that computational biology, as a relatively new intellectual field,
is diverse from its outset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
