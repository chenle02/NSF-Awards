Funds are provided to use a new data set of Northern Hemisphere sea
ice&lt;br/&gt;concentration, derived from weekly operational ice charts spanning
more than three decades (1972-2004), to analyze: (1) long-term regional
variability and trends in sea ice area and extent; (2) the changing mix of ice
types in the Arctic Ocean, in order to understand the recent record low summer
ice extent minima; (3) the duration of the ice season, as an indicator of
climate change; and (4) the modes of variability of the ice edge, in order to
develop a predictive capability for sea ice extent. The data set is largely
independent of the popular passive microwave sea ice concentration products that
are heavily used by the sea ice community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sea ice extent
is believed by many to be a bellwether of environmental response to climate
change in the Arctic. This project will utilize a long historical data set in an
efficient manner to document the variability of this parameter. The results are
anticipated to be important for the verification and skill assessment of climate
models.&lt;br/&gt;
