The objective of this research is to create topological integrated optomechanics
to enable transformational solutions to current limitations in high confinement
photonic integrated circuits. The approach is based on the realization of three-
dimensional optical waveguides that guide light out-of-plane. The comprehensive
research program involves design, fabrication, and test.

Intellectual merit: Three-dimensional photonic integrated circuits will harness
phenomena of purely topological origin to create broadband polarization
transparent photonic integrated circuits. Out-of-plane optical waveguides will
also be developed to realize broadband and low loss fiber-to-chip and vertical
chip-to-chip couplers. Broadband coupling and direct access to devices on an
entire chip surface without dicing or cleaving the chip are enabled. Tunable,
broadband, polarization transparent, and compact system architectures involving
high speed transport of data between and within photonic integrated circuits are
envisioned.

Broader impacts: The universality of topological phenomena enables the
development of optical laboratory experiments with results that may be
extrapolated to a variety of physical systems where laboratory experiments are
economically unfeasible. The research concept extends to applications in future
high performance optical networks, all-optical switching, and optical logic
computing. The program responds to the challenge of preparing science and
engineering students to be successful in an increasingly interdisciplinary and
global environment by developing a global scientists and engineers pipeline at
Ohio State University. Furthermore, modules will be created for an integrated
optics curriculum that engenders integrative research thinking. Finally,
undergraduates, minority student, and students from underrepresented groups will
be involved in the research program.
