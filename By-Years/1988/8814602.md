This project is in the general area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry and in
the subfields of molecular spectroscopy and separations science. The thrust of
this experimental program,under the direction of Professor Mary Wirth of the
University of Delaware, focuses on the applications of molecular reorientation
measurements to the field of analytical chemistry. The overall goal of the
research is to determine the amount of solute geometry information that can be
obtained by quantitative measurements of rotational diffusion parameters. This
goal will be achieved by studying 1) solutes that are very similar in structure
to one another, e.g. isomers, 2)large polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons
suspected of changing conformation in strong chromatographic solvents, 3)solute
attachment to micelles and to silica surfaces, and 4) solute/solvent systems
having poorly understood solvation interactions. The research proposed here will
be used to examine the rotation of various molecules in different solvents.
Lasers will be used as probes to measure this rotation as well as the
interaction of these molecules with the various solvents. Molecules that are
very similar in structure as well as large organic molecules composed of carbon
and hydrogen will be used in this study. The results of these studies may be
used to predict the separation of similar molecules in liquid chromatography.
