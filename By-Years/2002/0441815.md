This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop a taggant and anticounterfeiting/object authentication system based on a
totally new type of optically encoded nanoparticle which can uniquely label
almost any physical object and distinguish it from millions of other similar
objects. The system is based on exciting samples of rare earth-based
upconverting phosphor (RUP) materials at a single invisible infrared wavelength
which emit into many narrow, well resolved emission bands from 400-800 nm. The
encoded information is contained within the relative ratios of the multiple
emission bands which are proportional to the relative ratios of emitters present
in the phosphor. Since it has been experimentally demonstrated that over 330
ratios can be resolved in a two color system, it is predicted that up to 30
million samples could be uniquely labeled in the proposed four color system.
Proof of principle experiments are proposed in the areas of document and optical
media authentication, object tracking applications and pharmaceutical tampering.

Commercially substantial, direct and near term benefits can be derived from the
application of this technology across many diverse areas such as document and
other media authentication, personal health or safety (food supply and
pharmaceutical tampering), product authentication and the labeling of large
numbers of biological samples for high throughput screening. By virtue of the
extremely large number of unique labels that can be generated and read, there
could be unprecedented opportunities in the intelligence field to
surreptitiously track and authenticate objects, individuals, documents,
vehicles, money, explosives and weapons. The ease of applying the labels, the
simplicity of hardware to read the labels, the high compatibility with existing
techniques and the stable, nontoxic nature of the labels will facilitate rapid
commercial acceptance
