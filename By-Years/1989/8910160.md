The focus of this research is to develop (a) a flexible design task
decomposition strategy that generates a hierarchy of compatible sub-tasks and
(b) a function modularizer that combines compatible functional attributes among
the sub-tasks so that a single structural artifact can meet multiple functional
needs. Qualitative simulation capabilities will be investigated to help correct
any bad decisions that are made during the design process. These ideas will be
implemented in a computational model, using systems approach, for conceptual
design synthesis of hydraulic circuits.
