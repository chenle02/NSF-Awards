The Global Emissions Inventory Activity (GEIA) is a crosscutting activity of the
International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Project, a core project of the
International Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP). Since 1990, GEIA has been
providing quality assured emission inventories for global studies of past,
present and future atmospheric chemistry, air quality and climate change. The
GEIA Center is responsible for long-term coordination, outreach and
planning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, GEIA will expand information to
be distributed through the GEIA web site. This will include quality assured
references and links and commentaries related to: non-GEIA global data bases and
key regional inventories, underlying data sets and algorithms used to derive
emissions, historical and future trends of emissions, seasonality of emissions,
innovative techniques for developing emissions data bases, etc.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GEIA Center tasks will include: (1) Coordination (Manage
development, review and distribution of new GEIA data and information, and
develop and maintain close collaboration with modeling groups and other
customers); (2) Outreach (Expand the GEIA network, distribute news, and organize
annual workshops, and develop informational materials for various audiences),
and (3) Planning (Assess critical needs and implementation issues and develop
new strategies to address those). Thus, GEIA will continue to provide valuable
information for use of a large scientific community.&lt;br/&gt;
