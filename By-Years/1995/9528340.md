AST 95-28340 PI: Marc Davis Studies of Large Scale Structure in the Universe
This proposal has three parts, all concerned with the large scale structure
(LSS) of the universe. The first part is to complete a comparison of an IRAS-
derived local gravity field to the observed peculiar velocity field. This will
help evaluate the distribution of dark matter in the "local" environment. The
second part is to support Keck observations relating to LSS. The emphasis is on
small projects during the remainder of the Keck instrumentation "shakedown",
such as trying for redshifts of very faint galaxies and to obtain K-band imaging
in fields with very deep HST imaging, but software development for the DEIMOS
spectrograph is also planned. DEIMOS should be completed in 1998. Finally, the
PI intends to continue development of n-body LSS simulations. In particular, use
of GRAPE, a computer board hardwired to optimize such calculation, is expected
to provide a factor of 5 improvement in mass resolution, compared to previous
simulations.
