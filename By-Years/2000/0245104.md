This award supports the continued development of a system to study how the
primate retina processes and encodes visual images. This Retinal Readout System
will allow the simultaneous detection of signals from hundreds to thousands of
retinal output neurons while the retina is stimulated by dynamic visual images
focused on the input neurons. The signals from the output neurons will be
detected in real-time, from a single living retinal preparation, with all
spatial and temporal correlations among the signals recorded. Although the
emphasis of the proposed work is on the study of the retina, the instrumentation
and software tools under development are extremely versatile, with the potential
for wide application in other areas of neuroscience.

The Retinal Readout System is based in part on the silicon microstrip detector
technological concepts and expertise developed to study short-lived particles in
high energy physics experiments. The specific items under development include
arrays of 512 microelectrodes for recording the signals generated by retinal
neurons, a custom-designed analog VLSI chip (the Neurochip) for amplifying,
filtering, and multiplexing these signals, a fast data acquisition system, and
analysis software to efficiently process the data sample.

This interdisciplinary project in neurophysics has provided, and will continue
to provide, research opportunities for undergraduate students, graduate students
and postdocs, in both physics and biology. These opportunities range from
independent study courses to senior thesis to Ph. D. thesis work.
