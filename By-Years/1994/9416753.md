9416753 Chaki A new technique is proposed for preparing metal-matrix
composites. This technique involves impacting ceramic particles on a thin and
flowing sheet of liquid metal. If mixing of the impacted particles with the
metal stream can be accomplished, this process is expected to result in a
uniform distribution of ceramic particles in a metal matrix. The liquid metal
sheet containing the ceramic particles will impinge onto a spinning disk whereby
the liquid sheet breaks up into small droplets of the metal-matrix composite.
These droplets will solidify rapidly and be collected and subsequently compacted
into test samples using hot press sintering and hot rolling. These test samples
will be used to evaluate the resulting structure and also the mechanical
properties of the metal-matrix composite. ***
