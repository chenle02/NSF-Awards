Concern about exposures to toxic substances is part of our lives. This project,
informed by appropriate scientific information, addresses this concern by
developing a philosophic analysis of normative assumptions in risk judgments.
The research focuses on the comparison between risks from toxic substances and
those from other human activities and exposures. The discussion of risk
comparisons has been dominated by the scientific and technical risk assessment
community, with little input from philosophers. This discussion has been
insensitive to some of the problems posed by special properties of toxic
substances and some of the differences between them and ordinary risks in life.
It has tended to overlook many features of the acceptability of risk exposures
and to appeal to a particular paradigm, utilitarianism and cost-benefit
analysis, in assessing the acceptability of risks. The goal of this research is
to identify a much broader and richer matrix of features of risk-taking and
risk-exposure, that can be taken into consideration when assessing the
acceptability of risk . The first research task is to articulate further some of
the normative distinctions underlying the different risk judgments we make as
individuals. These distinctions, which have begun to be developed in the risk
perception and risk communication literature, include such factors as magnitude
and probability of harm and benefit, numbers and distributions of people
affected and voluntary or involuntary occurrence, whether the risks are
appreciated or avoidable, and so on. The second task involves the
systematization and assessment of these factors in light of non-consequentialist
as well as utilitarian features in moral theories. The goal here is to broaden
the understanding of relevant moral paradigms in understanding and evaluating
risk judgments. The project will result in articles and presentations, and a
book length monograph.
