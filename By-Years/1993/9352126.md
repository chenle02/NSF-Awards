This project will implement change in the design of experiments for first and
second year biology and chemistry courses by introducing the capability to
conceptualize and visualize structures and transformations in three dimensions.
The design will engage students in experiments which connect lectures and
laboratory and which reflect the intellectual and laboratory practices of life
scientists and chemists. Students will study biological material or chemical in
two ways. The student will analyze the molecular structure using computer-based
tools and also manipulate the same material in laboratory. The instruments which
provide the capability for viewing and analysis of molecualr structure are
molecular visualization software running on high-resolution graphics personal
computers and molecular models, as requested in this proposal.
