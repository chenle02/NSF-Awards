Research Initiation Awards provide support for faculty at Historically Black
Colleges and Universities who are building a research program. It is expected
that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and
effectiveness, improves research and teaching at her home institution, and
involves undergraduate students in research experiences. The award to the
University of the District of Columbia has potential broader and societal impact
in a number of areas. The project seeks to explore a creative, novel, and
potentially transformative sensory aid for elderly stroke survivors with the
capacity to revolutionize rehabilitative and balance aid paradigms currently
used. Undergraduate students will gain research experiences and are actively
involved in the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching research goal is
to obtain new scientific knowledge on the effects of a non-mechanically
stabilizing cue using fingertip or light touch, as well as a multidirectional
partial bodyweight support (NaviGAITor) aid, for balance rehabilitation of
elderly participants who are stroke survivors. Participant standing balance,
gait, functionality and multisensory reweighting, as well as how the visual,
somatosensory, and vestibular sensory systems adapt to added sensory information
to yield a postural response, will be assessed. The potential of utilizing light
touch to serve as a long-term, permanent rehabilitation aid for elderly
participants is a radically different approach than devices and methods
currently used. Further, the research will investigate a distinctive NaviGAITor
system that allows for multidirectional range of motion, as opposed to the
traditional with-treadmill or straight-path walking partial bodyweight support
approaches. The knowledge resulting from this research has the potential to
benefit society in that it ultimately aims at reducing falls in elderly stroke
survivors.
