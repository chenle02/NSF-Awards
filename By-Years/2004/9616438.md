9616438 Bertman Peroxyacyl nitrates (PANs) are a major component of total
oxidized nitrogen in the atmosphere. More effort is needed to understand their
formation, loss and distribution, as well as their impact on local, regional,
and global atmospheric chemistry. Measurements of PANs can be sensitive probes
of regional influence and of global issues related to pollutant transport. In
this project, a dedicated and automated analytical instrument system for
measurement of tropospheric PAN and its analogs will be constructed, installed,
and operated at the University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS) located
near Pellston, Michigan. PANs will be measured using automated gas
chromatography with electron capture detection. The UMBS site allows
investigating many questions regarding atmospheric ozone chemistry in the
Midwest. Air masses reaching this site are transported either from rural areas
or from the industrial/metropolitan areas in the south. The project will have a
strong collaborative component since it will be co-located with measurements of
ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, organic nitrates, isoprene, carbonyls,
meteorological parameters, etc., performed by other scientists. These
comprehensive measurements will also allow detailed speciation of reactive
nitrogen. The PAN measurements will contribute towards a better understanding of
the seasonal fluctuations of nitrate photoproducts, the mechanism of isoprene
photochemistry during different seasons, and the photochemical and transport
mechanisms that result in the observed species distributions.
