The SuPporting Economically Disadvantaged Undergraduates in Physics (SPEeD-UP)
project is offering scholarships to a minimum of 24 students majoring in physics
at Towson University. Scholarships are available to both incoming freshman and
to transfer students who are academically superior and have demonstrated
financial need. To ensure success of the scholars, they are being linked to
effective student support structures that include the following: Science
Scholars thematic housing, special introductory physics sections to build
cohesiveness among the scholars, social receptions and informal meetings with
faculty, field trips to NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, the Maryland Writing
Project, an active Society of Physics Students Organization, and academic
mentoring by faculty. The SPEeD-UP project is building upon best practices from
an existing S-STEM program at Towson University designed for mathematics,
computer science and biology students. The physics department has a history of
successfully educating female students, minority students, and future secondary
school physics teachers; all of these are areas of great need for the physics
community.
