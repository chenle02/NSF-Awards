The research is a continuation of research on the solid- state oxidation and
solid-state formation reactions of multicomponent oxides and silicates. The
solid-state oxidation research emphasizes the role of dislocation defects in the
kinetics and atomic mechanisms of oxidation. Oxidation kinetics will be measured
as a function of density of dislocations, oxygen chemical activity, temperature
and time. The structure and growth of the oxidized region will be determined
using optical and electron microscopy, and Rutherford backscattering
spectroscopy. The oxidation process will modelled. The research on solid-state
formation reactions will concentrate on the early stages of growth of the new
crystal phases where the kinetics are interface-dominated rather than diffusion-
dominated. The chemical reactions near the interface will be studied.
