To assist students to acquire the basic quantitative problem- solving skills
they need to succeed in science, Howard Community College, MD, working
collaboratively with Cumberland County College, NJ, and other community
colleges, is creating an interactive multimedia program to teach scientific
computational fundamentals. The program will diagnose and teach at three levels
(based on Gagne's cognitive skills hierarchy) of scientific computational skills
--reviewing specific science- related math skills, applying math to specific
science-related tasks and performing scientific problem-solving.The program,
draws upon all the graphic, sound, computer-branching, and video capabilities of
multimedia instruction, will include a test instrument that will be used to
assess students prior knowledge, devise an individualized learning plan, and
evaluate knowledge gained. The instructional components will be "generic"--not
specific to any one science discipline--but separate problem sets will be
developed for biology, chemistry, and physics thereby customizing the program to
each discipline.The innovative curriculum, including adaptation of classroom
instruction, will be evaluated at the project colleges, as well as several other
two-year colleges serving as independent peer review sites.
