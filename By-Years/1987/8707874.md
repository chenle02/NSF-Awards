This is pathbreaking research that has already reshaped and advanced the
economics of information, finance, decision theory, game theory and industrial
organization theory. For example, under the previous grant the investigator
developed a conceptual framework for sequential equilibria which everyone now
uses; launched a major new branch of signalling theory; defined a new way of
representing bargaining among a large number of opponents; and obtained many
subtle but important insights into the way reputation affects business behavior.
Renewed support permits the investigator to pursue an ambitious research agenda
in these areas. Specifically, the agenda includes (1) the study of models of
reputation where the party holding the reputation is not subject to perfect
monitoring; (2) investigation of whether in such models, it is possible that
unverifiable but useful information will go entirely unused; (3) further study
of organizations as reputation bearers, focusing on models where a number of
parties share and affect a reputation contemporaneously; and (4) the development
of models of dynamic choice with unforeseen contingencies, the use of these
models to study dynamic bilateral relationships, and a comparison of those
models with neoclassical models of dynamic choice.
