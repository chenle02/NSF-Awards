For millennia, rabies has remained a frightening and significant health hazard.
Currently, raccoon rabies has enormous health impact in the eastern United
States, with continuing spread into new regions. Human risk is affected by
contact with wild animals and pets, intrusion into natural areas, vaccination of
free-ranging wildlife, and actions that disturb the balance between native
species. This study will use computer and mathematical modeling to synthesize
information uncovered through a variety of disciplines, to recognize critical
knowledge gaps, and to identify potential control strategies. Field studies will
provide new information about how raccoons use the landscape. Contacts between
raccoons will be monitored using novel radiocollars that communicate with each
other. Data will be gathered where raccoon rabies is endemic and where the
epidemic wave front has not yet arrived. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This integrated
approach will allow generation and testing of predictions about disease spread
and will create a decision tool for policy makers. Rational and cost-effective
control programs can be built on this understanding of disease ecology and
impacts on human populations. This will set the stage for comparative assessment
of potential control strategies, analogous to the successful approach used for
fox rabies in Europe. Insights from the cross-disciplinary modeling process will
provide a map for scientific consensus building, communication and education for
other emerging diseases.&lt;br/&gt;
