The proposed research will apply high-power lasers to irradiate a microscopic
ice layer and accelerate particles to high speeds. The goal is to demonstrate
the highest acceleration efficiency known to date and to deliver particle beams
suitable for applications. Similar to x-rays, particles of high speed penetrate
through tissue but deposit most of their energy only at one point deep inside
the human body. Thus, they are extremely well suited to destroy cancer cells.
The laser-driven particle beams are expected to have the required properties so
that they can be further developed for tumor therapies. The added advantage that
they are compact will make them widely available for hospitals and research
centers. If successful, the project will have high pay-off for society. The
award will provide full-time support for a graduate student and part-time
support for a postdoctoral associate at Stanford University, in keeping with the
goals of the program toward preparation of a much-needed workforce in
accelerator science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will produce
pure high-energy proton beams from the interaction of a high-intensity short-
pulse laser with cryogenic hydrogen. These experiments utilize a novel
continuously flowing cryogenic micro-jet that was recently developed at
Stanford. Thus, the project is in the unique position to achieve simultaneously
all the requirements on energy, charge, purity, beam emittance and repetition
rate that up to now have been elusive in this field. Existing particle-in-cell
simulations show that liquid hydrogen will become transparent during the
interaction with the laser thus enhancing the sheet electric fields and
resulting in nearly mono-energetic proton beams of energies larger than 50 MeV.
Experimentally demonstrating the predicted proton beams will be a very important
achievement, and a demonstration of new accelerator physics. Furthermore, these
beams will be suitable for injection and will consequently motivate new studies
of hybrid accelerators that have tremendous potential to deliver the urgently
needed 230 MeV and above regime for applications in proton radiography, imaging
and tumor therapies.
