support for 25 fourth-grade and 25 fifth-grade teachers in the schools where
Project IMPACT has a K-4 research and implementation project being completed.
This is an extension to fifth grade of an on- going, joint research and teacher
enhancement project in elementary mathematics education implementation in urban
school districts. The project has conducted intensive teacher enhancement for
grades K-3 along with longitudinal data collection on students as they
progressed from K through third grade. This project will continue the project to
complete fifth grade with these students and their teachers. The project has a
strong research component focusing on the issues performance and behaviors and
beliefs related to mathematics. Cost-sharing is 31% of the NSF funding request.
