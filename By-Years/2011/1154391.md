The goal of this project is to increase the science, technology, engineering,
and mathematics (STEM) workforce by recruiting, mentoring, and supporting
academically talented, but financially needy, students through degree completion
and partnering with employers to facilitate placement. Project objectives are
to: &lt;br/&gt;(1) Improve educational opportunities for eligible students
pursuing degrees in biological, physical, mathematical, and information sciences
or engineering or technology.&lt;br/&gt;(2) Increase retention of students to
degree achievement by creating supportive environments through changes in
organizational culture and practices.&lt;br/&gt;(3) Improve student support
programs by providing mentoring, tutoring, counseling, internships, and
placement.&lt;br/&gt;(4) Increase the STEM workforce by implementing the project
with industry partners to help meet national needs.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project is providing students with
skills that improve academic competitiveness, encouraging them to pursue STEM
careers, increasing faculty involvement in mentoring students, nurturing
permanent changes in organizational culture and practices, and increasing the
economic diversity of the STEM workforce. Project partners include Danfoss
Turbocor Compressions, General Dynamics, Brookhaven National Laboratory, and the
Florida-Georgia Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation. The college is
providing release time for faculty to mentor students and STEM tutors for
scholars.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project goes beyond
increasing the quantity of students in STEM disciplines by advancing knowledge
of effective practices that prepare students to pursue STEM careers from
community colleges, the fastest growing educational level in the nation, by
innovatively integrating student support and placement.
