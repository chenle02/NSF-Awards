Principal Investigator proposed to study the uncertainty in imperfections in
viscoelastic plates, and their effects on buckling. The main objective is to
investigate the feasibility of convex modeling - a new concept of uncertainty in
imperfection sensitivity analysis. Comparison will be made against classical
techniques of stochastic analysis. Both static and dynamic buckling are to be
considered.
