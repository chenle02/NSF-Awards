This research is part of an extensive effort to reduce the high cost of mass
cell culture by a large factor. A mathematical model can be a powerful tool to
optimize culture processes. This proposal presents a project to create a
mammalian-cell model which will describe quantitatively the effects of
environmental and genetic variations on cellular response in terms of growth,
morphology, and the expression of certain gene(s) of interest. Such a model
should be useful for design, control and optimum operation of biological
reactors for the biosynthesis of mammalian cell products.
