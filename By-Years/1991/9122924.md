This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) will study the development of a
finite-difference time- domain (FDTD) solution for periodic problems in
electromagnetic scattering and radiation. Such problems have a number of
applications in integrated optics, scattering, and radiating structures, and the
application of the FDTD method to this class of problems would allow the
treatment of inhomogeneities in the geometry, or in the material constants. To
the PI's knowledge, the FDTD method has not yet been generalized to periodic
structures. The SGER is appropriate for this work because of this novelty, and
because this work has elements of risk in that the FDTD technique may not be
well- suited for periodic problems because of computational constraints, or the
possibility that there is a presently unforseen difficulty with such a
formulation. It will allow the PI to quickly evaluate the concept of an FDTD
solution for periodic problems by formulating such a solution for two-
dimensional periodic structures.
