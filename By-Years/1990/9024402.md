This research deals with the physics of novel superconducting microstructures:
uniform submicron particles, mesoscopic interfface structures, and magnetic flux
coupled superlattices. The research employs novel vacuum deposition and micro-
electronics fabrication methods. The research can lead to improved understanding
of certain outstanding problems of high-Tc superconductors and the fabrication
of microstructures which exhibit new quantum interference phenomena. Where
appropriate, potential applications of the research to superconducting devices
will be explored. The submicron particles will be used in experiments to measure
the temperature dependence of the penetration depth anisotropy, critical field
enhancement and their relation to conduction anisotropy, interlayer coupling,
pairing symmetry, and finite size effects. An experiment is proposed to
determine the quasiparticle energy spectra, and search for quantum interference
effects in mesoscopic structures. The flux coupling structures will potentially
provide DC transformers with multiple secondaries and large coupling ratios.
