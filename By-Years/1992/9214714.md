This project uses local wave diagnostic techniques to study surface
manifestations of subsurface magnetic interactions with acoustic waves. The PI
used the NSO South Pole observations of Pomerantz, Harvey, Duvall and Jefferies
to develop diagnostic techniques to detect interactions of acoustic waves with
subsurface magnetic structure. These techniques are giving the PI the first
detailed look at subphotospheric magnetic structure, showing submerged flux
tubes that cross the solar equator to connect the active region bands. These
techniques offer a broad range of synoptic applications and may revolutionize
our understanding of solar interior MHD and the solar dynamo. The techniques
will be used to develop an obersvational basis for exploring the solar interior
by means of acoustic holography. The results offer a unique opportunity to open
the solar interior to the field of local helioseismology.
