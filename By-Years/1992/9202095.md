The focus of this research is the design and synthesis of nanosized units termed
modules that can be pieced together by directed organization using specific,
non-covalent bond associations. The modules contain functionality for directed
organization and the rigid geometry needed to form covalently pre-assembled
sections of the desired cavities and/or channels. Specific 1D, 2D and 3D target
motifs can be realized by placement of appropriate functional groups on the
modules. The approach could have a major impact on the synthesis of new
functional organic materials. With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is
supporting the research of Dr. Jeffrey S. Moore, a young investigator from the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Professor
Moore will focus his efforts on the rationale design and preparation of packed
organic crystals possessing large internal cavities and/or channels. The
resulting crystals will serve as a new family of "hosts" in the developing area
of host-guest chemistry. The method, in the long run, could lead to the
preparation of new organic materials and even tailor-made organic zeolites.
