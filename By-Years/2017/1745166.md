The workshop is intended for women undergraduate and masters students who are
currently working in speech science and technology. It will be held at
Interspeech 2017, in Stockholm, and will feature panel discussions with senior
female speech science and technology researchers, student poster presentations,
and a mentoring session. The workshop is designed to foster interest in research
in the field of speech science and technology in women at the undergraduate or
masters level who have not yet committed to getting a PhD in speech science or
technology areas but who have had some research experience in their college and
universities on individual or group projects in those areas. The motivation for
the workshop is the realization on the part of many women researchers in the
speech science and technology fields that there seem to be relatively few junior
women researchers in the 'pipeline' to careers in speech. This issue is
addressed by providing a venue where students in speech science and technology
can present their work to each other and to senior women researchers, and where
senior women can describe their own research and career experience to students
and mentor them. The first workshop was held in San Francisco in 2016 and was
very successful and inspirational for young women students.
