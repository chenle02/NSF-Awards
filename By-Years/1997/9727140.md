ABSTRACT ATM -9727140 Dickinson, Robert A. University of Arizona TITLE: Land-
Ocean-Atmosphere Interactions: Mechanisms for the Seasonal Variations in
Precipitation Over Tropical Land This study will combine observations and
modeling to examine the mechanisms responsible for seasonal variations of
precipitation over tropical land and to determine how these variations are
affected by land-atmosphere interactions. The problems involved in the
difficulties with the simulation of North American monsoon and the wet season
over the eastern equatorial Amazon by the NCAR CCM3 climate model will be
investigated. Diagnostic analyses and numerical simulation will address the
relative roles of land versus ocean SST in determining the onset of the wet
season and the observed spatial patterns. This work will further advance climate
modeling effort which will assist in attempting more accurate prediction of
tropical climate.
