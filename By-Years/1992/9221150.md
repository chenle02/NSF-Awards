The goal of this research project is to better understand how a well-
coordinated division of labor is accomplished in insect societies, by analyzing
the mechanisms devised by natural selection for the coordination of labor groups
(castes) within the honey bee society. Dr. Seeley will examine three distinct
operations in honey bee colonies that require the joint activity of two castes,
and will aim to determine for each operation how information flows between the
castes so that their rates of activity stay in proper balance. The three
operations are nectar acquisition, nest thermoregulation by evaporative cooling,
and comb construction. This research addresses a fundamental problem faced by
any organization in which there is division of labor, namely the coordination of
interdependent labor groups within the organization. This is a severe problem
when one group must adjust to unpredictable changes in the activity level of a
second group. For example, in the case of the bees, whenever the weather turns
hot and the hive begins to overheat, bees working inside the hive spread more
water for cooling and bees working outside the hive must accordingly increase
their water collection. The solution is the creation of various lines of
communication between the groups. These communication links are not well
understood for animal societies, even those such as the honey bee society where
it has long been known that there is an elaborate division of labor. Hence this
research will address an important gap in our understanding of how intricate
animal societies work, and it may well provide ideas on how to better coordinate
labor in human organizations.
