9423088 Carini This project investigates the microwave conductivity (up to a
frequency of 20 megahertz) of disordered metals in which the electrons are close
to a localization transition, such as ultrathin metal films and highly
disordered metal alloys. Experiments will compare the dc and microwave
conductivity as a function of temperature (T&gt;30mK) and magnetic field
(B&lt;8T). Theses measurements will test the predictions of the scaling theory,
which treats the transition as a quantum-critical point where the temperature,
alloy concentration, and frequency dependence of the conductivity are related to
the same critical length-scale. % % % The proposed experiments study the
transition from the metallic state to the insulating state that occurs in
disordered materials when the electrons become localized in space. The
localization transition occurs because of the wavelike behavior of the electrons
as quantum mechanical particles, and yet the transition is a collective
phenomenon where all parts of the system undergo the same change of state at the
same time. The experiments will measure the electrical conductivity in
disordered metals in order to understand how quantum mechanics affects the
transition between the conducting and insulating states. ***
