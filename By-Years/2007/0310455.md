Rick Heller of Harvard is supported by the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to develop new approaches for theoretical investigations of
quantum coherence, quantum wave propagation, and quantum dynamics and
spectroscopy. Six interrelated topics will be explored: transport in
nanostructures, multichannel quantum signal processing, zero point energy,
dynamical tunneling in molecules, proximity resonances and superradiance, and
spectroscopy in condensed media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcomes of this
research will enable improved understanding of the way molecules and small
devices work, and will make possible the design, prediction, and control of
their behavior.
