0448050&lt;br/&gt;Vetter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is focused on
developing experimentally validated mathematical models of the mouse heart
ventricular anatomy and wall mechanics and to use these models to quantify the
relationship between wall stress and the onset of cardiac hypertrophy. Specific
aims are to 1) to develop a detailed three-dimensional mathematical model of the
mouse heart geometry including the ventricles, papillary muscles, and fiber
organization via histology, image processing, and surface and vector field
fitting, 2) to use this new model in numerical simulations of cardiac wall
mechanics to drive the deformation of the nonlinear, anisotropic cardiac muscle
using the finite element method., 3) to correlate regional wall stresses with
the early onset of physiological hypertrophy in the left ventricle (swimming
mouse model) and 4) to impact high school students from underrepresented
minorities through an outreach program of activities that explore the
cardiovascular system in terms of anatomy, physiology, engineering, and
physics.&lt;br/&gt;
