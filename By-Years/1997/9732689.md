Self-adjusting data structures have considerable practical importance; they
offer efficient performance and they are easy to code since they are not
required to enforce structural constraints. This same lack of structural
constraints, however, makes it difficult to predict the behavior of these data
structures over a lengthy sequence of operations. Recently, and contrary to
expectation, the widely used and highly practical pairing heaps data structure
has been shown to require more than constant amortized time for the decrease key
operation, thus underscoring the need to have better methods for anticipating
behavior of self-adjusting data structures. The major focus of this project is
the development of such methods. Goals for this project include (i) reaching a
definitive understanding of the pairing heap data structure, utilizing both
analytical and experimental methods; (ii) the development of a formal theory of
self-adjusting data structures, placing them at one end of the spectrum of
graded structure with emphasis on obtaining an understanding of the performance
limitations that are incurred as structure is diminished; and (iii) an
exploration of non-linear amortized analysis for the purpose of predicting the
frequency and severity with which time consuming operations can take place.
