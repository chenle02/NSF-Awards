The investigator mentors undergraduate students in a range of research
activities, including the preparation and presentation of papers at professional
meetings. Specific topics include theoretical and applied aspects of wavelets,
number theory, image processing, graph theory, coding theory, and minimal
surfaces. Technical training and education of all parts of the country's
population is essential for the nation's success in an increasingly
technological world. This project focuses on mentoring and training activities
of women undergraduates. It continues in a more formal way the investigator's
successful practices in training students and preparing them for careers in
areas related to the mathematical sciences.
