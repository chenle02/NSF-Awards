The objective of the Third International Conference on Case Histories in
Geotechnical Engineering is to bring the engineers, scientists, and academic
personnel from around the world together to discuss case histories of
geotechnical structures relative to satisfactory performance and failure or
unsatisfactory performance. The need for this conference has been established by
discussions and correspondence with a large number of professionals and
societies around the world.
