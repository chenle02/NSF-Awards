9508683 Holl This project constitutes the initial phase of a long-term study of
tropical moist forest recovery from human-induced disturbance. The goals of this
study are to better understand factors limiting the recovery of tropical moist
forest ecosystems from human disturbance and to develop practical methods for
accelerating such recovery. Surveys of vegetation, soil, microclimatic
variables, and seed rain of primary forest, secondary forest, and agricultural
land will provide baseline data on differences between these habitats from which
to measure recovery of disturbed habitats. These data will also serve to
generate hypotheses about factors potentially limiting recovery that will be
tested following the planning period. %%% Strategies for accelerating recovery
will be tested in small-scale manipulative plots. Initial experiments will focus
on accelerating recovery by augmenting seed dispersal and ameliorating stressful
microclimatic conditions. Mapping of land-use types in this area will provide a
database for development of further studies of forest recovery. Jointly, these
activities will serve as the basis for developing a large-scale research project
of tropical moist forest restoration. ***
