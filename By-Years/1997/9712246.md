This project continues investigation of the cylindrical algebraic decomposition
(CAD) technique. This technique, developed in 1975 for quantifier elimination in
the elementary theory of real- closed fields, has been continually improved in
the last twenty years. A vast number of mathematical problems can be expressed
in this theory and, potentially, solved via quantifier elimination. CAD has many
applications, including control engineering, connectivity and path finding
problems. Major improvements are also being made to the algebraic algorithms
needed for CAD, including polynomial resultants and greatest common divisors,
polynomial factorization, polynomial root isolation and refinement, and
computations with algebraic numbers.
