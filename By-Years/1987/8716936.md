Elitzur will continue theoretical work on three areas, all related to detailed
atomic or molecular physics. They are mass loss from late-type stars, flows near
newly forming stars and spectra from stellar and galactic accretion disks.
Elitzur is an expert in relating the theory of atoms and molecules to specific
astronomical observations. He will compute the intensities of selected
ultraviolet, visible, and radio emissions in order to deduce the winds and mass-
loss from red giant stars, the flow of gases ejected from newly forming stars,
and the structure of gaseous disks around either stars or centers of galaxies.
