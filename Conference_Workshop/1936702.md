This conference grant will support the travel of participants to attend the
workshop on "Emergent Trends in Complex Function Theory" that will take place at
the Centre de Recerca Matematica (CRM) in Barcelona, Spain, from October 28 to
October 31, 2019. The scientific program is aimed at the interplay between two
vast areas of complex analysis: the theory of approximation of functions by
solutions of elliptic equations, rational approximation, singular integrals and
capacities on the one hand and the theory of spaces of analytic functions and
their operators on the other.

One of the main goals of the program is to strengthen contacts between
researchers working in these two areas of analysis. The interplay between these
fields has already led to interesting and important results. For instance,
results about harmonic approximation in the plane and spectral synthesis in
Hardy-Sobolev spaces (J. Mateu, J. Orobitg, J. Verdera), and the recently
discovered intersections of polyanalytic polynomial approximations with the
theory of model spaces (A. Baranov, J. Carmona, K. Fedorovskiy, M. Mazalov, P.
Paramonov). A significant amount of the funding will be used to support graduate
students, early-career researchers, and researchers from underrepresented
groups, giving them the opportunity to learn from and discuss these topics with
renowned specialists. More information is available at

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
