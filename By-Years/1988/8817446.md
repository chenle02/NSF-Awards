The carbon isotopic composition of marine kerogen is thought to be primarily
controlled by COz availability. And yet almost no experimental data exists on
the effects of different COz levels on carbon isotopic fractionation. Funds are
provided for a two years' study to examine the effects of increased pCOz levels
on the Fractionation of carbon isotopes of phytoplankton during phytosynthesis
using marine mesocosm system at URI Marine Ecosystem Research lab. Experiment
will employ 4 mesocosm tanks for up to 16 months. Each tank will be held at
differing but constant TCOz, pCOz, and pH levels. Weekly estimates of
productivity will be made and temperature, salinity , nutrients, etx. will be
monitored to learn about the phytoplanktonic response of carbon isotopic
franctionation to increased pCOz level.
