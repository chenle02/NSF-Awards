The interaction of the solar wind with ionized gas confined by the earth's
magnetic field results in a long extension downwind to many earth radii of the
magnetic field and gas (the magnetosphere) and the generation of currents of
millions of amperes which flow through the high latitude ionosphere, and create
the striking displays of light emission known as the aurora. This award is for
the continuation of a cooperative observation and analysis program called
GISMOS, of which several successful campaigns have taken place, using radar and
optical and magnetic field measuring equipment to determine the pattern of
electric field associated with the currents and auroral emissions. The objective
is to advance our understanding of the physical processes involved in the sudden
release of energy previously accumulated in the magnetosphere by the solar wind-
magnetosphere interaction, part of which is deposited in the ionosphere and is
known as a magnetic substorm.
