IBN-9630189 de Bruin and Szczyglowski The formation of nitrogen fixing nodules
on legume plants represents an unusual example of externally induced
organogenesis under the influence of two different organisms, namely the plant
host and symbiotic bacteria. This symbiotic process results in the creation of
the appropriate microenvironment necessary to support the fixation of nitrogen
by the prokaryotic symbiont and the assimilation of nitrogen by the plant host.
Although the genetic components involved in nodule induction have been
relatively well studies in the bacterial symbiont, a lot remains to be learned
about the plant's contribution to the process. Preliminary genetic data have
suggested a distinct connection between nodule morphogenesis and other plant
developmental processes. The specific aim of this proposal is to test the
hypothesis that common regulatory elements are involved in both lateral root
formation and nodule organogenesis in the model legume Lotus japonicus, which is
particularly amenable to combined genetic, physiological and molecular analyses.
The L. japonicus har-1 mutant we have isolated, displays a drastically altered
root morphology, as well as aberrant nodulation properties, and serves as the
experimental basis of this proposal. By characterizing this mutant and the
corresponding gene(s), we hope to learn more about the genetic determinants
responsible for nodulation. In the very long run, this information may
contribute towards the knowledge base required to extend the nodulation process
to presently non-nodulated crop plants, such as the cereals.
