This proposal provides funding for the first GREPSEC: Underrepresented Groups in
Security Research workshop, which will be affiliated with the annual IEEE
Symposium on Research in Security &amp; Privacy, in May 2013, in San Francisco
CA. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;USC/ISI will organize a day-and-a-half long workshop
for women and underrepresented minorities in computer security and privacy. The
workshop will be held May 18-19, 2013. This is the weekend before the IEEE
Computer Society's Security and Privacy Symposium, the premier conference in
security, and this workshop will be co-located in San Francisco,
California.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad goal of the workshop is to increase
the number of women and underrepresented minorities in computer security
research. Security is a wide field, encompassing network security, operating
system security, language-based security, forensics, privacy, as well as legal
and policy issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the organizers is to
encourage PhD students who are female and from underrepresented groups to choose
security as their field of specialization. Their approach is to show the wide
range of problems within the field and how women and underrepresented groups are
working towards solving those problems.&lt;br/&gt;
