PI: Alan G. Smith&lt;br/&gt;Proposal number: OS-0920114&lt;br/&gt;Title:
"Prezygotic Interspecific Reproductive Barriers in
Nicotiana"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genetic,
geographic and ecological processes can isolate related plants resulting in the
evolution of new species. Reproductive isolation is a very important component
of this process that determines whether closely related plants are sexually
compatible as part of the same or different species (speciation). Therefore,
reproductive barriers facilitate the evolution and maintenance of new species.
This project takes a biochemical approach to identify the proteins and
mechanisms that regulates sexual compatibility among related plant species.
Identification of the mechanisms will lead to a better understanding of the way
plants evolve and how new species develop. This project also has direct
application to understanding the production of seeds and fruits, which is very
important for plant breeding and crop improvement. Plant breeding often relies
on the introduction of new traits via interspecific hybridization between
cultivated species and wild species, which is often prevented due to species-
specific reproductive barriers. Despite the impediment that reproductive
barriers create for interspecific gene transfer, little is known regarding the
mechanisms and responsible gene(s). The goal of this project is to identify the
protein(s) that determine sexual compatibility among related
species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study has brought together three researchers
with distinct and complementary skills in diverse areas of protein purification,
reproductive biology and genetics. The project will integrate knowledge and
technologies into academic courses, create new educational opportunities for
undergraduate and graduate students, and actively involve students in supervised
and independent research.
