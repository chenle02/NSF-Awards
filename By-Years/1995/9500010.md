Goncharov 9400010 Professor Goncharov will work on the relationship between both
classical and modern theories of the polylogarithm and special values of
L-functions of varieties. He will also explore connections between algebraic
k-theory and motivic Galois groups. The goal is an explicit computation of the
Beilinson regulator for arithmetic varieties. This project falls into the
general area of arithmetic geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest
areas of mathematics: number theory and geometry. This combination has proved
extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that withstood
generations. Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes. Such
codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
