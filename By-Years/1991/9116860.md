This research is to design I/O subsystems for high capacity storage and
associated object management systems tailored for the kinds of data types
encountered in scientific research on global climate change related to the
physical interaction of the ocean, land and atmosphere. The researchers are
constructing a prototype system, populating it with real data and making it
available to earth system science researchers on the National Research and
Education Network (NREN). The prototype object management system is based on
significant extensions of the dual technologies of extensible database systems
(POSTGRES) and redundant arrays of inexpensive disks (RAID), developed in part
under previous NSF support. This research relates to Digital Equipment
Corporation>s (DEC) project Sequoia 2000. DEC has provided the researchers
funded under this grant with the equipment necessary to perform the research.
