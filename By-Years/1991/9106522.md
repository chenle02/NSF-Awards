Aspects of the topology of algebraic varieties will be studied. Particular
emphasis will be on the development of new topological invariants or techniques
(e.g. Intersection Homology, Motivic Cohomology, Perverse Sheaves) and on the
study of particular varieties which are important in applications (e.g. Modular
Varieties, Configuration Spaces). Algebraic varieties are spaces defined by
polynomial equations. They should be particularly simple, but their topology can
be more complicated than this suggests. Since they arise in many different
contexts, it is important to classify and analyze them.
