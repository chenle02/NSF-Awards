This I-Corp project investigates sensor systems for enhancing communication in
noisy environments through real-time beamforming. The investigation will
determine potential of a system incorporating multiple microphones, a field
programmable gate array, and associated electronics to implement beamforming in
real time to enhance signal-to-noise ratio in listening to acoustic sources. The
system is best described as "acoustic binoculars" as it enables the listener to
hear soft sounds originating away from the listener or normal sounds in noisy
environments. The proposed innovation addresses the problem of directing
listening attention in noisy environments and in amplifying quiet sources. It
overcomes shortcomings in existing products for acoustic beamforming, which
include significant computational delay, presentation of only the direction of
an acoustic source (without providing the beamformed signal for listening), and
lack of scalability to large numbers of microphones. The prototype system is
scalable and performs beamforming in real time; hence, it has the capacity to
increase signal-to-noise ratio dramatically as well as to provide the beamformed
signal 100 kHz data rates for listening.

The technology has potential impact in the form of a number of products, e.g.,
listening devices for pilots, passengers, and operators of noisy
equipment/vehicles to enhance listening attention in noisy environments and
devices for audio-based surveillance from a safe distance. The proposed
technology may also extend to medical and structural ultrasonic imaging devices,
although existing prototypes have been directed only towards acoustic
beamforming. Extending the real-time beamforming architecture to ultrasonic
imaging (medical or structure imaging), provides the potential to enhance images
derived from what is one of the safest non-invasive imaging methods in
existence.
