This is a renewal of NSF grant ECS-8315655A03 and represents collaborative work
with K.I. Golden of the University of Vermont (ECS-8713627). Continued
theoretical work on collective modes and dynamical transport coefficients of
strongly coupled plasmas is to be carried out. The theoretical scheme developed
by Golden and Kolman and already successfully applied to various physical
situations will be employed to the study of physical systems of engineering
importance. These include electron gas in metals, 2-dimensional electron gas in
MOS devices, hetero- structures and molten salts. All these systems share the
the property that the Couloumb interaction between the particles is strong which
renders the use of customary perturbation methods inadequate. The GK scheme is a
novel non-perturbative approach developed for the analysis of such systems.
