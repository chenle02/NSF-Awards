Dr. Ringo has an excellent model system to determine how genetic changes affect
behavior by the endocrine system. The apterous locus in Drosophila is crucial
for the survival of embryos and young, and for the normal development of wings
and specific endocrine glands that are involved in the production and secretion
of juvenile hormone. Juvenile hormone is a major growth regulator in insects as
well as being required for normal oogenesis and the development of reproductive
behavior. Using a multidisciplinary approach, Dr. Ringo will genetically dissect
the endocrine basis of reproduction in Drosophila. Using specific mutations of
the apterous gene, he can define precisely the extent and timing of the
behavioral defects, and determine the exact relationship between these defects
and the level of juvenile hormone. This research not only open doors at
elucidating the molecular basis of hormonally controlled behavior patterns, but
it could lead to noninvasive means of insect pest control. This is very
important especially given the recent controversy surrounding chemical spraying
for control of insects, specifically flys, in populated environments.
