Under the direction of Professor Donna Haraway, Mr. Joseph Dumit is producing an
ethnographic study and contemporary history of positron emission tomography
(PET) functional brain imaging. He is combining intensive archival work and the
collection of primary oral histories with participant observation of PET centers
and popular culture content analysis. He is focusing on interdisciplinary
interactions and the ways in which popular theories of human nature and
categories of persons interact with the experimental production of scientific
knowledge. His thesis is that functional brain imaging, through PET and other
techniques, is actively helping to redefine our notions of the interdisciplinary
negotiations involved in producing, distributing, and interpreting functional
images of living human brains. This study offers a unique and much-needed
contribution to understanding the implications of the ongoing "biologization" of
human nature in science, medicine, popular theories, and in the legal system. A
second objective is to make available to other researchers a basic history of
PET scanning by collecting primary sources and documents and organizing a
qualitative index to these materials. These will be stored in archives and made
available electronically.
