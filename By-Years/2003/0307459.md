Mobile, location-aware devices raise the potential for fundamentally new
information services. However, this potential has not been realized. This is due
in part to the absence of a firm conceptual and empirical&lt;br/&gt;foundation.
This proposal explores one basis for constructing the requisite foundation:
socially defined places. How places (such as schools, offices, or theaters)
shape behavior has been explored in environmental&lt;br/&gt;psychology and
architecture, but the notion of 'place' has not been operationalized for use in
interactive systems. This project takes on that task. The key hypotheses are
that (a) people's information and&lt;br/&gt;communication needs are relative to
place types, and (b) making 'place' a first-class computational object will
increase the effectiveness and usability of location-based systems. This project
will test the hypotheses&lt;br/&gt;through a combination of ethnographic
studies, development of novel algorithms and interfaces, and laboratory and
field studies, leading to the following results: 1) additional empirical
knowledge about the concept of place and its role in organizing people's
activities; 2) a conceptual framework and guidelines useful to designers of
location-based systems; 3) a general infrastructure for place-centered community
information sharing systems; and 4) field studies and laboratory evaluations
that demonstrate the utility&lt;br/&gt;and acceptability of such
systems.&lt;br/&gt;
