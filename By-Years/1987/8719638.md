The goal of this project is to understand mineral lattice processes that give
rise to the elastic, thermodynamic and transport properties of minerals.
Calculations have been completed for specific heat of forsterite which agree
well with values obtained by calorimetry. The calculations for forsterite will
now be extended to include thermal expansion, compressibility , and the pressure
and temperature dependence of the elastic constants. A similar study will be
carried out on fayalite and perovskite. These mineral are major phases in the
earth's mantle and knowledge of their properties will facilitate interpretation
of seismic data.
