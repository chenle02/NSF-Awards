This research is to study the lithospheric structure and active tectonics of
the Atlas mountain system in Morocco. Data produced by a recently installed
modern, telemetered, digital seismic network in a joint effort by Cornell
University and institutes in Morocco will be used in the effort. The Atlas
mountain belt is an active transpressive system with abundant active folding and
thrust and strike-slip faulting. Its evolution and structure is fundamentally
different from that of most mountain belts located along convergent plate
boundaries, such as the Himalayas, Zagros, Andes, and Alps. Different
lithospheric models will be tested by seismic and gravity data to explain an
apparent excess of mass beneath the Atlas mountains. This research is a
component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
