9712115 Rice This grant provides $80,000 as two-years partial salary for
continued support of a technician to oversee operations and maintenance and
train new users on both the electron microprobe (EMP) and the scanning electron
microscope (SEM) at the electron- beam facility, University of Oregon. This is a
Phase II grant for technical support under the IF/EAR program. Continuation of
technical support for the electron-beam facility at the University of Oregon
will greatly contribute to the chemical and physical quantitative and
qualitative analytical needs of a number of funded research projects including,
textural analyses of volcanic rock to elucidate magma chamber processes, studies
of fluid-rock interactions during metamorphism and hydrothermal alteration,
studies in high pressure experimental petrology, studies in sedimentary
petrology and reservoir rock physical characteristics and studies of the
properties of synthetic materials. Finally, a large number of graduate and
undergraduate students benefit from the training that this technician provides
as part of a formal departmental analytical methodology course. ***
