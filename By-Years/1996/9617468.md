9617468 Zimmie Long term monitoring of two existing landfills will continue
under this Small Grant for Exploratory Research, representing a unique
opportunity to obtain long term information about landfill performance.
Laboratory and field work will include study of frost penetration, freeze- thaw
effects, hydraulic conductivity changes, and settlement in the cover materials,
especially the impermeable barrier layers. Much attention has been given to date
on the performance and constructability of barrier systems beneath landfills,
but to date few covers have been installed so that their performance has not
been evaluated. This is critically important because, while the landfill lining
systems are notoriously redundant in design, landfill covers are not redundant
as presently envisaged. In particular, this research addresses the possibility
that improved performance and reduced costs for covers can be achieved by the
use of unconventional materials, e.g. waste paper sludges. ***
