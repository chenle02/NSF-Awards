This award supports research in antarctic paleobotany to be conducted by Thomas
and Edith Taylor of Ohio State University in cooperation with Sergio
Archangelsky of the Argentine Museum of Natural Sciences in Buenos Aires. The
work is an extension of a study of Permian plants from the Transantarctic
Mountains, Antarctica. It will continue cooperative work on fossil floras from
Patagonia by examining Permian floras in the field and in the laboratory. Field
work will include collection of fossil plants and examination of the
depositional environment and paleoecology of the fossil sites. The data will be
compared with similar data gathered on Permian sites in Antarctica during the
1988-1989 and 1989-1990 field seasons. Utilizing detailed information about
field relationships and floral composition, it will be possible to correlate
biostratigraphy of these two areas. The research outlined in this proposal
represents a colla- borative program designed to examine fossil plants of
Permian age from southern Argentina and Antarctica. The U.S. component (Taylor
and Taylor) have expertise in collections obtained from sites in Antarctica.
Their Argentine colleagues (Archangelsky, Cuneo and Andreis) have expertise with
Permian plants and depositional environments from Patagonia. This program
provides a unique opportunity to interface these two data sets and to provide a
synergistic evaluation of Permian floras from this sector of Gondwana.
Correlations between these floras and those from other Gondwana continents are
important in understanding biogeographic factors such as floral migration and
evolution, as well as being indispensable in developing biostratigraphic charts.
