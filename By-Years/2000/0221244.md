This dissertation investigates how sibling-headed households (SHH) in Namibia
cope with the loss of both parents to AIDS. In 2000, 16% of Namibian children
were orphans. The research will measure the actual and perceived support
received by SHHs. How much instrumental, emotional, and informational support
are provided by the children's networks? Which SHHs receive more support and how
do contextual factors help explain those differences? Interviews, observation,
and surveys will help map children's networks and the resources they receive
from them.
