Support is provided for young scientists to attend an international conference
on substance P and related neuropeptides to be held at the University of
Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester, MA. Substance P was isolated and
characterized in the early 1970's and its importance has been established in the
intervening years. This meeting will bring together renown scientists with
expertise in a number of areas including pharmacology, biochemistry, and
molecular biology to discuss the recent exciting advances in our understanding
of the role of substance P and related peptides in the functioning of the
nervous system. Substance P has been implicated in the transmission of painful
stimuli, in inflammatory responses, in arthritis and in inflammatory bowel
disease. Moreover, substance P fibers innervate the vasculature including the
coronary circulation. The aim of this meeting is to foster stimulating
interchange between graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, junior and senior
scientists in the hopes of providing new insights into the basic mechanisms by
which substance P and related peptides act in the nervous system.
