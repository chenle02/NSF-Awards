Aligned vertical fractures in the crust may be conveniently and accurately
observed by S-wave seismometry. Vertically propagating S-waves move at slightly
different speeds depending upon the polarization of the S-waves with respect to
the alignment of the fracture population. S-waves polarized along the fracture
faces propagate faster than do S-waves polarized normal to aligned fracture
faces. The S-wave speed differential or S-wave splitting is analogous to
birefringence in crystals.
