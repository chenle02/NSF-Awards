This award is to help support a doctoral dissertation. The dissertation will
utilize the 1850-1880 federal census of population and agriculture to produced a
pooled cross-section of panel-like data for six rural townships in Missouri. The
purpose of the study is analyze the relationship between changes in family and
household demography and changes in economic performance in the sample
townships. The major question to be addressed is how did fertility, persistence,
race, and birthplace affect tenancy rates, farm income and market orientation
during this crucial period in American development? Statistical tests will be
undertaken to determine the degree of correlation between family characteristics
and the path and progress of agricultural development. It will then be
determined how a family's characteristics aided or hindered the production of an
agricultural surplus for sale in the market. This project is important because
it will provide a better understanding of the economic process during a crucial
period in American history.
