This project investigates unification with a focus on semantic unification
where some of the function symbols have associated with them, usually specified
in the form of an equational theory. The main objective is to explore
decidability and complexity results, and design efficient algorithms in the
framework of the constraint paradigm, an approach developed earlier in the study
of optimal unification algorithms for associative-commutative theories. In
particular, the use of constraints and heuristics based on them is being
explored to prune the search space. Decidability and complexity issues on
various equational disunification problems are also being explored.
