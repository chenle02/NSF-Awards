Expressing parallel computations over complex shared-memory data structures has
always been a vexing issue in parallel programming. On one hand, popular task-
based programming models do not provide first-class abstractions for isolation
and locality. On the other, Actor-based programming naturally captures locality
but is unsuitable for computations on large shared data structures. The present
project partially bridges the gap between these two styles of parallelism
through Chorus, a new programming model for parallel computations over
unstructured, continually changing shared-memory data structures.

The key abstraction of Chorus is an object assembly: a local, isolated region in
the heap equipped with a thread of control. Assemblies can imperatively modify
themselves, merge with other assemblies, and split into smaller
assemblies?through these operations over assemblies, Chorus captures
unpredictable, dynamic changes to parallelism. This makes Chorus an ideal
programming model for many irregular data-parallel applications (e.g., meshing,
clustering), which exhibit fine-grained data-parallelism in typical executions
but no parallelism in the worst case, and whose parallelization remains an open
and difficult challenge.

The predicted outcomes of the project include new insights into the semantic
foundations of Chorus and new language constructs integrating Chorus with
existing abstractions for asynchronous task creation, directed synchronization,
and locality. On the system-building end, the project will integrate Chorus with
the Habanero Java parallel programming language, and implement a compiler and
runtime for the resultant language. The performance and programmability of this
language will be thoroughly evaluated using benchmarks largely consisting of
emerging irregular workloads.
