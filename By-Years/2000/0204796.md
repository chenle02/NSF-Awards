EIA-0204796 &lt;br/&gt;Steckler, Nicole&lt;br/&gt;Oregon Graduate
Institute&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;SGER: Organizational Facilitators and Inhibitors
to Information-Sharing Across Federal Agency
Boundaries&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This small grant will study the organizational
facilitators and inhibitors to sharing of information across government
agencies. This testbed is an existing multi-agency group working on the topic of
Adaptive Management Areas of the national forests in the Northwest US.
Participating agencies are the US Department of Agriculture and the US
Department of the Interior. This multi-agency group also collaborates on a
multi-agency portal with another Oregon Graduate Institute grantee of the
Digital Government program, thus providing a natural collaboration between the
disciplines of computer science and social
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
