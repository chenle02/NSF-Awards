This project is concerned with developing a model of natural language
understanding in which the inference machinery is based on discourse principles.
In particular, a theory of text interpretation is develop. This theory computers
an interpretation that conforms to plausible goals of a speaker and is most
likely to be intended given the utterances than any other interpretation. The
system is implemented by postulating an access/selection.integration paradigm.
It is allowed for probabilistic considerations to be compiled into how elements
are indexed, rather than exist as part of a run-time mechanism.
