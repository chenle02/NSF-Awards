Funding is provided to support the Turbulent Mixing and Beyond symposium which
will be held at The Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics in
Trieste, Italy on the 14th through 18th of August, 2017. The funds will be used
to cover expenses associated with travel for 15 U.S. graduate students. The
international meeting is soliciting invitees that are world renowned experts in
the study of physics and control of turbulent shear flows. The 5 day symposium
will include approximately 60 keynote presentations and 180 participants from a
range of individuals including students, young scientists and established
researchers.

The broader impact will be to increase the dissemination of studies associated
with the Turbulence mixing physics among students, young scientists and
established researchers. Although NSF funds will not be used for international
participants the international nature of those attending the symposium will
further broaden the exposure and impact of the research presented at this
meeting. In addition, the papers from the symposium will be posted online, the
symposium will be video recorded, and papers from the symposium will be
submitted for journal publication.
