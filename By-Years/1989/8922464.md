As part of a longer term study, Dr. Servos is examining the history of
industrial sponsorship of scientific research on university campuses from 1900
to World War II. Under this grant, he is studying the evolution of contractual
relationships between universities and industrial firms during that period,
focusing on such issues as the motives and expectations of industrial sponsors,
the relationship between in-house and extramural industrial research, the
scientific and technical accomplishments of such plans, the effects of corporate
sponsorship on faculty morale and ont eh research and educational missions of
the academy more generally, and the reasons for the rise and decline of such
relationships during the interwar years. By studying selected examples of
efforts to integrate industrial and academic science, Dr. Servos will enlarge
our understanding of the ways that industrial and academic research intersected
during their early and formative years and will provide a historical perspective
on the cooperative schemes of the present.
