The purpose of this project is to bridge the gap between the interactive
capacities of current robotic agents and human-like cognitive abilities that
have long been the aim of artificial intelligence research. The basic thesis is
the concept that embodiment itself both enables and constraints our cognitive
capacities. Through interaction with imagined stimuli we reuse concrete
machinery for abstract tasks. By agreeing as a society to interpret arbitrary
signals in terms of our experiences, we develop symbolic language. We understand
music, metaphor, and even mathematics by virtue of their relationships to our
physical experiences. This project utilizes this thesis as a foundation and
further explores the ways in which sophisticated, symbolic, and abstract forms
of cognition are built on our embodied experiences.
