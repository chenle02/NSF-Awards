This award is to support research that will develop a network of tree-ring
records covering the past 3,000 years from the western United States. These data
will be used to understand the temporal and geographic variability of Holocene
climate in western North America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Field work will be
undertaken to obtain tree-ring records of appropriate length from regions
currently lacking high resolution time series. Existing tree-ring archives will
be carefully analyzed to select the best 3000+ year records of climate. These
records will be integrated into a network with sufficient geographic coverage to
be useful for ocean-atmosphere modeling studies. The resulting network of
records will be used to produce a variety of climate reconstructions ranging
from long regional reconstructions to synoptic reconstructions of the western
United States.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this proposed
research center on the development of a network of high resolution climate
records from the western United States that can be used to fully explore the
range and frequency of climate change. This tool is presently not available and
will have a wide range of applications for paleoclimatology, oceanography and
other subdisciplines of climate change.
