The National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) of the University of
Illinois proposes to host a Wide Area Networking Conference in order ot promote
an understanding of the benefits of networking among Long Term Ecological
Research (LTER) sites. This workshop will serve as model for familiarizing
scientific researchers with core services of networking, i. e., file transfer,
remote log in, and electronic mail. It will assess the use of networking as
infrastructure for collaborative scientific ventures. Lectures and laboratory
sessions will be given by professionals with networking and supercomputing
experience. Topics will include: General networking and remote computing;
introduction to ICP/IP protocols, resorces available on the internet; and an
introduction to computational science and supercomputing. An evaluation will be
taken in order to assess the need for future workshops and the form they should
take.***//
