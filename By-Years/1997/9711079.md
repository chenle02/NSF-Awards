This award is made under the innovative technology connections portion of NCRI's
"Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64, which covers K-12
education institutions (including vocational technical schools), public
libraries and museums. It provides partial support for twelve months to
investigate the use of FSK modulation (Frequency Shift Keying) on unused
Instructional Television Fixed Service (ITFS) bands. This is an application of
FSK modulation, which traditionally is used in spread spectrum communication
systems, to the ITFS microwave bands. This engineering study has the following
objectives: Develop a test plan that addresses both adjacent channel and co-
channel testing and test equipment requirements. Systematically field test the
use of FSK modulation techniques on Multipoint Distribution Service (MDS) and
ITFS frequencies, providing a matrix of test results. Determine the interference
capabilities of an FSK signal into conventional NTSC analog transmissions.
Prepare a document consistent with the format of the Request for Declaratory
Rulemaking on the Use of Digital technology in MDS and ITFS frequencies. The
results of the test will be submitted to the FCC, and could assist the FCC in
its decision on allowing widespread use of this technology.
