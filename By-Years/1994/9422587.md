This research explores how indigenous Maya Indians in Yucatan, Mexico, local
immigrants and non-governmental organizations manage forest resource systems.
The project focuses on the roles of information and communication in the use and
governance of common-pool resources. Three questions will be studied: What is
the structure and content of local ecological knowledge that enables successful
commons management? What is the character of the communications networks that
make possible assimilation, distribution and implementation of this information?
and to what extent is loss of local knowledge and disruption of communication
networks related to a breakdown of the commons? The general background issues
are what lessons do micro-level approaches to increasingly threatened commons
systems hold for the future of global commons such as the earth's forests,
ranges, water and air? Methods will include ethnographic fieldwork in Campeche,
Yucatan, Mexico. Field researchers will interview individuals for their
cognitive models of resources using intensive open-ended interviews as well as
close-ended questionnaires and psychological tests to study mental models,
social networks, and the social distribution of ecological knowledge. Consensus
analysis will be performed on local communities to study the distribution and
patterning of ecological knowledge. In addition the range of biotic resources
available to the community will be surveyed as a form of `ground-truthing`. This
research is important because systematic analysis of local community-based
knowledge and beliefs and the linkages between this knowledge and practices will
help societies plan to conserve natural resources. This is the human dimension
of both local and global change in the preservation or breakdown of common
property resources.
