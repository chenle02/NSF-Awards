This award, under the U.S.-Mexico CONACyT Initiative, is concerned with an in-
depth scientific understanding of the nature of the relationship between mobile
robotic agents and their environment. The research addresses the agent-
environment relationship directly using schema theory and neurophysiological and
ethological models to ultimately provide credible, generalizable, and useful
results in this domain. These systems will ultimately be grounded in both
simulations and actual robotic hardware. An in-depth understanding and dynamic
modeling of the relationship a robot has with its environment (i.e., the overall
ecology) is important to ensure that fielded robotic systems don't compete
inappropriately with other agents that can do the task more effectively (and by
competing, reduce their usefuless); that the robots are successful competitors
within the ecological system and can potentially displace less efficient agents;
and that they are ecologically sensitive so that agent-environmental system
dynamics are well-modeled and as predictable as possible whenever new robotic
technology is introduced. The research efforts will be tied together through the
use of software tools already in existence or under development at both sites,
including NSL, a neural simulation language; ASL, an abstract schema language;
and MissionLab, a schema-based mission-oriented simulation and robot
implementation environment.
