This project is funded in part by the National Science Foundation Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites program in the Social, Behavioral,
and Economic Sciences directorate. It has broader scientific and societal
impacts in addition to integrating undergraduate research and education. This
REU Sites award to the Crow Canyon Archaeological Center supports authentic
archaeological research for 10 undergraduate students from underserved
populations over the course of seven weeks spanning three years (30 total
students). Students actively engage in research alongside professional mentors
within the framework of a long-term research project, the Northern Chaco
Outliers Project. Students receive extensive preparation in STEM-based learning
objectives that are necessary for future success within the discipline. This
program provides students with the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities to
secure future employment within archaeology and to pursue advanced degrees,
emerging as the next generation of professionals, Tribal Historic Preservation
Officers, educators, and leaders within the sciences. Inferences generated about
past human behavior are utilized to create a better understanding of the
principles that govern culture change worldwide and to address issues relevant
to todayâ€™s societies, providing critical information to guide future policy
making. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Crow Canyon Archaeological Center initiated
the Northern Chaco Outliers Project in 2017 with the goals of addressing
important regional questions surrounding the expansion of ancestral communities
in the Mesa Verde region, as well as broader anthropological research questions
concerning human-environment interactions, the development of
inequality/equality, the political role of community centers, and identity
formation/dissolution. Although this Site has a regional focus, its results have
national and global impacts. By engaging in scientific research focused on
broader anthropological questions, REU students advance and share knowledge of
the human past and contribute to cross-cultural and cross-disciplinary research
surrounding human actions in the past, present, and
future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
