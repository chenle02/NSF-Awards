The Urban Community Project to Stimulate Interests in STEM Careers (U-CPS)
project of Fisk University is a three-year project designed to provide
challenging and stimulating learning experiences to middle school students by
providing high quality professional development experiences for three cohorts of
15 middle and high school teachers through the development of learning modules.
Teachers will conduct research by testing and refining these modules and operate
as facilitators initially in pre-existing 8-weeks boys' (THURST) and girls'
(GUSTO) summer science camps, and then modify them for use in science classrooms
during the academic year. The project provides an after-school teachers'
training program focusing on the utilization of robotics, rocketry, computers
and ICT programming skills in urban classrooms in the Metropolitan Nashville
Public School System.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The goals of the project are to: (1)
Improve pedagogy among public school science teachers by providing a
professional development program for middle and high school science teachers to
assist them in developing and integrating innovative teaching methods in their
science curricula; (2) Enhance science and math summer science programs to
prepare students from underrepresented groups for academic achievement and
careers in STEM/ICT disciplines; (3) Use structured interactive and hands-on
activities in rocketry and ICT in the classroom to enhance teaching competencies
and student learning.
