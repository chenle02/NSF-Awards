This is a transfer of funds to the U.S. Air Force Rocket Systems Launch Program
for the launch of the COSMIC satellite constellation. COSMIC is a constellation
of six satellites that will make use of recent developments in remote sensing,
communications technology, and computing to solve some of the most important
geo-scientific issues today. Each spacecraft will carry three science payloads
for weather and space weather research and prediction, climate monitoring, and
geodesy. These payloads are 1) GPS occultation receiver 2) Tiny Ionospheric
Photometer (TIP) and 3) Tri Band Beacon Transmitters (TBB). The COSMIC system
includes the low earth orbit satellites, ground data reception and spacecraft
control stations, data analysis centers and the data communications networks.
