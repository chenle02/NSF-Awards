Regular Equipment Grant to purchase a flash-lamp-pumped Nd:YAG laser and light
energy meter that will be dedicated to support research in engineering. The
laser and energy meter will form the core of a research test facility for
studying novel laser resonators containing diffractive optics. Preliminary
experimental tests have shown that the unique properties of diffractive
resonators are well suited to a variety of laser systems including solid-state
and semiconductor lasers. The laser and energy meter described in this proposal
will enable accurate measurements of a variety of resonator properties including
small differences in lasing thresholds, comparisons of output energy,
fundamental and higher-order mode shape.
