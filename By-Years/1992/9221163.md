This project will examine the determinants of dental variation in the Asian
Colobinae, a large subfamily of primates not studied in any depth to date. In
addition to providing the first comprehensive data set on all the extant Asian
species of this subfamily, it will contribute to knowledge of a primate
evolutionary radiation, addressing one way in which closely related species
coexist. The relationship of dental variation to differing diets and ecologies
will be tested, as well as phylogenetic correspondence. Besides being important
in its scientific goals, this project will also improve the technical and
investigative abilities of an excellent young scientist.
