Because the lower creust is hot,lower crustal flow should be rapid. Yet rapid
crustal flow is not considered in existing models of continental extension and
passive margin formation. The PI proposes to develop theoretical models that
approximate the temporal evolution of strain in regions where the crust flows
rapidly, and then compare the results with geologic and geophysical data from
the Aegean margin and the Valencia margin south of Spain.
