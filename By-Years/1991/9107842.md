A classical focus of statistics is estimation of the accuracy or error of
statistical procedures; currently, attention to this problem is directed at
measuring accuracy after data have been obtained. By developing the underlying
mathematical theory this research examines post-data inference and derives the
properties of data dependent measures of accuracy. In addition, ancillarity
paradoxes will be examined in which conditioning upon observed sample size
within subgroup leads to inadmissibility of the usual estimators. The
possibility of constructing and verifying dominating estimators will be
investigated.
