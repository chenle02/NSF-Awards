The knowledge of biology is increasing so rapidly that the breadth of biology
can no longer be taught in a single course. The Biology Department has addressed
this issue by abandoning the traditional introductory survey course and adopting
a group of fundamental courses. In cell and molecular biology, the fundamental
courses are Molecular Biology, Developmental Cell Biology, and Biochemistry.
This opportunity is being taken to develop innovative labs in cell and molecular
biology that demonstrate the principles discussed in lecture and that also allow
students to perform the state-of-the-art techniques. Through this project,
equipment is obtained that enables faculty to teach students state-of-the-art
techniques in these fundamental cell and molecular biology courses. New
experimental modules stress investigative approaches. Labs include forensic DNA
typing, using the polymerase chain reaction technology (Molecular Biology),
Western blotting to identify specific proteins expressed during neural
development (Developmental Cell Biology), and DNA footprinting to study the
interactions of the lac repressor with the lac operon operator. The strength and
uniqueness of this proposal come from the innovative design of the new
curriculum. A large number of frosh and sophomore students use sophisticated
equipment to learn state-of-the-art techniques previously not available or only
available in upper-level courses. Early exposure to these techniques, in
experiments carefully designed to pique students' interest, better prepares them
for upper-level classes and increases their interest in both research
opportunities and graduate school.
