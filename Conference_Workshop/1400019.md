This award provides two years of funding to help defray the expenses of
participants in the "Kent State Informal Analysis Seminar," the next meeting of
which will take place March 1-2, 2014, on the campus of Kent State University.

The Kent State Informal Analysis Seminar is a roughly biannual regional
conference that has served the US Midwest for over forty years. The themes of
the meetings vary greatly from event to event, ranging over a broad spectrum of
topics that has included approximation theory, convex geometry, dynamical
systems, the geometry of Banach spaces, harmonic analysis, partial differential
equations, and several complex variables, to give just a sampling. The featured
speakers at the March 2014 meeting will be Svetlana Jitomirskaya (mathematical
physics) and Nets Katz (harmonic analysis and combinatorics), each of whom will
deliver a four-hour series of lectures. The seminar format provides ample
opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to
present their work.
