Millions of lightning flashes occur per day over the Earth, transferring
tremendous power from electrical clouds to Earth's surface in the form of
electric current. Lightning discharges also occur between the clouds and the
edge of space, producing luminous displays called sprites and elves. These
events can occur because cosmic rays from other galaxies and x-rays from the Sun
make the edge of space electrically-conducting. It is not well understood how
lightning might modify ionospheric conditions that affect communications and
navigation (e.g., GPS) systems, or how changes in the space environment might
affect electrical processes in polar-region clouds relevant to weather and
climate, or how society would be impacted in other ways through electrical
connections within the Earth-atmosphere-geospace system. This Broad topic is the
subject of the project "Electrical Connections and Consequences Within the Earth
System".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the purpose of this 5-year multi-
institutional basic research investigation to better understand the electrical
processes that link together the atmosphere, solid earth and geospace components
of the Earth system. The approach is to develop improved understanding of
processes controlling the charge and discharge of electrified clouds, the
electrical coupling between the atmosphere and ionosphere, and the flow of
current throughout the system. The project will culminate in creation of a
global model that is capable of replicating much of the experimental data
accumulated to date, and that Interfaces with the rest of the atmosphere-
ionosphere system within the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) at
the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). Other key goals of this
project are to educate the public about this field of study, and to motivate and
educate a cadre of next-generation scientists on this global view of the Earth-
atmosphere-geospace system.
