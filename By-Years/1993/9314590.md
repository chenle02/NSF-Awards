ABSTRACT: 9314590, PI-Dorman: An earthquake swarm located teleseismically in a
small region about 300 km west of the East Pacific Rise at 18 degrees south and
116 degrees west prompted the deployment of ocean bottom seismometers near the
site during a multibeam and side scan survey of the ridge. Hundreds of
microearthquakes located within or near the array of oceanbottom seismometers,
the side scan sonar, and the multibeam bathymetric data will be analyzed. A
comparative event analysis of the location and mechanism of the location and
mechanism of the teleseismically recorded events will be conducted, and the
stresses that would be expected for a variety of different mechanisms will be
modeled to aid in understanding the tectonci role of this earthquake sequence.
