The Computing and Engineering Scholarship Program (CESP) at Saint Cloud State
University (SCSU) will offer 45 biennial scholarships of $6,000 per year for
four years to students that demonstrate financial-need and academic talent, and
elect to pursue degrees in Information Assurance, Information Systems, Computer
Science, Computer Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Manufacturing
Engineering. Recruitment plans will target transfer students from Minnesota and
neighboring states. This project will build on the successes of a previous
S-STEM project at SCSU and will improve SCSU STEM programs, will continue the
development and enhancement of student support structures, and will increase
SCSU's contributions to the national need for STEM graduates.

Student support structures, such as faculty and peer mentoring, advising,
mentoring and tutoring, will be enhanced to ensure student success. Students
will be assigned a faculty mentor, a graduate assistant and senior student
support. Students may optionally engage in a research project, take a 1-credit
seminar course or complete an internship in industry or in a national lab that
will provide them with practical skills to will help them to be successful in
the workplace. Assessment plans will evaluate the efficacy of the enhancements
to the SCSU student support infrastructure and will track student success after
leaving the program.
