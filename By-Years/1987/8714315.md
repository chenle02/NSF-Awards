This proposal requests funds to purchase equipment for the Freshwater Biological
Facilities Center. Three major suites of equipment include: a scanning electron
microscope with elemental analyzer, image analysis and multitask computer; an
Intermap Analytic Photogrammetric Workstation; and an inductively coupled plasma
emission spectrometer, ion chromatograph, and autoanalyzer. This instrumentation
will enhance one of the major directions of interdisciplinary research, the
development of linkages among stream ecology, geology, geochemistry, and
geography, including geomorphology and hydrology. A major research goal is to
improve current theories in stream ecology by incorporating the indirect and
direct effects of watershed geology and geography on stream biology and
chemistry and to utilize geology and geography as an organizing force within
ecosystems. The University of Alabama is in an ideal location to achieve this
owing to its proximity to four geological provinces in a climatically similar
area and an extensive system of streams and rivers. This instrumentation will
substantially move the institution closer toward its goal of focused breadth
with cooperative efforts in areas of aquatic ecololgy and modern systematics as
interfaced with geology, geochemistry, and geography.
