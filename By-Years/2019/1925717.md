The exponential growth of computing power and the emergence of high-performance
computing paradigms has revolutionized all fields of science and engineering.
Graphics processing unit (GPU) hardware, a type of highly parallel co-processor
originally designed for generating 3D scenes in video games, has been
increasingly leveraged over the last decade to dramatically accelerate
scientific computing workloads. This project is for the acquisition of a GPU
compute cluster consisting of 24 state-of-the-art NVIDIA Tesla V100 32 GB GPUs
with fast inter-GPU communication. The resource is housed at the University of
California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), and is accessible to researchers across campus
and externally through a connection to the Pacific Research Platform/Nautilus
federated systems network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Initial research activities on
the facility span the computational realm, including: a new type of multi-scale
molecular simulation for predicting structural and thermodynamic properties of
complex polymeric solution formulations; a materials characterization thrust
involving crystal orientation indexing with real-time instrument feedback
control; and the development of a scalable Neural Architecture Search framework
for automatic generation of Deep Neural Network models for scientific
applications of machine learning. The cluster provides a significant resource
for educating the next generation of computational scientists in the latest GPU-
computing techniques. Undergraduates, high-school students, and K-12 teachers
will also have access via existing campus-sponsored programs: Research
Experience for Teachers (RET), California Alliance for Minority Participation
(CAMP), and the Center for Science and Engineering Partnerships (CSEP). These
programs serve to provide training and increase the number of under-represented
students in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
