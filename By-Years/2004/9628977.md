9628977 Berenbaum Although the presence of toxins in plants has long been
associated with resistance to insects, the idea that low nutrient quality can
similarly protect plants against their insect enemies has remained untested for
over forty years. The goal of this project is to measure variation in the
nutritional quality of Pastinaca sativa, the wild parsnip, and determine whether
the low levels of such vital insect nutrients as protein, fatty acids, vitamins,
and sugars are associated with escape from attack by Depressaria pastinacella,
the principal insect enemy of the plant. This project is of interest not only
because it can contribute to the conceptual understanding of plant-insect
interactions, which collectively constitute the principal form of biological
interaction on the planet, but also because it can potentially lead to new and
environmentally compatible approaches to pest control. Breeding strains of crop
plants that are resistant to insect damage based on their low content of
essential insect nutrients can lead to pest control without use of synthetic
organic insecticides. Nutrients that are essential requirements for insects but
are relatively important in human diets can be specifically targeted for
manipulation. Many plant pests feed on only a narrow range of crop species;
because of their extremely specialized diet, plant-feeding insect pests are
particularly vulnerable to nutritional deficiencies in their diet in that
missing nutrients in many cases cannot be compensated for by switching to other
plant species. Adoption of such a control strategy can lead to improved yields,
reduced risks of resistance acquisition, and reduced impacts on nontarget
species compared with conventional pesticide treatments.
