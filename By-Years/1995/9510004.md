The Department of Chemistry at the University of Iowa will use this award from
the Chemistry Instrumentation and Facilities Program to help purchase a state-
of-the-art mass spectrometer with capabilities not currently available. The
areas of chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition include the
following: synthesis and characterization of polyfluorinated phosphonate
polymers, structural studies of novel natural products from fungi,
characterization of transition metal complexes and polymers produced by
reactions they catalyze, identification of lipids present in inseparable
mixtures, identification of enzyme metabolites, and characterization of novel
nucleoside phosphonates. Mass Spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe
intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast
array of organic, bioorganic and organometallic molecules. The acquisition of a
mass spectrometer is essential for the prosecution of frontier research in many
fields in chemistry, and a modern data handling system improves the instrument
control and the efficiency of the facility.
