9405397 White PI, U.S. collaborator Joyce Blueford, and Russian colleagues will
conduct sedimentological, stratigraphic, paleontological and geochemical
analyses of selected Cenozoic siliceous and organic- rich deposits of Russia,
and compare these deposits to related units in California, and to deep-sea core
material from the northern Pacific. This comparision will ultimately broaden our
understanding of siliceous rocks and their integral role in paleoceanographic
and petroleum research.
