9404107 Lee The plan of research covers a number of topics characterizing
classes of Einstein metrics in Riemannian Geometry and local embeddability of
pseudoconvex CR-manifolds. This component of the research may have potential
applications to relativity theory. It is also proposed to develop the Ricci
software package to implement coordinate-free tensor calculations which would be
a valuable tool for research in Riemannian geometry and which is likely to have
educational ramifications. ***
