Long-term environmental changes alter the abundance of species by directly
affecting reproduction, mortality, and other demographic parameters. However,
changes in species abundances are also affected by positive and negative
feedbacks operating through ecological interactions within and among species. In
the research stochastic models will be developed for population dynamics to
predict how species interactions influence the effects of environmental changes
on species abundances. In collaboration with other researchers, these models
will then be used to integrate this theory with existing long-term data sets
from different types of ecological communities.
