The project implements the Cisco Networking Academy specializing in
virtualization and server consolidation. The project also develops a networking
and information systems security workforce. The disciplinary focus is
information technologies education and the project elevates the curriculum to
meet current workforce needs and a transitioning local and global economy. The
project is lead by Computer Information Technology (CIT) faculty. CIT is a two-
year, associate's degree program preparing graduates for employment with
organizations that use computers to process, manage, and communicate
information. Implementation of the Academy and partnerships with K-12 schools
for the first level Cisco courses and with regional community colleges for the
second level Cisco course delivery are underway. Results are disseminated
locally and regionally to enhance CIT program training strategies and aid
economic development efforts with a trained workforce. The primary audience is
two-year college students and secondary school students, while two-year college
faculty complete professional development. The project initiates a new class of
knowledge workers within the CIT field. CIT technicians, through this activity,
understand securing, virtualizing, and consolidating networks while creating
awareness for energy conservation measures. Underrepresented groups are
encouraged to participate in the training program. Project evaluation is a
measurement of learning outcomes and successful certifications in Cisco-related
competencies.
