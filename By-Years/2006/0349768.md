This award helps support a conference entitled, "Tree Rings and Climate:
Sharpening the Focus," in Tucson, Arizona on April 6-9, 2004. NSF support will
be combined with funds from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration's Office of Global Programs and the Past Global Changes project
office of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme to provide participant
support for scientists with expertise in dendroclimatology and related aspects
of climate to participate in presentations and discussions that synthesize the
scientific strengths and weaknesses of the last thirty years of tree-ring
research. Workshop participants will also access opportunities and challenges
for the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The participants, which include seasoned
researchers, new investigators, and students, will produce and distribute a
document synthesizing and summarizing the conference proceedings and findings
for examination by the wider scientific community. In this manner, an open and
lively exchange of views on this important topic will be enabled.
