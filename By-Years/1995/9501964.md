9501964 Shaw This program will investigate variations in lithospheric strength
along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The study will combine an analysis of multibeam
bathymetric data to extract lengths and vertical offsets of normal faults with a
modeling portion to arrive at a thermal picture of the lithosphere and thus an
estimate of strength, given an inferred composition and rheology. ***
