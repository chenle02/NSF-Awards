Although streams are networks of aquatic habitat that are distributed across a
terrestrial landscapes; little is known about how the patterns of these networks
affect the distributions of organisms that live within them. The objective of
this research is to examine how stoneflies, a group of insects that develop as
larvae in streams and live in the forest as adults, disperse among streams, and
how the patterns of streams affect the distribution of stoneflies in the White
Mountain National Forest of New Hampshire. Using stable isotopes, adult
stoneflies will be tracked in the forest to measure flight distances. A model
will be developed to predict how individual insect and habitat characteristics
affect flight patterns. Historic dispersal patterns will be estimated indirectly
by assessing relatedness of individuals using molecular genetics. This research
will provide a greater understanding of how aquatic insect populations are
integrated among streams, and will be useful for predicting how disturbances
affect populations distributed across connected habitats.
