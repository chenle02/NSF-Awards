This award from the Environmental Chemical Sciences and Physical and Dynamic
Meteorology Programs of NSF supports Professor Steven Neshyba and his students
at the University of Puget Sound. They study the surface texture ("roughness")
of ice crystals in clouds. These ice particles play a significant role in
Earth's weather. They influence how the clouds reflect and transmit sunlight.
The mechanism by which such roughness develops is not well understood. This
project includes experiments and computation. It aims to develop a theoretical
description of the ice surface properties. Undergraduate students participate in
the work as researchers, co-authors of papers and presentations, and
collaborators. Other educational impacts include providing high school students
and teachers from Lincoln High School hands-on experiences operating a scanning
electron microscope. All of the researchers write computer codes to interpret
the resulting images. Professor Neshyba travels with his students to
collaborator laboratories in the Czech Republic and Norway helping them to gain
an appreciation for science in an international context.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the laboratory, roughness properties of cirrus-like ice
crystals are obtained by growing the crystals inside a variable-pressure
scanning electron microscope. Molecular dynamics simulations explore the
evolution of ice surface characteristics over complete cycles of ice layer
growth. A coarse-grained model for ice growth extends the reach of these
molecular-scale simulations to much larger time- and distance scales. These
results are used to predict interactions with visible light, especially as
pertinent to atmospheric remote sensing experiments. A predictive theory of ice
crystal surface morphology can be achieved by integrating elements of ice growth
dynamics across multiple scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
