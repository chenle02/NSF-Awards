The four-year project at Thomas Nelson CC provides 36 scholarships of $2500 per
year to students majoring in computer science, engineering and mathematics.
Recruitment efforts target populations typically underrepresented in CSEMS
career fields. Pre-college partners help identify potential candidates for the
scholarships. Specialized academic and student life-skills support activities
provide students with the tools to succeed at TNCC and to seek, obtain, and
retain careers in CSEMS fields. A strong evaluation component with its control
group provides clear documentation of the efficacy of the various support
strategies.
