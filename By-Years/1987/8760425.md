A proof of concept will be established (in Phase 1), and (in Phase II) a cost-
effective portable computer-based system will be developed for acquisition and
processing of data needed to create, on-site if desired, as-built drawings of
facilities such as buildings and space layouts. Robust algorithms for checking
the measurements given and user interface graphics will give the needed
reliability for eventual commercial application. The core of the system will be
based on a high-performance 32-bit single-board computer readily available. The
computer will be supplemented with convenient commercially available transducers
for measurement of distances, orientations and specific reference locations.
Various options exist for these sensors; a number of particular approaches are
discussed, such as an ultrasonic transmitter-receiver, theodolite-type systems
with direct electronic readout of angles and distance, and laser-based systems.
An overall system with reliable data-acquisition from sensors, real- time
processing, analysis and graphical display of the physical location, will be
designed to the prototype level in Phase I.
