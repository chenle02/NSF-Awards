Researchers often need to complement field and laboratory data with
observations of behavior in strategically designed indoor naturalistic
facilities, which deviate substantially from those envisioned in Federal
standards for research-animal husbandry. This need has repeatedly brought
regulatory agencies, university administrators, and researchers into conflict.
Clarification of the complex web of responsibilities and obligations shouldered
by regulatory personnel and university administrators will be necessary if the
design and operation of indoor naturalistic facilities is to be sustained as a
viable component of behavioral research. Closer contact with the veterinary,
zoo, and humane communities can also help researchers anticipate problems,
improve plans, and advocate their research requirements more effectively. This
conference will bring zoo and research veterinarians, university administrators,
regulatory agents, and humane-society professionals together with scientists
involved in behavioral research. The proceedings will involve (1) inspection and
discussion of extensive new indoor naturalistic habitats of the New York
Zoological Park, (2) panel discussion of four hypothetical facilities that might
be constructed on a university campus, and (3) presentation of 15 technical
papers on the strategic use of indoor habitats; the ways in which they often
deviate from Federal standards; design and maintenance considerations related to
light, air quality, and substrates; population sizes; co-habitation of multiple
species; pests; hygiene, and security. Perspectives from the humane and animal-
rights communities will also be presented.
