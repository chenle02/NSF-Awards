Education as social capital is commonly invoked as a justification for
advocating more education for all. According to this prevailing model, growth in
educational attainment creates -human capital,+ which adds aggregate social
value to society. At the same time, however, it has been recognized that
education has an important role as the central mechanism behind social
stratification. Here, education acts primarily as the chief agent of -social
competition,+ in which there is no added social value to more education, but
rather, education acts as an allocator, where increases in educational
attainment simply lead to a continuous resorting into ranks. These two models of
the causal effect of education generate highly divergent predictive consequences
of the value and price of education for society. This research tests these
competing models and unpacks the effects of formal education and the importance
of individual performance, curriculum, and methods of learning on distinctive
types of social outcomes.
