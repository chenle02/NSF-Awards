&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks to address these two primary challenges by
developing adaptive software tools to&lt;br/&gt;co-manage quality-performance-
power tradeoffs. First, we will develop combinatorial and statistical adaptive
techniques to select methods dynamically, delivering the improved performance
while producing a solution that meets application quality requirements. Next,
using an annotated model of computation and communication costs and sparse data
access patterns, we will develop techniques for power reduction
without&lt;br/&gt;performance impairment. For example, power savings can be
significant even when relatively minor load&lt;br/&gt;imbalances among
processors are exploited. These imbalances can easily be on the order of
trillions of&lt;br/&gt;CPU cycles, and power consumption can be tuned through
dynamic voltage scaling (DVS, where both the&lt;br/&gt;clock frequency and the
supply voltage are tuned) for lightly/heavily loaded processors. More
importantly,&lt;br/&gt;resulting insights can lead to future systems where the
power budget is directed effectively over processor-memory interconnect
subsystems to improve application performance. We plan to implement our
techniques by developing an adaptive component software system on high-end
multiprocessors
