This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office to Yale University provides funds for the repair and
renovation of Sloan Physics Laboratory which houses that institution's atomic,
molecular, and optical physics research and research training activities. This
building was constructed in 1912 and last renovated in 1958. The ARFMP grant of
$950,000 and $1,183,400 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to
modernize these research and research training facilities and consolidate
several high quality research programs. The project will address significant
disadvantages of the current research infrastructure by providing (a) thermal
and vibrational isolation that is absolutely essential to the conduct of high
precision experiments, (b) adequate levels of cleanliness, and (c) structurally
sound locations for large magnets and power supplies. The greater interactions
among related programs that accrue from this renovation can be expected to
enhance collaborations and the quality of ongoing research. This award
contributes to the infrastructure of science by providing an improved
environment for the conduct of research and for the training of quality
undergraduate and graduate students. Students trained in these laboratories,
where high technology instruments are developed and used, are in demand in both
basic and applied research fields.
