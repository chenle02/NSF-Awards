9451657 Perez-Arnau Biology courses will be improved by introducing an
innovative system of microorganism classification which uses a modern method of
statistical analysis based on the fatty acid content. This system, which uses
the gas chromatograph, will be linked to a local network in order to service a
greater number of students. The project will: 1) introduce a new microorganism
characterization method, 2) update the chromatographic techniques in the
Microbiology laboratory, 3) increase the knowledge and skills of the Biology
students through the practical operation of high technology instruments. New
experiments will help the students acquire and/or improve the following skills:
(A) relate structures and chromatographs, (B) the analysis of statistical data
and the use of the MIDI system, (C) the management and operation of the
chromatograph, (D) comprehend the complex nature of the components of
microorganisms, (E) learn new taxonomic criteria based on molecular composition.
The courses which the new technology will benefit are the following: General
Microbiology, Cellular and Molecular Biology, Medical Microbiology, Industrial
Microbiology, and Mycology. The utilization of the gas chromatograph system and
the related software for the biochemical analysis of microorganisms can be
duplicated in other undergraduate settings. A lab manual in Spanish will be
produced and distributed.
