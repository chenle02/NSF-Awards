This research is an historical investigation of the `going public` strategy
used by U.S. presidents. The central theoretical statement holds that campaign
strategies affect governing practices. The research focuses on changes in
campaigning styles by presidential candidates at the turn of the twentieth
century and links these changes to governing strategies that focused on direct
appeals to the mass public. A new data set is developed of campaigning
activities and presidential policy announcements. A multivariate statistical
model using `event counts` is used to test the change in governing practices
over time.
