About thirty percent of all disk galaxies exhibit distinctive ring- like
enhancements in their light distribution. This research is an organized
observational and theoretical effort to understand the morphology and dynamics
of such ring galaxies. The research group, recognized experts in this field of
study, will compile a homogeneous catalog of the ring properties for statistical
studies, and apply a well-tested n-body computer code incorporating self-
gravity, gas, and stellar dynamics to a very large number of particles to study
various mechanisms for ring formation.
