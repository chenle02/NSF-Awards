Research will be conducted on migration of potential chemical pollutants of
groundwater in subsurface locations. Mathematical models will be formulated that
may have applicability in engineering design of storage locations for hazardous
wastes and in evaluation of decontamination concepts where chemicals have
contaminated groundwater.
