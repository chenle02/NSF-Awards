In many scientific disciplines, computational simulations form the third pillar
of research complementing theory and experiment. With simulations increasing in
complexity, resolution and duration, visualization of intermediate results has
become important in rapid assessment of simulation data. Moreover with the
ubiquity of sensing devices, joint analysis of simulation and observational data
is emerging within research communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
capitalizes on recent video standardization strides emerging within web
communities. It explores the use,adaptation, and optimization of these video
capabilities within the cyberinfrastructure required for advanced computational
science. The resulting visualization aims to promote collaboration and facile
sharing of scientific results among research and non-research communities.
