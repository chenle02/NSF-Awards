The award is to support a doctoral dissertation research project that will
examine the patterns of community diversity in the Hood River ecosystem in the
Northwest Territories of Canada. The Hood River is a pristine river without
anthropological influences to disturb the ecosystem. This environment will offer
a unique opportunity to establish a link between natural heterogeneity in
biodiversity and environmental factors such as temperature differences within
the landscape. The community analysis will be compared to satellite remote
sensing data so that the role of diversity of plant communities, may be examined
as a function of spectral reflectance. This baseline study will provide data
needed to test hypotheses regarding species responses to possible warming trends
in the Arctic predicted from modelling studies.
