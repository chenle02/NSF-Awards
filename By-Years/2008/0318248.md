;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activity is to create an annual leadership
institute for senior tenured women faculty in NSF-supported disciplines with the
purpose of increasing the representation of women in higher education leadership
positions (chair, dean, etc.), and supporting the ADVANCE goal of facilitating
women's advancement to the highest ranks of academic leadership.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The leadership institute will increase the accessibility
for such training for faculty in the midwest by providing low cost workshops
within that geographic area. The leadership training will focus on the business
and leadership skills needed for women to make a successful entry into
department chair and dean positions. This proposal addresses the need for women
to have opportunities to cultivate leadership skills and goals in a structured
setting in order to capture the benefits of such training that is often made
available to male faculty in informal, less structured and more 'on the job'
settings. The goal of the ADVANCE program is to increase the participation of
women in the scientific and engineering workforce through the increased
representation and advancement of women in academic science and engineering
careers. With this award, NSF seeks to support new approaches to improving the
climate for women in U.S. academic institutions and to facilitate women's
advancement to the highest ranks of academic
leadership&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
