The subject of this research is to investigate the basic physics of polymer
gels, in particular their moleculer and microscopic structure, the kinetics of
gelation, and the diffusion of particles and polymers in gels. The problem of
probe diffusion in gels has a direct bearing on the practical problems of
electrophoresis, and on the fundamental problem of polymer diffusion in random
media. The primary experimental tools that will be used are static and dynamic
laser light scattering. An investigation of the vibrational dynamics of gels
using inelastic neutron scattering and Raman spectroscopy is also proposed. The
experimental work will be complemented by computer simulations of gels. This
effort should lead to a better understanding of the properties gels as
materials.
