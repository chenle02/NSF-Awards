This award provides funding for a three-year Combined Research-Curriculum
Development (CRCD) program, entitled, "A Research-Based Electromagnetics-
Circuits Curriculum for Giga-Scale Microelectronics," at the University of
Washington, under the direction of Dr. Vikram Jandhyala. The overall objective
of this project, which aims at a dramatic paradigm shift, is to combined
electromagnetic (EM) and circuits principles in a unified, hierarchical manner
in order to target high-technology areas.
