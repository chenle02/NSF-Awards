The principal investigator proposes to study a variety of problems from both a
combinatorial and a geometric viewpoint. Many of these problems concern
Thompson's group, a fascinating group which appears in varied branches of
mathematics, from logic to algebra to homotopy theory and group theory. The
principal investigator plans to explore questions ranging from amenability to
quasi-isometries of this group. Additionally, the investigator proposes to
extend prior work on quasi-isometries of lattices, working with colleagues to
finish a quasi-isometry classification of s-arithmetic lattices. This would
complete a project worked on by many geometric group theorists that has led to
the introduction of interesting new techniques. Finally, the principal
investigator plans several projects concerning convexity properties of groups.
While almost convexity is well understood, there are few examples of groups
which are not almost convex but satisfy weaker convexity conditions. She also
seeks to expand the list of classes of groups which are known to be almost
convex.

The principal investigator proposes several projects in the area of group
theory. A group is a mathematical structure, often introduced in the context of
symmetries of a particular object. Certain properties of a set of symmetries can
be extrapolated to describe abstract mathematical sets. In her research, the
investigator studies groups as geometric objects, using the geometry to give
greater insight into abstract properties. The investigator studies closely one
particular group, named Thompson's group after the researcher who first defined
it. Thompson's group can be understood geometrically using pairs of binary
trees, an approach which relates this group to questions in theoretical computer
science. Thus it provides an interesting interdisciplinary application of
abstract mathematics. Additionally, Thompson's group is a favorite example or
counter-example to many questions in mathematics. There are many open questions
about this group which interest an international group of mathematicians. In
particular, the geometry of this group is not well understood, a question which
interests the investigator greatly. Mathematicians have a standard way of
describing a "picture" of a group, which is sometimes difficult to construct.
For certain groups, it is possible to ask a computer to construct this picture.
The principal investigator is interested in exploring an algorithmic property of
some groups, called almost convexity, which allows computer construction of the
group.
