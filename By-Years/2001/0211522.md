In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Bowen will use negative ion photoelectron spectroscopy to
investigate the stabilization of otherwise unstable anions by solvation and by
counter ions, gas-phase double Rydberg anions, excess electron states in
clusters including dipole-bound cluster anions and cluster analogs, and bio-
molecular anions and their complexes.

This project deals with several issues of contemporary physical chemistry, which
impact on related fields and on biochemistry. The work will provide molecular
level description of important condensed phase phenomena, including those in
biological entities. The work will be assisted by graduate and undergraduate
students and by postdoctoral research associates. In an active outreach program
the work is also presented to middle school students to give them a feel of
ongoing forefront scientific research.
