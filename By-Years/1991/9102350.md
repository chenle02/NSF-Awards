This applicant proposes to study regulation of DNA replication and transcription
in eukaryotic cells. More specifically, the work will employ biochemistry and
molecular biology techniques to focus on the effects of the phosphoprotein p53
on the replication and transcription processes. The work is planned to take
place in the laboratory of Dr. Carol Prives at Columbia University.
