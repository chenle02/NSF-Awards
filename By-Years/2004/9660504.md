*** 9660504 Waupotitsch This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
will develop proof-of-concept geometric mathematical software tools to allow for
the incremental reconstruction and control of surfaces and volumes generated
from arbitrary point set data. The tools will incorporate novel methods for
geometric modeling based on a combination of concepts from combinatorial
topology and computational geometry. Current methods of surface reconstruction
have found limited use due to a number of factors, including slow data
processing, the introduction of approximation errors, and the requirement that
data sets be well behaved. If successful, this project will result in the
development of an elegant and compact solution to automatic surface and volume
reconstruction and model simplification which is free of these limitations. The
ability to accurately and automatically reconstruct or model the surface and
volume of objects defined by an unstructured set of points has the potential to
fundamentally impact a number of major economic sectors including the CAD/CAM,
animation, and biological and medical modeling industries .***
