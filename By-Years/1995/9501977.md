The goal of this project is to develop reasonable complexity, source independent
coding algorithms. Source independent algorithms are crucial to the design of
robust systems for applications such as image coding and mobile communications.
In applications of this type, the statistics of the source and channel in
operation are typically unknown a priori, and the performance of the strategy
employed is sensitive to those unknown statistics. The approach taken is the
two-stage approach developed in the source coding literature. Given a space of
possible sources and a particular coding strategy (e.g., VQ, DCT-based transform
codes, etc.), for each source in the space there exists an optimal code.
Designing a single code is equivalent to quantizing the space of possible codes
to 0 bits; the entire space of optimal codes is approximated by a single code
that does well on average across the data. The two-stage coding literature
demonstrates that in general we should quantize the space of possible codes more
finely. Some of the rate should be spent on describing which code, in a family
of codes, should be used on the source in operation. Specific projects being
completed in this research include the development of a universal DCT code
compatible with existing JPEG and MPEG image and video coding standards, a
universal KLT code, a universal wavelet packet code, and a universal channel
code. The main objectives of the education plan are to develop and maintain an
exciting atmosphere of active learning for undergraduate and graduate students.
This objective is being accomplished through innovative programs geared at
helping students to participate fully in their own education and by developing
an atmosphere that encourages the maximum possible exchange between students,
faculty, and members of local industry.
