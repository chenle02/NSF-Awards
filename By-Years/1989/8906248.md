The research concerns the development and analysis of algorithms for computing
the stationary probabilities of large scale Markov chains on modern
multiprocessor computers. The computation of stationary probabilities for large
scale problems is a fundamental concern in a wide variety of applications such
as computer modeling, computer performance evaluation, queueing networks, and
more generally, in applications where discrete mathematical models are used to
understand the dynamics of very large systems comprised of a collection of
loosely coupled subsystems. Parallel and vector implementations on a variety of
multiprocessor computers will be emphasized and specific techniques under
investigation include subspace iteration methods; hybrid iterative-direct
algorithms; overlapping block iterative schemes; parallel aggregation and
iteration methods; and block elimination algorithms. The architectural aspect of
the work involves the identification of those features of contemporary vector
and parallel computers which are best suited for implementing these techniques,
and in this regard, a variety of machines, including the Alliant FX/series, the
Sequent Balance, and the CRAY Y-MP will continue to be used.
