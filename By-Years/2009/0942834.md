As nanotechnology grows it is imperative for developing engineers/scientists to
receive an education that includes cutting-edge interdisciplinary topics,
including advanced topics and concepts. This project is addressing these goals
by developing an interdisciplinary Nanophotonics hands-on laboratory course
(with embedded introductory lectures) at the upper-class undergraduate level.
The project introduces the concepts of nanophotonics with an inter-disciplinary
team of faculty from the College of Engineering by developing and co-teaching a
sequence of junior level courses which tie into the College of Engineering's
research-based Senior Design Projects. With the addition of this program, upper-
level undergraduates who are excited by the introduction to nanotechnology at
the freshman and sophomore levels now have an opportunity to experience
nanotechnology in a hands-on laboratory experience. This project creates a
continuum of nanotechnology educational opportunities from the freshman year
through the Senior Capstone experience.
