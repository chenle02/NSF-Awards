This is a project to process and analyze data multichannel seismic data
collected off the Newfoundland Basin as part of a collaborative project studying
non-volcanic, conjugate margin evolution. This work will better define drilling
targets of ODP Leg 210, the last leg of the ODP. The additional work includes:
1) detailed characterization of enigmatic crust seaward of continental crust on
the SCREECH transect; 2) pre-stack depth migration of SCREECH transect 2; 3)
correlation of stratigraphic horizons on Newfoundland and Iberia using waveform
inversion; 4) gravity modeling and calculation of mass anomalies; 5) development
of a depth-domain stratigraphic and structural database that will be used to
model Newfoundland-Iberia margin evolution and 6) collaboration with colleagues
working on both margins to develop unified models of margin evolution.
