This is a proposal to develop a model of the magnetic field variability in the
Antarctic region. Over a wide range of time scales (fractions of minutes to days
and months) the magnetic field is determined by currents in the magnetosphere
and polar ionosphere and responds to changes in the interplanetary medium.
Measurements of the field are provided through magnetometers at thirteen
locations on the Antarctic, and can be complemented by lower-latitude
measurements in the auroral zone. Two types of inputs to the model are the solar
wind/IMF parameters, representing the interplanetary state, and the Southern
Polar Cap geomagnetic index (PCS), representing the regional magnetospheric
state. The first will be used to develop a dynamic model, first in a linear and
then a nonlinear implementation. The second will be used to map the effective
area of the PCS, and examine the magnetic substructure. Results from these
methodologies will be compared against results from the Northern polar cap where
we continue to upgrade such modeling and forecasting approaches, in the form of
conjugacy studies. Comparisons of the dynamic models in the two polar caps with
MHD simulation runs will be undertaken to determine the correspondence of the 3D
current structure to its geomagnetic signature on the ground, and improve the
interpretation of the latter's spatial and temporal features. Part of the
broader impact of this proposal is an improvement to a space weather model being
developed for the Northern hemisphere. This is in part a collaboration with the
Finnish Meteorological Institute in the context of the Electric Power Research
Institute's Sunburst project. In terms of education and knowledge transfer,
elements from the model development will be used in lectures and seminars in the
Knowledge Transfer group of the Center for Integrated Space Weather Modeling.
