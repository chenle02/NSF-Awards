This award supports the development of a facility at Black Hills State
University that would be utilized by various experiments going into the Deep
Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory. As an above-ground screening
facility, collaborations would have easy access to the proposed equipment for
training and for pre-screening of materials so that time underground could be
used more efficiently. This award will support the development of a trace gas
analyzer that exceeds the limits of commercially available systems by a factor
of ten improvement in sensitivity, allowing one to detect impurities down to the
sub-ppb level as required. This instrument will be vital to the success of the
next generation of large noble-liquid-based detectors.

Among the Broader Impacts, this proposal will provide opportunities for
undergraduate and graduate students from Idaho and South Dakota and surrounding
areas, including under-represented Native American students, to participate in
world-class international experiments in the exciting setting of underground
particle physics. Students will acquire skills such as the use of background
monitoring systems and detector calibration techniques, and will learn computer
skills involving data analysis methods.
