9732615&lt;br/&gt;Sanford&lt;br/&gt;This proposal ("Numerical Modeling of
Motional Induction in the Ocean") supports a collaboration between the PI,
Thomas Sanford and a postdoc, Robert Tyler, from the University of Washington in
a cooperative research project with Josef Oberhuber at the Center for Climate
Research in Hamburg, Germany. The research will create the first general three-
dimensional time-dependent model capable of calculating the general global
ocean-generated electromagnetic fields. The model will be developed by extending
a sophisticated model already developed by Oberhuber's group. Simulations will
study the non-local and transient ocean-generated electromagnetic fields, which
will help with interpreting current data on ocean flows; study the global
electromagnetic fields generated by ocean tides; use the model to describe the
variability and distribution of magnetic fields generated by low-frequency ocean
variability; and use the model to assess the potential for using satellite
magnetic surveys to monitor ocean variability.&lt;br/&gt;
