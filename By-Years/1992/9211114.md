A major challenge in neural network research is to build models that are simple
enough for analysis but describe the biological behavior of the network and can
be tested experimentally. Recent experimental and theoretical studies of small
neural networks make the building of such models possible. In the proposed
research we will build a detailed biological model of the pyloric Central
Pattern Generator of the lobster. This model will be an extended version of the
Hodgkin-Huxley model which includes the important currents and synaptic
connections. Using methods from dynamical system theory and physical
approximation we will obtain a simpler model which still describes the
experimental results. A phase model will be developed from the full model. The
effects of synaptic modification and changes of intrinsic properties of the
neurons will be tested, and the effect of neurotransmitters will be
investigated. The theoretical study will combine analytical and numerical
methods from neural network and dynamical system theory, numerical simulations
and will be compared to neurobiological experiments. The research will
contribute to bridging the gap between regular neural network models and the
biological reality.
