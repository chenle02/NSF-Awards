9355740 Ponzio The Youth Experiences in Science (YES) Project of the 4-H Center
at UC, Davis will produce, pilot and evaluate an informal science education
curriculum expressly designed for 5-9 year olds in school-age child care (SACC)
settings. Seven thematic units will be developed (three in both English and
Spanish versions), utilizing the basic design process and instructional model
developed in the earlier SERIES Project. Each unit consists of engaging hands-on
activities performed with inexpensive materials and incorporating home and
neighborhood service applications. During the three years approximately 500
teenage volunteers will deliver the program to approximately 2,500 children
through a network of existing SACC sites operated by 4-H and other community
groups. Capitalizing on SACC settings, the program will collaborate with schools
and reach out to parents through development of "Science Family Backpacks" and
"Science Family Activity Nights." Program evaluation includes in-depth
monitoring and use of multiple assessment instruments and measures at 25
selected sites. In addition to formative and summative evaluation, data will be
available on parent involvement and the amount, nature, and durability of
positive influences on participants' school science interest and success. ***
