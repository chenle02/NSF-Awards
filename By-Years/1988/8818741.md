Space plasma simulation techniques are proposed to study magnetospheric
dynamics. A major research effort will be in the study of shock waves and
discontinuities. Kinetic theory approach will be used to investigate dissipative
processes in the intermediate shocks. These newly discovered intermediate shocks
and their time-dependent properties will be studies for application to
reconnection processes in the dayside magnetopause boundary layer. A multigrid
numerical scheme will be developed for the global study of the magnetopause
boundary layer. This model will be determine the role of Kelvin Helmholtz
instability. A unified model of the particle acceleration and wave emission in
the auroral zone will be developed. The model will explain the processes by
which the ion beam energy in the plasma sheet boundary layer couples to the
nonlinear phenomena (double layers and electrostatic shocks) in the auroral
zone.
