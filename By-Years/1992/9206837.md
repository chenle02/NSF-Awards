This instrumentation development project will develop an acoustic data/command
link for complex hydrographic profiling and related underwater hardware. It
builds upon extensive work at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution on acoustic
telemetry and an acoustic modem that has resulted from these efforts. The
acoustic data link is intended to replace or augment the standard data
communications link that utilizes conducting wires within the oceanographic
cable suspending the CTD package. Given the large number of hydrographic
stations planned for Global Ocean studies and the potential for data loss
resulting from broken conducting cables, a back-up acoustic data link providing
real-time information to the ship, would be highly beneficial. The new data link
would also have application on ships of opportunity when standard oceanographic
cables are not available. The proposed system would also be compatible with
control systems and data loggers in use at other institutions.
