Clinch Valley College requests support from NSF for connection of its campus
network to VERnet. VERnet is the midlevel network located in the state of
Virginia. VERnet will provide operations management and information services and
it will give Roanoke College connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45
million bits per second) National Backbone network. The College needs greater
functionality and network speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries,
and make file transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail
system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link. This is also a
unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative educational resources.
