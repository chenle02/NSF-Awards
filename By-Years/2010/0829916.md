EMT jNANO: Computing with Protein-Based Associative Memory
Processors&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract: The promise of new architectures and
more cost-effective miniaturization has prompted interest in molecular
computing. One such architecture is based on the development of associative
memory processors using appropriate proteins. Prototypes of this architecture
are currently in use for applications such as fingerprinting and image matching.
The.commercial success and future development of protein-based associative
memory processors (PBAMPs) hinges, to a large part, on expanding the realm of
successful applications. No systematic study of the capabilities and limitations
of these processors has been conducted especially in relation to the digital
computers. In this project the investigators take up this
study.&lt;br/&gt;Present day computational algorithms are limited in part by the
lack of optimal memory architectures. While serial memories have been highly
optimized, memories which provide associative access are both expensive and
provide only modest data storage capacity. ProteinÂ¬based memory architectures
provide for both large scale (three-dimensional) storage as well as associative
processing. The bacteriorhodopsin protein with its unique light-activated
photocycle, nanoscale size, and natural resistance to harsh environmental
conditions, provides for protein-based memories that have a comparative
advantage over magnetic and optical data storage devices. Protein based memory
matrices are reusable and eco-friendly. In addition, the bacteriorhodopsin
protein exhibits increased thermal, chemical and photochromic stability. Protein
storage devices are capable of storing large amounts of data (1011_1013 bits) in
a small volume of the memory medium. Bacteriorhodopsin-based storage media are
portable, radiation-hardened, waterproof, and EMP-resistant. In this project
advances will be made in optimizing protein based memories as well.
