An investigation of time-dependent deformation employing both computer modelling
and experiments will be conducted on pure metals and the intermetallic compound,
nickel aluminide (Ni 3AL). The research will include studies of the cell
structures developed during deformation in terms of the elastic properties of
individual dislocations and the development of a constitutive model for plastic
flow, including flow kinetics, strain hardening, static and dynamic recovery.
The overall aim of this work is to develop a model which is capable of
describing the basic characteristics of both low and high temperature
deformation.
