Many countries around the world use tax incentives to influence firm decisions,
aiming to promote innovation and productivity as well as to create economic
stability. This research exploits a novel data set and provides a new way to
precisely measure how firms respond to two different kinds of tax incentives.
The investigators analyze the effects of a large fiscal incentive for R&amp;D
investment in the form of a corporate income tax cut. The investigators also
examine the impact of value-added tax (VAT) reform on firm fixed asset
investment and assess its role as a counter-cyclical fiscal stimulus during the
financial crisis. The results of this project will give us new evidence on how
private enterprises respond to changes in tax policy, and will help us to
evaluate the long-run forces that have resulted large changes in challenges to
U.S. leadership in global innovation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
consists of two related projects on fiscal incentives and firm growth. The first
project exploits unique features of the Chinese corporate income tax incentives,
which generate jumps in firm's payoff function. This project then implements a
cross-sectional "bunching" estimator that is novel in the R&amp;D literature.
Building on this policy variation and panel data, the investigators use a new
estimator of casual effect to further quantify the effects of the tax program on
firm productivity and on fiscal costs. The investigators also structurally
estimate the model to match the data bunching patterns and the treatment
effects. The second project considers changing from production-based VAT to
consumption-based VAT, thus allowing the direct deduction of new fixed asset
investment from VAT and substantially reducing the user cost of capital. The
investigators exploit variations in the timing of the policy roll out in
different regions and industries to quantify the response of firm investment to
the fiscal stimulus. This project then leverages on the rich heterogeneity of
micro-level data to identify how these responses differ across firms.
