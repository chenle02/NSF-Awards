A complex array of both abiotic and biotic factors interact to structure marine
and lacustrine benthic communities. Many ecologists consider the role of
predators important to the understanding of how natural communities work. Stream
ecologists, however, do not agree on the importance of predation to stream
communities. Some studies find direct and indirect effects if predators, while
others find no effects at all. The disagreement may arise because of differences
in the flow regimes of the streams and habitats studied by different
researchers. This study focuses on temporal variation in the importance of fish
predation to stream benthic community structure and how spates and isolation of
stream pools interact with predation. Mesocosms and in situ manipulative
experiments will be used to experimentally test the importance of fish predation
in streams during different seasons. The major objectives are 1. to measure
seasonal changes in the effects of predatory fish on benthic communities; and 2.
to calculate the importance of predation relative to spates in determining
community structure throughout a year. These data will help further our
understanding of the importance of top predators in streams.
