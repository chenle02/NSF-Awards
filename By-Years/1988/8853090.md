Jacksonville University will purchase a spectrum analyzer system, an optical
spectrometer, a photopolarimeter, a fiber optics system, components for a
Michelson interferometer, and a portable personal computer. This equipment will
be used to improve instruction through the implementation of a new laboratory
course in electro-optics for upper-division physics majors. A unique feature of
this program will be the construction of some of the equipment for the course by
advanced students as special projects. Jacksonville University will match the
NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
