This project supports an innovative curriculum improvement in this institution's
undergraduate mechanical engineering program. With the equipment funded by this
awards, students are able to design their own experiements in mechanical
measurements and instrumentation, incorporating computer data acquisition and
analysis as part of the laboratory experience. The equipment included in the
measurements lab includes: analog/digital conversion system, data acquisition
system, oscilloscopes, flow measurement system, temperature and humidity
measurement system, linear displacement system,velocity and acceleration
measurement system, roataional, load and torque measurement system. This award
is being matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
