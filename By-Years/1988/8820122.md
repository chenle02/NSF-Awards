The Southern Technology Council will hold a 2-day working meeting to review its
agenda for improving the S&T capabilities of the South. Some of the issues that
will be addressed are: o The extent to which regional cooperation is possible
among universities and colleges and how that would improve the quality of
research, and what process to use. o Means of improving the diffusion of
technologies to small and medium-sized businesses; o Ways to encourage greater
participation of women and minorities in scientific and technolical programs and
careers. o Means for improving education for scientific and technical careers
and work. o Mechanisms to assess the impacts of technology on the environment,
the economy, and the people. The result will be a detailed plan and a statement
of regional objectives for Science and Technology that will be presented to the
Southern Growth Policies Board for review and implementation.
