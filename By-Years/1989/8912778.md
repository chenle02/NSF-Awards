This project aims to investigate the application of proof-theoretic techniques
to problems in the operational semantics of true (non- interleaving)
concurrency. The research will explore a fruitful relationship between Petri
nets and linear logic theories which gives rise to a correspondence between net
token games and linear proof trees. This correspondence makes it possible to see
that algorithms and theorems from the proof theory of linear logic can be
applied to problems in net theory and, conversely, that results about nets have
consequences for provability in fragments of linear logic. For example, standard
proof-theoretic concepts such as cut elimination give rise to algorithms for
increasing the concurrency in an execution sequence on a net. On the other hand,
the decidability of forward markings on nets can be used to show decidability
for a significant collection of linear logic formulas. Concepts such as the
interpretation of logical theories and conservative extension may be useful in
understanding abstraction for nets. Moreover, it is hoped that this idea for
understanding concurrency in proof trees will lead to the discovery of other
interesting models of concurrency.
