Planning Grant for an I/UCRC in Space Power and
Propulsion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0832399 University of Michigan, Ann Arbor; Alec
Gallimore&lt;br/&gt;0832434 Michigan Technological University; Lyon King (lead
institute)&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;University of Michigan and Michigan
Technological University propose a planning grant for a collaborative center
"I/UCRC in Space Power and Propulsion" to pursue research in areas including
launch vehicles, in-space propulsion, energy generation, energy storage, and
energy processing. The program is motivated by the increasing penetration of
commercial applications in the space industry. The intellectual merit of this
proposal lies in the development of new methods and standards for terrestrial
testing of space craft. By standardizing testing techniques, new designs can be
more readily benchmarked and failure rates can be predicted with less time in
testing. By improving standards for measuring ground test facility capability
and consistency of measurement, industry will be better able to judge the merits
of tested designs and accept them with greater confidence.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed center in collaboration with two universities
and endorsed by several government agencies and industries, if successful, will
facilitate the research development to support the US satellite communication
and aerospace industries. This research will help maintain U.S. strategic
competitiveness in space power and propulsion. Once the center has been
established, the PIs will seek to broaden the research expertise by recruiting
other universities and members. Both universities have also institutionalized
programs to recruit, educate, and retain under-represented groups.
