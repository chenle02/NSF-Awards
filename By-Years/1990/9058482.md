Dr. Craig Martens is supported by a Presidential Young Investigator Grant from
the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to study vibrational
dynamics and energy transfer in many-body chemical systems. Martens will develop
computer simulation techniques which are important for a more fundamental
molecular dynamical interpretation of chemical reactions. Martens will apply
molecular dynamics approaches to chemical systems ranging in complexity from
isolated polyatomic molecules and clusters to complex condensed phases such as
molecular liquids. He will study ultrafast vibrational energy transfer and
relaxation in such systems which can be strongly nonstatistical, involving
special degrees of freedom and favored pathways. Martens plans to employ a
powerful new mathematical tool known as "phase space reconstruction" to extract
collective modes of many-body systems from numerical experiments. This technique
will allow him to detect, characterize, and visualize relevant many-body
collective coordinates.
