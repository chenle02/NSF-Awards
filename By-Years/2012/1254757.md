The objective of this program is to develop large-area, low-cost organic field-
effect transistors and organic photovoltaics with unprecedented performance and
reproducibility. This goal will be achieved by using single-crystals to design
and implement novel materials and device architectures. Results obtained on
charge injection and transport will enable engineering of these high performance
devices by spray-deposition. The intellectual merit inheres in (1) exploring the
intrinsic properties of soluble small-molecule organic semiconductors in single-
crystal form, (2) incorporating successful candidates in spray-deposited
devices, and (3) optimizing their performance by controlling film uniformity and
device structure. Nondestructive contact deposition techniques will be used with
high mobility semiconductors and with dielectrics promoting reduced operating
voltages. Exploring the interplay between processing details and the resulting
contact effects, film microstructure and charge transport will provide feedback
for developing better devices. The project is transformational in devising a
unique platform to answer questions about charge transport in technologically
relevant materials, being the first to use single crystals of materials
compatible with solution-deposition techniques. The broader impacts are aligned
with the anticipated importance of organic electronics to our economic progress;
project results will advance high-performance devices that spark a new
technology. In addition, graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students will
gain knowledge and skill sets spanning crystal growth, device design,
fabrication and characterization. Infrastructure and results will be integrated
in a new course and outreach programs at the local science museum. The PI will
persuade girls that science careers are exciting and possible.
