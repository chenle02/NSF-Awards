Funds are provided to support an investigation of the phenomena that take place
when fluids are injected into a high vacuum an area in which there have been
very few quantitative studies which is surprising since there are a large number
of scientific and commercial applications of these phenomena. The study proposed
here is directed at developing a quantitative understanding of the interactions
between the fluid mechanics, cavitation and surface characteristics of liquid
streams injected into a high vacuum. The work involves experiments in unique
facilities that have been designed for this type of study, along with sufficient
analyses and modelling to accomplish the purposes of developing a quantitative
understanding of the phenomena.
