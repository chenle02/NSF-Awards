This research project is designed to reconstruct the economy of societies using
Topara ceramics in the lower Pisco valley of Peru. It will build on a survey at
the site of Chongos conducted by the student in 1985 and is the first study of
habitation sites and economic activities of these transitional societies of the
Formative.Early Intermediate periods (ca. 200 BC). The research will also focus
on the regional interaction between sites and between cultures in the region.
While the south central coast of Peru has been the subject of outstanding
chronological work, only recently has work focusing on living sites been
undertaken. This research project will fill gaps in the existing data base in
this area and will deal with the problem of regional variation and allow
reconstruction of the settlement pattern. It is predicted that the settlement
will be urban, a rare and importance occurrence in the southern coastal area. It
will also increase our knowledge of subsistence practices in the region. This
research will help archaeologists understand the processes of interaction
between indigenous peoples and politically and economically larger societies. It
will help show how new ideas are introduced and accepted by an indigenous
society.
