Abstract for award of Ellenberg DMS-0401616

Rational points, Galois representations, and fundamental groups

1. The investigator proposes to continue his study of traditional problems of
arithmetic geometry (bounds and asymptotics for the number of rational points on
varieties, counting number fields, computing Mordell-Weil ranks of families of
abelian varieties) by means of less traditional methods (Galois actions on
arithmetic fundamental groups, non-abelian Iwasawa theory, Batyrev-Manin
heuristics.)

2. The investigator's research is in the field of arithmetic geometry, whose
central problem is the determination of the set of solutions of equations. A
typical problem in this area is the conjecture of Fermat, which asserts that two
perfect nth powers cannot sum to another nth power. The resolution of this
conjecture by Wiles resulted from the application of deep geometric methods to
this seemingly arithmetic problem; the investigator's research, similarly,
centers on the application of modern geometry to questions about equations and
their solutions in integers.
