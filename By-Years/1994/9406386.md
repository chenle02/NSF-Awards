9406386 DeWilde Cabrini College requests support from NSF for connection of its
campus network to PREPnet. PREPnet is the midlevel network located in the state
of Pennsylvania. PREPnet will provide operations management and information
services and it will give Cabrini College connection to the NSFNET, a high speed
(1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone network. The College needs
greater functionality and network speed to be able to access supercomputers,
libraries, and make file transfers along with being able to implement a more
reliable mail system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.
This is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative
educational resources.
