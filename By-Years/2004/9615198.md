Abstract 9615198 Deshler The annual stratospheric ozone hole above Antarctica
is driven by chlorine compounds which interact on the surfaces of the polar
stratospheric clouds which form during the polar winter. It is for this reason
that the hole appears in the austral spring and that ozone depletion is much
more severe in polar regions than elsewhere. This investigation provides
detailed information on the actual cloud particles and the distribution of the
clouds and the ozone by using balloon borne instruments. The measurements will
provide vertical profiles of both the PSCs and ozone, size distributions of the
PSC particles and some information on their composition and physical state
(liquid or solid). The project is enhanced by cooperation with an Italian
investigator who operates a lidar system in McMurdo. The project contributes to
the WMO/UNEP Network for the Detection of Stratospheric Change and the Global
Change Initiative. ***
