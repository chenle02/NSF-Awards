The goals of the Barotropic Electro-Magnetic and Pressure Experiment (BEMPEX)
were to determine the different forcing functions and barotropic response of the
ocean at subinertial time scales. These include atmospheric pressure variations,
low frequency vorticity waves and sub-diurnal tides. With this work, the EM
measurements are going to be compared with bottom pressure and water column
current measurements. An understanding of the low wavenumber barotropic modes is
essential to interpret altimetry data.
