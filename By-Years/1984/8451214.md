This study aims to investigate techniques for verifying or gaining confidence in
the correctness of logical descriptions of digital circuits. The approach is
based on verifying the correspondence between a logic diagram and a register-
transfer level description by means of symbolic simulation, or some mixture of
symbolic and actual simulation. The study implements such a verification system
(probably on a LISP-based workstation) and then evaluates algorithms for the
various tasks that it entails (such as logic minimization). Research continues
on routing of integrated circuits when certain routing layers are strongly
preferred over others.
