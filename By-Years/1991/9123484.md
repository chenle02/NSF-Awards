This award supports Professor Martin A. Uman and several junior members of his
research group at the University of Florida to collaborate in a study of the
behavior of lightning with Professor Michel Ianoz and others of the Laboratory
of Electrical Energy Research, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne,
Switzerland. They will carry out research in the modeling of return strokes and
the applications of these models to horizontal power line coupling of close
lightning strokes. The research plan expands and enhances Dr. Uman's ongoing
cooperative research with this group and others at the Universities of Bologna
and Rome, Italy. It makes use of measurements obtained by the U.S. and Swiss
research groups at the NASA Kennedy Space Center in 1991, using Swiss equipment.
The collaborators also plan to collect more data from further joint experiments.
This research will advance basic knowledge about lightning and its possible
electromagnetic interactions. Its applications are of particular importance to
electric power distribution systems in the United States and elsewhere. It links
three very strong research groups and provides an outstanding training
opportunity for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in Dr. Uman's
research group at the University of Florida.
