The interaction of major strike-slip faults and regional low- angle detachment
faults in extending terranes is of considerable interest. This renewal project
focuses on the Kingston Range detachment fault and associated plutons that is
located near the enigmatic eastern terminus of the Garlock fault, and involves
additional field mapping and laboratory analysis in the Shadow Mountains area.
Results will document the complex stratigraphic and structural relationships
between crustal extension, high-level synkinematic plutonism, and extension-
related terrestrial sedimentation.
