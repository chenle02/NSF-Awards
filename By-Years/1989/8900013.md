Mid-ocean ridges are the site of volcanic activity as the new ocean crust is
generated. An important question about this activity is whether as it ascends
the magma collects in a chamber below the axis of the ridge, and if so, what is
the size and extent of the chamber. Recent seismic data collected on the East
Pacific Rise show a reflector that has been interpreted as the top of a magma
chamber. This reflector is present on along-axis and cross-axis profiles. At
locations where the ridge axis is relatively broad and flat the reflector is 3-4
km wide while in locations where the ridge axis is narrow and rough the
reflector is less than 1 km wide. The objective of this project is to determine
if the observed difference in the width of the reflector is due indeed to a
difference in the width of the magma chamber or might instead be due to
refraction and diffraction of the seismic energy by the seafloor. The principal
investigator will reanalyze the seismic data using a technique that can account
for energy refractiona and diffraction at the seafloor.
