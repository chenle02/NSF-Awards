The principal investigator proposes fundamental, experimental, and modelling
approaches to pneumatic transport to provide a firmer basis for scale-up and
more efficient operation. The independent variables to be explored
experimentally are: geometry (vertical, horizontal and inclined test sections of
1, 2, and 4-inch diameter pipes); particle size (2-1000 microns); particle
densities (1000-7600 kg/m); and different flow rates. The following dependent
variables are to measured: particle velocity, power spectral density function of
the particle velocity sensor for cluster sizing, pressure fluctuation, pressure
distribution along the circumference of the pipe, pressure drop, and visual
observations which will be recorded on videotape. This basic information will be
utilized in a modeling effort to interpret the findings and project scale-up.
