This research is aimed at developing on-line identification and adaptive
control strategies for food extrusion. A twin-screw food extruder will be used.
A general process model structure will be determined in the form of auto-
regressive moving-average model with auxiliary inputs. Multi-variable self-
tuning regulator algorithms will be developed for regular operations based on
the generalized predictive control technique. Model reference adaptive control
algorithms will be developed for transient operations. This research is one of
the very first applications of adaptive control in food processes. It is also
among the first applications of multi-variable identification and adaptive
control theories in a real process. The aim is to advance the theories and
enrich the adaptive control literature. It can significantly improve the
extrusion process and the quality of numerous foods. It may introduce new
technologies to the manufacturing industry.
