The intent of this project is to integrate the use of computers and associated
technology into the introductory physics courses in order to 1) assist students
in becoming more competent in the use of these powerful tools in the laboratory
and their homework, 2) improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the teaching
of physics and 3) to increase the insights into and understanding of physics by
students by involving them in the more computational and model
building/simulation aspects of physics.The goals are being accomplished through
the establishment of a network of laboratory workstations connected to a
file/print server and printers. This network is also connected to a lecture
teaching station, instructor stations, and an existing local area network. The
laboratory stations are supplied with hardware and software to support data and
graphical analysis, analog and image data acquisition, report generation,
tutorials and a problem/question database. The students do experiments designed
to teach them competency in the use of these tools for analysis and increase
their understanding of physics concepts. The teaching station supports the
display of large static images, high resolution dynamic images, interactive
videodisc and videotape as well as conversion of computer images to videotape.
