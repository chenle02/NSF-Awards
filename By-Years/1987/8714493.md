The research focuses on type of circuit timing simulation, which can do variable
accuracy analysis (at the discretion of the user). This approach to timing
simulation has potential to provide design engineers with faster and more
accurate simulation of circuit design. The research is on-going work on an
integrated circuit timing simulator prototype called SPEC82. This prototype
simulator is tree/link based, event-driven and uses charge and energy conserving
table models for device characterization. It has shown encouraging results in
speed and accuracy of simulation. Research is in improving capabilities of
SPEC82 through accommodation of more devices, generalized macro- modeling,
spread time-constant control, and adaptive error control. Benchmark tests will
be run on the improved SPEC82 simulator.
