Live Updates of Scientifc Workflows&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Computer systems are being applied to increasingly
demanding cross disciplinary applications. The environments in which they
function and the resources they manage &lt;br/&gt;are gradually more diverse,
distributed and dynamic. This is particularly observed for &lt;br/&gt;biomedical
applications where the need for flexible, dynamic, data intensive
computing&lt;br/&gt;functionalities are substancially critical. This revolution
of modern medicine requires &lt;br/&gt;novel and efficient approaches to support
resource integration and scientific workflows&lt;br/&gt;(SWF) that capture,
analyze, retrieve, integrate, and produce molecular information
&lt;br/&gt;including biological specimens derived from tissue, cells, or blood
combined with&lt;br/&gt;medical records or clinical trial data. Such workflows
are increasingly used in e-science&lt;br/&gt;discovery and are characterized by
frequent changes that are part of the scientific &lt;br/&gt;discovery process.
The research develops a uniform approach to support live updates of
&lt;br/&gt;scientific workflows accessing distributed resources. The goal of
live updates is to allow &lt;br/&gt;continuous execution in the presence of
changes. The research supports updates of &lt;br/&gt;both the structure and
nature of SWFs processes and the data they access and create&lt;br/&gt;(produce
and consume). The research divides the live update problem for SWFs into
four&lt;br/&gt;main technical aims: software update, persistent storage update,
workflow update, and &lt;br/&gt;evaluation and testing. It develops the
mechanisms for updates as well as automatic &lt;br/&gt;checks for the safety of
a planned update. The research impacts information-based&lt;br/&gt;drug
discovery and development, and healthcare decision support
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
