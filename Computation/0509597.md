Many problems in science and engineering are modelled by large systems of
differential equations. It is the purpose of the research described in this
proposal to design and implement accurate, efficient, reliable, and robust
methods for the numerical simulations of such systems. These methods should be
capable of exploiting special structure often present in such systems to
increase the computational efficiency. Examples of such systems with special
structure include many problems in computational fluid dynamics, molecular
biology, quantum mechanics, and heat transfer, and their numerical solution
requires new more powerful numerical techniques than the classical methods. The
novel techniques which will be investigated in this proposal are based on the
recent theory of general linear methods and on exponential integrators which
treat differently specific parts of the differential systems. Some of the
proposed schemes are appropriate for implementation in a parallel computing
environment.
