This award provides partial funding to allow US students to attend the 19th
International Conference on Atomic Physics (ICAP XIX), which will be held in Rio
de Janeiro, Brazil from July 25th to the 30th. ICAP is the pre-eminent
international conference on atomic, molecular and optical (AMO) physics,
bringing together leading researchers from around the world. ICAP is held every
two years in a country that has a strong presence in the atomic physics
community. By providing the opportunity for students to attend the conference,
the support from the National Science Foundation will potentially foster
collaborations between the United States and foreign scientist at their earliest
career stages, something that can seed long lasting exchanges for the leaders of
atomic physics in the future. Funding for this award is provided by the Physics
Division and by the NSF Office of International Programs.
