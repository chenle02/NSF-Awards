This research will consider finitely generated torsionfree modules over
coordinate rings of affine algebraic varieties, particularly surfaces and three-
folds. The principal investigator will obtain a theory of direct-sum
cancellation for these modules and will apply it to specific cancellation
problems. This will be accomplished by classifying all indecomposable finitely
generated torsionfree modules over surfaces with only rational double points as
singularities and by obtaining invariants for direct sums of these modules. This
research is in the general area of commutative algebra and is concerned with the
structure theory of modules and cancellation problems. This work is an
interesting combination of techniques from classical module theory and geometry.
The questions that will be examined are deep and important. The outcome of this
project will be of interest to the mathematical community.
