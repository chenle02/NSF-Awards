9312167 Freed In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of
the Chemistry Division, Freed will pursue electron spin resonance (ESR) studies
of the dynamics of free radicals in fluids, on surfaces, and in related systems.
New relaxation and structural techniques will be used, and the necessary
theoretical frameworks for understanding these experiments will be developed and
extended. Two-dimensional Fourier transform (2D-FT) ESR, 2D-FT electron-electron
double resonance (2D-ELDOR), spin-echo correlation spectroscopy (SECSY)-ESR ,
dynamic imaging of diffusion (DID)-ESR , and far-infrared (FIR) ESR are among
the techniques to be used. %%% In this project Freed will develop several new
techniques for electron spin resonance (ESR) which closely parallel new
techniques in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). These new methods will allow ESR
to examine molecular structure and motions more readily in fluids and on
surfaces. Such studies will undoubtedly impact many areas of chemistry, biology,
and materials science. ***
