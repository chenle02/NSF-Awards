Several studies in recent years have confirmed that both the crust and upper
mantle beneath oceanic regions are anisotropic in their elastic properties. We
propose to study the nature of that anisotropy by comparisons of observed
waveforms recorded at regional and near distances with those calculated for
models of generalized anisotropy which can include up to 13 eleastic constants
and which can vary from layer to layer in magnitude and direction. By
restricting our observations to waves which have traveled short distances we
will minimize any effects of lateral heterogeneity of velocity structure on wave
forms, increase the likelihood that the orientation and magnitude of anisotropy
is uniform along that path, and, if paths of different distances are available,
may be able to separate the effects of varying anisotropic structure in the
upper crust, lower crust, and upper mantle. In addition, since short paths are
used, it will be possible to use small events which are numerous in many parts
of the Pacific.
