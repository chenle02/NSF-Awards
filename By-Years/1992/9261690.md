Current instruments for solar ultraviolet and stratospheric ozone measurements
are expensive to purchase and operate. The proposer aims to develop a low-cost
solar ultraviolet scanning spectroradiometer, suitable for moderate resolution
(1nm) measurements of solar irradiance in the UV-B spectral range, 290- 320nm.
The objectives of this instrument would be solar UV-B and column ozone
measurements for the detection of secular trends. Proposer plans to design and
construct a Seya-Namioka nonochromator in order to determine the actual light
throughput of the proposed spectroradiometer. Then the proposer will design,
construct and evaluate the semiconductor detector circuit. The proposed
instrument would be available for global monitoring of solar UV increases and
stratospheric ozone depletion.
