This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I presents a feasibility study to
commercialize a microprocessor technology that will address the challenge of
delivering power-constrained technology while still fulfilling the increased
performance needs in modern systems. Aggressive performance optimizations
enabled by reduction in feature sizes have contributed to increase of
power/energy consumption with every chip generation. The approach is based on a
tightly integrated compiler-architecture framework and provides a coherent
strategy for chip-wide energy reduction with no (or minimal) performance impact.
The focus of this is on the microarchitectural components. A key idea is to
complement traditional mechanisms in microprocessors with low energy, statically
managed access paths enabled by static information extracted at compile time. A
central thesis is that much speculative static information can be extracted that
is currently not exploited, and that this information can be leveraged in novel
statically speculative microarchitectural mechanisms to significantly reduce
energy consumption.&lt;br/&gt; The company plans to license its patented
technology in form of synthesizable and hard cores to leading equipment,
semiconductor and OEM partners worldwide who focus on applications, design, and
manufacturing. Immediate vertical markets targeted include: handhelds such as
smart phones and PDAs, wireless portable applications, and battery driven
military applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
