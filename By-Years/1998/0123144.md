&lt;br/&gt;This project supports undergraduate students in computer
science&lt;br/&gt;and mathematics through scholarships, mentoring, internships,
research experience,&lt;br/&gt;conference participation and other activities.
The project provides four scholarships each&lt;br/&gt;academic year: two for
lower division students, and two for upper division
students.&lt;br/&gt;Scholarships are awarded to students with demonstrated
financial need on the basis of&lt;br/&gt;academic record, professional promise,
and character.&lt;br/&gt;Scholarship recipients are encouraged to take advantage
of various opportunities in the Math and Computer Science Departments that will
be enhanced by this project. Students obtain professional training through
internship programs with local high technology companies, participation in
research with faculty members, and attendance at seminars and professional
meetings. Scholars receive support and mentoring by faculty, and are provided
additional activities and mentoring opportunities specially designed to meet the
needs of female students. Leadership skills are developed through community
service, teaching assignments (both within the Department and in the local
area), and administration of the annual mathematics contest for high school
students. Scholarship recipients are expected to take leadership roles in
community-building activities sponsored by the Department.&lt;br/&gt;
