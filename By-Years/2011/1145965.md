Name a species in nature, and chances are, its females use sperm from more than
one male, resulting in multiple paternity of offspring. This sperm competition
generates strong selection that drives rapid evolution of both male and female
reproductive traits and may contribute to the maintenance of species boundaries.
Despite its evolutionary importance, sperm competition has been difficult to
study within its natural environment, the female reproductive tract, because
sperm from different males are generally indistinguishable, and the female
reproductive tract is often poorly suited for microscopy. The proposed research
exploits the experimental and genetic tractability of the fruit fly, Drosophila
melanogaster, to generate 200 genetically differentiated populations whose sperm
heads express a green or red fluorescent marker. Thus, the research will
investigate how sperm variation contributes to sperm competitive success, how
sperm traits genetically vary and covary, and ask how the female's genome
contributes to her sons' sperm traits. The research will also quantify
male×male×female genetic interactions and examine how rearing environment
impacts sperm traits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will greatly
advance understanding of the complex genetics of sperm traits and of sperm-
female interactions underlying variation in reproductive success. Human
infertility diagnoses of unknown cause may be a consequence of interactions
between partners, but distinguishing potential sources of incompatibility
necessitates a detailed understanding of reproductive processes and the genetics
of reproductive success. Also, fluorescent-sperm populations generated for this
research are proving valuable in laboratories worldwide studying genetics,
development and fertilization and in educating the public about reproductive
biology.
