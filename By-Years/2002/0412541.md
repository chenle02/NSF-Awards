Robotic Insect Flight Stabilization Using Biomimetic Sensors Ronald S. Fearing

This project concerns flight control for miniature flapping wing robotic
fliers. The focus of the research will be on the use of biomimetic (inpired by
nature) sensors to stabilize the flight of an approximately one tenth gram two
wing robot. Two winged flapping fliers such as true flies provide unmatched
capability for aerial maneuverability and robustness when flying in cluttered
environments. At this small scale, conventional sensors require too much
electrical and computational power to use. This research project will study the
use of rapidly-prototyped, low-power biomimetic sensors modelled after insect
ocelli (for visual horizon sensing), halteres (for angular rate), and eyes (for
optical flow) for flight control.

Intellectual Merit:

The proposed research advances understanding in biomimetic sensors and flight
control strategies for flapping wing fliers. For insect-sized flying robots,
flapping flight provides very high maneuverability while requiring a very tight
coupling between sensors and wing actuation. This project will also lead to
better understanding of extremely low power, sensor-rich control techniques for
mobile micro-robots.

Broader Impacts:

This project will provide interdisciplinary education for undergraduate and
graduate students in biomimetic sensing and control, as well as micro-robotics.
For the broader robotics community, rapidly prototyped microsensors will be
useful on a wide variety of mobile platforms. For society, a potential broader
impact will be large numbers of low-cost, light-weight flying robots which could
robustly enter unknown and hazardous environments, potentially keeping rescue
workers out of harm's way.
