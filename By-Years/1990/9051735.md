The laboratory in microbial physiology, previously mundane and emphasizing the
memorization of metabolic pathways and structures of the bacterial cell, is
being revitalized with the purchase of two calorimeters, an oxygen electrode,
and a spectrophotometer. The calorimeters are used for teaching thermodynamics,
and the oxygen electrode and spectrophotometer are used for teaching enzymology.
Students will see that thermodynamics and enzymology can be used to solve
research problems in microbiology. Faculty benefit because of the increased
breadth and the challenge of teaching the theory and techniques. The instruments
are also to be used for undergraduate research projects which are an integral
part of the curriculum. The university will contribute an amount equal to the
award.
