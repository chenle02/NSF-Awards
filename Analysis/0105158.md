ABSTRACT

This proposal concerns the completion of several works of Thomas H. Wolff.
Wolff's recent unfinished work concerns the restriction conjecture and Kakeya
problem, Anderson models, and spectral gap properties of measures. In addition,
he was in the process of writing an introductory book for analysis students
about the restriction conjecture and Kakeya problem.

Wolff was a recognized leader in the field of harmonic analysis. He received
the 1985 Salem prize and 1999 Bocher prize for his work, as well as being
invited to speak at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1986 and
1999. Many projects were in progress at the time of his tragic death on July 31,
2000. The PI proposes to undertake supervision of their completion.
