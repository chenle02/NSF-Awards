9405167 Nowack This research is a collaboration between the University of
Illinois and Purdue University to analyze short-period and broad- band seismic
waveform data from the northwestern Pacific. Because of the complex tectonic
setting and major subduction zones in the area, pronounced variation in
lithospheric and upper mantle structure is expected near this margin. Using
high-resolution seismic waveform data, a detailed study of such variation can
place additional constraints on mantle dynamics and mineral physics. Using high-
quality seismic data from the broad-band networks, the proposed work complements
existing long-period and travel time studies in this region. ***
