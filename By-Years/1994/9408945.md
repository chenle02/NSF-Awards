9408945 Moran This Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) project involves
an opportunistic collaboration between U.S. and Canadian investigators who will
conduct a study of a suite of natural and artificial radionuclides during the
1994 U.S./Canada Arctic Ocean Section (AOS). The AOS is under the auspices of
the Arctic Systems Science (ARCSS) Global Change Research Program. The AOS is a
collaborative research effort with Canada that will involve approximately 60
scientists on a Canadian and a U.S. icebreaker during a 55-day cruise in the
summer of 1994. This project will measure Thorium isotopes in seawater to
quantify upper ocean particulate organic C and N export fluxes and deep ocean
particle cycling. In-situ pumps will be used to collect dissolved and
particulate samples for determination of radionuclides in the surface and deep
waters. Collection of these data within the framework of other multidisciplinary
efforts will lead to a better understanding of organic C and N cycling, particle
dynamics and circulation time scales in the Arctic Ocean, and will contribute to
the emerging global efforts to better understand the role of the Arctic Ocean in
global climate change.
