Assessment/Research (91)&lt;br/&gt;Engineering - Civil (54)&lt;br/&gt;The goal
of this project is to investigate student conceptual understanding in Mechanics
of Materials. The project will investigate student misconceptions and
characterize student beliefs about learning in Mechanics of Materials in order
to develop curricular materials and an instructional plan to improve student
conceptual understanding. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work builds on
research in two areas - theoretical cognitive research that explains causes for
students' conceptual difficulties, and action research that describes successful
methods for overcoming these challenges. This project addresses students'
previous beliefs about content and learning that interfere with their
development of conceptual understanding. The project is employing interview and
analysis methods that model earlier work by physics education researchers who
have shown that it is possible to change student beliefs about content and
learning in order to enable conceptual understanding. The project is also
employing proven methods for developing curriculum materials and instructional
strategies to address misconceptions and deepen conceptual understanding and
student engagement.
