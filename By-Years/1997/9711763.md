This dissertation project will draw upon institutional theory and social
movement theory to explain changes in corporations' sexual discrimination and
rights policies. The project employs a multi-method approach, blending survey
data about Fortune 1000 companies, intensive interviews with human resource
directors and gay rights activists, and a small number of case studies. The
research will examine the impact of the sociopolitical environment on
organizational policy making, the influence of industry and corporate
characteristics on such decisions, and the organizational, strategic and
cultural factors that were most influential within organizations.
