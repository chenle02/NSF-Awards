IIP 0968971&lt;br/&gt;Pennsylvania State
University&lt;br/&gt;Nembhard&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pennsylvania State
University (PSU) has recently launched the Center for Integrated Healthcare
Delivery Systems (CIHDS) and plans to join the Industry/University Cooperative
Research Center (I/UCRC) entitled "Center for Health Organization and
Transformation (CHOT)" which currently is a multi- university center comprised
of Texas A &amp; M (lead institution) and Georgia Tech. CHOT was established in
2008 to "conduct mixed methodology, applied research on the antecedents,
execution, and effects of transformational interventions and strategies that
combine evidence-based management, clinical and information technology
innovations, and on-going organizational learning and ccultural change" in
healthcare systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PSU will serve as a catalyst for
transformational change in US healthcare delivery through a focus on quality,
efficiency, and effectiveness of care processes and the integration of these
processes with health information transformation technologies into a modern
coordinated system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed site will develop
transformative approaches, demonstrate them in its partner healthcare
organizations, and disseminate evidence-based approaches to regional and
national healthcare CEOs, CFOs and CIOs. The proposed site will conduct
interdisciplinary research with the theme of healthcare process excellence.
CIHDS' core faculty have already developed a strong history of working
collaboratively across multiple units, engaging healthcare providers as partners
in applied research, and working closely with students to address research needs
of the relevant industry partners. The wide scope of participation (expected
from the potential members of the site) will enhance dissemination of results.
Dissemination is also expected to occur via professional and academic
associations and conferences, and special symposia. The proposed site plans to
engage students and partners from diverse and/or under-represented groups.
