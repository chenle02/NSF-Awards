Zahuranec SUBJECT: Bio Physical Interdisciplinary Trophic Studies (BITS 2)
Chronic undersampling of the marine environment, including both biological and
physical components has been, and remains, a major block to understanding how
the marine ecosystem functions and how it will respond to changes, whether
natural or anthropogenic. This research directly addresses this problem by
applying advanced acoustical technology to the problem of measuring spatial
distributions of zooplankton and micronekton at a mooring, and collecting
abundance and size data with a high temporal resolution over long periods. There
are three specific objectives of this research: 1) operation and maintenance of
a recently installed pilot mooring on the Southern California coast, 2)
development of a vertical profiling platform to allow collection of long time
records with high resolution of vertical fine structure in the plankton and
related biophysical variables, and 3) deployment and installation of a mooring
for studying zooplankton in the northwest Atlantic on Georges Bank as part of
GLOBEC, a component of the US Global and Climate Change initiative.
