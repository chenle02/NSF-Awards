This project by Craig Ogle of the University of North Carolina, Charlotte is
within the Organic Dynamics Program, and is aimed at a better understanding of
organolithium compounds. Organolithiums are important intermediates in the
synthesis of a wide variety of organic compounds, and this research will provide
the elucidation of their structure by a relatively new technique known as rapid
injection nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The reactivity of
alkyllithium reagents is often modified by the addition of alkoxides. Mixed
bases have been used extensively in metalations, polymerizations and
alkylations, without a clear understanding of how the reagent is being changed.
This study is aimed at providing a fundamental understanding of the mechanism of
the reaction of alkyllithiums and mixed aggregates with electrophiles; this may
lead to the development of more reactive and selective reagents. The work will
consist of the preparation and identification of mixed aggregates of
organolithiums and alkoxides of groups IA and IIA. The reactivity of these mixed
aggregates towards electrophiles and carbon acids will then be investigated by
Li-7 and H-1 rapid injection NMR. Mixed aggregates formed from the reaction of
alkyllithiums with electrophiles will also be investigated.
