Our project is developing a suite of high-quality JAVA applets that visually
simulate a variety of astrophysical phenomena. The simulations are designed for
instructional use in 100-level general education college astronomy courses, but
will be appropriate for 200-level college courses as well as advanced high
school classes. The simulations make use of the JAVA SWING library, which allows
construction of superior graphical user interfaces enabling users to
conveniently and intuitively interact with simulations.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The simulations are accompanied by extensive supporting
materials including student guides, instructor guides, background material, and
concept tests for peer instruction. These materials allow the simulations to be
used in a variety of instructional formats, including computerized laboratories,
homework assignments, and in-class demonstrations. Each applet also includes
student assessment in the form of a pre-test and a post-test in the web-based
assessment engine EDU (marketed by Brownstone Learning). This program allows
applets to be incorporated into questions so that assessment can take advantage
of applet capabilities. Instructors can request accounts for their students in
the EDU system and download statistical reports of their student's assessment
results. In addition to informing teachers and educating students, use of this
built-in assessment will gather considerable information on how students learn
from and interact with simulations. This information can be used in developing
future web-based materials. All project materials will be publicly available at
no cost on the web and also disseminated by McGraw-Hill Publishing on CD-ROM.
