This Research Opportunity Award funds a project "Deformation and Yielding
Mechanisms in Rubber-Modified PVC Blends Using Speckle and Moire Interferometry"
at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University in support of Case Western
Reserve University's Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Applied
Polymers. This two year project is reporting to the Center's Industry Advisory
Board. The mechanism of deformation and yielding in toughened polyvinylchlorine
blends with chlorinated polyethylene is being investigated. Grating objective
speckle and moire interferometry techniques are identifying regions of elastic
and plastic deformation to develop the criteria for stress-whitening based on
the components of stress on the elastic/plastic interface. The Principal
Investigators are competent and have the facilities to perform the research. The
Program Manager recommends that Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University
be awarded $99,979 for a two (2) year project.
