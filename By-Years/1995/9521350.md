Beaubien/ABSTRACT ATM-9521350 The objective of this research is the development
of a new high precision, low cost radiometer (pyrgeometer) to measure infrared
radiation in the atmosphere. Existing devices have not been improved in twenty-
five years. While the proposed radiometer adopts some current techniques and
practices of existing devices, including calibration, it also incorporates a
unique configuration, which was identified during the Phase I research.
Potential Commercial Applications: Precision infrared radiometers are used in
long term climate experiments, and these networks are often deployed on a large-
scale basis over the globe. There are also several industrial applications where
precise radiometric infrared measurements can reduce the cost of batch
manufacturing of raw materials.
