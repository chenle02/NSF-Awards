The investigator would hold a working conference to discuss how ideas are
transferred. The primary goal of this conference is to address the theoretical
and methodological issues raised by recent critiques of transfer and to develop
a research agenda to guide further empirical work. An enduring goal of education
has been to provide learning experiences that are useful beyond the specific
conditions of initial learning. However, researchers' progress in understanding
and supporting the generalization of learning has been limited due to
methodological and theoretical problems with the transfer construct. Numerous
critiques of transfer have contributed to a growing acknowledgement that there
is little agreement about the nature of transfer and the nature of its
underlying mechanisms. The intent of this conference is to reach sufficient
agreement on the theoretical and methodological issues in defining transfer so
that research can proceed productively.
