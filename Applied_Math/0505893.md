This project pursues the parallel problems of how best to dampen a vibrating
body and how to identify, from observations of a vibrating body, the dissipative
forces acting within it and upon it. Damping can be achieved through various
mechanical means, and for each of these, one seeks ways to distribute material
properties to optimally stifle vibrations. Yet optimality can be characterized
in several ways, such as the total energy caused by a worst-case vibration,
total energy averaged over all vibrations, and the asymptotic rate of energy
decay. Each of these different metrics requires different mathematical tools and
computational techniques. To address these problems, this project will draw
upon, and augment, tools from mechanics, functional analysis, and numerical
analysis. The task of finding the best damping is a spectral optimization
problem, which is particularly challenging because the mathematical models for
these vibrating bodies are non-self-adjoint and have variable coefficients. As
such, they are representative of a broad class of important problems in
application areas such as fluid dynamics, and thus insights gained from this
work may suggest advances on a broad class of problems. In addition to design
optimization, this project will also develop techniques for characterizing the
material properties of a body based on measurements of vibration. Of particular
interest are models comprising several one-dimensional entities vibrating
together. At the macroscopic level, such models describe violin strings composed
of an elastic core enclosed in a dissipative sheath below an outer elastic
winding, while at the microscopic level, similar models have been proposed to
model DNA as two intertwined rods glued together elastically.
