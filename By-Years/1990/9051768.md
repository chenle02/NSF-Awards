This project creates a laboratory for signal processing and instrument
interfacing. The two workstation laboratory demonstrates state-of-the-art signal
processing using simple object oriented programming of familiar computers. The
laboratory is multi- disciplinary with applications in Computer Science,
Mathematics, Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Communication, and Music. Topics
covered include digital and analog signal production, signal transmission
through practical media, signal reception, and processing. Specific topics
include modems, signal synthesis, harmonic analysis, programming signal
processors, computer- instrument interfacing, and computer networks. The
laboratory enhances the student's understanding of the technical and economic
limits of computers and communication. Students interface sensors with computers
and evaluate their limitations. The students also write and test signal
processing software and use signal processing software to evaluate the technical
limits of various real-world systems. The award is being matched by an equal
amount from the principal investigator's institution.
