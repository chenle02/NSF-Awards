9509144 Jonsson This research addresses the biochemistry and genetics of the
human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) integration pathway. Specifically, the
underlying basis for integrase (IN)-LTR recognition will be defined. One
approach will be to construct chimeric HTLV-I and HTLV-II integrases to identify
the LTR recognition domain. Import of the amino acid domain for recognition of
HTLV-I IN's LTR to HTLV-IIg IN would correspond to a loss of recognition for the
HTLV-IIg LTR and gain of recognition for the HTLV-I LTR by the HTLV-II/I
chimeric protein. Once the domain has been identified, site-directed mutagenesis
will be employed to ascertain the important functional amino acid residues. A
second aspect of the research will focus on the molecular details of binding and
recognition of the LTR by IN using fluorescence technology. This fluorescence
approach is useful in that it offers a more dynamic and sensitive approach to
binding, which will be important in the light of the "weak" DNA binding activity
of integrases. Direct impact of these studies will be toward increased
understanding of the biochemical pathway of retroviral integration. In a broader
sense, however, the reactions catalyzed by IN have implications in several other
areas such as "weak" protein-DNA interactions, and recombinases where scientific
advancement has not been as rapid as with other DNA-protein interactions. %%%
This research focuses on the protein-DNA interactions of the retroviral protein,
integrase. Retroviruses are a large family of single stranded RNA viruses. All
retroviruses contain the gene that encodes for integrase, which functions to
insert the viral DNA into the cell's DNA. The insertion of the viral DNA is
essential to the viral life cycle. In order for integrase to insert or integrate
the viral DNA, the protein must "recognize" the viral DNA and the cell's DNA.
The specific aim of this project is to define the manner whereby integrase
recognizes the retroviral DNA and the cell's DNA. ***
