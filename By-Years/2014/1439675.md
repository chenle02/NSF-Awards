A new center is to be planned based at Florida State University, University of
Minnesota-Twin Cities and Ohio State University named the Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Applications in Flow Control (CAFC).
CAFC is motivated by two major goals:(1)moving beyond the current design
paradigm that relies on conventional steady aerodynamics and (2) integrating
active flow control into engineered fluid systems. Active flow control is a
multidisciplinary field that spans numerous technical disciplines, including
fluid dynamics, controls, smart materials, actuators, sensors, and signal
processing. Advances in these fields are often combined and first demonstrated
in laboratory-scale experiments and subsequently scaled to industrial
prototypes. Therefore, industry-driven collaborative research initiatives are
required to catalyze and transition innovations from university research
outcomes to industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fluid dynamics and aeroacoustics
communities are at the threshold of a paradigm shift as flow control is poised
to alter the way many engineering fluid systems are designed. Once achieved
there is a potential to revolutionize many areas, ranging from all modes of
transportation to energy production to process engineering and more. The planned
center will operate at the forefront of this transformation by connecting
advances in fluid dynamics, controls, smart materials, actuators, sensors, and
signal processing and applying to societally relevant problems with industry
guidance. The proposed I/UCRC AFC will combine a team of complementary
researchers and educators, train graduate students in interdisciplinary fields,
actively recruit and mentor students from underrepresented groups, and team with
entrepreneurial small businesses, industry, and government agencies.
