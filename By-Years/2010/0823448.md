Graduate student Adrian V. Bell, along adviser Dr. Peter Richerson, will
undertake research to empirically test theoretical models of cultural change.
Human beings learn their culture from others. Therefore, to look at cultural
microevolution in action, the researchers will test social learning models for
their predictive power in a few key learning domains. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
research will be carried out in the Islands of Tonga and among the Tongan
diaspora in the United States. The contrast between Tonga's marked geographic
boundaries and the open and quickly moving Tongan diaspora provides an excellent
natural experiment. In each site, a culturally conservative community and a
rapidly changing community will be chosen for study. The investigators will
focus on how individual-level decisions about who to learn from and what to
learn, affect the spread, change, or conservation of behavioral traditions. Data
collection will include ego centered networks and structured interviews. The
investigator will use statistical procedures to rank evolutionary models of
cultural change and highlight those that best explain trait variability revealed
in the data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every society in the world is currently
experiencing rapid change. Understanding how cultural change proceeds is
fundamental to understanding human beings today. This research will contribute
to this endeavor through empirical testing of longstanding, but heretofore
untested, models. The research also will contribute to determing how culture
change works at the level of the individual, both among those who have migrated
to the United States and among those who have not.
