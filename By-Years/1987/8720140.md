The primary objective of the project is to develop a competitive research
proposal on "Decision Makers' Cognitive Process Depicted by a Covariance
Structural Model." Support of the project will assist a well trained black
social scientist to improve his research capability and to complete the planning
and development of a regular MRI proposal. The planning activities, if
successful, will significantly enhance the potential of the investigator to
compete for MRI and other research support.
