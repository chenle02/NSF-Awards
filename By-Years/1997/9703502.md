Ivester, Andrew University of Georgia The doctoral dissertation research will
determine the ages of dune activity in Georgia, describe the geomorphic and
stratigraphic context of the dunes, and use the resulting information to infer
the processes and environmental conditions that produced the dunes. Ages of dune
activity will be determined using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating
with supplementary age data from accelerator mass spectrometer (AMS) radiocarbon
dating. Results will yield a record of natural climatic variability and
illustrate the effects of global climate fluctuations on eolian activity.
