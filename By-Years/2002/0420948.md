This award provides support for purchase of a laser confocal scanning microsope
(LSCM) to aid research and educational programs at the grantee institution.
Confocal fluorescence microscopy, which allows the reconstruction of 3-D images
of cells and tissues, has become one of the most important tools in contemporary
cell science. The instrument will be placed in a central microscopy facility
which is already well-equipped with electron and light microscopes, sample
preparation equipment, and image analysis workstations. A faculty director and
full-time microscopy technician provide training and support to faculty and
student users of the facility. This microscope will be used for a diverse set of
research programs, including 3-D reconstructions of neural networks in marine
invertebrates, neurogenesis in the adult mammalian hippocampus, control of
calcification in the crustacean cuticle, and metabolic organization of cells.
The instrument will also be used in research training and education at all
levels from undergraduate to postdoctoral, and will be available for use by
researchers at other local and regional institutions.
