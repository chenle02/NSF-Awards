The objective of the project is to measure the paleoceanographic variability of
heat content in the Turbulent Boundary Layer of the tropical and subtropical
oceans. A new measure of the nutricline, and by proxy, thermocline, depth is the
coccolithophorid species Florisphaera profunda. This marine algae is restricted
to the lower euphotic zone, high nutrients, and temperatures >10C. The research
will define and test this measure. The goals include (1) Improve bioecologic
definition of F. profunda in the tropical Atlantic. (2) Document changes in the
equatorial Atlantic nutricline for the last 200,000 years (3) Determine if the
change in global climate at 2.5 Million years altered the nutricline response to
precessional forcing using F.profunda in ODP site 662A for the interval 3.1 to
1.9 Million years. (4) Delineate the position and expression of the poleward
boundary of the North Atlantic subtropical gyre for the last 200,000 years.
