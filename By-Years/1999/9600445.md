This proposal centers around nuclear theory and its application to issues of
importance in astrophysics and particle physics. Traditionally, the atomic
nucleus is viewed as a system of neutrons and protons -- the nucleons. The
interactions between nucleons lead to a variety of collective properties,
involving neutrons and protons moving coherently. Projects to understand why
many nuclei exhibit collective behavior typical of an enharmonic vibrator and to
assess the role of proton-neutron collective pair correlations in nuclei near
the proton drip line are proposed. Despite the enormous success of the
traditional picture, there is now great interest in going one step deeper, to
obtain a consistent picture of nuclei directly from the quark constituents of
the nucleon. Baryon mappings have been suggested as a practical approach for
realizing this goal. Several issues related to implementation of this method
will be investigated, followed by detailed applications to real nuclear systems.
Nuclear physics also plays an important role in efforts to extract information
of fundamental importance in astrophysics. Two such applications will be
considered -- a study of the response of a proposed iodine detector to solar
neutrinos and a treatment of the beta decays associated with r- and p- process
nucleosynthesis.
