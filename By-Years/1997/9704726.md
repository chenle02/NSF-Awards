9704726 Lin The landscape of the study of knots and 3-manifolds has undergone a
dramatic change in the past decade. Through the advent of the Jones polynomial,
quantum invariants and Vassiliev invariants, it transpired that knots,
3-manifolds and other lower dimensional topological objects could be studied
extrinsically as combinatorial objects, with topological equivalence as a kind
of symmetry. The investigator recognized the broader roles these topological
objects may play, and this fresh point of view is reflected in the many topics
studied in this project: the representation varieties of the fundamental groups
of homology 3-spheres over finite fields and their relations with Ohtsuki's
invariants of homology 3-spheres; the probabilistic interpretation of certain
string link invariants closely related to quantum invariants; integral and
projective geometry of Gauss integrals, the classification of Legendrian knots,
the study of various energy functionals with respect to the geometric structures
on knot spaces, and the topology of level sets of Gauss integrals; and
calculation of relations among (alternating) multiple zeta numbers, using string
links as devices. Knots are fascinating objects. When fastening a rope, the
distinction between a knot and a "slip-knot" (one that can be undone by pulling)
must have been recognized very early in human history. However, a mathematical
study of knots was started only around the end of the nineteenth century and has
finally in recent years matured into a useful scientific tool. Nowadays, basic
concepts in knot theory are crucial for DNA biology and foundational physics,
and they are related to many other fields in mathematics. On the other hand,
easily pictured but difficult questions in knot theory still remain beyond the
reach of mathematical techniques. Two basic features of knot theory, the
diversity of different kinds of knots and the role played by symmetry in their
classification, may well provide hin ts and tools for many different kinds of
scientific research. ***
