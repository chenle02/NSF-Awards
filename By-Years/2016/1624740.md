This project will study the monsoon phenomenon. The broader impacts envisioned
are multifaceted, including participation in existing outreach activities for
K-12 and undergraduate research mentoring and teaching. The PI also has a strong
sense of the need for data and computer code/script dissemination and proposes
to develop a tool to facilitate this kind of intellectual product exchange.

Limitations of the existing theoretical treatments of monsoon circulations have
been noted in prior literature, and a few examples of those theories failing
entirely have been documented, but as of yet there has been no systematic
attempt to break the theories. Using idealized general circulation models,
effort under this project will identify conditions under which existing monsoon
theories break down. New theoretical insights will be applied to climate model
simulations of past and future climates in order to improve constraints on
monsoon behavior in paleoclimates and in the coming decades.
