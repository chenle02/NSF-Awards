Partial support will be provided for a workshop that is being held to define a
focus and direction for the solid mechanics research community, but more
specifically for the grantees of the NSF's Solid Mechanics Program to enhance
the quality and impact of the research supported. The solid mechanics research
community has not evolved a cohesive central management, so that most
researchers work on single investigator projects in a relatively unstructured
environment, with little peer guidance for their activities. It is expected that
this workshop will foster a more cohesive operation, using as a nucleus the
grantees of the Solid Mechanics Program. The workshop proceedings will be
published shortly after the conclusion of the meeting. It will be an imaginative
and realistic document of use to the entire solid mechanics research community
and to funding agencies.
