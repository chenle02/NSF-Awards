This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a
new microcapillary bioplate platform for biochemical analysis using a new
sealing fabrication technique. The advantages of this approach will be to add
the following attributes to high density glass microcapillary bioplates:
improved reliability and elimination of cross-contamination through
disposability, complete flexibility in diameter and length of capillaries, use
of 100,000 to 10 million capillaries per standard plate, improved capillary
uniformity, dramatic reductions in cost and process times, and reduction of
environmental contaminants.

The commercial application of this project will be to provide the biotechnology
research community with less expensive and potentially disposable microcapillary
plates for combinatorial biochemical assays.
