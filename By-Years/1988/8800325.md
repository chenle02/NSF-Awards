This grant provides funds to bring five prominent Western European
thermodynamicists to the United States to visit several university, government
and/or industrial laboratories, as well as to attend and participate in an
American Institute of Chemical Engineering meeting. The visits would provide the
opportunity to initiate and enhance U.S.-European cooperation. In addition, the
visitors could be a valuable resource in evaluating the status of thermodynamic
and phase equilibrium research in the United States and Europe. These visits
will enhance overall research activities by U.S. workers. Support for domestic
U.S. travel will be provided by U.S. universities and industry.
