This Career Advancement Award for Women is made in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic,
and Organometallic Chemistry Program to Dr. Claire A. Tessier of the Chemistry
Department, University of Akron. Due to impurities, commercially available main-
group metal silicides have not proved to be useful starting materials for
further functionalization. Dr. Tessier will prepare pure silicides by low
temperature routes, study their reactivity and functionalization, and determine
which impurities in commercially available materials impede or accelerate
reactions. Solid state NMR and X-ray diffraction will be used in
characterization. The long term goal of the research is to synthesize novel
polysilanes and metal-silicon compounds which might serve as precursors to
silicon carbide and solid state transition-metal silicides. The work undertaken
here will enable Dr. Tessier to expand research areas in her laboratory and
establish an independent research program.
