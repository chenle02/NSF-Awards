This proposal, submitted under the Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER)
Program, is designed to investigate student, parent, and school factors that are
related to mathematics and science enrollment and achievement in secondary
schools. The study will examine three sources of influence on the outcome
variables of courses taken and achievement in science and mathematics in
secondary schools: Parental influence as indicated by parents' involvement,
encouragement, and expectations; students' motivation and interest; and school
influence as indicated by tracking and interest and access to information and
guidance. Further, gender and ethnicity-based differences will be investigated
to assess if enrollment in science and mathematics courses and achievement among
women and minorities and differentially affected by these factors. The education
plan describes three main activities: Teaching, curriculum development, and
advising-mentioning. The plan lists strategies that will lead to continual
improvement in teaching and to the development of a "personal pedagogy." The
development of new courses will be guided by new knowledge and research in the
field. New courses in research methods and measurement will be application-
oriented with an important part of the education.
