9225072 Jain This proposed program continues as a renewal program, which
investigates ion dynamics in glasses as reflected in the frequency dependence of
electrical conductivity s, the nuclear spin relaxation (NSR), and in the
correlation between the two. NSR rate and s are to be measured as a function of
frequency and temperature. Charge delocalization (bonding) and its effect on ion
movement are to be characterized systematically. %%%% This proposed program aims
to investigate and to understand the ion movement in glasses. It seeks to answer
questions such as, what is the origin of electrical conductivity at moderately
low temperature?, and what is exact nature of chemical bond between a mobile ion
and ion charge compensation center or network at large? Glass is assuming ever-
increasing importance as a major component of the optical communication world.
Fundamental understanding of this kind can produce information which will aid
out design of new glasses for new applications. ****
