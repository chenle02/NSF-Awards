CISE RI: A Networked Computing Environment for the Manipulation and
Visualization of Geometric Data

This project, enabling the RI/MII PI Workshop, strengthens the national
computing infrastructure by supporting exchanges on infrastructure development
needs of research. The meeting serves to judge the effectiveness of the awarded
infrastructure and awarded research carried upon such infrastructure, as well as
their impact on research and education. Facilitating face-to-face contacts and
exchanges of ideas, the conference serves as a tool for the principal
investigators to judge their own work and that of others awarded. In addition to
research exchange, often the PIs gain insights as to where to recommend students
to pursue graduate studies and even what universities to apply that best might
service their new PhD degree, and alternately, where their research might have
the most influence.
