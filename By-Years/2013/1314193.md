Biological diversity is critical to the function of the Earth's ecosystems,
however our understanding of how that diversity evolved, how it is maintained,
and the links between biodiversity and the services that ecosystems provide is
still woefully incomplete. The Dimensions of Biodiversity program was
established in 2010 with the goal of transforming our understanding of the scope
and role of life on Earth. This workshop will bring together scientists and
students from Panama and the United States to learn about the Dimensions of
Biodiversity program and establish international collaborations that will lead
to the development of proposals that are appropriate for submission to that
program. Panama is a strong candidate to be a partner in the Dimensions of
Biodiversity Program because it harbors tremendous biological diversity and
because there is scientific and institutional support for research in this area.
There will be strong broader impacts of this workshop because it will include
Panamanian post-doctoral researchers and graduate students and because it will
develop new international collaborations between scientists in the United States
and Panama. This award is being co-funded by NSF's Office of International
Science and Engineering.
