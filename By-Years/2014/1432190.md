The low numbers of computer science graduates is a national concern. One of the
frequently cited reasons for leaving computer science is students' difficulties
with programming. The goal of this project is to build a software tutor that
provides feedback designed to guide students through the process of developing a
sequence of steps to solve a given problem, selecting the programming language
features appropriate for each step, and then writing code using those features.
Students will learn to solve 40 different problems of varying complexity using
the software tutor. The software tutor is expected to help reduce the number of
students, especially women, who typically drop out of programming courses and
increase the number of graduates who eventually go on to careers in Information
Technology.

This research and development project will consist of the following activities:
1) Creation of practice software that provides formative feedback to help
students learn algorithm formulation and program design by solving problems. In
addition, students will learn to write code for the problems, which will cover
selection, loops, and functions in both Java and C++. 2) Assessment of student
learning throughout the course using a formative evaluation of the pedagogic
modules and feedback from the practice software. Summative evaluation will
examine the impact of the software on the success of students in an introductory
Computer Science course, measured in terms of grades, retention, and
specifically, the differential impact of the software on women in the
introductory programming course. 3) Dissemination of the results of the project
through research conferences and journals and by sharing the practice software
among educators so it can be adopted and used in other introductory Computer
Science courses.
