Cyst nematodes are parasitic roundworms of plant roots that cause severe yield
and quality loss in many agricultural systems. In the US, the soybean cyst
nematode is the most serious pathogen problem in soybean production. Only very
limited control options for these plant pathogens exist and further research
into their biology is needed to uncover novel control targets. In order for cyst
nematodes to be successful, they need to be able to completely change their host
plant at the cellular and physiological level. At the heart of these changes are
massive alterations of plant gene expression patterns under the control of the
nematode, i.e., these plant parasites are able to reprogram plant cells for
their own benefit. It is unknown how cyst nematodes are able to do this, but the
investigators will use the model plant Arabidopsis and the beet cyst nematode to
explore a new mechanism that they have shown to be involved in cyst nematode
parasitism, namely the effects of plant microRNAs (miRNAs), which are powerful
regulators of gene expression. The investigators will characterize four miRNAs
that they have shown to be active at the site of nematode infection and they
will identify additional regulatory RNAs. As a result, the scientific community
will gain understanding of cyst nematode parasitism and, more importantly, this
project will identify potential avenues to interfere with cyst nematode
parasitism with the goal to engineer crop plants that are resistant, which would
eliminate billions of dollars in yield loss world-wide. Broader impacts are the
training of young scientists as well as an involvement of high school teachers
who will produce a training video module on cyst nematodes, which will be an
eye-opening teaching tool for students of all backgrounds.
