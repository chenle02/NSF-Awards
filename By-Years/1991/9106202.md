This award request is intended as support for advanced academic research and
applied studies in the multidisciplinary topic of enhanced in situ
biorestoration of hazardous waste contaminated terrestrial, aquatic and marine
environments. The proposal addresses the need for: (1) the fundamental factors
controlling biodegradation of toxic organics; (2) how combinations of anaerobic
and aerobic treatment can be used to compliment each other; (3) in situ
detoxification of mixed-type contaminants using local microbiology treatment;
and (4) low-cost, efficient in-ground remediation of recalcitrant toxicants,
including trace metals removal and recovery of metal values. The purpose of this
research project is to employ modern techniques from basic and applied research
areas to elucidate the chemical mechanisms of microbial ecology responsible for
detoxifying anthropogenic contaminants in the environment.
