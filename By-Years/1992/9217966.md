The project will link the record of Plio-Pleistocene magnetic reversals to
lithologic variations in sediment cores from the North Atlantic, Equatorial
Atlantic and western tropical Pacific, using continuous records of sediment
porosity, magnetic susceptibility, and optical density. Results will address
three problems: (1) the nature of short-term magnetic events reported elsewhere;
(2) the depth at which magnetic grain orientation becomes established; (3) the
relative accuracy and precision of the previously-established age scale for
magnetic reversals based on K-Ar dating versus more recent approaches based on
"tuning" lithologic variations to orbital forcing.
