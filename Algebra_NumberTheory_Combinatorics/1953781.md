Symmetric function theory is an area of mathematical research which has produced
an abundance of intricate (and sometimes conjectural) identities, many of which
are very difficult to prove. Symmetric functions have ties to geometry,
representation theory, and physics, and there is a deep interplay between these
areas: symmetric functions give a computational model for difficult matters in
these other fields, and symmetric function identities are often best understood
as shadows of deeper concepts from other areas. This project studies the
algebraic and geometric underpinnings of a symmetric function problem called the
Delta Conjecture. The project provides research training opportunities for
undergraduate and graduate students.

Quotients of the polynomial ring in n variables have classical ties to the
combinatorics of permutations and the geometry of the flag variety. This project
studies analogous quotients (and subspaces) of a newer ring called 'superspace'
which has n commuting generators (corresponding to bosons) and n anticommuting
generators (corresponding to fermions). These new algebraic objects are linked
to the combinatorics of ordered set partitions (as studied by Haglund,
Shimozono, and the PI) and the geometry of a variety of spanning line
configurations introduced by Pawlowski and the PI. A deep conjecture of
Zabrocki, and a related conjecture of Wilson and the PI, assert that (a variant
of) superspace gives a representation-theoretic model for the Delta Conjecture.
The PI will use the algebra and geometry of superspace to tie other areas of
mathematics to the Delta Conjecture, which could lead to an illuminating proof
thereof.
