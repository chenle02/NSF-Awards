This research will show how activity in protests for municipal services in the
Mexican city of Guadalajara affects relations between the female protesters and
their male relatives. Latin culture defines female activity in terms of home and
family, so this sort of public activism runs counter to the dominant norms of
the culture. The project will see how men and women deal with these
contradictions in their lives. Methods used include consultation with local
newspaper archives, re-analysis of a household survey conducted by a local
research facility, surveys of 100 households in a poor neighborhood, and
intensive interviews with both participant and non-participant households. This
research is important because popular demonstrations for civil services are
widespread in the world (witness Eastern Europe i 1989). Understanding of the
dynamics of such activity, on an individual, family, and household level can
help society form policies to respond appropriately.
