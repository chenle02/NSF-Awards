This award will support a six-month research visit by Professor John B. Van
Zytveld of the Department of Physics, Calvin College in the laboratory of
Professor H. Endo, Department of Physics, Kyoto University. They will measure
the optical properties of the liquid alloys MgBi and MgSb in the concentration
regimes in which the alloys become less metallic and more semimetallic or
semicondu- cting. They will obtain this information by means of optical
reflectivity measurements at normal incidence in the photon energy range from
0.5 eV to 5.2 eV. This study should provide valuable information about the
electronic structure of these alloys.
