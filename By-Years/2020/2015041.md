This grant supports to student travel for select students participating in 25th
AAAI/SIGAI Doctoral Consortium (DC), which will be held on February 7-8, 2020,
in New York, New York. This activity will bring together a broad community of
researchers in the field of AI, and support junior researchers at this critical
early-career stage. The DC creates the opportunity to bring in participants who
might not have attended an AI conference due to lack of resources. This is
especially true for those at smaller institutions and those which have less
developed AI programs. Engaging such participants has the potential to draw more
talent into AI research, improve research ideas in their formative stage, and
engender collaborations across the breadth of disciplines. This event provides
students with invaluable exposure to outside perspectives on their work at a
critical time in their research and also enables them to explore their career
objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
