9507987 Fu This project involves the application of state-of-the-art climate
observations, especially satellite data, and simple numerical models to clarify
the processes that control the amount and distribution of water vapor in the
upper troposphere in the middle latitudes. Understanding these processes is
critical to understanding the earth's radiation budget and the potential for
global warming. The objectives of the project are to: (1) identify the main
sources of and mechanisms controlling upper tropospheric water vapor in the
middle latitudes, especially the relative importance of large-scale horizontal
advection and vertical transport by local convection and (2) examine whether
these processes are adequately represented in general circulation models. The
research will contribute directly to the goals of NSF's Water and Energy -
Atmospheric, Vegetative, and Earth Interactions (WEAVE) effort. The educational
component of this CAREER award consists of a variety of activities involving
both graduate and undergraduate students and an effort to encourage
underrepresented groups, particularly women, to pursue careers in the physical
sciences.***
