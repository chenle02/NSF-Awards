0121911&lt;br/&gt;Uhlmann&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Pan-American Advanced
Studies Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by the NSF and the Department
of Energy (DOE), aims to bring many of the developments of the last 20 years or
so in the mathematical theory of inverse problems to advanced graduate students,
postdocs, and other scientists in the Americas interested in the topic and its
applications. The PASI, organized by Dr. Gunther Uhlmann of the University of
Washington, will be held at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in
Berkeley, California from October 29 to November 2, 2001. This PASI will be
followed by a MSRI-organized workshop on Inverse Problems and Applications at
the same site, thus allowing some of the participants and lecturers to attend
both events. The emphasis of the PASI will be on open problems in the field but
also on promoting international collaborations by bringing experts in different
areas together in one event. Approximately 25 participants will be expected,
from various countries in the Americas. &lt;br/&gt;
