Explosive growth in shared-data-center computing has increased the need for fair
resource-allocation policies and mechanisms that provide quality-of-service
(QoS) guarantees for tenants sharing a physical infrastructure. The focus today
is on virtualizing entire applications with integrated compute, storage, and
networking resources. This requires automated techniques for dynamically slicing
and aggregating the underlying physical infrastructure, to create ensembles of
virtual resources with flexible mixes of different resource types.

The project involves the development of policies, algorithms, and scheduling
mechanisms to optimize the joint allocation of multiple heterogeneous resources.
Models for fair sharing of multiple resources suitable for these systems will be
defined, and new resource allocation algorithms that maximize consolidation
ratios will be developed and evaluated. The results will advance the development
of the fast-growing cloud IT infrastructure by increasing resource efficiency
for the service providers, and providing better QoS guarantees and isolation for
the tenants. The project will also result in the education and training of
students in a topical and important sector of Information Technology.
