The proposed research concerns computational principles of touch sensing in the
context of part localization, model-based recognition, and shape reconstruction;
it encompasses a number of areas of robotics - touch sensing, part orientation
and localization, shape recognition, grasping, dextrous manipulation. The
proposed localization scheme aims at determining the pose of an object with
known geometry relative to the (robot) hand through contact. Algorithms will be
developed for processing tactile data, computing geometric invariants, and
registering them onto the object's surface. The education part of the project
includes development of interdisciplinary courses with an emphasis on robotics
and geometric computation.
