A field experiment is performed in which underground pipelines are placed
within the Parkfield segment of the San Andreas Fault. The experiment aims to
examine the validity of current assumptions about the behavior of underground
continuously welded steel pipe and jointed ductile iron pipe subjected to near
surface fault offset. Active and passive instrumentation are made to permit
important assumptions embodied in current prediction and design methods to be
evaluated and improved. Critical parameters to be measured will be the anchor
length in welded pipes and the relative rotations and displacements at joints in
segmented pipes.
