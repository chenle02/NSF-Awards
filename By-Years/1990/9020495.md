Theoretical research in elementary particle physics will emphasize the
application of non-perturbative quantum field theory methods to a variety of
problems which cannot be solved by treating some part of the physics as a
perturbation. One of these problems is the possible non-conservation of baryon
(nucleon) number at high energies due to quantum-mechanical tunneling. A second
is the completion of a field theory of strings. Baryon number non-conservation
at high energies would lead to extremely interesting collisions at the
Superconducting Super Collider, and a field theory of strings would be an
important step in the evolution of a string theory of the fundamental forces.
