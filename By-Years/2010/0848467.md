This project will continue work on the development of methods for the formation
of C-C bonds using organozinc reagents, as the formation of C-C bonds is of
fundamental importance in organic synthesis. New and efficient methods will be
studied for the direct conversion of aldehydes into enals, which are among the
most important starting materials for organocatalytic reactions. Methods for the
stereospecific synthesis of enantioenriched enamines will also be explored.
Finally, new classes of enantioenriched cyclopropanes will be prepared through
novel halocyclopropanations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic
and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor
Patrick J. Walsh of the Department of Chemistry at the University of
Pennsylvania. Professor Walsh's research efforts involve the development of
novel and practical methods for the formation of C-C bonds. Such chemistry will
allow multiple reactions to be performed without isolation or purification of
intermediates, thus reducing the environmental impact of chemical synthesis.
Successful development of these methods will positively impact organic synthesis
in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries.
