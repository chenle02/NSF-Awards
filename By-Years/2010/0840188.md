The 2009 International Year of Astronomy coincides with the dimming and
brightening of a variable star that can be seen with the naked eye. The American
Association of Variable Star Observers and the Adler Planetarium and Astronomy
Museum are organizing a new citizen program called STARS (Science Through
Astronomical Research) that engages 8,000 amateur astronomers and non-
astronomers in measuring brightness changes in the star Epsilon Aurigae,
analyzing their observational data, and developing and testing their own
explanatory hypotheses. The goals of the project are to increase public
understanding of science by involving citizens in active research on an
accessible, yet enigmatic astronomical phenomenon, and disseminate lessons
learned to other citizen science programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A mixed methods
evaluation study is monitoring the implementation and impact of the program. The
project should (1) increase the number of non-astronomers who take up astronomy
as a hobby, (2) increase the number of amateur astronomers who participate in
other citizen science-related astronomical activities (for example, sky
surveys), and (3) increase the number of non-science oriented citizens who
become more interested in science. A research study is investigating how a
large-scale informal citizen science project changes public understanding of
scientific inquiry.
