This work is a collaborative effort to study the transformation and removal of
ozone and fine particles in the air due to multiphase atmospheric chemistry
related to aerosol acidity. The chemical measurements made will augment the
planned 'core' measurements obtaining during the Atmospheric Investigation,
Regional Modeling, Analysis and Prediction (AIRMAP) program field intensive
scheduled for July and August 2002. The objective of these additional
measurements is to assess the significance of pH-dependent, gas-particle
interactions with respect to the cycling of odd nitrogen, sulfur and other
chemical species in the Gulf of Maine boundary layer. This work contributes to
interagency collaboration in aerosol science between NSF and NOAA.
