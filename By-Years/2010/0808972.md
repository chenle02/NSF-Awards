Professor Murray Johnston of the University of Delaware is supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry and by the
Atmospheric Chemistry Program in the Division of Atmospheric Sciences to develop
a nanoparticle inlet for use with aerosol mass spectrometry, and to use it for
characterization of airborne nanoparticles in laboratory and field studies. At
present, on-line sampling of nanoparticles from ambient air into the vacuum of a
mass spectrometer is inefficient, making it difficult to study nanoparticle
formation and reactivity. The inlet being developed in this work will aim to
transmit nanoparticles over a broad size range, especially particles smaller
than 10 nm, so that their composition can be determined. This analytical
methodology will be used to study the formation and growth of nanoparticles in a
coastal marine environment, and to study the formation of secondary organic
aerosols. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide important information
on the source and fate of nanoparticles in the environment so that their impacts
on human health and the environment can be assessed. The methodology is relevant
to the study of human exposure to nanoparticles in the workplace and to the
study of large molecules and macromolecular assemblies in biological systems. A
diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students will be educated in this
interdisciplinary area involving chemistry and atmospheric science. The results
of field measurements will be used as case studies for environmental chemistry
coursework at the University of Delaware, and the general public will be engaged
at University sponsored science outreach events.
