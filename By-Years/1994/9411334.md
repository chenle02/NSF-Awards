This project implements a prototype digital library focussed on environmental
information, with a concentration on the utilization, evaluation and preparation
of environmental impact reports, statements and related documents. The prototype
system is intended for eventual full-scale deployment in the State of
California's CERES production systems. The research plan has three primary
goals: provision of a coherent, content-based view of a diverse set of
information objects distributed geographically; achievement of scalability to
very large collections, clients and servers, and the development of new data
acquisition technologies. The project strong reliance upon the success of
extending alpeady developed conventional DBMS technologies to support of
subelement access and content-based views. More radical approaches are planned
for automated document segmentation and topic characterization in order to
define and locate material in a "topic space" and image analysis for retrieval
and browsing.
