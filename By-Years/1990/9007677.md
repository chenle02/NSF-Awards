The work on the Information Dispersal Algorithm (IDA) makes it possible to store
and route information in distributed and parallel systems so as to achieve
highly fault tolerant and space-time efficient performance. Applications of this
method will be developed, in particular to routing in asynchronous parallel
computers and to storage of information in disk arrays. There now exist, non-
cryptographic, secure (i.e. secret and resistant to malicious adversaries)
distributed computing protocols. These methods will be applied to extend the
ITOSS (Integrated Toolkit for Operating System Security) to the distributed
system environment so as to achieve system security based on distributed
authority. IDA brings about an improvement in routing of data through
computation on that data. This suggests a study of the possible tradeoffs
between computation and switching of data. Randomized algorithms will continue
to be a major tool in the study of the above questions.
