Morris Brown College requests as Planning Grant of $50,000 form the National
Science&lt;br/&gt;Foundation to support TranSMET -Phase I, a period of academic
self-assessment,&lt;br/&gt;understanding, and planning around those issues of
infrastructure, faculty and student&lt;br/&gt;preparedness that pose barriers to
desired student outcomes in the science, math, engineering,&lt;br/&gt;and
technology disciplines. The 10 month planning phase is designed to culminate in
1) a&lt;br/&gt;comprehensive five-year proposal that will catalyze the
pedagogical reformation of Morris&lt;br/&gt;Brown College by 2) conducting a
thorough analysis of the College's SMET infrastructure and&lt;br/&gt;programs
and to develop a realistic and workable plan for implementing changes; and 3
)&lt;br/&gt;developing a process of consistent assessment and evaluation of SMET
programs. With the&lt;br/&gt;formation of TranSMET Morris Brown College plans to
design a series of three retreats&lt;br/&gt;(meetings and workshops). Phase I of
the project will culminate in a complete analysis of its&lt;br/&gt;current SMET
infrastructure, the formation of a permanent assessment and evaluation
process&lt;br/&gt;for all present and future SMET programs, and fmally the
development of a comprehensive&lt;br/&gt;multi-year proposal to increase
minority participation in the SMET "knowledge workforce."&lt;br/&gt;
