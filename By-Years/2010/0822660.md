Previous studies of the interaction of tropical cyclones with their large-scale
environments have focused primarily on environmental controls on storm tracks
and, more recently, rapid changes in intensity. Through a combination of review
and analysis of archived storm observations and idealized simulations employing
the NCAR/PSU MM5 mesoscale model nested down to 3-km horizontal resolution, this
research will investigate the previously unexplored issue of what environmental
factors control tropical cyclone size (i.e., diameter) and other broad
structural aspects of these storms. Since the large-scale environments in which
tropical cyclones are embedded are generally well represented by existing
operational weather forecast models, it follows that identifying those
environmental characteristics that are most important to determining cyclone
size and structure will improve forecasts storm structure and its
evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research centers
upon achieving improved understanding of fundamental physical processes that
control evolution of hurricane size and broad structural configuration of
accompanying envelopes of damaging winds and heavy
precipitation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this work include
training of university graduate and undergraduate students and support of the
participation of underrepresented groups. Improved techniques for forecasting
changes of tropical cyclone size will in-turn impact operational products
including storm surge prediction and proper scoping (in space and time) of
coastal evacuation plans in the face of landfalling hurricanes.
