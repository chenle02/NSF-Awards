Existing digital radio systems, which use continuous phase frequency modulation
with coherent detection, trade spectral efficiency for low bit error rate. In
certain applications, such as satellite and mobile radio, they are subject to
degradation due to fading and doppler shifts. This research will investigate the
use of trellis coding of the signal space with CP-FM, using non-coherent,
discriminator-based detection. This coding scheme will be applied for both
symmetrical and asymmetrical signal constellations. System performance in the
presence of Rician fading doppler effects will be investigated and compared to
non-coherent detection of standard modulation schemes such as MSK, duo-binary,
and TFM. Finally, an optimum modulation scheme will selected for a given code
rate. A successful effort could result in more efficient communications systems
that require less power for the same bit error rate, reduced weight, higher
reliability, improved spectral efficiency, better doppler and fading
performance, and lower costs.
