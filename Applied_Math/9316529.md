9316529 Puckett The central focus of this research is the design and development
of a numerical method for modeling complex nonlinear wave interactions in
condensed matter at high pressures and temperatures. This numerical method is
based on a collection of numerical algorithms that have been used with great
success to model shock wave refraction in gases. The extension of these
algorithms to problems involving condensed matter involves modifications to
accommodate a realistic condensed phase equation of state, the inclusion of
realistic constitutive relations for modeling the strength effects in solids,
and the development of robust algorithms for describing vacuum states. It is
also expected that a better understanding of wave phenomena in condensed matter
gained from the numerical computations will contribute to the understanding of
the wave structure that characterize solutions of more general systems of
hyperbolic conservation laws than those that govern the flow of gases, and thus
aid in the mathematical analysis of these equations. This work includes
extensive experimental validation of numerical results. This project is
concerned with developing advanced computational methods, based on methods
originally developed to address aerospace and defense problems, and applying the
new methods to important problems in the geosciences. These new computational
methods are used to design an improved experimental technique for determining
sound speeds in geophysical materials. Accurate knowledge of sound speeds is
important for the correct interpretation of seismic data. The new computational
methods are also used to model the effect the impact of a large comet or
asteroid would have on the Earth. Such impacts have been proposed to explain the
mass extinction of species (e.g., dinosaurs) and may have been responsible for
the periodic loss of the Earth's early atmosphere. The specific nature of such
large shocks, and the consequences they might hav e for the atmosphere and the
Earth's magnetic field, are addressed. The use of the computational methods to
model explosive volcanic eruptions is also investigated. The computational
methods developed in this research will have a wide range of applications in
other areas of science and technology.
