The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a smart slit lamp. In clinical optometry, the use of slit-lamp
microscopes is indispensable. Approximately 104 million regular eye exams are
performed annually using a slit lamp. In the presence of specialized devices,
the slit lamp is still widely used by optometrists across the globe for its
flexibility. There are many tests that can be performed using the device,
however, due to its time-consuming nature in clinical practice the number of
tests performed is currently limited. The proposed smart slit-lamp device may
allow optometrists to perform multiple tests in a much shorter time and help to
identify and diagnose diseases that are not currently being observed using
traditional manual analysis. The proposed smart slit lamp may provide access to
improved eye care and further research in the field of optometry.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of
imaging technologies and image analysis software for slit lamps used in
optometry. In optometry, the slit lamp microscope is an essential device that is
used to look at the interior of the human eye. Optometrists, ophthalmologists,
and eye bank technicians use these microscopes regularly to observe the health
of different parts of the human eye. Current slit lamps come in two forms:
analog and digital. However, current slit lamps do not provide image analysis
software or automation. The proposed technology is designed to provide a digital
slit lamp with both imaging and image analysis capabilities and more automatic
operation, which may minimize human intervention and save time while making the
diagnosis more objective. Preliminary work has shown that the proposed
technology may provide a consistent, accurate, and objective measure that will
lead to improved eye care.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
