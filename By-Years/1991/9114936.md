This project supports a workshop for Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCU's) Smart Node consultants to the Cornell National
Supercomputer Facility (CNSF). The CNSF Smart Node program is a consortium of
more than 70 institutions nationwide that distribute supercomputing expertise,
support and training to researchers and students at their home institution. The
primary goals of the program are to provide readily available consulting and
training for researcher who access the CNSF's facilities from remote
institutions and to involve participating institutions in the development of
programs that address their supercomputing needs. These goals are met through
the combined efforts of the Theory Center Staff, the CNSF and the Smart Node
institutions. This project includes an initial training workshop and support for
one of the annual Smart Node consultants meetings. There will also be special
regional meetings at several of the HBCU institutions. COntacts between the
HBCU's and members of the Theory Center's Corporate Research Institute and its
industrial partners will be initiated for the development of student internships
and to stimulate interactions with faculty.
