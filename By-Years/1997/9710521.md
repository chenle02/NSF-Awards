This project supports the 27th annual Frontiers in Education Conference to be
held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in November 1997. The FIE Conference is co-
sponsored by the IEEE Education Society, and the Education and Research Methods
Division of the American Society of Engineering Education (ASEE). A primary goal
of the FIE conference is to promote the widespread dissemination of innovation
in teaching and learning in undergraduate engineering education. Presentations
in technical sessions represent work at the "frontier" of education, and the
format of the conference is designed to promote dialog between presenters and
attendees. Funding from NSF has played a major role in increasing the quality of
the conference in the last several years. Continued funding will support the
"NSF Project Showcase" to feature successful NSF sponsored projects, including
the successful Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program. *
