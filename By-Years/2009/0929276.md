The Alabama Alliance for Students with Disabilities in STEM is a collaborative
effort involving Auburn University, Tuskegee University, Alabama State
University, and Auburn University at Montgomery, Central Alabama Community
College, Southern Union Community College, the Alabama Institute for the Deaf
and Blind, and six school districts in East-Central Alabama: Lee, Chambers,
Elmore, Montgomery, Macon, and Tallapoosa County school systems. The Alliance
has the following four major goals:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal 1: Increase the
Quality of Students with Disabilities Completing Associate and Baccalaureate
Degrees in STEM Disciplines;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal 2: Increase the Number of
Students with Disabilities Completing Associate and Baccalaureate Degrees in
STEM Disciplines and entering STEM graduate degrees or STEM
workforce;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal 3: Increase the Number of Students with
Disabilities Completing Graduate Degrees in STEM Disciplines;
and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal 4: Increase the number of high school students
with disabilities going to college.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This unique Alliance,
which includes two Historically Black Universities, Tuskegee University and
Alabama State University, builds upon established STEM bridge programs to
include female and minority students with disabilities. The Alabama Alliance has
an internal evaluation team and an external evaluator who will lead the
independent formative and summative project evaluations, Dr. Abbot Packard, from
the University of West Georgia.&lt;br/&gt;
