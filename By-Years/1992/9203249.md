This project develops an existing scalable fault-tolerant and visually
programmable platform called GLU which enables parallel application to be run on
existing hardware. The essential property of GLU that makes it all work is the
way it actually combines declarative and procedural code. GLU programs consist
of a declarative top layer and lower layers of procedural code, e.g., C or
FORTRAN. The procedural code is written without thinking about parallel
evaluation. All the parallelism and the fault tolerance come from the
declarative level. GLU will be developed by making improvements at various
levels: in the range of machines that can be used, in performance (and
measurement thereof), in the declarative/procedural interface to allow
systematic reuse of existing code, in the graphical specification of the
declarative layer, and in the graphical layer itself.
