Dr. Robert Boutilier is a professor of geology at Bridgewater State College in
Massachusetts. He has organized a three year effort, in collaboration with the
Massachusetts Audubon Society, to help local school districts develop outdoor
science education as an integral part of their elementary school science
curriculum. Approximately 120 teachers will have two-week summer workshop
experiences at one of several Audubon nature centers, where they will learn to
develop instructional activities based on outdoor habitats close to their
schools. Staff from the College and nature centers will work with these teachers
during the academic year to help them refine their use of local environments for
instructional purposes. The region covered by this project will include much of
southeastern Massachusetts, extending from Boston through Brockton, New Bedford
and Fall River to Cape Cod. The proposed teacher enhancement project will
establish an in-the-environment science curriculum for southeastern
Massachusetts. Teachers will receive training in the content and instructional
methods necessary to help design and implement this new curriculum. More than 32
local school districts will benefit from this project. Cost sharing amounts to
33% of the NSF contribution to the project.
