This research consists of three projects. The first concerns the impact of
demographic changes on the demand for various types of government spending with
age-specific benefits. While the consequences of an aging U.S. population for
the Social Security and Medicare trust funds has received substantial attention,
the consequences for other categories of government spending, in particular
spending on primary and secondary education, are relatively unstudied. This
project uses data on the composition of government spending in states, as well
as in individual school districts, to study the effect of the population's
demographic composition on the level of public spending. The results will
provide insights on alternative explanations for declining popular support for
public education. A second project focuses on the effect of tax subsidies and
tax-related regulations on employer-provided health insurance and other employee
benefits. One aspect of this analysis is a study of how individuals who are
eligible for Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs) use these accounts. These
accounts are closely related to "Medical IRAs," which have recently attracted
substantial popular attention. The extent to which employees use FSAs, and
whether they make reasonable estimates of their annual medical expenses in
funding these accounts, should provide important information to decision-makers
about Medical IRAs. The final project considers the impact of taxation on
individual portfolio decisions. Using the rich variation in tax rates provided
by the 1986 Tax Reform Act, and data from the 1983, 1992, and 1995 Surveys of
Consumer Finances, the research examines what effect, if any, changing tax rules
have had on the types of assets held by households in different tax situations.
The resulting estimates will provide a basis for assessing the inefficiencies
associated with tax-induced distortions in portfolio choice.
