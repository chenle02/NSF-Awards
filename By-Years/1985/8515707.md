This project will enable the United States to have a representative who will be
active in the activities of the International Standards Organiation. The
Organization is involved with research investigations and promulgation of
standards with respect to masonry construction, such as unreinforced and
reinforced masonry. The participation of the United States representative and
other colleagues will enable the United States research and professional
communities to keep abreast of new developments occurring in foreign countries.
The data resulting from this activity is very useful to the programs of the
National Science Foundation and to the United States academic, professional, and
construction communities.
