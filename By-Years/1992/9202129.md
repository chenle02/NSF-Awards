This is the first year of a three-year continuing award. The research uses the
concept of the dual surface to investigate theoretical and experimental
questions related to recognizing curved surfaces. The project is investigating
classes of surface for which the outline yields the complete projective geometry
of the surface (including algebraic surfaces, and others if they can be found to
exist), and classes of surface for which the outline yields some, but not all
projective invariants. The theoretical investigation will be aided by algorithm
implementation for recognition of a wide range of surfaces using projective
invariants measured from the outline.
