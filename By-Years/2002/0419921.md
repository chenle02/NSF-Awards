This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
real-time ultrasonic control of the tightening of bolted assemblies, using a
varying, stress-dependent, wave speed algorithm. Existing technology uses
ultrasonic measurement to verify the fastener tensile force by measuring its
elongations after it has been tightened and disregards the wave varying speed,
included in our control algorithm. The project will determine the sound wave
speed and the stress level correlation in solids, developing an algorithm to
vary the wave speed according to fastener elongation, integrating the ultrasonic
device and the new algorithm into the assembly tool, and assessing the validity
of the tabulated stress factor in ultrasonic measurements.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts resulting from this project will be
improvement in the transportation safety of passenger cars and trucks, it is
seen that his could help the U.S. economy and local economy by increasing
productivity through reduced downtime and warranty costs associated with failed
machines and products. Significant benefits to many industries, the aerospace,
transportation systems, nuclear and fossil power generation plants as well as
the automotive industry. &lt;br/&gt;
