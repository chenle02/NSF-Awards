Meiosis is a complex cellular process that occurs during the sexual reproduction
of all eukaryotic organisms including man. The process of meiosis involves the
assembly of complex cellular structures, including the synaptonemal complex, and
the spindle. We are studying two genes required for normal meiosis in
Drosophila: (1) c(3)G, which is required for the assembly of the synaptonemal
complex, and (2) cand, which encodes a kinesin-like mechanochemical protein that
is required for the assembly of the spindle. We have refined the cytogenetic
localization of c(3)G in order to facilitate the isolation of the gene by
molecular cloning. We now propose to isolate the c(3)G locus by chromosome
walking, and use the cloned gene to determine the nature and subcellular
localization of the gene product by DNA sequencing and antibody staining. We
also propose to identify additional genes required for synaptonemal complex and
spindle assembly by screening for mutations that display second-site
noncomplementation of c(3)G or cand. Gametes are formed in sexually reproducing
organisms by an intricate sequence of two cell divisions known as meiosis.
During meiosis special structures are formed in the dividing reproductive cells
which ensure that a precise and complete set of chromosomes is distributed into
each gamete. The cellular structures and mechanisms of meiosis are essential for
normal reproduction, since gametes carrying too many or too few chromosomes give
rise to grossly abnormal or inviable offspring. The detailed mechanisms of
meiosis are as yet poorly understood. This is a proposal to study genes of the
fruit fly Drosophila whose products play an essential role in meiosis.*** //
