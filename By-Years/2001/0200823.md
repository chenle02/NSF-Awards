A numerical model will be developed to simulate solar energetic particle (SEP)
event charge distributions, energy spectra, and relative abundances as functions
of space and time due to a propagating coronal mass ejection (CME) driven shock.
This model couples the hydrodynamics of the moving shock to the ion kinetics,
while at the same time accounting for non-equilibrium charge and energy change
processes. The level of realism is such that self-consistent comparisons with
SEP ion and plasma observations will be possible. In addition, a dedicated
parallel computing laboratory will be established at Roanoke College. This
laboratory will not only address the needs for numerical implementation of the
proposed model, but it will also provide training for undergraduate science and
non-science students in the developing information technology art of parallel
scientific computing.
