This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes a trunk-
supporting exoskeleton that minimizes the forces on the wearer?s back at L5/S1
location during bending and reaching. These systems would decrease the severity
and number of work-related back injuries while enhancing workers? safety. By
using these devices, automobile assembly and distribution center workers can
preserve their natural body postures when maneuvering parts and boxes, and thus
substantially reduce the strain associated with such work. Consequently, the
risk of back injuries will be greatly reduced in workers when using these
devices. In turn, the national cost of treating back injuries will be greatly
reduced. This project is in its infancy, but it has the potential to change the
way workers maneuver boxes and parts in distribution centers and assembly
plants. To accomplish this goal several technical challenges must be overcome.
The objective is to conduct a set of orthopedics, ergonomics, and metabolic
experiments not only to systematically characterize the system, but also use the
experiments for redesign and fine tuning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
impact/commercial potential of this proposed research is to dramatically improve
the quality of life for workers. The technologies proposed here will manifest in
development of broad classes of exoskeleton devices for workers who repeatedly
move light objects in factories, warehouses and distribution centers. This
project will decrease the risk of back injuries due to repetitive maneuvers in
warehouses, distribution centers, and auto assembly plants. This project will
decrease compensation indemnity claims involving back injuries and increase
availability of affordable assist systems for workers. The technological impact
of this proposed research stems from the system integration approach to
developing a class of assist devices customizable for a range of working
environments. This effort involves the deep integration and convergence of
mechanism design, ergonomics, orthopedics, and models for human spine.
