Professor Friedman is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research on developing
statistical mechanical theories for ionic solutions. Friedman uses formal theory
based on an integral equation treatment of a rigid, nonpolarizable interaction
site model (ISM) Hamiltonian. Using this theoretical model, he seeks to explain:
1) non-equilibrium solvation dynamics, 2) dielectric and charge transfer
phenomena, and 3) thermodynamic, structure and transport phenomena in
electrolyte solutions. Results are to be compared with computer simulations and
experiments. The aim of this research project is to improve the way the
measurable properties of solutions are interpreted in terms of the interactions
among the molecular constituents. This is particularly a challenge for ionic
solutions; the long range of the forces between the ionic charges strongly
affect both the measurable properties and the mathematical tools needed to
relate them to the molecular models.
