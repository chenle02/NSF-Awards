9400722 Hobbie Freshwater systems are a major feature of the arctic landscape,
despite the low precipitation, because permafrost prevents drainage and
evaporation is low. Their relative biotic simplicity offers advantages to
researchers attempting to sort out the various controls and interactions of
arctic lakes and streams. An understanding of the ecological processes is a
necessary part of the long-term goal of this project: prediction of the effect
of changes in land use and climate on arctic stream and lake ecosystems. This
project will be based at an LTER site, Toolik Lake, on the North Slope of
Alaska, and will make use of long-term experiments of stream and lake
fertilization and manipulations of the dominant predator in lakes, the lake
trout. These manipulations are maintained by the LTER group. The project will
also use LTER-produced data on basic environmental conditions including climate,
lake physics and chemistry, nutrient concentrations in streams and lakes, and
stream flow. The project will move strongly towards synthesis and use data
derived from all the past studies plus data from recent manipulations on streams
and lakes. The long-term goal of the synthesis and modeling is to understand the
movements and transformations of water, nutrients, and organic matter through an
entire watershed in the high Arctic. ***
