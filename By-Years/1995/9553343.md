CICNet, Inc. An Iowa Vision: Teamwork, Technology, and the Future of K-12
Science Education This grant combines the efforts and resources of the Iowa
Department of Education, the Area Education Agencies, the existing K-12
networking initiatives, and some of Iowa's top teacher education universities.
Through this coalition, partnership-building activities are designed to identify
current noteworthy resources, increase general awareness, and research the
feasibility and potential of key ingredients such as staff development,
continuing support, open access, cutting edge applications, and commercial
partnerships. A statewide meeting with national presenters will be organized,
regional meetings will be set up, and CICNet specialists will be deployed to
Iowa to coordinate the work of the task forces assigned to these activities.
Cost sharing is not included.
