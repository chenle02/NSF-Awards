AST 0307922 Slanger

Dr. Tom Slanger and colleagues at SRI International will perform observations of
the visible and near-infrared nightglow emissions from the atmospheres of Mars
and Venus, using the Hubble space Telescope and the ARC 3.5-m telescope at the
Apache Point Observatory, respectively. The Mars nightglow spectrum has never
been recorded previously, either by planetary probes or by near-Earth telescope
observations. Dr. Slanger predicts that Meinel band emissions from the OH
radical will be prominent features in the Mars nightglow and that these
emissions will provide essential information about the abundances of hydrogen
atoms and ozone molecules in the Mars middle atmosphere, and indirectly provide
information about the fate of atmospheric water. Observations of molecular and
atomic oxygen emissions will also be performed, providing important constraints
on models of oxygen atom profiles, about which we have little direct
information. This group's pioneering telescope observations of the visible
nightglow spectrum of Venus are having a significant impact. The discovery of
oxygen green-line emission has challenged current interpretations of oxygen
energy-transfer kinetics. That its intensity is highly variable (absent in 1975,
present in 1999, and absent again in 2001) motivates an on-going program of
observations to elucidate the origins of variability and the implications for
understanding dayside-to-nightside, horizontal, and vertical transport.

The project will be conducted in close collaboration with the Astronomy
Department at New Mexico State University. The extensive work carried out in
recent years using astronomical sky spectra will be substantially enhanced by
the direct collaboration and communication that will be required on this
project. Over the last decade, the SRI Molecular Physics Laboratory has acted as
host to almost 100 undergraduates in the NSF Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) program. This interaction will continue. ***
