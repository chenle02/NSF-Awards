This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at Ohio State University purchase laser equipment. This
equipment will be used in the following research activities: 1) Time correlated
single photon counting (TCSPC) for picosecond fluorescence lifetime
measurements. 2) Picosecond and femtosecond UV/Visible transient absorption
measurements. 3) Picosecond transient resonance Raman measurements and
picosecond transient IR absorption measurements. 4) Nonlinear optical (NLO)
characterization of materials using degenerate four wave mixing (DFWM) and the
optical Kerr effect (OKE). Lasers emit a narow beam of coherent, powerful and
nearly monochromatic electromagnetic radiation. This radiation is used in
Chemistry to study a broad range of subjects, from the dynamics of proteins and
nucleic acids to photoelectron transfer processes, and from interfacial
chemistry to picosecond pulse shaping. Lasers are also useful in optics,
communications, and engineering.
