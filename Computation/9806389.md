Numerous problems in area as diverse as VLSI design, game theory, artificial
intelligence, neural networks, operations research, statistics, reliability, and
finance can be modeled by using set functions, i.e., mappings of the subsets of
a finite set into the reals. It was noticed in the mid-60's by the PI that set
functions can be viewed as "pseudo-Boolean" functions, i.e., real valued
functions with 0-1 variables, and can be represented as multilinear polynomials.
It was noticed along the years that beside their polynomial representation,
pseudo-Boolean functions admit also other algebraic representations, e.g., as
additive posiforms, as logical posiforms, etc. It also turns out that various
types of applications may lead naturally to various types of representations.
Also, it can be seen that the solution of some of the most important problems
concerning pseudo-Boolean problems (finding a global optimum, finding a local
optimum, approximating the optimum, finding a good approximation of the
functions, finding a good majorant or minorant of the function) depends heavily
on the particular representation used. In this proposal the investigators will
deal mostly with the optimization of pseudo-Boolean functions with a heavy
emphasis on their representation. They will consider separately various problems
of optimization, majorization, approximation, etc., for pseudo-Boolean functions
given in polynomial form, in additive posiform, as well as in disjunctive
posiform representation. Beside investigations concerning the algebraic problems
of presentation, the investigators will lay heavy emphasis on the computational
aspects of the problem, and plan to elaborate specialized algorithms for exact
and heuristic optimization problems of pseudo- Boolean functions in various
forms, on local optimization, and on the detection of efficient methods for
particular classes of problems.

In numerous real-life situations, optimization problems have to be solved
involving decisions and selections between various alternatives. When, for
example, locations have to be found for cellular ground stations, emergency
facilities, warehouses, etc., the usual mathematical optimization procedures
cannot be applied blindly, since they may recommend the location of say half a
unit in one place and the other half in another. Therefore, new mathematical
techniques are needed to make sure that the solutions can only involve locating
either an entire unit in one place or no part of it in that place. Similar
problems occur when selections are made between projects to be undertaken,
people or equipment to be assigned to various tasks, or much more complex
situations where a large company (e.g. an airline) has to assign its equipment
(e.g. aircrafts) to its various activities (e.g. flights). In such situations,
the mathematical formulation of the problem requires the use of variables which
can only take the values of 0 or 1. In spite of its apparent simplicity, this
requirement can cause major mathematical and computational difficulties. This
project deals to a large extent with the problem of finding various mathematical
models describing situations like the above ones and developing optimization
techniques for handling them. A substantial amount of computational
experimentation is part of the project and will complement the mathematical
developments.
