The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is centered
around the ability to potentially reinvent interactions with indoor spaces.
Similar to how GPS has revolutionized how we explore the world outdoors, indoor
positioning can augment indoor experience with new information; having impact
through the whole chain from end users to the surrounding industries. For
example, the ability to track critical equipment indoors can save lives as in
the hospital ER, understanding the flow of people inside of buildings can
optimize our approach to energy management, and the availability of precise
navigation indoors can be used by both humans and robots to streamline factory
and warehouse operations. Commercially, the opportunity for this technology is
significant. The general indoor positioning market is estimate to grow 42%
annually to $10 billion by 2018. Today's indoor positioning solutions remain
imprecise and/or too cumbersome to deploy - diluting their commercial and
societal impact to date. This technology fills a crucial gap in this space by
providing indoor positioning that is at the same time accurate, compatible with
today's devices, and easy to deploy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project
concerns an indoor positioning platform that is accurate, compatible with any
Wi-Fi enabled user device (smartphones, tablets), and easily deployable.
Research in this area has led to the development of hardware and algorithms that
allow for sub-meter position accuracy indoors via easily manufactured compact
Wi-Fi nodes built from commodity hardware. Simply placing these nodes at known
locations in any indoor space allows for immediate positioning of user devices
without additional pre-deployment effort. While GPS has revolutionized outdoor
positioning, it does not work indoors. Current non-GPS solutions to this problem
compromise accuracy, or require expensive hardware or calibration in the
environment. This solution is both easy to deploy and accurate, filling an
important gap in the indoor positioning industry.
