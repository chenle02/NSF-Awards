This project centers on continued development of the Rice Convection Model (RCM)
to study the Earth's magnetosphere and its coupling to the ionosphere and
thermosphere. This three-year project concentration on eliminating the
fundamental shortcoming of the present RCM, namely the inconsistency between the
pressure distribution computed by the RCM from adiabatic-convection theory and
the magnetic forces implied by the inputted magnetic-field model. A new
algorithm will be developed for fast calculation of 3d magnetic fields that are
approximately consistent with RCM- computed pressure distributions. The first
convection-model calculation with approximately self-consistent B will asssume
steady inputs, no near-Earth neutral line, and no other major non-adiabatic
processes. The second self-consistent calculation will represent a classic,
idealized magnetospheric substorm, including a growth phase, an expansion phase
with disruption of the near-tail plasma sheet, and a recovery phase with
reconstitution of the plasma sheet. Work will continue on other RCM
investigations, including penetration of magnetospheric electric fields to low
ionospheric latitudes, transport of ring- current/radiation-belt particles, and
magnetic-field-aligned electric fields. Work applying the RCM to plasma
transport in the Jovian magnetosphere will be pursued, though at a rate that
depends on the prospects for appropriate data from the Galileo mission.
