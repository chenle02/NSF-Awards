This project by a doctoral student of anthropology investigates how industrial
workers and managers in a post-socialist setting (the Czech Republic) pursue
strategies which impact the economic "transition" to fully capitalist forms of
enterprise. Through surveys, interviews, and as an employee in the factory
setting, the student will collect the data needed to analyze the processes
whereby groups of workers come to think about their work and organize
themselves, and how these, in turn, affect processes and goals within specific
enterprises. The research will also document the political processes among
workers and identify how power and authority are exercised within the factory.
This research will contribute to the body of theory regarding industrial work in
different cultures and will provide practical approaches to enterprise
management as well as valuable insight to business ventures in the
region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
