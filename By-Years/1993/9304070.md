Recent studies have indicated that plate-tectonic processes were active at
least as far back as the early Proterozoic. Work has focused on orogenic
compressional features, and a fold and thrust belt, for example, has been
delineated in the Penokean orogeny in central Minnesota. However, little work
has been done on post-orogenic aspects of these old systems, and the
demonstration of large-scale extension during late-stage processes that helps
return rocks to the surface in young orogenies prompts the examination of this
possibility in the Penokean Orogeny. This project will employ structural
analysis and extensive age dating to attempt to constrain the timing of cooling
and to use these data to determine if simple erosion is sufficient or if
tectonic denudation was also involved. Results will help understanding of the
late-stage processes in the Penokean Orogeny and provide additional insight into
early proterozoic plate tectonics.
