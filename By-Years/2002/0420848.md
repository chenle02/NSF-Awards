0420848 Yu This is a proposal for applied biomedical engineering research at a
non-Ph. D granting institution. The PI is early in his career, but seems well
qualified, and has collaborators at major research universities (University of
Pittsburgh, Carnegie-Mellon). The equipment requested is both general purpose
and addresses a specific technological need, the development of more realistic
model circulatory system for testing medical devices.
