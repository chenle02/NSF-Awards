This research involves problems in Bayesian nonparametric statistics. The
Bayesian statistical theory will be advanced for unimodal and symmetric density
and monotone failure rate models. Furthermore, computing procedures will be
developed to allow these methods to be applied to realistic data. A second
problem involves statistics on a sphere for a rotationally symmetric model. In
this setting a Bayes method for directional data is provided for the cases of
large samples and small samples. In a third problem, the large sample properties
of the posterior distribution of a parameter are studied in the presence of
partial information. The last problem concerns the accuracy of the finite (or
infinite) Bayesian bootstrap approximation to posterior distributions with
respect to smooth prior distributions and the sampling distribution of a
corresponding statistic.
