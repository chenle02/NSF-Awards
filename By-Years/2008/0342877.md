With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program, the Department of Chemistry at Emory University will acquire an
isothermal titration calorimeter and a differential scanning calorimeter. This
equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including a) engineering
and structure/function studies of proteins; b) binding of reactant, inhibitors
and coenzyme to B12-dependent ethanolamine deaminase; c) design of self-
assembling peptide materials; d) template-directed polymer synthesis; and e)
exploration of colloidal systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Calorimetry is an
extremely useful tool in modern analytical chemistry. Calorimetric analysis is
used to measure the thermal energy (heat) exchange that occurs during molecular
interactions and reactions. Thus it can provide a very reliable and sensitive
method for determining the thermodynamic properties of materials such as changes
in heat capacity of liquid and solid samples. &lt;br/&gt;
