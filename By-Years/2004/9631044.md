Bond 9631044 Insects often avoid predation through their resemblance to the
backgrounds on which they rest. For example, the cryptically patterned forewings
of woodland moths blend into the tree bark, making them difficult to detect.
Many of these insects are polymorphic, which means that they occur in a variety
of distinctive forms. Predatory birds, such as blue jays, that feed on these
cryptic insects use a technique called hunting by searching image, in which they
concentrate their foraging efforts on one prey type at a time while effectively
ignoring the other types. This behavior improves their ability to detect
cryptically patterned prey. It has often been assumed that polymorphism in prey
species is an adaptive response to predators using searching images. This
relationship between the behavior of the predator and the population biology of
the prey has never been rigorously investigated. Using the responses of blue
jays to computer-generated images of moths on a cryptic, textured background,
the proposed research will explore several important features of the searching
image mechanism and examine the effects of the predator's behavior on the
diversity and abundance of prey.
