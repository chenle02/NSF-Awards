This is a recommendation for an award to support this Engineering Foundation
Conference. The investigator had conducted a similar conference under NSF Grant
No. 8513321 and has submitted an acceptable draft of a publication resulting
from that conference. The purpose of this award is to provide financial
assistance to the Engineering Foundation to support travel by four of the
participants who will make significant contributions to the conference. They are
Ludovico Spinosa (CNE-IRSA Bari, Italy); John Gregory (University College,
London, England); Garry Hoyland (Water Research Centre, Stevenage, England); and
Roger T. Haug (Consultant, City of Los Angeles, CA). The proposal is exempt from
peer review because it is for the conduct of a conference where reviews cannot
be obtained from persons who are both knowledgeable and uninvolved (Circular
132). Award is recommended in the amount of $5,289 to meet travel expenses for
the 4 key individuals listed above.
