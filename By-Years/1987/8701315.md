The application of base isolation systems to structures provides an excellent
alternative for seismic protection. Many base isolation systems are available
but an economic and effective system has not been developed for residential
structures. The purpose of the proposed research is to identify and evaluate the
physical characteristics that are required to make a "sand-joint" isolation
scheme effective and practicable for a seismic design of masonry dwellings. The
basic idea of the sand-joint is to form a relatively weak frictional plane at
the base of a masonry wall by separating the wall from the foundation with a
thin layer of sand. This joint isolates the structure from strong ground motion
in much the same manner as do more sophisticated base isolation mechanisms
currently being implemented in larger structures. Although the sand-joint
approach already has been introduced in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) on a
very limited basis, the optimal characteristics of this mechanism have not yet
been determined.
