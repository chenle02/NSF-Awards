Howard University has several researchers who would benefit from access to
supercomputers and access to other researchers connected to the NSFNET. The
campus will be connected with high speed lines (1.5 million bits per second) to
SURAnet, a mid-level network which provides connectivity to the National Science
Foundation Network, NSFNET, also through high speed communication lines. The
proposal submitted by the Departments of Electrical Engineering and Systems and
Computer Science also has the support of the University Computing Services
(UCS). These groups are working together on the future development of a high
capacity University.wide network. The need for high speed computer links is
initially focussed on providing network speeds suitable for access to
supercomputers for current and future demands of university researchers. Support
is requested for communications equipment, communication lines, and partial
defrayment of SURAnet membership fees.
