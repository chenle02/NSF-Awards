This project proposes will develop a laboratory component for a popular biology
course for non-science majors, Natural History of Alaska. This course serves 180
students per year and has a high enrollment of Alaskan Natives (15-20%) and pre-
service teachers (15-20%) The new laboratory exercises are designed as
explorations into the natural world. Students are encouraged to observe,
question, design their own studies, and present findings orally and in writing.
The laboratory component will set the agenda for the lecture portion of the
course. Plant community ecology, plant/herbivore interactions, stream and lake
ecology, adaptations for living in the cold, population dynamics, and
parasite/host relations are among the topics students will explore.
