Through this project, the department is implementing improvements in
computational chemistry, biochemistry, organic chemistry, and chemical
information courses. The use of these computer resources involves projects on
predicting reactivities of organic derivatives. A second phase of the project
addresses the use of databases available on the Internet to compare the three-
dimensional structure of recombinant peptides. Also, the project describes
accessing databases as part of the current chemical information course. Overall,
this project permits the integration of computer data and methods into the
undergraduate curriculum.
