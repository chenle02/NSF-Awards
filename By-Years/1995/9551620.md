In this project, a multipurpose computer is being used to complement traditional
laboratory and field investigations. Students carry out a variety of
simulations, use self-guided multimedia learning materials to learn laboratory-
and field- related concepts, and analyze data. They also manipulate and
quantitatively analyze images captured with microscope equipment and a new gel
scanner. The project allows faculty and students to create multimedia teaching
modules from original materials. Photographs, video, and sounds are being
digitized and edited. With presentation software, they are incorporated into
multimedia modules. These interactive modules are being made available in the
new laboratory, in existing laboratories, and over the university network for
students to study at their own pace. The new equipment includes the following:
(1) a computer laboratory with five Macintosh computers, five PC-compatible
computers, five laserdisc players, presentation and simulation software, and
several laserdiscs; (2) a Macintosh graphics development station with a capture
board, video tape recorder, video camera and software; and (3) a video scanner
and light boxes for electrophoresis and chromatography gels. The new laboratory
directly affects at least 360 science majors in the College of Science and
Engineering, including all entering freshmen biology majors, all sophomore
biochemistry and chemistry majors, and 130 upper-division biology students.
