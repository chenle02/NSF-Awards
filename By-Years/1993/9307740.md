Under the direction of Dr. George Cowgill, Mr. Saburo Sugiyama will collect
data for his doctoral dissertation. Over the course of many years of excavation
by both Mexican and U.S. archaeologists at the site of Teotihuacan in central
Mexico, many sacrificial human burials have been uncovered. Recently Dr. Cowgill
and his colleagues conducted excavations at the large Feathered Serpent Pyramid
and discovered a number more. Although these materials have the potential to
provide insight into Teotihuacan political, social and ritual organization they
have been relatively little studied. Mr. Sugiyama's project will help to remedy
this. Evidence indicates that the burials were carefully placed in relation to
the pyramid. Many contain rich grave offerings of carved stone and obsidian
tools. As a first step, Mr. Sugiyama will plot the spatial distribution of the
graves and then determine associations with burial objects. He will then search
for patterns in the arrangement of materials and place the graves in a
chronological context. On this basis he hopes to reconstruct the rituals
involved. Since these sacrifices were state ceremonies and ritual was
manipulated directly or indirectly for political goals, understanding of these
ceremonies will also shed light on the organization and maintenance of the
Teotihuacan state. Teotihuacan was one of the largest and most influential
cities in Mesoamerica in Pre-Columbian times. It flourished in central Mexico
between approximately the first century A.D. and the eighth, covering about 20
km2 with a population of at least 100,000 during its peak. The ecological
setting, the politics, the economy, the trade system, the technology, religion
and other aspects of ideology have been studied for an understanding of the
society and its history per se and for theories about the evolution of ancient
states in worldwide contexts. It is now known that the city was a unique example
of ancient urbanization in the New World. However, still poorly understood are
the specific form of the government and the nature of the ideological programs
in the development and functioning of this state. Mr. Sugiyama's research will
investigate these questions. This research is important for several reasons. It
will provide data of interest to many archaeologists. It will increase our
understanding of how complex societies developed and it will assist in the
training of a promising young scientist.
