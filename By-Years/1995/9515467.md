9515467 Wali This award provides travel support for Dr. Kameshwar Wali from the
Physics Department at Syracuse University to conduct collaborative research with
Dr. Girish C. Joshi, University of Melbourne School of Physics. The work will
focus on theoretical studies of elementary particle physics. This project will
investigate models for unified theories of elementary particle interactions
within the framework of noncommutative geometry and on mathematical objects such
as Octonians. Noncommutative geometry, as outlined by Prof. A. Connes, promises
to be a suitable framework for quantizing space, time and matter. The
investigators propose to study the role of gravitational forces in the structure
of magnetic monopoles, particularly the nonabelian magnetic monopoles which have
an extended structure. The work of Dr. Joshi in Australia is supported through
the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism (DIST).
