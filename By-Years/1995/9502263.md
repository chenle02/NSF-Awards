ABSTRACT CTS-9502263 Nicholas Abbott University of Cal Davis The research
focuses on the design of self-assembly systems using non-covalent interactions.
External fields such a light or electric potential will be applied to control
the molecular interactions and thereby modify macroscopic properties of the
surfactant systems. Also, self assembled monolayers will be used to direct the
anchoring of mesogens within thermotropic liquid crystals and obtain
macroscopically anisotropic electrical and optical properties. The research may
contribute to the development of drug-delivery systems, new separation
techniques, optical sensors and liquid crystalline displays. The educational
plan includes the development of an undergraduate laboratory for biochemical
engineering, and the introduction of graduate courses in molecular simulations
and design of advanced materials.
