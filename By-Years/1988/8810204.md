Under this project the P.I's will undertake the compilation and analysis of XBT
data from the equatorial Atlantic Ocean in support of the long-term objectives
of the Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere (TOGA) Program. Several lines across
the equatorial Atlantic are now being sampled routinely using XBT's. These data
will be collected, quality-controlled, and analyzed for annual and interannual
variability of the surface temperature and subsurface thermal structure. These
results will be correlated with atmospheric data and incorporated into models in
order to assess the impact of the thermal structure on longer term climate
changes.
