The project combines field measurements with numerical modeling to investigate
tide-induced residual circulation and dispersion in coastal embayments. A
shipboard Doppler current profiler and moored current meters will be deployed in
Vineyard Sound in a two-month field program designed to observe the spatial
variations in tidal and residual flow around a headland. The numerical modeling
will involve three components: a set of idealized studies of tidal flow around a
headland; realistic simulations of the field site and of the basinwide
circulation in Buzzards Bay and Vineyard Sound; and numerical Lagrangian drifter
experiments in the idealized and physically realistic domains. The overall
objective of this research is to characterize advective and dispersive transport
in coastal bays and well-mixed estuaries caused by tide-induced circulation.
