Dickinson College, located in Carlisle, PA, is the recipient of ARI funds to
underwrite part of a renovation project for the Althouse Science Building,
constructed in 1957. In order to improve upon a research oriented curriculum in
chemistry, existing laboratory space will be upgraded and relocated to support
research and research training in organic synthesis. Phase I of the renovation
project will relocated a faculty research laboratory in proximity to a research
laboratory for advanced students, and primary teaching laboratories for the
faculty member. Space will be reconfigured to provide modern research facilities
for work in applications of organoiron systems to organic synthesis. Phase II of
the renovation will upgrade research training space and infrastructural
utilities used for advanced synthesis studies. The student research laboratory
will become the model for the development of future research space for advanced
chemistry students. The impact of the improved research environment will allow
the Chemistry Department to implement key aspects of a curriculum that
encourages students to deduce principles from research experience, and support
the investigative activities of faculty engaged in synthesis research.
