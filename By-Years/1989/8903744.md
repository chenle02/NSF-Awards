The interaction between light and the plasma membrane of growing leaf cells is
the focus of this proposal. Leaf expansion requires light. Most dicotyledonous
leaves remain very small in the dark, expand slightly in response to (red) light
of low fluence rates, but they require continuous exposure to (white) light of
high fluence rates to reach full size. this photoresponse is a "high-
irradiance" response of phytochrome occurring in green tissue, and it may
involve additional activity of a blue-light receptor. The mechanism(s)
transducing light absorption to cell growth will be pursued by testing the
following hypotheses: 1) red and blue light act through two photoreceptors to
stimulate cell growth in leaves, 2) blue light stimulates proton efflux driven
by an electron transport system in the plasma membrane, 3) red light acts
through phytochrome to modulate potassium flux through ion channels. These
possibilities will be tested in primary leaves of Phaseolus vulgaris L. which
provide a well documented model system for light stimulated cell expansion. The
generality of their responses will be tested in leaves of other species
(Populus, Vicia, Impatiens) which grow differently in response to light. %%% The
goal of the research is to determine how leaf cell enlargement in plants is
controlled and what is the nature of the molecules involved in their growth
response to light.
