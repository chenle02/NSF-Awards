9418773 Blake This project is part of the Southern Hemisphere Marine Aerosol
Characterization Experiment (ACE-1), which will be conducted in the remote
Southern Pacific in 1995 using aircraft, ship-board, and ground-based
measurements of a wide variety of chemical species, physical and meteorological
parameters with the central goal of investigating the formation, evolution, and
optical properties of atmospheric aerosol. In this component, whole air samples
will be collected on-board the NCAR C-130 aircraft during most flights of the
ACE-1 project. After the completion of each such flight, the samples will be
shipped to the PI's home laboratory and assayed for about 25 halocarbons and 40
non-methane hydrocarbons. A five column/six detector gas chromatography
apparatus will be used for analyzing the samples. The analysis of these whole
air data will be useful for the interpretation of other measurements aboard the
aircraft by providing information on the origin of the air encountered. The
latitudinal profiles of halocarbons and hydrocarbons that will be obtained in
the transit flights will provide useful information regarding source and sink
distributions of different atmospheric gases. Vertical profiles for gases of
different atmospheric lifetimes yield information on transport processes. These
data will be useful for the atmospheric modeling community. Data taken during
Southern Hemisphere vertical profiles over remote marine regions will be used
for flux calculations, ultimately leading to source strength estimates for
biogenic hydrocarbons and halocarbons.
