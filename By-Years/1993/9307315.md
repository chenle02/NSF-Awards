9307315 Schnabel This project is concerned with making massively parallel MIMD
computers more usable and used by application scientists and engineers. It now
seems clear that massively parallel, distributed memory MIMD machines either are
or soon will be the most powerful supercomputers available, in terms of memory
and speed. So far, however, their use by applications scientists has been
seriously hampered by the lack of easy-to-use, efficient, and portable
programming support. It has also been hampered by the natural reluctance of
scientists and engineers to move their applications to a new computing
environment. This proposal addressed both of these problems, through the
symbiotic development of language, compiler, and run-time support for parallel
scientific programming, along with the development of substantial parallel
scientific applications in computational fluid dynamics and optimization.
