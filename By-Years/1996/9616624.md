9616624 Lee The overall objective of this project in intelligent structural
systems is to advance the state-of-the-art and state-of-practice of seismic
protective systems technology. In particular, application to the construction of
new and more advanced structures and the rehabilitation of existing construction
using such intelligent technologies will be emphasized. Special attention is
given to two important areas. The first explores the application of protective
systems as a global retrofit for welded moment-resisting steel frames under
near-source seismic conditions such as those experienced in recent Northridge
and Kobe earthquakes. The second area addresses the technical and fiscal
implications of using protective systems to rehabilitate masonry and non-ductile
concrete buildings. In addition, theoretical and experimental studies will be
undertaken to permit the comprehensive evaluation and comparison of passive and
semi- active systems. The following tasks will be performed to complete the
proposed research: (1) Test beds for performance, evaluation and comparison; (2)
Near-source ground motions; (3) Application to welded moment-resisting steel
frames; (4) Application to rehabilitation of concrete and masonry buildings; and
(5) Development of simplified methods of analysis and design guidelines. ***
