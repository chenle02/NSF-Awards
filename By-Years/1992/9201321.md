The principal investigator will use methods from Riemann surface theory to
study problems in dynamical systems. In particular, he will use the theory of
quadratic differentials and Teichmuller theory to study the ergodic theory of
measured folliations, interval exchange transformations, and rational billiards.
This award will support research in the general area of dynamical systems. A
process which is very simple and easy to understand locally can become extremely
complicated, nonlinear, and difficult to analyze globally. Dynamical systems is
the study of this local to global relationship. Many physical systems can best
be modeled using this area of mathematics including fluid flow and turbulence,
complex biological systems, mechanical systems, and chemical reactions.
