Current cybersecurity practice is inadequate to defend against the security
threats faced by society. Unlike physical systems, present-day computers lack
supervising safety interlocks to help prevent catastrophic failures. Worse, many
exploitable vulnerabilities arise from the violation of well-understood safety
and security policies that are not enforced due to perceived high performance
costs. This project aims to demonstrate how language design and formal
verification can leverage emerging hardware capabilities to engineer practical
systems with strong security and safety guarantees. The ultimate goal is to
strengthen the security foundation upon which today's information-based society
is built, thereby improving national security by providing capabilities to
protect critical infrastructure from misuse and cyber-attack, as well as
protecting individual privacy and reducing opportunities for cyber-
muggings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A rich set of micro-policies - instruction-level
security monitoring mechanisms based on fine-grained metadata tags - can be
described as instances of a common dynamic monitoring framework, formalized and
reasoned about with unified verification tools, and efficiently implemented
using programmable metadata-propagation hardware. Specific project contributions
include (1) a linguistic framework for defining and combining micro-policies,
with a verified compiler and a framework for carrying out machine-checked proofs
of key security properties; (2) architectural extensions and microarchitectural
optimizations for micro-policy enforcement in hardware with low performance
overhead and acceptable resource costs; and (3) applications of the micro-policy
language, proof framework, and hardware support to implement, verify, and
evaluate a number of concrete micro-policies on realistic application workloads.
