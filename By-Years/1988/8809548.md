This research involves computer modeling of the patterns of aggregates formed
when individual small particles become attached to a seed particle or to a
preexisting aggregate. It will explore the regime where the rate of transport by
Brownian diffusion to the aggregate and the rate of attachment are of comparable
magnitude. Simulations regarding the particles as discrete objects and
simulation regarding particles continuously distributed will be developed.
Aggregate morphology can greatly influence the characteristics of particle
agglomerates including their optical, rheological, and packing properties. This
research should help relate agglomerate morphology to the transport and growth
kinetics.
