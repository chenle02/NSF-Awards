The conference brings together meteorologists, hydrologists and civil engineers
to discuss advances made in the simulation of precipitation at mesoscale or
catchment scale. This meeting is a follow up of the first meeting of this nature
that took place in March 1986. In the past two years considerable progress has
been made. New operational mesoscale precipitation models exist; new
multidimensional stochastic models of precipitation have been proposed;
significant new data sets are available; large experiments are planned; and
recent results of research question the concept of clustering at the convective
cell scale. The interaction between these research communities is timely and
will benefit the forecasting of floods.
