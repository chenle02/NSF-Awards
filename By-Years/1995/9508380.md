This action funds a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biosciences Related to
the Environment for 1995. This program of fellowships to individuals provides
opportunities for Fellows to gain additional scientific training beyond the
doctoral degree and to pursue innovative and imaginative research into the
fundamental mechanisms underlying the interactions between organisms and their
environment at the molecular, cellular, organismal, population, community,
and/or ecosystem level in any area of biology supported by the Directorate for
Biological Sciences of the National Science Foundation. This program is designed
to enable selected scientists early in their careers to improve and expand their
research skills, to direct their research efforts across traditional
disciplinary lines, and to avail themselves of unique research resources and
facilitites, including foreign locations. The research and training plan
supported by this fellowship is entitled: The effects of climate variability on
plant succession in coastal Lake Michigan sand dunes during the past 2400 years.
