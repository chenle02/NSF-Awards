Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The PIs are requesting funds to acquire a Coulter-
Beckman Multisizer 3 Electronic Particle Analyzer and associated preparatory
instruments. The PIs will be the primary users of the proposed instrument, with
participation by undergraduates. Research efforts include the characterization
of sediment in the deep pelagic Atlantic and Pacific oceans as part of
paleoeanography/paleoclimate investigations, and the flux and fate of
terrestrial sediment in the nearshore of southern
California.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;Indiana University
of Pennsylvania is primarily an undergraduate university and all of the
geoscience majors are involved in primary research; the institution encourages
faculty-student research supported by internal and external grants. The proposed
instrumentation will directly contribute to the research and training of
undergraduates pursuing science (Geology Track and Environmental Track) and
education (Earth and Space Science Education and General Science Education)
majors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
