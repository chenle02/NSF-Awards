Static non-linear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) describe a variety of
problems in physics and engineering. Numerical schemes are commonly used to
approximate the solution satisfying particular boundary conditions. Such schemes
usually require solving a large system of coupled non-linear discretized
equations. Iterative methods for such systems can be very expensive
computationally, often leading practitioners to use alternative problem
descriptions to avoid solving the full boundary value problem. The investigator
proposes a family of fast (non-iterative) methods for a wide class of static
PDEs, for which the direction of "information flow" defines a natural ordering
on the discretized equations. In a joint work with J.A. Sethian, non-iterative
Ordered Upwind Methods (OUMs) were introduced for Hamilton-Jacobi PDEs arising
in anisotropic (& hybrid) control and in front propagation. The investigator
proposes to extend OUMs to boundary value problems describing differential games
and non-autonomous optimal control problems. In a joint work with J.
Guckenheimer, the OUMs were previously applied to a special system of
quasilinear PDEs to approximate invariant manifolds of vector fields. The
investigator proposes to extend the invariant manifold approach to compute
multi-valued solutions of boundary value problems.

The efficiency of the proposed methods stems from the notion of "causality" --
unobvious yet natural ordering of the elements of computation. This approach is
relevant for the applications as diverse as robotic navigation and
photolithography, seismic imaging and computational geometry, optics and
transient elastography, differential games and segmentation of images. Which
trajectory is optimal for a rover traveling on the surface of Mars? With what
delay and how strongly will an underground explosion be felt by a sensor at a
given point on the surface? What are the optimal parameter values for etching
and deposition in the integrated circuit manufacturing? What is the minimum safe
distance for the aircraft collision avoidance? Will the electrical power system
automatically recover after a "fault"? Answering these important practical
questions in real time requires efficient and robust numerical methods for
solving the corresponding partial differential equations.
