A 3-year program is proposed to explore the interactions of atomic oxygen with
ice surfaces at temperatures relevant to the high-latitude summertime
mesosphere. In particular, experiments are proposed to quantify the loss rate of
atomic oxygen on ice surfaces and to investigate atomic oxygen effects on the
heterogeneous formation and growth rates of ice. Oxygen atom recombination will
be studied using a Knudsen cell reactor, together with laser-induced
fluorescence and mass spectroscopic species detection. Atomic oxygen effects on
ice formation and growth will be investigated using a cryogenic test chamber,
Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and optical thin-film
measurement techniques.

The overall goal is this work is to provide experimental information to identify
and clarify possible roles of mesospheric atomic oxygen in heterogeneous
atmospheric chemistry and ice dynamics. The results of this project will aid in
interpreting measurements of oxygen-atom and ice-particle distributions in the
high-latitude summertime mesosphere and will provide insight for constructing
numerical models for mesospheric phenomena such as noctilucent clouds (NLCs) and
polar mesospheric summertime echoes (PMSEs).
