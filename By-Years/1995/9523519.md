ABSTRACT CTS-9523519 Kostic N. Ill. University This proposal is to fund
innovative exploratory research on the measurement of the thermal conductivity
of polymers during shear flow. It is known that the thermal conductivity
measurement for certain polymers under no-flow conditions is different from that
found during shear flow, and this work will attempt to measure thermal
conductivity under actual shear flow conditions. This work should help
understanding of the fundamental conduction process during the shear flow of
polymers, and the results may aid designers of equipment that involves heat
transfer to a flowing polymer.
