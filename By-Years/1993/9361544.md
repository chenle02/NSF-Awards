9361544 Markham Advanced Fuel Research Inc. (AFR) has pioneered a technique to
determine temperatures along a "line-of-sight" into transparent materials. It
involves measuring infrared radiance spectra, for materials with well-
characterized, temperature-dependent optical constants. The objective this
proposal is to demonstrate that Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) radiance
spectra can be used to extract the average temperature at the slurry-sample
interface during micromachining processes. Feasibility will be demonstrated by
performing FT-IR radiance measurements through samples to the slurry interface,
for two systems: colloidal silica lapping of sapphire, and diamond lapping of
silicon. The latter case represents the dicing of silicon wafers. At present
there is no way to measure the slurry-sample interface temperature during
micromachining. The successful completion of Phases 1 and 11 would lead to an
on-line process monitor for the micromachining of single-crystal ceramics, as
well as to increased understanding of the processes involved. ***
