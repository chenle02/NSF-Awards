The research will develop procedures and guidelines for seismic design and
restraint of hazardous piping systems located in industrial-facility buildings.
The design level for piping systems will be vased on the importance of the
piping and the intensity of the seismic loading. A piping importance rating will
be developed, based on OSHA and EPA standards for hazardous fluids. Seismic
zpnation, including local soil characteristics and the respnse of diverse types
of buildings, will be considered in the development of seismic design
parameters. A computer code which incorporates state-of-the-art technology in
the seismic area systems.
