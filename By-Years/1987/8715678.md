Diffusivity is an important property for the design of adsorption separation
systems, gas purification, and catalytic conversion processes. Porous zeolite
systems are often used to perform the transport processes. The measurement of
diffusivities in molecular sieve zeolites has resulted in large, unexplained
differences between values determined by adsorption techniques and the nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) method. The possible explanations for these differences
are (1) failure to account for thermal effects, (2) failure to account for mass
transfer resistance, (3) failure to account for a surface barrier resistance at
the crystal surface, (4) differences in the crystal structure of the adsorbent,
and (5) differences in the regeneration of the adsorbent. There is now the
unique possibility of simultaneously measuring the diffusivities in identical
systems by three independent methods. Analysis of the results will yield
significant insights into the dilemma of the large differences reported in the
literature, and this study may provide improved design capabilities for mass
transfer processes involving gas diffusion in microporous media.
