99422915 Land This award provides partial funding for the support of a
laboratory technician to oversee the operation and maintenance of the solid-
source thermal ionization mass spectrometry laboratory in the Department of
Geological Sciences at the University of Texas, Austin. The institution is
committed to providing the remaining funds required. The technician will be
responsible for assisting users, especially students, in obtaining high quality
data, and in enhancing the capabilities of the mass spectrometer through
software development, hardware testing and calibration. The thermal ionization
mass spectrometer laboratory is engaged in research and teaching projects of
several faculty members requiring the determination of high-precision isotopic
compositions of boron, strontium, neodymium, lead, rubidium, and thorium as well
as the determination of the trace abundances of rare-earth elements by isotope
dilution techniques. ***
