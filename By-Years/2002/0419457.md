This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will target the
development of a process to produce valuable hydrogen and sulfur from toxic
hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Current commercial technology converts H2S into water
and sulfur, thereby losing a valuable source of hydrogen. Sulfur polymerization
mechanisms for the proposed process have determined using computational
chemistry. As a result, new sulfur polymerization agents were identified and
will be verified experimentally in this work. New catalyst supports have also
been identified and will be evaluated.

The amount of hydrogen consumption to remove sulfur represents from 25 to 40% of
the total hydrogen requirement. Hence, putting the hydrogen in H2S on total
recycle within a refinery could significantly reduce capital and operating
costs.
