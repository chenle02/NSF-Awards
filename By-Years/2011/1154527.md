This enhanced renewal S-STEM project is awarding 64 scholarships to academically
talented STEM students (in all majors) with financial need. The objectives of
the project are: 1) decreasing student reliance on loans and full-time work 2)
increasing the graduation rate of the Scholars compared to the graduation rate
of other students in STEM disciplines who are not receiving scholarship support;
3) improving the educational support system by providing cohort activities,
academic support services, research projects, STEM internships, and mentoring;
4) increasing the number of students entering the STEM workforce or graduate
school; 5) widening the pipeline to STEM programs via outreach to local schools
and in-reach to CSU freshmen; 6) increasing access to education to
underrepresented minorities and first generation students. Recruitment,
selection, and career placement are the responsibility of a faculty committee
with the support of an industrial/community advisory board.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is the expected
increased understanding of how to best engage underrepresented minorities and
first generation college students in obtaining a baccalaureate in a STEM field.
The academic programs into which the students go are strong, and there are
extensive academic support activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact
of this activity is directly related to providing better systems of support and
cultivation of untapped natural resources within their communities: human
capital unrealized. Many underrepresented minority and first generation students
are very talented but face many barriers that impede their success. The project
is enabling these students to complete a STEM major and enter the workforce.
