the American Association for the Advancement of Science, in collaboration with
the Association of Science-Technology Centers and several science centers, has
requested $837,958 in NSF support of a project to make science museums more
accessible to minority groups. In the project, AAAS and ASTC propose to provide
technical assistance and staff training to science museums on equity issues,
with emphases on institutional self- assessment, developing effective science
education programs reaching minority audiences, and working effectively with
community organizations and other institutions serving minority groups. Several
museum sites will be involved initially in the development of the four program
components: 1. development of guidelines for an equity self-assessment in
museums; 2. science equity training for all museum staff; 3. the development of
relationships between museums and community groups and schools and colleges and
universities that serve minorities; and 4. a national effort to create awareness
among minority groups of employment opportunities in science museums. Additional
dissemination will be provided through training workshops and sessions at museum
conferences. A "how-to" guide and video will be developed for museums on
conducting an equity self-assessment. //
