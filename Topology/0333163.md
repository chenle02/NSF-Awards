Building on ideas and techniques developed in proposer's previous works, the
proposal is to pursue two projects related to aspects of Floer theory. The first
is to relate the 3- and 4-manifold invariants recently defined by Ozsvath and
Szabo (OS) with the Seiberg-Witten invariants (SW), based on an extension of the
geometric picture underlying Taubes's proof of the equivalence of Seiberg-Witten
invariants and Gromov invariants of symplectic 4-manifolds. Since the two
definitions (OS vs SW) are drastically different and each has its own advantage,
a relation of the two should yield important consequences in low-dimensional
topology. The second project is to extend and generalize the proposer's recent
work on Floer-theoretic torsions. These are symplectic invariants which on one
hand refine the Floer homology, on the other hand have interesting relations
with "1-loop" Gromov-Witten invariants. The relation remains to be better
understood, yet it has already been used to obtain results in symplectic
topology which are beyond the the reach of Floer homologies. Moreover, the
Lagrangian intersection version of this invariant should be regarded as a
simplest example of "open Gromov-Witten invariants", which though still not
rigorously defined in general, are expected to relate to the Chern-Simons
invariants according to the physicists (Vafa, Witten et al).

This proposal showcases the recent fertile interactions between mathematics and
high energy physics. Gauge-theoretic invariants, enumeratitve invariants of
holomorphic curves, and Floer theory all have their origin in physics, yet have
since yielded the most important recent results in the fields of low dimensional
topology and symplectic geometry. The proposal deals with fascinating relations
among these physics-inspired invariants, and their applications to topology.
