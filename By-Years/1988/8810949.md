Periodic or quasi-periodic variations in key paleoclimatic indicators (benthic
foraminiferal .18O and .13C, %CaCO3, and planktonic foraminiferal populations)
occurred between roughly 3 and 2.47 Myr. Using data analyses and sensitivity
experiments with General Circulation Models, this project will explore whether
these oscillations were driven by variations in relatively small Northern
Hemisphere ice sheets that did not calve icebergs to the open Atlantic ocean or
by large-scale changes in Arctic sea-ice limits. Among many possible causes of
the Northern Hemisphere ice age, the project will explore the effect of large-
scale tectonic uplift in Southeast Asia (Tibet, Himalayas) and the American
southwest (Colorado Plateau, Rockies) on the Northern Hemisphere planetary waves
(and thus on climate at the earth's surface). New analyses will extend the high-
resolution isotopic time series, and experiments with a model including an
interactive mixed-layer ocean will define more accurately the full climatic
effects of Late-Cenozoic tectonic uplift. %%% This project will examine climatic
fluctuations preceding the initiation of the "Pleistocene" ice ages and the
initiation of the ice age itself (which actually began 3.2 million years ago;
approximately 1.0 million years before the Pleistocene began). The project will
utilize computer models of climate interactions in order to examine the feed-
back mechanisms of climate and ocean environments with the tectonic uplifts of
major high-altitude land masses. This will be the first attempt to model so many
of the variables the cause of respond to climate changes that resulted in the
initiation of the ice ages.
