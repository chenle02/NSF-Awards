This project is being supported under a special funding focus for STEP,
"Graduate 10K+," an activity of the National Science Foundation, supported in
part by donations from the Intel Foundation and the GE Foundation, to stimulate
comprehensive action at universities and colleges to help increase the annual
number of new B.S. graduates in engineering and computer science by 10,000 over
the next decade. In particular, this project team is focusing on first-time,
first-year college students who are not calculus ready, and first-time sophomore
students who are missing up to two courses necessary to be classified as part of
their class-level cohort. Students with these characteristics are "at risk" of
leaving their engineering and computer science courses of study, even though
they may be in good academic standing. The intellectual merit of the project
lies in its coordinated adaptation of a set of best practices: 1) dedicated
counseling throughout the academic year regarding attaining and keeping cohort
status, 2) an academic Summer Bridge program for non-calculus ready first-year
students, and 3) ongoing retention tracking for various sub-populations within
the institution. A dedicated STEP counselor is coordinating weekly individual
and group program meetings designed to guide students throughout the academic
year, to advise on key summer course selections, if needed to regain cohort
status, and to use available tutoring and workshop services to avoid
withdrawals. The project's broader impacts are being realized through the
framing of the project as a research study to investigate the connection between
maintaining class-level cohort status and retention, and leveraging professional
opportunities at national and regional conferences to draw attention to the
broader set of efforts at boosting retention in STEM and build a community of
practitioners.
