This research aims to develop a unified framework for integrating surveys so as
to guide the design of a multi-purpose survey program. Algorithms will be
developed for optimal integration based on more than one objective function and
for sequential integration of surveys. The investigators will attempt to use the
one-to-one correspondence between general sampling schemes and unit-by-unit
sequential sampling to reduce the size of the underlying transportation problem,
thereby expediting the solution of the integration problem and, in certain
cases, providing solutions in simple closed form. This research addresses the
problem of integrating surveys. The problem of designing a cost-effective
sampling program for two or more surveys which maximize the overlap between the
old and the new samples is known to be of considerable practical interest in the
design of large-scale periodic and multi-purpose surveys. Although this problem
has been studied for several decades, no unified theory for it has yet been
developed. The object of this project is to develop a unified framework within
which to evaluate the integration of surveys. New algorithms and computer
software will be developed for optimal integration of surveys under general
sampling schemes. Optimality properties of these and other existing methods will
be evaluated.
