There are multiple applications for compact particle accelerator, especially
high energy ıTens of MeV! and high current ıKA! output. Gradients of 10 to 20
MV/m are possible only with RF accelerators, and existing Linear Induction
Accelerators do not operate at over 1 MV/m. Tetra Corporation has developed an
insulator technology to suppress and enhance vacuum surface flashover. The
technology has been demonstrated to operate up to the gap's vacuum breakdown
strength 40 MV/m at 100 ns long pulses, with the estimated theoretical limit in
the 100's of MV/m range. This technology will be developed for use in linear
induction accelerators and dielectric wall induction linacs. At the present, the
technology has been demonstrated for use as a vacuum dielectric insulator for
gradients of 40 MV/m at pulse length of 100 to 200 nsec. There is evidence that
at shorter pulses (10 to 50 nsec or shorter) the breakdown strength will
increase. The Phase II program will develop a compact accelerator for two basic
commercial opportunities; waste treatment and reduction, and a source for
compact electron microscopy. Design is extended to include a better structural
protection and the ability to be driven with a high current single pulse source
or RF.
