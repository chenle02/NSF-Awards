The University of Houston establishes a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) Site affiliated with its Center for Materials Chemistry. Ten students are
recruited nationwide every year for a nine-week summer research experience.
Students participate in research projects in the general areas of synthesis,
characterization, and physical studies of materials, including the synthesis of
organic, inorganic and composite materials, instrument-intensive physical
studies of materials, and theoretical modeling of materials. REU participants
also take a three-credit Independent Studies course in materials chemistry,
attend scientific seminars and participate in organized social
activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
