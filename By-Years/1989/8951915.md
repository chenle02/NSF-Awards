Physiograph equipment will be purchased to be used in a number of courses. These
courses include Human Biology, Plant and Animal Biology, Life Science I, II, and
Anatomy and Physiology. The students to be affected tend to be disadvantaged,
and will gain significantly in their understanding of scientific principles from
the hands-on experience of performing ECG and EEG experiments, respiration
exercises, and studying electrochemical activity of the heart and muscles. Large
numbers of students will be affected, many of whom are future teachers. The
school will provide 50% matching funds.
