This project will incorporate into the chemistry curriculum at Spelman College
principles and applications of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). New
experiments introduced into courses in organic chemistry and instrumental
analysis will teach students current state- of-the-art methods of chemical
measurement and analysis. In addition, the powerful analytic technique of GC/MS
will greatly enhance the ongoing research efforts of undergraduate students.
With the addition of GC/MS capability to its honors programs and research
projects, Spelman College continues its significant contribution to science
education of Black women undergraduates.
