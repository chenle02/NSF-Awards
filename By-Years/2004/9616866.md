Schechter, Paul AST 96-16866 Dr. Schechter will continue his study of
gravitational lenses in a three-part program. The first is to continue the
reconnaissance of known and new quadruple lens systems. The second is to conduct
intensive monitoring of PG1115+080, a gravitational lens for which multiple time
delays have been measured. The third is to develop algorithms and reduction
methods to reduce the uncertainty of the measurements as close as possible to
the photon limit.
