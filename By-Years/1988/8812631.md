A workshop will be convened to discuss theoretical developments and methods of
testing predictions between different spatial and temporal scales. The
objectives of the workshop are to (1) foster increased interaction among
scientist of different ecological disciplines who are actively working on
extrapolating information between spatial and temporal scales; (2) analyze
recent theoretical developments; (3) present case studies demonstrating
ecological processes for which the scale of measurement influences the
interpretation; (4) discuss relevant mathematical, statistical, and geographical
methods for extrapolating information across scales; and (5) identify critical
needs for future research. The results of the workshop will be conveyed to the
general scientific community through a summary report in the Bulletin of the
Ecological Society of America and a special issue of Landscape Ecology that will
contain papers discussing theoretical issues and case studies. It is critical
that a concerted effort be made to develop new syntheses and define important
research objectives needed to interface predictions, results, and data from
different spatial or temporal scales.
