*** 96-61064 Winstead This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will develop and experimentally validate a comprehensive computational
model for electromagnetically coupled metallurgical processes. The model
incorporates an efficient approach for predicting the interaction among
electromagnetic, fluid dynamic, and heat transfer subsystems. Phase I will
demonstrate the feasibility of the unified approach by developing a two-
dimensional model that solves for alternating magnetic fields, turbulent fluid
dynamics, conjugate heat transfer, and phase change. It will be capable of
modeling processes that involve deformation and containment of free-surfaces,
metal solidification, and particle transport. Phase II would extend the model to
three dimensions and additional electromagnetic configurations. Commercial
application of the computational model is expected in many material
manufacturing processes involving electromagnetic fields. These processes
include induction furnaces, electromagnetic casting, refining, stirring,
shaping, pumping, and braking systems. ***
