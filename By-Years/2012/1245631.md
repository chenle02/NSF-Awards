This project is enhancing the Earth and Environmental Science curriculum at New
Jersey City University, a Hispanic-Serving Institution with diverse students in
an urban setting, through acquisition and integration of an automated particle-
size analyzer based on X-ray absorption. The instrument is being used to
facilitate inquiry-based learning across a wide range of courses, with a
particular focus on contaminated urban soils, and to support placed-based
undergraduate research during the summers and in the academic year. The
intellectual merit of the project lies in its well-crafted plan to achieve
specific learning objectives related to skills in analytical and quantitative
reasoning and problem solving. Broader impacts include increasing participation
of diverse, urban students in the geoscience workforce, and promoting an
interdisciplinary Urban Environmental Science Program that can serve as a model
for similar institutions.
