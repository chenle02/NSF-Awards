Research will be carried out in photonuclear physics at the Brookhaven National
Laboratory (BNL)/LEGS facility, at The Svedberg (cyclotron) Laboratory (TSI) in
Sweden, and at the CEBAF laboratory. The principal focus will be on experiments
which probe multinucleon exchange currents. Linearly polarized and monoenergetic
high energy gammas will be used in exclusive three-body breakup of He-3 at BNL.
High resolution proton capture reactions at TSI will be used to explore many
body currents in complex nuclei. For CEBAF activities, design and construction
of Cerenkov detectors for proposed experiments with the large acceptance
spectrometer will be undertaken.
