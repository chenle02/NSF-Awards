Full Center Proposal (Phase I) for an I/UCRC for Health Organization
Transformation

0832439 Texas A&M University System (lead institution); Larry Gamm 0832390
Georgia Institute of Technology; Eva Lee Texas A &M Health Science Center and
Georgia Tech propose a center "Center for Health Organization
Transformation"(CHOT)to conduct mixed methodology, applied research on the
antecedents, execution, and effects of transformational interventions and
strategies that combine evidence-based management, clinical and information
technology innovations, and ongoing organizational learning and cultural change.
The proposed work can result in improved health care quality and more effective
use of financial and system resources in the delivery of health care. The
research is designed to produce transformation in a critical industry, and the
proposed team makes a credible case that the scope of the problem indicates a
need for whole-system, transformative change.

Since the health care sector is a significant segment of the US economy,
enabling more effective use of resources within this sector could positively
impact the economy. More specifically, the proposed research will benefit
quality of patient care, operations efficiency of the healthcare delivery
systems, and workforce transformation. These successes will be propagateda cross
the practicing health systems in the nation through the center's industrial
partners as well as the center directors and investigators.Research teams for
the proposed center are made up of a diverse set of research faculty and
graduate students,working closely with health system leaders. The center
activities will support improvements in both masters' and doctoral level
education and research. Broader dissemination will occur via professional and
academic associations and conferences,and other mechanisms. Both schools are
committed to inclusion of a diverse faculty and student body.
