In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Prof. Thaddeus of the Harvard-Smithsonian Astrophysical
Observatory will conduct a research program for the investigation of rotational
and electronic spectra of postulated carbon and silicon molecules by means of
laboratory Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy, in combination with a
supersonic molecular beam, long-path millimeter-wave spectroscopy, and laser
spectroscopy. Previously unobserved species, such as silicon clusters and
silicon hydrides, and reactive ring compounds, e.g., meta-benzyne,
cyclopentadienylidene and tetradehydrobenzenes postulated by ab initio theory
will be searched for and investigated. In addition, investigations will be
carried out on complex molecular ions, such as protonated ring-chains, ring-
chain carbenes, and weakly polar molecules and complexes. Many of these
molecules are expected to play a role as reactive intermediates in industrial
processes such as combustion and semiconductor growth processes, as well as in
astronomy. The work will serve to answer basic questions about the structure and
bonding of carbon and silicon molecules of the same
size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be conducted with the assistance of
graduate and undergraduate students and post doctoral research associates. These
participants will acquire advanced training in contemporary physical chemistry
in preparation for advanced studies or employment in the industrial, academic,
or government sectors of our economy. Collaborations with experimental and
theoretical groups in the USA and elsewhere will contribute to the conduct of
the research.&lt;br/&gt;
