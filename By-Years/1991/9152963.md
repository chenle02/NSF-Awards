This project establishes an undergraduate lab for materials processing. It
involves advanced materials processing, specifically for ceramic powder
synthesis, characterization, and densification analysis. The instruments are
associated with precise quantification of particle size distribution and surface
area with computer-based data analysis. Equipment for controlled chemistry
densification studies is also involved. Laboratory exercises illustrating
fundamental principles of intermolecular forces, mass transport mechanisms,
chemical stability and solid solution formation, and solidification theory of
glass are incorporated into appropriate places of several courses.
