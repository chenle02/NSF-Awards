This NSF award supports the preparation of a documentary film about
mathematician Maryam Mirzakhani for national broadcast on public television via
American Public Television syndication (APT) in November 2021 or March 2022.
This documentary, "Secrets of the Surface: The Mathematical Vision of Maryam
Mirzakhani", directed by George Csicsery, had its world premiere at the Joint
Mathematics Meeting in Denver, Colorado in January 2020. The 60-minute film has
had wide distribution in DVD and streaming, and numerous public screenings at
universities and film festivals since the premiere. The film has proven highly
effective at conveying mathematical ideas to the general public through the
human story of Mirzakhani, a leading mathematician who became the first woman to
win the Fields Medal (2014). The film chronicles her education in Iran through
graduate school at Harvard, and her numerous mathematical breakthroughs, before
her untimely death in 2017. Mirzakhaniâ€™s story, as told in the film, has proven
inspirational to girls studying STEM subjects and to women choosing mathematics
as a career. Her example as an Iranian woman who reached the top of her field
demonstrates the possibility of overcoming gender and cultural barriers. The
film also shows how formidable cultural differences, in this case between Iran
and the United States, can be overcome through the pursuit of knowledge and pure
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modification of the film for public television
broadcast involves editing, adding required modules, closed captioning, and
other technical work, as well as promotional efforts aimed at individual station
programmers in the public television system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
