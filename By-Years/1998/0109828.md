This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate
beam steered electromagnetic radar using differential synchronization signal
path switching (DSSPS) to increase the operable frequency and target resolution.
The research will also determine the effective imaging beam refraction as it
exits opaque media, the feasibility of classifying human targets in the
downrange profile, and the feasibility of implementing fractal geometries into
bow-tie antennas to reduce ringing. Phase I will result in a compact system
capable of penetrating thick opaque materials using high frequencies to locate
targets in an arena that is otherwise reserved for low frequencies because of
attenuation and the steering limitations of electronic delay
methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential commercial applications are expected in
electromagnetic application for subsurface feature detection, including voids,
contaminants, hazardous waste containers, hydrologic-lithologic interfaces, the
location of buried utilities, and for locating human targets through opaque
materials such as buildings, earth, rock, and snow. The smaller size of a high
frequency array offers portability for the latter application.
