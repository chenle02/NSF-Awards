Mobility endonucleases are known to promote gene conversion events in a broad
range of organisms including yeast, the T-even bacteriophages T2, T4 and T6, the
acellular slime mold Physarum polycephalum and the green algae Chlamydomonas.
They present a minimum of two new classes of DNA-cleavage proteins based on
analysis of their complex recognition sites and their amino acid sequences.
Their role in intra-species gene conversion events has already been established,
while their potential involvement in horizontal gene transfer and in
mitochondrially related fungal senescence is under investigation. The objective
of this research planning grant is to first establish a working system of
genetic and molecular techniques and assays to study the intron-encoded
mitochondrial endonucleases in Podospora anserina, and to initiate the proposed
study with a specific endonuclease candidate. These preliminary efforts will
provide the basis for additional studies that will 1) address the frequency of
mobility endonucleases within the mitochondria of Podospora, 2) characterize
selected endonucleases in regard to their substrate requirements and
specificity, 3) study the expression and regulation of these proteins and their
function in the mitochondria, 4) develop techniques to look at the possible
acquisition of introns and their mobility endonucleases via horizontal transfer,
and 5) assess their possible role in senescence- a curious aging process that
Podospora exhibit during culture.
