The focus of this research involves the coordination-directed arylation of
alkanes and further general arylation studies. A four step process involving
transmetallation, C-H activation, reductive elimination and oxidation is
proposed to account for the arylation reaction and experiments are designed to
address this central hypothesis. The ability of the method to differentiate
between different typed of C-H bonds in complex substrates will test the scope
of this palladium-mediated methodology.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research of Dr. Dalibor Sames of the Department of Chemistry at Columbia
University. Professor Sames will focus his work on the development of
methodologies for palladium catalyzed C-C bond formation via C-H bond
activation. Owing to the ubiquitous presence of C-H bonds in organic compounds,
the methodology could have an extremely important broader impact on organic
synthesis, in particular on the pharmaceutical industry. The work also provides
an excellent venue for the training of graduate students.
