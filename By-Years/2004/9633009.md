9633009 Bentley Virus-like particles (VLP's) are viral coat protein structures
devoid of any functional nucleic acids, DNA or RNA. As such, they offer the
possibility of safe, effective, multivalent, and low cost vaccines for human and
animal viral diseases. Professor Bentley and Vikharia propose to study this
relatively new phenomena using the well characterized baculovirus/insect cell
system to generate the chimeric proteins. They propose a basic study of the
variables that influence the production and perform and of these particles.
Among the questions to be answered are: what structural proteins are necessary
and at what levels for the assembly of VLP's for two important poultry virus,
IBDV and avian reovirus? what factors influence the expression of the VLP's? and
what problems are associated with VLP separation and stability: The viral
protein genes will be substituted for the baculovirus AcNPV coat protein,
polyhedrin, which is not required for the replication and maintenance of the
baculovirus in-vitro. ***
