9418685 Getting The proposed research will provide high pressure petrologists
with a method of absolute pressure-temperature calibration that can be utilized
in laboratories throughout the research community. The method is based on the
accurate determination of several intersecting equilibrium boundaries in a gas
piston cylinder apparatus. Apparatus in other laboratories are calibrated, in
both absolute temperature and pressure, by referring equilibrium observations in
those devices to the PIs' accurately determined boundaries. The proposed
research will determine phase equilibria with an absolute pressure and
temperature accuracy of 1% at pressures between ~1.5 and 3 GPa and between 700
and 1600 (K.
