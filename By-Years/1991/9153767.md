This project, sponsored by SUNY College at Fredonia, is a three year project
working with 50 middle school teachers from the local school districts. The
teachers will be taught science content and pedagogy skills to prepare them to
deliver an interdisciplinary curriculum based upon the New York State Middle
School Sciences Syllabus. In addition to the summer program there will be an
academic year follow-up program. In total teachers will spend almost 5 1/2 weeks
each year on the project. The project topics will include units on computers and
technology based instruction teaching of, problem solving and inquiry skills,
student centered hands-on activities and leadership development. In addition to
support from the college the project is supported by a collaboration of
organizations including the local school district, the regional Board of
Cooperative Educational Services and the Chautauqua Teachers Center. The
matching funds provided by the college and the local school districts are
equivalent to about 10% of the NSF grant.
