AST 0206197&lt;br/&gt;Kulkarni, V P&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The origin
and evolution of galaxies and the production of chemical elements in the
Uni-&lt;br/&gt;verse are fundamental issues in astrophysics. Abundance
measurements for Galactic stars and interstellar gas are used to reconstruct the
chemical and dynamical history of the Milky Way. Advances in ground-based and
space-based technologies now enable astronomers to extend such studies to
distant galaxies, to sample the epochs when only a few percent of the stars in
galaxies had formed. The damped Lyman-alpha absorbers (DLAs) in the spectra of
quasars allow us to study the stars and gas in galaxies for redshifts 0 &lt; z
&lt; 5, i.e. back to 80-90% of the age of the Universe. The DLAs thus offer an
excellent probe of the chemical history of galaxies. The investigator will
conduct a study of the chemical and morphological evolution of DLAs, and their
implications for galaxy evolution in general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
