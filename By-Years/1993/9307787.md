9307787 Houston When collapsible soils area wetted they fail and produce
differential settlement which may damage structures. The purpose of the project
is to: further refine a down-hole in-situ test developed in a previous project,
so it can be used inside the hollow stem auger; develop techniques for
predicting the extent and intensity of wetting due to accidental wetting;
enhance the understanding of the flow mechanisms when water infiltrates an
initially dry soil; and develop techniques for combined wetting and mud jacking
for the mitigation of collapsing soils under existing structures. The results of
this research will improve the basic understanding of the behavior of
collapsible soils under certain conditions and this new knowledge will directly
benefit the geotechnical engineering practice. ***
