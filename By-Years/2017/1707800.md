This award funds theoretical research in several different topics in
relativistic astrophysics and general relativity. One focus is on tests of
general relativity and on sources of gravitational radiation that might be
detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) and
by future space based detectors. Theoretical studies of sources of gravitational
waves funded by this award will be useful to aid detection of signals from black
holes and other sources, and also to aid in their interpretation. Gravitational
wave studies can tell us about the nature of gravity, properties of black holes,
and properties of the early Universe. A second focus is the exploration of newly
discovered conservation laws involving black holes, and their implications for
deep and poorly understood issues in quantum gravity such as the information
loss paradox discovered by Stephen Hawking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail,
the principal research topics of this award are: (i) The development of methods
to compute the gravitational waveforms from point particles inspiraling into
spinning black holes, using a combination of analytical and numerical
approaches; (ii) Generalizing the mathematical formalism of Wald and Zoupas to
develop a comprehensive description and understanding of conservation laws
involving soft hair on black holes, and studying their physical consequences.
