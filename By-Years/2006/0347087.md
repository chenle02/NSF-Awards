Exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UV) is known to cause DNA damage. The initial
insult is often a crosslinking of adjacent nucleic acid bases in DNA generating
cyclobutylpyrimidine dimers, or CPDs. All organisms use DNA repair proteins to
undo this damaging modification. The project concerns one member of this class
of repair proteins, DNA photolyase. Photolyase uses blue light to undo the UV-
induced crosslinking. The protein has evolved to identify and bind CPDs with
exquisite specificity. Once bound, the CPD is repaired within about 2 billionths
of a second upon absorbing blue light. The investigator will use state-of-the-
art biophysical and biochemical methods to understand the details of the repair
mechanism at the molecular level. These methods include subpicosecond ultrafast
laser spectroscopy, both transient absorption and time-resolved fluorescence
measurements, single molecule spectroscopy using multiphoton excitation,
enzymology, and the development of sophisticated computer models to interpret
the results. The repair reaction will be followed in real time, with
subpicosecond (less than a millionth of a millionth of a second) time
resolution. Other experiments, performed on single protein molecules, will
determine how photolyase binds and manipulates the damaged DNA strand. Much of
the sophisticated work will be performed by graduate students and post-graduate
scholars. Other important experiments will be performed by a cadre of talented
undergraduate students. These students will gain a breadth of experience that is
a hallmark of biophysical chemistry.
