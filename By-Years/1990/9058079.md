The principal investigator (PI) will continue research in the areas of
integrated broadband networks, wireless information networks, traffic theory,
optical networks and distributed processing in a network environment. He will
set up a network research lab for concept demonstration which will include
networked workstations for simulation and experimentation on protocol and multi-
media applications. The applications include digital signal processing and
micro-computing programming platforms; and network database and software
installations.
