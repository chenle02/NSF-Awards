Laboratory measurements of cross-sections for excitation, determining
vibrational distributions, and how energy is transferred in particular reactions
is fundamental to our understanding of the processes that take place in our
atmosphere. This program will attempt to investigate many of the problems that
have plagued the use of these laboratory studies to understanding the
terrestrial airglow. Resonance- enhanced multi-photon ionization and Laser-
induced fluorescence techniques will be used. Particular studies will
characterize the vibrational distributions in N2, O2 and NO and study the energy
transfer in the O/O2 system. 1/24/89
