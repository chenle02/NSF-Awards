The objective of this calculus planning grant at Miami University in Ohio, is to
develop a lean and lively calculus syllabus for college students who have had
calculus in high school. After consultation with scientists from client
disciplines on the current uses of the calculus, materials incorporating
computers will be developed to run a preliminary experiment. At the end of one
year, a large scale controlled experiment with teaching and computing materials
will be ready. Miami University will co-fund over a third of the project.
