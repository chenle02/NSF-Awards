The need for high quality, directed research on hyperbase systems (hypermedia
database systems) has become very apparent to researchers in many fields. This
workshop brings together approximately 25 participants from the areas of
hypermedia, database, collaborative and information retrieval systems for an
intensive two-day workshop, held in Washington, D.C. in October 1992. The
workshop has two primary goals. The first goal is to bring synergy to the
hyperbase system research area through understanding and building of research
relationships in this diverse and multidisciplinary group. The second goal is to
establish an agenda for research in this critical area of next- generation
information systems. The result of the workshop is a report identifying:
critical research issues facing hyperbase system researchers, current progress
on the issues, potential methods of approach (including literature citations)
and a general research agenda for the field. The results will be widely
disseminated in the refereed and professional society literature and through the
appropriate conferences.
