The P.I.'s will extend their work in neural network-based control technology by
applying there concepts to the control wing surfaces of an aircraft. Their
neurocontrol algorithms will be used to deploy the active surfaces of a wing.
This will be simulated with neural networks monitoring various sensors and
controlling the active wing surfaces. The P.I.'s believe that it is possible to
take control theory that has been used in robotics and develop it to function in
aeronautical applications. To prove this, they will employ a system they are
using in a robotic application that is based on a distributed adaptive control
theory developed by Seraji (1989) and enhanced with neural networks. They will
use a multiple neural network systems approach as outlined in their NSF Final
Report ( will be tested in a flight simulation and demonstrated in a realistic
scenario on a high resolution, three dimensional graphics workstation.
