Among the most important molecules in biological systems are the heme proteins,
which transport molecular oxygen, mediate its utilization by living things, and
carry out a variety of other functions related to electron transport. At the
center of these proteins is an iron atom bound to a cluster of four nitrogen
atoms, the so-called heme group. This project is an ongoing effort to synthesize
relatively small molecules which mimic the functions of heme proteins. Such
synthetic molecules are expected to be useful not only as models of the
biomolecules, but also as oxygen carriers for industrial and medical
applications. This is a renewal of an active NSF grant. Totally synthetic
substances are being designed which reproduce the functions of heme proteins.
Emphasis is on modeling those heme proteins that form iron-dioxygen adducts as
they function. Ongoing studies first produced rare examples of iron dioxygen
carriers that do not utilize the porphyrin ligand and structural refinements
yielded examples that are fully functional under ambient conditions. Further
studies should generalize the structural principles that have evolved and lead
to predictive control over oxygen affinities. Kinetic and mechanistic studies
are planned which will provide insight into the fundamental processes of binding
and dissociation of oxygen and the autooxidation of iron oxygen carriers.
