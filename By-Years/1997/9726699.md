Kleppa 9726699 This grant supports systematic investigations of the
thermochemistry of refractory materials. These studies are based on applications
of a unique high-temperature reaction calorimeter which is operated continuously
at temperatures up to about 1500K. This calorimeter was developed with special
support from the NSF in 1987-88. During the coming three years this
investigation will be extended to the compounds formed by the mildly radioactive
actinide elements thorium and uranium with the late transition metals and the
noble metals. The investigations plan a special modification of the unique high-
temperature reaction calorimeter which will allow measurements of heats of
mixing the heats of solution in binary liquid alloys at temperatures up to about
1500K without introducing one of the two reactants from room temperature. The
goal is to better understand the basis for how thermodynamic properties of a
binary system depends on the character of its two constituents. %%% There have
been few calorimetric studies of the thermodynamic properties of uranium and
thorium alloys based on binaries with the transition metals. This work adds to
the enthalpy data base for binary compounds of these elements. ***
