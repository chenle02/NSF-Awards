Energy production, transportation and utilization are ubiquitous in the United
States. They encompass nuclear and chemical processes that are subject to a
multitude of failure mechanisms that can be the result of poor design, human
error or acts of nature or terrorism than can have catastrophic impact of life
and property. The disaster mitigation system being constructed in this activity
is a system of systems that provides emergency response staff with both training
and planning as well as real time guidance on effective strategies to protect
the general public and first responders. The system uses computational fluid
dynamics to predict toxic plume evolution and an intelligent agent based model
of the impacted population operating within an intelligent traffic management
system. Cognitive algorithms are being developed to analyze the output data and
dissect it to channel necessary information and guidance to the appropriate
people. These analyses use high performance parallel computing to create the
necessary integrated solutions and exploit many of the features of the Global
Environment for Network Innovations (GENI) network. This will result in
simulation based information and guidance that can be quickly, and reliably,
transmitted to an emergency operations center and first responders in the event
of a large toxic material release in an urban area. A pilot exercise will be
performed in collaboration with an urban emergency response team to demonstrate
and explore what might be achieved during an emergency to mitigate adverse
effects using such emerging advanced computing and networking capabilities and
thus encourage their use.
