The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) in the state
of Mississippi will enhance the research competitiveness of approximately 20
researchers from institutions of the Mississippi Research Consortium (MRC). MRC
is a coalition formed in November 1986 by Mississippi's four largest
institutions of higher learning: Mississippi State University, Jackson State
University, the University of Mississippi, and the University of Southern
Mississippi. The researchers are organized in three research clusters focused on
the broad disciplines of chemistry/materials science. The research areas are:
(1) Composite Materials; (2) Advanced Polymeric Materials Laboratory; and (3)
Structure and Dynamic Analysis. The Mississippi EPSCoR Project is a major
catalyst for the creation of a mechanism to develop a functional state-wide
research infrastructure. The chief research officers constitute the Board of
both the Consortium and the EPSCoR Executive Committee. The cooperation among
the state's research institutions has resulted in a demonstrated successful
cooperative research effort, the sharing of expertise and scientific equipment,
and the coordination of efforts to address major projects. This collaboration
among the universities has created opportunities for stronger interaction with
state, federal, and private entities. The state has committed in excess of $11
million as an investment in EPSCoR's objectives for the duration of this three-
year award.
