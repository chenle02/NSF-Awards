This proposal addresses a new means to separate chiral molecules useful in the
synthesis of biologically active molecules, such as drugs, pesticides, etc. This
process should afford a marked decrease in the economics of producing such
synthons. because it allows for simultaneous product resolution, concentration,
and purification. There is an increasing trend toward separate regulation of
enantiomeric pairs of the chiral molecules found in many modern pharmaceuticals.
Because typically only one of the two (or more) enantiomers possesses the
desired biological activity, there is an increasing desire to perfect chemical
processes which will yield chirally pure products. The proposed liquid membrane
bioreactor, based on a hybrid reaction - separation scheme, is designed to meet
such a need. More economical routes to purer, biologically active drugs and
pesticides are offered by the enhanced liquid membrane bioreactor proposed.
Highly value-added products of this sort represent an increasingly large segment
of a multibillion dollar market, and current trends in legislation and
pharmaceutical development favor the commercialization of such process
technologies.
