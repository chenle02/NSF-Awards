This research by Dr. Mark Rausher and David Des Marais seeks to understand what
happens over evolutionary time when an organism has two copies of the same
genetic material. The general logic is that if, historically, an organism only
needs one copy of a gene to survive, then a second copy of the same gene will be
unnecessary. Three general fates have been proposed for what might happen to
these duplicated pairs: one copy might keep functioning as it did as a single
copy while the second copy experiences mutations that either cause it to lose
function or to gain novel function, or the two copies might end up sharing the
ancestral functions and thereby both become necessary for the organism's
survival. These latter two fates provide a rich source for the origin of new
features that lead to an increase in biological
diversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is valuable to the
scientific community because it will help explain some of the findings of recent
genome sequencing projects; namely, why do duplicate genes persist and what are
they doing? The project will also help to expand interest in exploring natural
observations using a scientific approach through training high school and
college students who routinely spend summers in our laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;
