Funds are provided for a a small computing system optimized for artificial
intelligence applications that will be used in research on failure analysis of
mechanical components. The aim is an extensible 'expert system' that can
diagnose the causes of failure (of bolts, bearings, and similar components) and
recommend corrective action. The system's knowledge base will contain knowledge
from human diagnosticians as well as physical principles, and the system
eventually will have links to external analysis packages (e.g. for finite-
element analysis). A small proof-of-concept system has been programmed in
FORTRAN and works well over a small domain. The new equipment will provide a
host for a much more ambitious systems programmed in LISP that will be large
enough to attack realistic problems over reasonable domains.
