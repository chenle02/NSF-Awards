As climate change alters temperature and precipitation, the distributions of
plant species are expected to shift. However, the ability of plants to survive
and grow in new areas will also depend upon how well they can resist the new
sets of herbivores and pathogens they are likely to encounter. To investigate
this in the forests of Michigan, a large experiment is underway in which 8,000
seedlings of 10 species of trees have been planted at 5 sites at different
latitudes within and beyond the current ranges of the species. This project will
enable researchers to identify the individual herbivores and pathogens that are
attacking the trees at the different sites, and to tell which are responsible
for the damage and disease observed. Results will help assess whether biotic
interactions will prevent forests in this region of the U.S. from surviving
climate change through species migration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
will train a Ph.D. student and an undergraduate student, and help continue
educational outreach to 9th grade students. Results will also help the U.S. to
anticipate and mitigate the negative effects of climate change on its natural
resources.
