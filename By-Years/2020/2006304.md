The 8th Workshop on Biostatistics and Bioinformatics will be held on the campus
of Georgia State University, Atlanta, May 8-10, 2020. The goal of the workshop
is to reflect recent advances in biostatistics and bioinformatics and the new
challenges in these research areas. The invited speakers include renowned
experts and promising young researchers. Graduate students and postdocs will
gain valuable research experience by making poster presentations. Four to five
Best Student Poster Awards of the ASA Georgia Chapter will be selected and
announced during the award ceremony of the workshop. In addition, a short course
"Learning and Implementing Bayesian Adaptive Designs" will be provided during
the workshop. The workshop will encourage graduate students and junior
researchers as poster speakers or participants. In particular, the conference
organizers will invite a large number of early-career and underrepresented
researchers to participate in the workshop.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The workshop
will focus on frontiers of high-dimensional and big data analyses, recent
advances in causal inference, new developments in functional data analysis, new
frontiers in fMRI data analysis, and generate opportunities for collaboration,
discussion and dissemination of new ideas. The workshop will establish an
excellent platform for close collaboration between different universities in the
research of biostatistics and bioinformatics. The conference organizers will
contact appropriate departments of historically black universities in the Metro
Atlanta area, invite underrepresented members to participate in the workshop,
and encourage them to apply for financial support through this award. The travel
supports provided by this grant are particularly for junior researchers and
graduate students. More information about the workshop can be found at

award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
