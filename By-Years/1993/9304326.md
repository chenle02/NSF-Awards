One of the most provocative tectonic models advanced in recent years contends
that the eastern edge of the North American continent collided with the southern
South America (Argentina) during the Grenville orogeny in Late Precambrian-early
Paleozoic time (750-550 Ma). This idea has major implications for the evolution
of the earth in terms of tectonics, climate, and organic distribution. This
proposal outlines plans to test this model by examining critical shear zones in
Argentina that are thought to have facilitated this major collision. The project
will initially concentrate on gathering kinematic data on shear zones in the
Pampean Terrane in order to determine movement histories and metamorphic
conditions during movement.
