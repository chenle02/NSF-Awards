The analysis of samples of curves is a field of growing relevance in statistics.
Samples of curves arise when a time-dependent process is observed on a group of
individuals. Such curves present both time and amplitude variability
("horizontal" and "vertical" variability), and both types of variation have to
be statistically modeled in order to draw valid inference from the data. The
investigator is developing dynamic regression models, that is, models for
prediction of response curves based on explanatory curves, that explicitly take
into account time variability. The properties of these methods are being studied
theoretically, by simulation, and by the analysis of real-life data sets.
Computer software implementing these methods is also being developed.

Data consisting of samples of curves include, among many others, human growth
curves, time-dependent gene expression profiles, daily air pollutant
concentrations, and stock prices. The investigator's work will help scientists
work on a broad range of applications and these statistical techniques will help
provide new insights into scientific areas as diverse as medicine, genetics,
environmental studies, and economics.
