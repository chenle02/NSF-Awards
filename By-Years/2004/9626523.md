Dr. Sarah H. Tolbert has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Tolbert received the doctoral degree from the University of
California at Berkeley under the supervision of Professor A. Paul Alivisatos.
Dr. Tolbert will continue research at the University of California at Santa
Barbara under the sponsorship of Professor Galen Stucky. The postdoctoral
research will focus on the study of iron oxide mesoporous materials. The systems
consist of surfactant/inorganic composites that display long range periodic
order reminiscent of liquid crystals. The synthesis and characterization of
mesopores is accomplished through the use of redox chemistry with iron oxide as
the model inorganic. The materials produced are characterized by Moessbauer
spectroscopy as well as by examination of magnetic properties. The work leads
toward the overall goal of understanding and predicting the observable states of
solids. The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as
an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and
experience of new Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in
contemporary chemical research and teaching.
