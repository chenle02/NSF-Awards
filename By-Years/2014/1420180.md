In our modern society, planning and scheduling decisions such as those made to
optimize airplane scheduling, route planning, and production planning
increasingly rely on computer algorithms. Many popular methods to solve these
often computationally hard problems are based on so-called linear programming
relaxations or, more generally, on convex programming relaxations. In this
project, the PI and the supported graduate student will study the theoretical
power and limitations of such convex relaxations for various optimization
problems. One goal is to discover new techniques to algorithmically extract
near-optimal solutions from those relaxations and hence certify the quality of
those relaxations. Another goal is to show lower bounds which prove that, for
some problems, no relaxation of a certain type and quality exists. This will
yield a better understanding of techniques that are widely used in industry to
solve real-world optimization problems. In addition, finding lower bounds and
fundamental limitations will help researchers and practitioners avoid wasting
precious effort trying to improve techniques that have reached their limits and,
instead, will focus their attention on finding alternative approaches for
improved algorithms. The PI is also committed to making results available to a
broad audience of students and researchers via lecture notes, survey papers, and
tutorials.
