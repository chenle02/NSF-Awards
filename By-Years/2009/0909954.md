This project focuses on the development of a novel method for the formation of
organocatalysts using the self-assembly of designed precatalyst modules and its
application in asymmetric catalysis. While organocatalysts have been shown to
rival the traditional transition- metal catalysts and even biocatalysts in
asymmetric inductions, the current design of organocatalysts based on pure
covalent bonds requires time-consuming syntheses and purifications. This project
studies a combinatorial approach for the formation of organocatalysts from
carefully designed precatalyst modules. These modules can self-assemble under
the reaction conditions through non-covalent ionic interactions to afford the
desired organocatalysts and modification of the catalyst structure is easily
achievable by switching these modules without chemical synthesis. Studies to
further elucidate the mechanism of this catalytic system will be undertaken.
Hypothesis driven studies of the application of this method in asymmetric
catalysis will be also performed.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research of Professor Cong-Gui Zhao of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Texas at San Antonio. Professor Zhao's research efforts revolve
around the development of modularly designed organocatalysts for asymmetric
reactions. Such chemistry will contribute to environmentally benign methods for
chemical synthesis since the catalytic system is purely small organic molecules
derived from the readily available chiral pools. Successful development of the
methodology will have a positive impact on synthesis in the pharmaceutical and
agricultural industries.
