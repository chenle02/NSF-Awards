The objective of this project are to identify and quantify chemical reaction
products when chlorine is used to disinfect wastewater treatment plant
effluents. Special emphasis in this project is on reactions between nitrogenous
organic compounds such as the amino acids and peptides in the effluents with
chlorine. Spectral techniques are planned to be used for identification of the
chlorination products, in the process of characterizing their stability and to
determine how conventional methods of analysis respond to the presence of these
compounds. Chlorination is relied on heavily in the United States for
disinfection of effluents prior to their placement in environmental waters.
Chlorine is known to react with organic compounds to form products many of which
have not been fully characterized with respect to their environmental
significance for downstream water users. Results of this project are expected to
provide the basis for any changes that may be necessary in engineering design
and use of chlorination to avoid or eliminate environmental problems associated
with use of this process.
