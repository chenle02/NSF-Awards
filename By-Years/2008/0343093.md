The goal of this project is to improve surface weather map analysis and, thus,
short-term weather forecasting. Present practice by the operational
meteorological community relies on the Norwegian Cyclone Model. Many of these
analyses, however, demark fronts not associated with significant horizontal
temperature contrast as required by the model. Many fronts identified in current
analyses appear to be determined on the basis of a cyclonic wind shift. Such
features are better denoted as baroclinic troughs with the associated clouds and
precipitation that differ from those associated with actual
fronts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be based on study of episodes of
real fronts selected from an existing archive. The synoptic circumstances for
the formation, evolution and dissipation of fronts in these episodes will be
documented. Frontogenetical calculations will be made. The results will be
compared with each other and with the observed change in the temperature
gradient on a series of maps for each episode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI also
will begin a preliminary investigation into a pronounced and consistent diurnal
change of wind direction at Tucson, Arizona - southeasterly at night and
northwesterly during the daytime. This variation has been observed to be as
consistent as land and sea breezes. This flow structure appears to be due to the
differential horizontal surface characteristics between a small mountain range
to the northwest of the city and a dry elevated plateau to the southeast. The
physical processes responsible for this flow structure will be investigated.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful completion of this research can potentially be
of value to operational forecasters as well as finding its way into
meteorological courses and text books.
