Communication and synchronization among processes is of fundamental importance
in parallel and distributed systems. Together, they have an impact on the
efficiency, the design, and the understanding of concurrent programs. This
research aims at examining shared variable and message passing systems with
respect to mechanisms for interprocess communication and synchronization. In the
case of shared variable systems, the question of cache coherence and the
appropriateness of non-atomic shared memory is considered. Proof techniques and
programming methodologies are developed for dealing with non-atomic memories. In
the case of message passing systems, the question of locality of computations is
investigated. Complexity measures that measure locality and efficient algorithms
for commonly occurring synchronization problems are developed. The impact of
failures and dynamic networks on algorithms and tight lower bounds on various
performance measures are explored. Finally, the research examines mixed
programming paradigms that support both shared memory and message passing. As a
part of this research, efficient simulations of shared memory on an underlying
message passing architecture are designed.
