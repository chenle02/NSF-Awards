This Study compares rates of decomposition of phytoplanktonic lipids in oxic and
anoxic sediments. The importance of various factors which control the
preservation of organic matter in marine sediments is at present controversial,
with both rain rate of organic carbon to the sea floor and variable rates of
competing issues. This study will specifically determine the rates of lipid
decomposition in oxic and anoxic sediments. Laboratory incubations using
14C-labelled algae and labelled individual lipids will be conducted with the
objective of estimating degradation rates for aerobic and anaerobic
decomposition processes. The decomposition rates obtained from the laboratory
experiments will then be compared with rates calculated from modelling of lipid
distributions in coastal sediments. The results will lead to a better
understanding of the importance of oxic vs anoxic environments in the
degradation or preservation of organic matter in sediments.
