The University of Northern Iowa will initiate a three-week, commuter Young
Scholars (EAI) project in Physics and Mathematics for 24 students entering
grades 7-9. The project, designed exclusively for ethnic minorities and women,
will focus on basic physics and mathematics concepts including energy transfer,
light, sound, graphs, symmetries and probability. Follow-up will include a
series of bimonthly Saturday morning activities during the academic year.
