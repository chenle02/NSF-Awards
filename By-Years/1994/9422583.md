9422583 Spilhaus The International Permafrost Association (IPA) of the
International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) will provide coordination and
communications for international scientific programs related to permafrost. The
IPA, through working groups; special projects; and conferences and workshops
will address issues such as global change and permafrost; periglacial processes
and environments; cryosols; mountain permafrost; foundation engineering in
permafrost environ- ments; seasonal freezing and thawing of permafrost;
permafrost at high latitudes and in rugged topography; and international
exchange of data and information. The IPA Secretariat ensures planning, de-
velopment, and implementation of these activities, working under the direction
of the IPA Council. The Secretariat plans and orga- nizes meetings of the
Council, its Executive Committee, and working groups; and prepares and
distributes working documents for and re- ports of IPA meetings, as well as
other IPA documents and reports, draft scientific papers and a regular
newsletter. ***
