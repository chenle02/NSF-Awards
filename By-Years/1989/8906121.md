The following pieces of optical characterization equipment for semiconductor
materials and device research will be purchased: 1) an argon ion laser, 2) a
high-speed, long-wavelength, infrared detector, 3) an electro-optic modulator
and driver, 4) a low-temperature cryogenic research dewar, 5) a high-frequency
lock-in amplifier, and 6) a data acquisition computer. This equipment will be
used in four different project areas which have a common need for the
contactless, non-destructive, evaluation semiconductor carrier lifetime and
electronic defect properties. The project areas are: 1) strained layer epitaxy
of germanium-silicon alloys by rapid thermal epitaxy, 2) molecular epitaxy of
group III-V compound semiconductors, 3) molecular beam epitaxy of mercury
cadmium telluride, and 4) silicon-based integrated micro-sensors and micro-
actuators.
