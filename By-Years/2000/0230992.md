The main goal of our project is to help engineering students become global
engineers by learning to define and solve problems in the context of differing
cultural and national perspectives. Another goal has been to evaluate and
compare the effectiveness of two different approaches to student learning. Our
project accomplishes these goals by developing and evaluating twelve multimedia-
learning modules under the general title, "Engineering Cultures." Our first
objective has been to complete final versions of eight prototype modules and
develop four additional modules. Each module includes 3-5 multimedia lessons
(45-60 minutes each) on CDs, a one-hour multimedia Introduction to Engineering
Cultures, an accompanying reader, a user's manual for students and instructors,
sample quiz and exam questions for instructors, and a web database of supporting
materials, including interviews with engineers from different countries. Our
second objective is to evaluate the intellectual content of each module with the
assistance of 24-30 content experts. Our final objective is to evaluate and
compare student learning in semester-length multimedia and classroom versions of
Engineering Cultures at each of two schools. Demo versions of the multimedia
modules will be disseminated to engineering educators at engineering education
conferences and via an upcoming ASEE national project on dissemination of best
education practices. We expect Prentice Hall to serve as national and
international distributor for the finished products.
