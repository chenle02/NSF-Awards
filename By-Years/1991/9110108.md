Recently, considerable attention has been devoted to the theoretical study of
machine learning. A primary goal of this research project is to understand how
changes in the learner's interaction with its environment in an on-line model
influence the complexity of learning. Previous work has shown that the
complexity of learning depends on how the instances (or examples) are selected.
The usual assumption is that the adversary selects the instances, but this
investigation will center on alternative on-line models. First, the situation
will be studies in which the learner selects the instances. Part of this work
will be the development of a new model in which each query has a small cost, yet
each mistake has a large cost. Such a model would favor learning algorithms that
make few mistakes while still requesting a modest number of examples. A second
alternative is to have a teacher perform the instance selection. It is planned
to formalize a model of teaching that requires the teacher to find the best way
to present the lesson so that any student who "pays attention" learns the
lesson. This model, will be used to study the complexity of teaching. Variations
of this model that place further restrictions on the learner (without confining
the learner to some particular algorithm) will also be considered.
