9410687 Robb This project is on research to study the production of enzymes from
extremophiles by expression of these enzymes in mesophiles, using recombinant
DNA technology. The objective is to make available large quantities of these
enzymes for biophysical and biochemical characterization and ultimately for
enzymatic applications, without the need for culturing extremophiles directly.
The specific objectives of this research include: (1) to clone and identify gene
sequences from the hyperthermophile Pyrococcus furiosus and related
thermophiles; (2) to express genes in heterologous systems at high pressure, and
characterize recombinant enzymes under elevated pressure and temperature to
establish optimal specific activity and assembly; and (3) to develop
bioprocessing methods for obtaining enzymes in sufficient quantity for
structural determination and biotechnological applications. ***
