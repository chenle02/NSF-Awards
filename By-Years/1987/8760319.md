A significant need exists in the field of dexterous robotics and teleoperation
for tactile feedback generated by high-resolution tactile displays. It is
proposed that a tactile sensor sub-system be developed consisting of a
microprocessor-based tactile data acquisition and analysis system coupled to an
innovative fingertip- shaped tactile sensor with normal and shear force-sensing
capability. The primary efforts of this project shall include (1) modification
of an existing, high-resolution, optical tactile sensor (manufactured by BEGEJ
CORPORATION) by development of sensing elements capable of detecting shear
forces in addition to normal forces, and (2) integration of the optical tactile
sensor into a complete, microprocessor-based tactile sensing sub-system capable
of autonomous tactile data acquisition, pre-processing and analysis.
