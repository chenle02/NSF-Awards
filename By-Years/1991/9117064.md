This proposal is for the establishment of an Industry/University Cooperative
Research Center for Polymer Interfaces at Lehigh University. The focus of the
Center is on developing a molecular level understanding of the structural,
dynamic, kinetic, and energetic characteristics of the interphase region between
a polymer and substrate. This will be accomplished through detailed
characterization of industrially relevant model/polymer substrate systems using
laser light scattering, inverse gas chromotography, impedance specroscopy, XPS,
Raman, NMR, FTIR etc. Companies from the aerospace, petrochemical and
microelectronic industries will profit from these studies. The Program Manager
recommends a continuing award for $50,000 for a five-year period. Near the end
of each 12 month period the Program Manager and/or the Director of the
Engineering Centers Division will review the progress of the Center on a number
of criteria, including the following: 1) the extent to which the university-
industry interaction and collaboration is developing; 2) the extent to which the
support base is expanding; 3) the extent to which a robust research program is
developing. If the review is satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend
support of the next period of this continuing award.
