In theory, tradeoffs between host resistance against parasites and host fitness
traits play a key role in the maintenance of genetic variation and hence in
determining the evolutionary potential of resistance. The proposed research
encompasses a comprehensive empirical study of tradeoffs focusing on host life
history and ecological traits, and will utilize a Drosophila-mite system as a
model to address several key hypotheses. These hypotheses are that strains
selected in the laboratory to be more resistant to parasitic mites will suffer,
in the absence of the parasites, significant reductions in egg hatch success,
ability to compete for limiting resources, survivorship and fecundity, and in
defensive capabilities against other natural enemies. These enemies include an
invertebrate predator and an insect-pathogenic bacterium. Another major emphasis
will be to test for the presence of costs of resistance under variable
environmental conditions to which the host organism is known to be exposed in
nature.



Many of the elements that mediate the Drosophila-parasitic mite association are
seen in vertebrate host-ectoparasite interactions, and in associations between
insect prey and their predators. Thus the results of the proposed work should
provide data of importance toward understanding the mechanisms and evolution of
resistance across a broad array of animal species. The data generated are also
expected to help define criteria for choosing appropriate natural enemies, and
especially mixtures of natural enemies, for effective biological pest control.
The research should therefore help to reduce dependency on chemical pesticide
and herbicide usage, and hence promote environmental health. Our general
knowledge of multispecies associations and their ecological complexities should
also be advanced. The research effort will contribute to the training of both
undergraduate and graduate students, and it should be of practical and societal
value as it is expected to help develop novel methods of sustainable biological
control.
