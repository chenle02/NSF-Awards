Dynamic image is a series of static images with a specified order and elapse
time interval between each element of the sequence. The difference analysis of
dynamic images and the usual scene analysis is that in addition to information
being extracted from each element of the sequence, information from the sequence
of images must be time integrated. Efficient computational algorithms for
treating time-sequence data sets plays a central role. Computational methods for
measuring the local spatial and temporal properties of digital dynamic images
will be developed. Spatial similarity for aligning images in an image sequence
(registration correction), and temporal similarity techniques for measuring
local temporal changes and correction between them will be used. Algorithms will
be developed for the calculation of spatial (two- dimensional) and temporal
similarity measures which can be utilized for the processing of gigabyte data
arrays, e.g. satellite and medical imagery. The emphasis will be on trade-offs
between computational efficiency and accuracy.
