Primary sensory neurons located along the length of the spinal cord in
structures known as spinal ganglia convey information about the body
(somatosensory information; e.g. pain, temperature) to the central nervous
system. Defining the anatomical, biochemical, and molecular characteristics of
these sensory nerve cells is prerequisite to determining their function. Dr.
Seroogy has recently discovered that substantial subpopulations of spinal
ganglion cells contain the biosynthetic machinery for an enzyme called tyrosine
hydroxylase, an enzyme crucial for the synthesis of a class of chemical
messengers called catecholamines. This finding raises the possibility that
catecholamines play a role in the transfer and coding of sensory information
from the body. The primary goals of the proposed research are to thoroughly
characterize the organization of tyrosine hydroxylase (and catecholamines)
within spinal ganglia and to determine the specific parts of the body that may
be associated with catecholamine signalling. Dr. Seroogy will accomplish this by
using molecular biological and neuroanatomical techniques. The results of these
studies will add significantly to our understanding of the functional
organization of catecholamines in spinal ganglia and will serve as the basis for
future correlations with physiological studies in order to understand the
involvement of catecholamines in transmitting sensory information.
