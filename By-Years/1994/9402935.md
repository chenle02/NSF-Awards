9402935 Meyer This award, made in the Advanced Materials and Processing Program
deals with the design, synthesis and characterization of molecular photonic
materials. These materials will be derived from monolithic gels in which steady-
state and time dependent optical properties can be systematically varied. A key
goal will be to efficiently produce long-lived photoinduced charge separation
within the solid state. Light absorbing species will be metal to ligand charge
transfer complexes of ruthenium and osmium imbedded into sol-gel matrices.
Energy and electron acceptors will be substituted anthracenes and methyl
viologens, tethered to gel matrices. By layering gels of donors and acceptors it
will be possible to segregate the steps of light absorption, energy transfer,
and electron transfer, mimicking the primary events in photosynthesis. This
research will bridge the gap between known solution chemistry and emerging
technology of solid state materials based on sol-gel processing. The technology
will find application in practical molecular level devices such as chemical
sensors, photovoltaic cells, and linear and nonlinear optical devices.
