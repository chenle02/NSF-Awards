This project is part of the NSF/USGS initiative within the National Earthquake
Hazard Reduction Program (NEHRP) to investigate the effects of the Loma Prieta
earthquake of 17 October 1989. Over 100 earth dams were located within a
distance of approximately 100 km from the source of this earthquake. The aim of
this project is to evaluate in detail two earth dams that were significantly
instrumented and in which the instruments were triggered during the earthquake.
In addition, and to the extent available, the recordings from other dams,
together with other information about these dams, are also being collected and
will be made available in a single document that can be utilized by other users.
The two dams are the San Justo Dam, 150 ft high, and the San Luis Dam, which is
300 ft high. These dams are respectively about 40 km and 80 km from the zone of
energy release. Soil and geologic data are available for both dams. Detailed
one- and two-dimensional analyses are being conducted in order to assess the
dynamic shear-strain characteristics of the material comprising each dam-
foundation system and to examine the adequacy of various available analytical
procedures for calculating the response of earth dams during earthquakes. This
is the first time that such detailed analyses can be conducted with measured
earthquake response records at several locations of an earth dam.
