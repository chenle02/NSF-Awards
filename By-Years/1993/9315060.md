9315060 Shearer This research is a continuation of the investigation of the
velocity structure of the earth by means of stacking seismograms from the global
seismic networks. Current versions of these stacks have successfully imaged
dozens of seismic phases including many reflections from upper mantle
discontinuities. Analyses of these phases have provided new evidence for a
discontinuity at 520-km depth and maps of the topography of the 410 and 660-km
discontinuities. This work will improve the stacking techniques to accommodate
both higher and lower frequency data, and apply these methods to the broadband
data from the IRIS network. The goals are to obtain improved maps of the
structure of internal discontinuities in the mantle, begin experimenting with
automatic waveform inversion techniques on the stacked images, and to search for
anomalous or unexplained features in the data. ***
