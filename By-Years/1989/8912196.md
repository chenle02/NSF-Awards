This research aims to expand the utility of silanes in synthetic transformations
by explaining their use as chiral auxiliaries in a variety of reactions. The
silyl functionality is a versatile one. Not only is it simple to attach to a
number of reactive centers but it is quite stable to a variety of reagents and
reaction conditions. The direction of this research can go several directions.
The PI wishes to investigate three of these during the planning period to
determine the direction this research program will go and the nature of a MRI
competitive proposal. The three areas are: 1) In depth study of conformational
effects in both chelate and cyclic models. 2) Synthesis of optically active
silanes. 3) Application of silyl auxiliaries in organic reactions.
