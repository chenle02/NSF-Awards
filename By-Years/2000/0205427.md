AST-0205427&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Simon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
is a program for measuring the masses of pre-main-sequence stars using
millimeter wavelength interferometry. Accurate measurements of stellar masses
are crucial data, and this work will provide answers to some fundamental
astrophysical questions. In particular, it will provide observational
constraints on two areas of astrophysical theory that are currently relatively
poorly constrained: pre-main-sequence evolutionary tracks, and theories of
binary star formation. The PI will also continue his program of the detection of
faint secondary companions in single-lined spectroscopic binaries, both to
measure the mass ratio distribution of binaries and to provide additional data
to use for measuring masses when combined with resolved observations of binary
star orbits.&lt;br/&gt;
