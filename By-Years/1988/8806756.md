In-depth experimental and theoretical studies of the role of hydrogen in
semiconductor single crystals, the purest and structurally most perfect
materials, will be made. Important scientific and technical information has been
gained recently from the study of many hydrogen-containing impurity and defect
complexes in silicon, germanium, and gallium arsenide. The plan is to
investigate the formation and detailed structure of some of these complexes.
Recent IR spectroscopy information on partially hydrogen-passivated multivalent
acceptors indicates the existence of both static and dynamic centers.
Information on electrically non-active centers on the other hand is very
limited. They will make use of local vibrational mode spectroscopy, together
with uniaxial stress, to determine the structure of fully passivated dopants.
Raman and EPR spectroscopies will be used in special cases. Modelling and
calculations for various configurations will be proposed and carried out in
close comparison with the data. In a parallel effort an investigation of various
hydrogen- introduction mechanisms will be made. Hydrogen RF plasmas,
electrolysis and chemo-mechanical polishing all seem to lead to hydrogenation
and associated dopant passivation. Attempts will be made to verify recent
conjectures and theoretical calculations that give the hydrogen charge state as
a function of the semiconductor Fermi level. Various theoretical mechanisms will
be examined in connection with these experiments. Results should be of
significance for many processes in semiconductor technology, such as plasma
deposition, etching, oxidation, and ion implantation. Most of these processes
involve, intentionally of unintentionally, hydrogen. An improved understanding
of its role in semiconductors is necessary for the successful development of
future silicon and gallium arsenide based devices.
