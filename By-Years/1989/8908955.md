In the past five years, steady state fluorescence microscopy has revolutionized
light microscopy due to the high degree of sensitivity and specificity. The time
resolution of steady state fluorescence microscopy when used to measure chemical
or molecular parameters has been in the seconds to hundreds of milliseconds
range. Fluorescence and phosphorescence lifetimes can attain time resolutions
from nanoseconds to seconds depending on the probe and can be used to extend the
temporal resolution of measurements. In addition, the chemical and physical
environment of a fluorescent or phosphorescent probe influences the lifetime of
the excited state of the probe. Thus the decay of the luminescence produced by
an excitation pulse is characteristic of the chemical and physical environment
so time resolved microscopy can be used to measure chemical and molecular
changes in cells. Results with a test microscope system have demonstrated the
feasibility of the approach and we are asking for the commercially available
components to assemble a complete system. The applications include
characterizing the lifetimes of newly developed dyes, measuring changes in ionic
environments in cells to measuring the rotational diffusion coefficients of
labeled macromolecules. This latter measurement will allow the characterization
of assembly and binding processes of macromolecules in living cells. Time
resolved microscopy will become a complementary tool to steady state microscopy
and will be the method of choice in many applications where the total excitation
dose must be minimized. In fact the lower total excitation dose required and the
higher sensitivity of rotational diffusion measurements will probably make this
the methods of choice over the now popular fluorescence photobleaching
redistribution technique in many applications.
