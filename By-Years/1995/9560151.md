This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the
feasibility of a next-generation machine designed for flexible fabrication in
vacuum processes and other micromachining applications. It is a novel machine
tool based on parallel platform robotics technology and is coupled with a
standardized machine tool interface for existing integrated manufacturing
applications. The positioning system will have full six-axis motion, plus a
redundant seventh axis permitting operation as either the tool or workpiece
holder for numerous advanced manufacturing applications. The technology is
expected to benefit vacuum- and micropositioning-related industries by enabling
affordable, precision components to be produced in small lots. Phase I
objectives include specification of the positioning system, development of a
fully articulated laboratory model in a 3-D solid modeling environment,
preliminary integration of manufacturing software into the virtual machine
environment, performance assessment, laboratory model demonstration, and
engineering model design. A standardized, multi-faceted seven-axis positioning
system, designed for vacuum use, will find numerous flexible manufacturing
applications in electronic materials, metallurgy, optical coatings, thick-film
coatings, instrumentation, tooling, forming, shaping, precision cutting,
grinding, and drilling, as well as laser processing of advanced materials.
