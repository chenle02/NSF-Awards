With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry and Geosciences at Tarleton State University will
acquire an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES).
This equipment will enhance research in the following areas: a) environmental
studies of trace metal cycling; b) compost analysis; c) formation and
composition of alkali metal polytellurides and polyselenides in nonaqueous
solvents; and d) metasomatic effects on upper mantle symplectites.

An ICP-AES can perform multiple element metal analysis quickly, which makes it
an essential instrument for a modern analytical laboratory and a technology with
which students must be familiar to fill academic and industrial positions in
today's society. These studies will have an impact in a variety of fields,
including geochemistry, and environmental, agricultural and inorganic chemistry.
