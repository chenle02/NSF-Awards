This award supports Dr. Mark A. Linne and a graduate student from the Colorado
School of Mines in a collaboration with Katharina Kohse-H`inghaus of the
Department of Physical Chemistry at the University of Bielefeld. The
collaboration between the two groups will investigate the use of novel
picosecond laser sources and techniques to evaluate and develop laser
diagnostics for reacting gas-phase flows in processes such as combustion,
chemical vapor deposition, and plasmas. The group in Bielefeld is well- known
for its research on the fundamental aspects of laser-induced fluorescence
diagnostics. The Colorado group has a laboratory setup that complements the
German capabilities and has been used for the development of several non-
traditional picosecond laser techniques. The main goals of the work are to study
energy transfer in small molecules, develop new picosecond diagnostics, combine
the capabilities of the two groups, and bring younger members of the group into
the collaboration.
