This Targeted Research project is investigating the merger of the information
retrieval (IR) and digital reference components of the National STEM Education
Digital Library (NSDL). Combining these functions enables users to find answers
to questions regardless if those answers come from documents in NSDL collections
or experts accessible through the NSDL's virtual reference desk. The project is
using large digital reference data sets of question/answer pairs with human
judgments to create ontologies of questions. These ontologies supplement
automatic question triage techniques to create an enhanced NSDL IR system. The
project is also developing methodologies for the creation of inductive expert
profiles to allow the enhanced IR system to route questions needing human
intermediation quickly and effectively.
