The National Science Foundation is providing partial funding for sponsorship of
the Board on Behavioral, Cognitive and Sensory Sciences (BBCSS) at the National
Academies of Science. This board, comprised of an impressive range of expertise
with outstanding scholars as its members, facilitates the exchange of
information and ideas on topical policy issues through meetings and workshops,
and explores avenues (e.g. through planning meetings) that may lead to new and
important studies. Several new projects under the auspices of BBCSS that are
likely to begin during this granting period include the convening of expert
committees to address issues of national security with relevant federal
agencies, the development of a report outlining the principles and practices of
effective Institutional Review Boards for ensuring the protection of human
research participants, and exploring the impact of neuroscience and its
technologies on various fields, including education. Also on the agenda for
exploration in the next few years are topics such as: demography and aging,
climate, human capital, the cognitive basis of racial bias, and bilingualism and
multi-culturalism in terms of language and skill acquisition. Sponsorship of
BBCSS will also support the retention of experienced staff who can be responsive
to requests and opportunities as they arise to enhance the ability of the BBCSS
to meet its mission and fulfill its responsibilities.
