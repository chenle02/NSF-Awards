The problem of fitting a smoothing or interpolating curve to a discrete set of
data values arises in almost every field of scientific research. An important
class of curve fitting problems requires the determination of a smooth
interpolating curve which preserves the shape of the data. An effective means of
producing such a curve is provided by tension splines -- a generalization of
cubic splines which includes additional parameters having the capability of
controlling the behavior of the curve. The investigator has developed algorithms
which relieve the user of the burden of having to experimentally determine
appropriate values of these parameters. The algorithms automatically select the
optimal parameter values required to satisfy user-specified constraints. A major
deterrent to widespread use of this method is the difficulty associated with its
implementation. The goal of the proposed research is a software package which
implements the algorithms referred to above, thus providing a convenient,
powerful, and versatile curve fitting method. The software is to be placed in
the public domain and distributed to the scientific community through the ACM
Algorithms Distribution Service.
