The Department of Mathematics at the University of California at Irvine will
purchase a Beowulf cluster of 32 (16 dual) Intel Pentium CPUs (connected with
1Gbic ethernet and operated by Linux) together with a SGI graphics computer. The
computer equipment will be dedicated as a powerful distributed computing
resource to the support of research in the mathematical sciences involving
numerical studies of partial differential equations. This broad area of research
will include in particular the following
projects:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microstructure evolution in a three-dimensional
elastic system - Q. Nie and F. Wan&lt;br/&gt;Numerical study of surface
diffusion in three dimensions - H. Zhao&lt;br/&gt;Computational study of the
Navier-Stokes-alpha model - Q. Nie, K. Solna and E. Titi&lt;br/&gt;Computaiton
of harmonic maps - P. Li&lt;br/&gt;Numerical studies for the Gauss curvature
flow with flat sides - P. Daskalopoulos and R. Hamilton&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In
addition to new understanding for the problems in material sciences, fluid
mechanics and geometry investigated, the results of these studies will provide
important computational tools for many other important problems in science and
engineering that require large scale computation&lt;br/&gt;
