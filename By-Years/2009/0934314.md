The University of Maine?s Darling Marine Center is awarded a grant to equip the
42-ft Ira C., the Center?s largest vessel, with a well instrumented CTD,
including optical sensors and a small array of sampling bottles plus a winch
with conducting cable so that CTD work from the Ira C. no longer needs to depend
on users bringing their own CTD and lowering by hand. This proposal is to expand
the environments and variables within effective reach of the University of
Maine?s marine laboratory, the Ira C. Darling Marine Center (the Center) in
midcoast Maine. The Center is within a day?s access by sea of an unparalleled
range of marine environments on the East Coast?depths from intertidal to > 200 m
and substrates from rocks to gravels to sand to mud. Environments within a day?s
reach include the coastal seas with the strongest latitudinal thermal gradients
along the U.S. coasts and the largest seasonal range of temperatures. It
includes the outflows of Maine?s three rivers with the greatest volumetric
flows, the Penobscot, the Kennebec and the Saco as well as several of the
smallest. It is ideally poised to help investigators do process-, ecosystem- and
species-level studies of Gulf of Maine and estuarine environments and biota in
the context of environmental variability and climate change.

Broader Impacts:

The Center has an outstanding group of faculty and scientists including some
distinguished emeritus professors. The center also has a remarkable record of
visiting scientists and students, drawing researchers from all over the U.S. and
internationally. Clearly an attraction is the facilities (including a first rate
library) and access to a unique spectrum of marine environments,
biogeographically diverse populations of marine organisms, etc. The need for the
proposed improvements is easily recognized. The authors describe how the
facility is used for education and how the upgrades will increase users for both
science and for education. The Center currently has NSF COSEE support, and the
author proposes to leverage off this program for K-grey teacher training,
undergraduate, and graduate and 'world-class' web-based educational outreach.
