This research concerns allocation in simple private goods situations such as
assignment of transmission capacity in a computer network. A strong case can be
made that in such problems (i) non manipulability (i.e., dominant strategies) is
a very desirable property, (ii) replacing the requirement of Pareto efficiency
with a fairness criterion is sensible - particularly since efficiency and non
manipulability are inconsistent requirements, and (iii) local serial
dictatorship is acceptable provided anonymity holds globally. It has been shown
that the serial social choice function satisfies these criteria. This research
is to characterize the class of mechanisms that satisfy these criteria. This
project is the point of departure for a systematic analysis of strategy-proof
mechanisms for allocating private goods. It represents an important and exciting
direction in which to increase our knowledge of allocation mechanisms and their
performance characteristics. Not only does the project promise to contribute to
the body of economic theory in a substantial way, it will affect the ways firms
and public bodies allocate certain scarce productive resources (such as computer
networks).
