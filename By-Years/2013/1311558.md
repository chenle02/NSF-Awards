The main goals of NSF grant DMS-1311558 are to use microlocal analysis and
integral geometry to understand important problems in tomography and then to use
this to develop and improve algorithms for those problems. Professor Quinto will
develop and test algorithms for electron microscopy, X-ray tomography, and
radar. Professor Quinto will adapt and test his three-dimensional electron
microscope tomography (ET) algorithm with new scanning geometries (ways of
obtaining the data) in ET, and he will refine the algorithm to address more
aspects of the physical model. Long-term collaborators at the Royal Institute of
Technology and the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, will provide biological and
realistic simulated data. Prof. Quinto will develop Sobolev seminorms that tell
how strongly features in an object will show up in its tomographic data. He will
use microlocal analysis to understand streak artifacts that occur in limited
angle tomography and use this to develop algorithms that decrease these streaks.
A large part of the PI's research in this project will involve novel methods in
bistatic radar with general flight paths. He and his collaborators will develop
the microlocal theory of radar for a broad range of flight paths. They will use
this to find flight paths that provide better data, and he will develop and test
algorithms for these flight paths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tomography is the
mathematics that images objects from indirect data including from X-ray CT
scanners, electron microscopes, or radar. He will develop methods to image
submicroscopic objects from electron microscopy data, the body from X-ray
tomography data, and the terrain of the earth from radar data. His electron
microscopy project is undertaken with biologists and mathematicians, and it has
already been used to image and understand individual sub-microscopic structures.
Prof. Quinto will use sophisticated mathematics to understand which features the
specific data can image well and what features cannot be well-imaged. He will
use this information to improve his algorithms. Professor Quinto is committed to
undergraduate teaching, advising, and mentoring a broad range of students and
young mathematicians, and his NSF project will directly support this through two
undergraduate projects. The PI's many undergraduate research students help
accomplish his research by developing algorithms and learning the underlying
mathematics as they learn to become creative researchers.
