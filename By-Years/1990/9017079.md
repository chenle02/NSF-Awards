Multiphoton processes in atoms irradiated by strong laser fields are studied.
The research concentrates on angular distributions for H atoms, various aspects
of two color ionization of H, and H-, extensions of the dc rate theory to
alternating fields, and an improved method for solving the time-dependent
Schroedinger equation in momentum space.
