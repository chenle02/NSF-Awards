*** 9560186 Steffan This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
involves the development of biosensors for measuring trichloroethylene (TCE) and
related chlorinated solvents in groundwater. The project involves creating
whole-cell biosensors by fusing reporter genes with chlorinated solvent-induced
toluene oxidation genes from Pseudomonas mendocina KR1 and Pseudomonas sp.
ENVPC5. A variety of reporter genes will be evaluated, but the work will focus
on the use of bioluminescence genes that have been widely used for the creation
of biosensors. Initial biosensor development will involve creating
transcriptional fusions between the reporter genes and cloned toluene oxidation
structural genes. Once created, the fusions will be transferred back to the
original host organism via marker exchange. Additional biosensors will be
created by cloning the entire regulons of the toluene oxidation pathways into E.
coli and inserting the reporter genes so it is expressed in response to TCE.
This approach will allow an evaluation of the most appropriate host organisms
for use as biosensors. The biosensors will be tested for their sensitivity for
measuring TCE in ground water, and the expression of the reporter genes will be
compared to expression of the wild-type toluene oxidation genes in response to
TCE. The biosensors will ultimately be used for developing on-line sensors for
monitoring TCE in groundwater, for developing TCE test kits, and for evaluating
the in situ performance of TCE-degrading microorganisms. This Phase I research
will result in the development of living TCE biosensors that can be used to
construct on-line monitoring devices and test kits. They will also aid in
evaluating, monitoring and modeling the performance of TCE-degrading bacteria in
situ The development of an inexpensive biosensor system will reduce the cost of
routine chemical monitoring, allow on-line monitoring, and increase the cost
effectiveness of environmental remediation. ***
