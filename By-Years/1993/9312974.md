This is an international travel grant jointly supported by the Polar Earth
Sciences and Artic Programs and the Interfacial, Transport, and Separations
Program. The purpose of this international travel grant is to allow the traveler
to interact with academics in the Peoples Republic of China. The activities
include: (1) presentation of a paper at the Sixth International Conference on
Permafrost in Beijing on July 5- 9, 1993; (2) participation in a field excursion
tot he Tibet- Qihai Plateau from July 10-24, 1993; and (3) a visit to two
research institutes: the Central Research Institute of Science and Technology of
th Ministry of Chemical Industry; and, the Lanzhorn Institute of Glaciology and
Geocryology. The common thread in these activities is the relation of
interfacial and transport phenomena to behavior of soil in polar and other low
temperature climates. The traveler is an expert in predicting differential frost
heave. This phenomena has engineering importance since its occurance can cause
significant damage to raods, airport runways, pipelines, and buildings.
