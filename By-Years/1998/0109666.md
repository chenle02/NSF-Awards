This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I (SBIR) project will apply Multi
Photon Detection (MPD) to quantify the minute amounts of proteins contained in
and secreted from a single cell. The successes of genomics have led to the need
for improved knowledge of the protein content of cells (proteomics). The
elucidation of all proteins requires better methods for the study of low
abundance proteins because the majority of "molecular switches" are expected to
be expressed at less than 10,000 copies per cell. The goals of this project are
to further improve the sensitivity of the MPD-enhanced immunoassays down to the
level of a few zeptomole/sample, to study intracellular processing of the
important family of cytokines (IL-1, IL-18) and to study the levels of caspases
in a single cell.

The commercial applications of the technology to be developed in this project
are in the rapidly expanding proteomics market, especially in the area of low
abundance proteins proteomics. This market is currently estimated at around $
200 million and expected to grow severalfolds over the next few years.
