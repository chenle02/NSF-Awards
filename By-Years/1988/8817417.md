This proposal requests funds to set up a freeze-fracture system for vitrified
biological samples. The system consists of a controlled environment
vitrification system (CEVS) which will allow a rapid freezing of samples
equilibrated at a controlled environment of temperature and humidity, and a
system of freeze-fracture-etch device. The CEVS will be constructed at the
University. The freeze-fracture-etch device will be purchased from Balzers, Inc.
The system will be used to study the phase diagram of phosphatidylethanolamine
liposomes (Huang), architecture of the microemulsions (Magid), symbionic vesicle
structures (Jeon), metal implants in bone tissue (Joy), and the mechanism of
flagellum motility (Joy). The system will be maintained and operated as part of
the University of Tennessee Electron Microscopy Facility. Full-time personnel
are available at the Facility to assist the investigators.
