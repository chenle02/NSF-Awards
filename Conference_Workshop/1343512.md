The "Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry in the Southeast" will take
place from 3:30 on Friday, November 8, 2013 until noon on Sunday, November 10,
2013 at the University of South Carolina. There is a strong and growing
Commutative Algebra community in the Southeast and there is a strong and growing
Algebraic Geometry community in the Southeast. The purpose of the "Commutative
Algebra and Algebraic Geometry in the Southeast" conference is to foster
collaborations between researchers at different institutions and encourage
interaction between the Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry communities.
There will be nine lectures and a poster session where graduate students will
present their work. The list of speakers includes renown experts as well as
junior researchers.

Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry are established and active areas of
mathematics that have deep connections with each other and with many other
subjects. They both study similar questions from somewhat different points of
view. Both disciplines profit when there is inter-communication. The conference
will provide opportunities for experts in these two fields to share ideas and
techniques from one of the fields that might be beneficial to the other field,
as well as opportunities for students and young researchers to exchange ideas,
start collaborations, and be exposed to new mathematics.
