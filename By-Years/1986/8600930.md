This research will explore the applicability of data-abstraction and object-
oriented programming techniques to the management of mechanical design data (the
"mechanical-CAD database problem"). Data abstraction and object-oriented
programming have been applied in a limited fashion to computer-graphic and
electronic-CAD databases, but have not been explored systematically in
mechanical domains. Data abstraction principles should provide techniques for
defining complex, hierarchical data structures with embedded semantic
information; object-oriented programming principles should provide techniques
for manipulating such structures in ways that use and propagate (by inheritance,
through operators) semantic properites. The research will be both theoretical
and experimental in character, and should yield a design for an experimental
data management system for use in mechanical CAD systems.
