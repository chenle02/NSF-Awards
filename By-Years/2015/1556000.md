An award is made to Louisiana State University to develop an instrument for
localized sampling of genomic material from single cells in tissue. The proposed
spatially resolved single cell genomics instrument will enable studies of
cellular processes on a single cell level with high resolution. The instrument
will facilitate local sampling of single cells and determination of genetic
differences from cell-to-cell within a heterogeneous population. It will enhance
the ability to study the genomics of stem cell development and the study of
genetic mosaicism in the brain, which has important implications in
understanding neurological diseases and their treatment. The project will
involve students and teachers as well as undergraduate students, graduate
students, and postdocs in several initiatives that will advance STEM education
and career development in Louisiana and the Gulf Coast region. The results of
the project will be disseminated using an array of social media platforms that
are aimed at demonstrating the capabilities of the approach broadly to the
general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genetic differences between individual
cells cause differences in their biological function; however, extracting DNA
and RNA from large numbers of cells obscures important information about
individual cells. High performance next-generation sequencing can be performed
on isolated cells, but only after they have been extracted, which loses the
information about their location in the organism. This project is aimed at
creating a device that can extract material from single cells while preserving
its location in the tissue. The instrument uses an atomic force microscope to
image the tissue and high-precision tip-enhanced laser ablation to select
material for quantification and sequencing. The material is sampled with high
precision from individual cells in spatially selected regions. The project goals
are construction of the laser ablation system, automated imaging and sample
collection, and demonstration of the instrument with breast cancer tissue
samples.
