Recent experiences with funding and managing U.S. activities in international
assessments of science and mathematics achievement have demonstrated a number of
problems such as high rates of non-response and uneven survey methodology. As a
result, the National Academy of Sciences has proposed the establishment of a
U.S. Board on International Comparative Studies in Education. The general
purpose of this board would be to oversee U.S. involvement in international
comparisons of education, particularly in student achievement. More specific
purposes would be to (1) provide a forum for information and discussion; (2)
endorse U.S. participation in international studies; (3) assist in planning the
conduct and funding of studies; (4) establish standards regarding quality of
study design, data collection and analysis procedures, and report preparation;
and (5) assist in the dissemination of study findings. The studies of special
concern for the near future are those conducted under the aegis of the
International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA).
