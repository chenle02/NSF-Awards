This award will provide participant support for young investigators (graduate
students and postdocs) to attend the workshop "Vistas in Axion Physics: A
Roadmap for Theoretical and Experimental Axion Physics through 2025" to be held
at the University of Washington's Institute for Nuclear Theory, Seattle, on
April 23-26, 2012. The goal of this workshop is (1) to organize the scientific
foundation for the next generation of axion and axion-like-particle (ALP)
experiments and searches, and (2) to be a roadmap for the researchers, research
sponsors and the broader scientific community.

For Broader Impacts, it has a particular focus on early career scientists
(postdocs and graduate students) and the Proceedings of the Workshop will be
published.
