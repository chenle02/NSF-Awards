The trend in electronic design is toward smaller, more powerful electronic
systems composed of many VLSI chips, and their design requires new automation
capabilities. This research is on the specific problem of modeling and
synthesizing electronic system level interconnect, and developing algorithms and
techniques that will be applicable to design automation of even broader systems.
The approach is to develop a general, but approximate, capability for modeling
inductive coupling of large scale system-level interconnect that is suitable for
front-end design. For example, the representation of inductance coupling as a
function of interconnect dimensions and spacing is being determined so that
performance vs. cost trade-off analysis can be obtained. Measures of
interconnect design goodness based on controlling the response damping, coupling
noise, and delay are being explored. Moreover, a general approach, which
addresses the complex problem of coupled lines, and includes a means of
exploiting extraction capabilities is being pursued. The results of this work
will also be considered for design automation of more general problems, such as
electro-mechanical system design.
