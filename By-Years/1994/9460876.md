Due to the increasing environmental hazards posed by automobile exhaust
emissions, alternative fuels, such as ethanol/gasohol, CNG, and hydrogen, and
electric propulsion have been proposed to power future automobiles.
Nevertheless, these hybrid vehicles suffer a significant loss in the combustion
efficiency resulting in a rather slow acceptance by the public. In order to
enhance the combustion efficiency of these alternative fuels, a novel, erosion-
resistant spark plug (railplug), based on the plasma railgun principles, is
proposed. The railplug electrodes require high-temperature strength, excellent
electrical/thermal conductivity, arc/plasma-erosion resistance to survive in the
harsh environments where they operate. Current electrode materials, such as
steel, Ni-Mn-Cr alloy, and platinum-coated nickel, fail prematurely in plasma
environments due to their inferior erosion resistance and poor high-temperature
properties. In the Phase I, Materials Modification, Inc., will develop
nanocrystalline refractory composites for railplug electrodes using chemical
reaction methods. These composites will be consolidated using rapid
consolidation methods that facilitate the achievement of near-theoretical
density, in a very short time, at substantially lower processing/manufacturing
costs. Phase I will focus on optimization of synthesis, consolidation, and
characterization. Phase II will concentrate on optimization of process-
structure-property parameters and the production of prototypes for lab and field
evaluation. This should rapidly lead to a collaboration with a major
manufacturer in the Phase III for incorporation into automotive systems.
