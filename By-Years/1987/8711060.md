In many economic settings the efficiency of explicit and implicit contractual
arrangements is limited by the presence of imperfect monitoring: some agents
cannot observe perfectly the actions of others. Often the economic problem of
interest involves the indefinite repetition of some strategic situation such as
an oligopoly, a partnership, or any organizational hierarchy. Cooperation in
such problems depends upon the participants responding aggressively to
indications that not all participants are honoring the implicit agreement. It
would seem then that the possibilities for cooperation are enhanced when signals
related to players' behavior are observed without delay, and when players can
respond quickly to new information. Under their previous grant the investigators
demonstrated that the opposite is true. Cooperation is enhanced by delays in the
observation of signals and slower reaction speeds for players. The delays and
slower reaction speeds made it possible to use a single punishment to deter a
multitude of different potential deviations from the implicit agreement. This is
described as "reusable punishments." Exploiting reusability enhances
organizational efficiency dramatically. In their previous work the investigators
used standard repeated games with discounting. These games assume a fixed
frequency with which players take actions and fixed frequency with which players
receive information regarding the play of the game. The contribution of this
grant comes from relaxing these assumptions, studying information flow in other
problems, and generalizing the results into a new theory of organizational
design. The new topics considered include implicit contract theory in
competitive markets, renegotiation in supergames, strategic complexity, partial
moral hazard in repeated agency, and the strategic dynamics of collusion in
markets with renewable resources.
