The main objective of this research is to develop mathematical methods for the
design and stabilization of nonlinear feedback- control systems. The development
of such methods would be of benefit to many branches of applied science and
engineering to which industrial controls, flight controls, position controls,
and other aspects of control engineering are pertinent. The main theoretical
tool proposed for the research is a theory of coprime fraction representations
of nonlinear systems. This theory seems to provide a basis for the design of
nonlinear control systems.
