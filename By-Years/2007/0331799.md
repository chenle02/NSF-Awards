This award provides funds to subsidize the travel and housing expenses of
students selected to participate in the User Modeling Doctoral Consortium, which
will be held in conjunction with the ninth International Conference on User
Modeling on June 22-26, 2003, in Johnstown, Pennsylvania.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the consortium, Ph.D. students who are doing their
dissertations on AI-related topics present their proposed research, and receive
feedback from a panel of established researchers as well as from the other
students. This provides the students with invaluable exposure to outside
perspectives on their work, at a critical time in their research, and also
enables them to explore their career objectives. This workshop contributes to
the professional development of young scientists who will lead this growing
field in the coming decades.&lt;br/&gt;
