9412680 Segel Research will be carried out at CERN on determination of the
neutron and proton spin structure functions. Polarized muons will be scattered
from polarized hydrogen and deuterium targets. The experiments will be carried
out in collaboration with a large group of US and European researchers, the Spin
Muon Collaboration. These measurements will help identify the fraction of the
nucleon's spin carried by quarks and gluons, test fundamental sum-rules related
to electroweak interactions, and probe the strange quark content of the nucleon.
