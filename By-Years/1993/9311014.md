9311014 Matsueda This is a project to study the relationship between the family
and juvenile delinquency. The researcher will use data from the longitudinal
National Survey of Children to analyze the relative influence of family
structure on delinquency and the extent to which factors such as marital and
parent-child conflict, attachment to parents, communication styles, parental
supervision, and styles of parental discipline mediate the influence of family
structure on delinquent behavior. This project has potential to make important
contributions to our theoretical understanding of both family dynamics and the
sources of juvenile delinquency. Research on the connection between family
structure and delinquency stretches back over more than half a century, and
contemporary social commentators confidently proclaim their views on this
connection. Yet up to now there have not been either suitable data or research
projects with sufficient methodological sophistication to allow claims about
family-delinquency links to be rigorously tested. This project, through its use
of richer data and its theoretical and methodological sophistication, will make
it possible to replace hunches and prejudice with scientific evidence. If this
project is successful, it should provide a firmer basis for considering policy
and interventions to help reduce juvenile delinquency. ***
