Membrane science and separations are two areas highlighted recently by the
Amundson report as worthy of special attention in chemical engineering research.
The goal of this Gordon Conference, which has been held every other year since
1974, is to bring together researchers working at the leading edge of membrane
science and technology for one week so that they may present the most recent
research findings and discuss the impact of these findings on the use of
membranes in separation methods. In the spirit of Gordon Conference in general,
we have organized the 1990 Synthetic Membrane Conference to allow considerable
time for active discussion of each paper. This Conference will draw participants
from the fields of engineering, chemistry and physics for the purpose of
discussing the most recent research progress in membrane science and technology.
It is important that we enable a significant number of graduate students to
attend so that 1) future leaders of membrane technology are exposed to
pioneering work done in the field; 2) the conference benefits from the fresh
input provided by younger researchers; and 3) current students in the field of
membrane science and separations are stimulated toward a research career and
possibly toward a faculty position.
