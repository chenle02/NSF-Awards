Proposal: 0851480&lt;br/&gt;PI Name: Joseph Magee&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
three-year renewal REU site program at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) will engage undergraduate students in an eleven-week summer
research experience in multidisciplinary research in engineering, applied
physical science, and information technology. The program will immerse students
in science and include hands-on experience with state-of-the-art research and
computational tools and involve frequent interaction with distinguished
scientists and engineers. The undergraduate students will learn to think about
the origins, future directions, and potential applications of research projects.
An important feature of this program will be the weekly seminar series. Seminar
speakers will come from diverse backgrounds, including representatives from
professional organizations, staff from neighboring laboratories, and NIST staff
members. These lectures will usually be augmented by a tour of a NIST research
facility. In addition, students will attend seminars that are sponsored by the
NIST Research Advisory Committee as part of its Summer Seminar Series, which
features nationally and internationally recognized researchers who will speak on
topical issues in science and society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Social activities
will be an integral part of the students' experience with the goal of building
friendships and collegiality between the students and faculty. At the end of the
summer, students will participate in a combined symposium and give oral
presentations of their research. This two-day event will be open to all NIST
staff and interested guests. All participants in this REU program will also be
expected to give seminars at their home institutions. This will be a confidence
builder for the student and can inspire other undergraduates to seek out an REU
program experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recruitment efforts will be targeted to
students underrepresented in science and engineering or from regional colleges
that have limited research opportunities for undergraduates.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this REU site program is to provide research
training which will prepare and motivate students to pursue PhD programs in
preparation for careers in research and development.
