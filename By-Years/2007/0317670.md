A central theme of the "Math in Motion project is the relationship between
seeing and imaging in mathematics learning; through our work we have become
deeply interested in conducting studies based on eye movements. This SGER
proposal fulfills an opportunity cost in the sense of taking advantage of an
ongoing prjoect that will provide a timely conceptual background and practical
need for the proposed work. I t will allow us to conduct interviews with high
school students in whichg they will interpret and draw graphs for the motion of
an imaginary object. We will analyze the data collected with an eye tracker in
conjunctions with the videotaped interview and its transcription. We will
examine how thte interviewee's scanpaths change as she tries to see and imagine
different aspects of the motion symbolized by the graph. These exploratory
studies will illuminate the following research questions of the project included
in the Math in Motion proposal: "How does bodily action/perception become part
of imagining the mothion and shape of mathematical enitities? In which ways do
students' understanding of properties come to mold their bodily
action/perception?" As far as we know, the existing studies in mathematics
education tracking eye motion have focused on ascertaining how experts and
novices pay atteention to different aspect of videotaped episodes or to validate
formal models of information processing. Our aim is different and more in the
tradition of Yarbus (1967): the conduction of case studies analyzing patterns of
indivi8dual canpaths depending on the viewer's questions and what she is trying
to imagine.
