&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pruning Techniques for More Expressive
Planning&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first year
funding of a two year continuing award. Solving more expressive planning
problems is important because many practical problems fall in this category. It
is important to be able to control search in the synthesis of these plans. This
project involves development of various pruning techniques for more expressive
planning. These are based on identifying various flaws in partial plans and the
costs of resolving them. An efficient conjunctive planner and an efficient
disjunctive planner will be modified to handle universal quantifiers, functions,
metric time and continuous variables. These planners will use pruning techniques
developed in this project. The results of the project will improve understanding
of efficient synthesis of plans in more expressive domains like NASA's Deep
Space One mission.&lt;br/&gt;
