The PIs propose to resolve kilometer scale waves in bottomside equatorial spread
F scattering layers using long baseline interferometric imaging at Jicamarca.
Since the main beam of the Jicamarca antenna is too wide to resolve ionospheric
interchange instability, the PIs will employ an imaging interferometry technique
to observe kilometer scale waves. The Jicamarca antenna array will be have a new
module, located at some distance from the others. The investigators will also
investigate the full nonlocal, nonlinear theory of intermediate-scale plasma
waves in spread F to determine the cause of pronounced km scale structures in
spread F disturbances. Finally, they will develop a fluid computer simulation of
the structures with radar imaging.***
