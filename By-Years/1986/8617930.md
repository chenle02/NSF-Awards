An x-ray diffractometer and area detector will be acquired. A wide variety of
biological projects will be supported by the new equipment. Among the projects
to be supported are further studies on crambin, a hydrophobic plant protein;
purothionin, a hemolytic toxin from wheat; kringle 4, a fragment of the enzyme
plasminogen; phycocyanin, a light harvesting antenna bacterial protein; and
mutant aspartate transcarbamylases, an enzyme important in pyrimidine
metabolism; natural products; synthetic receptors for organic molecules; metal
ion complexes with nucleic acids; metal ions bound to coenzymes. These
crystallographic studies on small molecules and other macromolecules will be
combined with numerous other techniques such as CD, Raman, NMR and ESR
spectroscopy; equilibrium binding assays and enzymatic kinetics; organic
synthesis; computer graphics and molecular mechanics and structural prediction.
On the whole, the intent is to look at structure-function relationships,
integrating static structural information with dynamic information to gain a
more complete understanding of macromolecular function. The crystallographic
structural determination will also serve as an important adjunct to organic
synthesis of natural products and to the design of synthetic receptors.
