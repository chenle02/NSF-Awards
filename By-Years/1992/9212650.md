It has never been possible until very recently to measure the natural
distribution patterns of odor in the environment. Dr. Atema and his colleagues
have developed tools to make such high- resolution measurements based on the
odor-sampling equipment of lobsters. The lobster and the aquatic environment are
particularly favorable to carry out this fundamental research on odor-sampling.
The present research will try to extract from such odor measurements the salient
features that allow animals to track turbulent odor plumes and locate their
source. Results from this work will open up our human understanding of an almost
unknown sensory world, but one used by many animals, both aquatic and
terrestrial. Practical applications can be expected almost immediately in the
design of odor-tracking underwater vehicles.
