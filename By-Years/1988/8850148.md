The proposed project is designed to increase awareness of engineering as a
career 20 for Native American, minority, and female students. The program will
target students entering the 9th, 10th and 11th grade as the primary candidates.
These students will be selected from the northeastern Oklahoma regional area,
which includes portions of northwest Arkansas, southwest Missouri, and southeast
Kansas. This will be a two-week on-campus session at the University of Tulsa
where the scholars will interact with departmental faculty, undergraduate
students in Chemical Engineering, and selected representatives from local
industry (including individuals from the various groups at which this program is
targeted). In addition, the scholars will be exposed to hands-on chemical
engineering problems through laboratory experiments and a small research
project.
