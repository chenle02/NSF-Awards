(A). Basic Aspect: This project is aimed at studying the mechanism of
regulation of growth hormone gene expression at the molecular level in the fish
system. Specifically, studies will be conducted to: (i) identify factors that
regulate the expression of GH genes, and (ii) to elucidate the molecular
mechanism of tissue specific and developmental stage specific expression of
these genes. (B). Applied Aspect: Successful growth and development in finfish
and shellfish is a prerequisite for the success of aquaculture. Knowledge of
unequivocal identification and understanding factors that regulate the
expression of fish GH genes will facilitate designing of realistic strategies
for enhancing the growth rates of finfish and shellfish in aquaculture
operations.//
