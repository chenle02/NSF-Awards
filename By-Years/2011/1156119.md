The Principal Investigator (PI) will study so-called "multiple" or "sympathetic"
coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in order to determine the structural properties of
the background solar magnetic field in which these eruptions occur, specifically
for two well-observed multiple CME events. He will investigate how structural
features like separatrix surfaces and quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs)
characterize the sites of magnetic reconnection and field reconfiguration, as
well as how they connect individual CME eruptions in multiple events and, in
particular, how these features predetermine the sequential order of eruptions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will analyze the evolution of multiple CMEs, using
data from ground-based and space-based observatories, along with global
potential field source surface (PFSS) and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modeling of
the coronal magnetic field. Specifically, he will compute global PFSS and MHD
solutions that describe the background magnetic configurations of the multiple
CME events of 1-2 August 2010 and 27-28 July 2011. He will also reconstruct the
large-scale separatrix surfaces and QSLs in these configurations and identify
which of their structural components are model-independent. The PI will then
analyze these components and identify among them those that are most likely to
affect the CME eruption process in these events, and particularly, those which
predetermine the order of successive CME eruptions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
PI's new techniques for the structural analysis of magnetic field configurations
will be applicable to all studies in solar and heliospheric physics where a
detailed knowledge of magnetic field structure and its impact on physical
processes in solar plasma is required. The PI will also share his results online
with the wider scientific community. This research will result in a fuller
description of the basic magnetic topology of the solar corona, and this
description is a prerequisite for effectively predicting space weather events
like CMEs.
