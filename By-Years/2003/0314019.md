This project will provide travel grants to enable 50 participants to attend the
Tenth International Congress on Mathematical Education (ICME-10) in Copenhagen,
Denmark, from July 4-11, 2004. Awardees will include mathematics teachers and
supervisors, mathematics teacher educators and researchers. The major objectives
of the project are to provide U.S. representatives with the opportunity to
acquire knowledge of mathematics education world wide, interact with leading
contributors to mathematics education from other countries, establish liaisons
and begin to build networks with foreign mathematics educators, bring problems
in the U.S. into better focus by learning from the experiences of others, derive
insight into new ways to approach and solve U.S. problems in mathematics
education, widely disseminate information from the Congress to the U.S.
mathematics education community, and to share knowledge of the current and
future plans of U.S. mathematics education with foreign colleagues.
