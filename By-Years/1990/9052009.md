The Department of Chemistry at the institution integrated Gas Chromatography-
Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) into its curriculum. The department acquired a
Finnigan MAT Model 804A GC-MS system which features an ion trap detector and
allows both electron impact and chemical ionization of samples. The instrument
is controlled by a menu driven IBM-PC compatible computer and permits library
searching of mass spectra. The department previously lacked any capability in
mass spectrometry. The instrument is fully integrated into the organic chemistry
courses in the curriculum and has been incorporated into two additional courses.
The project provides students with hands-on experience with an instrument that
has become standard technology in many academic, industrial, and commercial
laboratories. The project provides the first entry into instrumentation which
combines two analytical methods in one system. The education of at least 400
science majors over the next five years will be enhanced by the project. The
institution contributed to this project in a amount equal to the NSF funds.
