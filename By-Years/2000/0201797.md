0201797&lt;br/&gt;Green&lt;br/&gt;This award continues the successful NSF-
supported Design Projects' program at North Dakota State University in which
students design and build custom projects for individual persons with
disabilities. The objectives of the activity are to enhance engineering
education, provide students with insight into careers in rehabilitation, improve
the quality of life of people with disabilities, and serve the community. The
different design projects meet special needs of individuals that are not
addressed by commercial devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approximately 40
engineering students participate annually in the Design Projects' activity with
facilities provided in three separate laboratories for analysis, prototyping,
printed circuit board layout, fabrication, and redesign/development. The
engineering students interact with 8 organizations involved with aiding persons
with disabilities to identify candidates who would benefit from the program's
activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Design Projects completed each year of the
award are to be published in an Annual Review available at http://nsf-
pad.bme.uconn.edu/.&lt;br/&gt;
