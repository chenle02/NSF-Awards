An overall description of the research in this project is the study of proton
structure (or more generally, of the structure of particles that feels the
nuclear force, collectively known as hadrons). We want to learn the details of
how the proton is put together, or how matter is distributed within a proton,
and also to make use of this knowledge in the related fields, such as atomic
physics, to calculate phenomena that are sensitive to the proton size. One
remarkable method we use is a mathematical equivalence between results obtained
in certain weakly coupled, hence relatively easily calculable, 5-dimensional
theories and results in the 4-dimensional (counting time) theories that describe
our world. We obtain results this way for the charge distribution, magnetization
distribution, and energy distribution inside the proton and other particles. We
have also been able to apply our knowledge of proton structure to make
calculation of splittings between certain hydrogen energy levels to the
remarkable accuracy of a part in a million.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The direct
impact of this research is to further our understanding of forefront hadronic
physics. Broader impacts of the proposed activity include the training of new
students, including undergraduates; bridging the gaps between different fields
of physics such as between atomic and nuclear physics; and, given that the
principal investigator is regularly at the Jefferson Laboratory, bridging the
gap between university and national lab research groups. The principle
investigator, it may be also noted, has had two successful women Ph. D. students
and there may be further opportunities along these lines.
