This grant is enabling the Department of Computer and Information Science to
build a Silicon Graphics (SGI) computer laboratory. To foster computer graphics
use in the sciences and arts the university has initiated a series of
undergraduate courses in computer graphics. These courses prepare students to
use available graphics software and to develop graphics output to solve their
specific needs, enhance student understanding of math and science data, and
allow students to better visualize their environment. These courses are open to
students in computer science, engineering, mathematics, chemistry, physics,
biology, radio, television and film, and art. The lab serves as a campuswide
resource for new courses, previously funded research projects, and all
interested students. As many as 400 students are expected to use this computer
graphics lab each academic year.
