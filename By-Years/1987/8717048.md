The problem of determining certain characteristic values of large dynamic
systems is computationally complex and time consuming. New developments in
computer hardware together with configuration of that hardware show a high
degree of promise relative to the computation of these important design values.
This proposal addresses new innovations in both configuration and algorithms
specifically geared for the large-scale problem.
