In this project, the investigators will study the fundamental reaction chemistry
of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) production. Prior work from this group showed
acid-catalyzed reactions within particles may greatly enhance SOA formation,
this having important implications for atmospheric aerosol production. The
investigators will pursue laboratory, outdoor chamber and modeling elements
aimed at (i) understanding the mechanisms by which acid-catalyzed reactions lead
to SOA; (ii) quantifying the effects of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), acid
composition, and ambient atmospheric conditions on SOA formation for a
representative set of VOC reactions; and (iii) incorporating those results into
an existing chemical kinetic model in order to predict SOA formation under non-
acid and acid aerosol catalysis conditions. The project will through experiment
improve our basic understanding of factors critical to SOA formation, and
through modeling and mechanistic studies provide insight into particle formation
in the atmosphere on a range of scales. Particles in the atmosphere present a
major unknown with respect to their impact on global climate. The project
Principal Investigator is an early-career female research scientist. Further
broad impacts of the project include educational support for graduate students
to conduct directed research and undergraduates to gain research experience.
Equipment purchased under this award will build capacity and research
infrastructure at the host institution.
