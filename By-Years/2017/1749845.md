The integrated circuits (ICs) that underpin critical systems in modern society
are produced by a global supply chain that involves a variety of actors in many
countries. Some of the actors are trusted, but others are not. Untrusted actors
give rise to supply chain threats such as counterfeit ICs of uncertain quality
or the possibility of malicious changes to the function of ICs. To secure
electronic systems in defense, critical infrastructure, and healthcare, it is
increasingly important to secure the global IC supply chain. This research
project pursues new strategies for securing ICs against supply chain
threats.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This research explores a new framework for supply
chain security organized around three main thrusts. The first thrust explores
application-specific designs with post-fabrication programmability to prevent
targeted Trojan insertion by an untrusted foundry. The second thrust of the work
addresses the design side of the supply chain, and seeks new formal abstractions
for reasoning about, and protecting against, entire classes of malicious circuit
modifications. The third thrust addresses the distribution side of the supply
chain with a low-cost authentication technique to verify the provenance of
packaged ICs.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This research project has the potential to
positively impact national security and well-being of individuals by helping to
keep malicious parts out of critical systems such as defense aircraft and
medical devices. The work supports economic competitiveness of US semiconductor
companies by trying to prevent billions of dollars in annual losses from
counterfeits. The project supports cybersecurity education through a variety of
contest-based learning activities, and through a supply chain testbed for lab
courses that supports both education and research.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Public
data, tools, and design artifacts associated with this project will be made
publicly available through the completion of the project at
