Primordial Helium escapes from active spreading zones at the ocean bottom and is
carried around by the deep circulation. It represents a natural experiment in
tracer injection whose signal has possibly reached a quasi-steady-state. This
proposal requests funds to study the Deep and Bottom Water circulation of the
North Pacific using He-3 as a tracer. Samples were collected on two transects
across the Pacific, at 24x and 47xN, and on a NOAA/PMEL cruise around the San
Juan de Fuca Ridge. These samples will be analyzed and the Helium-3 distribution
interpreted in light of deep ocean circulation models.
