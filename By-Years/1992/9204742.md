This research consists of three directions. The first direction is devoted to
average case complexity. Specific issues include natural complete problems,
reduction theory, and specific graph problems. The second direction involves a
variety of other complexity issues. Specific issues include time-space trade-
offs, nontraditional approaches and linear time. The third direction is devoted
to finite model theory. Specific issues include classical first order theorems
and the logic of functions.
