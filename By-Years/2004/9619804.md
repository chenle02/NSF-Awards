Dr. David A. Pierce and other members of the Chemistry Department at the
University of North Dakota are being supported to continue a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. The site is co-funded by
the Chemistry Division and the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive
Research (EPSCoR). For the period 1997-99, ten undergraduate students will spend
ten weeks each summer actively engaged in basic research projects drawn from the
traditional areas of chemistry including synthesis, biophysical and bioinorganic
chemistry, catalysis, computational chemistry, and environmental analysis.
Students present both written and oral research reports. The site sponsors an
external evaluator who uses focus groups to measure participant and mentor
experiences. Recruitment focusses on four-year colleges in seven states in the
region, with intensive outreach to Native American students.
