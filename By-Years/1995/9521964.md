9521964 Ballance The Symposium topic is particularly timely because of the
increasingly wide recognition within the industry that durability and science
life production are key issues in the promotion and development of high
performance concrete. Thus, the topic is directly relevant to NSF's new
initiative on Civil Infrastructure Systems. The symposium will focus on research
which seeks to elucidate the mechanisms of chemical degradation, particularly
those involving chemical species from the environment, for example, chlorides,
sulfates and carbon dioxide. It will also address the integration of the
processes by which species permeate concrete with the changes in microstructure
and properties they bring about.
