Bruno Nachtergaele will work on problems in equilibrium and non-equilibrium
quantum statistical mechanics. The main focus is on quantum spin models, but
also some other quantum many-body systems will be studied. There are four groups
of problems in the project. 1) Rigorous study of Chern-Simons phases in quantum
spin models, in particular in the Freedman model. 2) Bosonization and quantum
central limit theorems, with applications to the analysis of the asymptotics for
large spin of the low-lying spectrum of the XXZ Heisenberg chain. 3) Microscopic
models for magnetic interface dynamics. This includes the study of bound states
of domain walls and droplets at impurities, diffusion of domain walls, domains
in dimensions higher dimensions and electron scattering in a magnetic wire with
domain walls. 4) Non-equilibrium stationary states, entropy production, and the
microscopic description of thermodynamic currents. For the last two topics,
Nachtergaele will study concrete dynamical questions of simple models that have
low-energy states with non-trivial geometric structures such as interfaces. One
of the long-term goals is to make progress in the theory of non-equilibrium
statistical mechanics.

In order to quantitatively understand many properties of electronic components
and measuring devices at the nanometer scale, analytic methods are needed that
allow us to study models that take into account both quantum mechanical effects
and interface phenomena. Nachtergaele will work on model problems to develop
such methods. Particular emphasis will be put on interfaces between magnetic
domains and their dynamics. This is a fundamental problem in understanding the
dynamics of magnetic memory devices, such as computer hard disks. The same
mathematical techniques also apply to the new field of spintronics. The approach
is to study a number of specific models with the expectation that a sufficiently
detailed solution of these models will point the way to answers for similar
questions in more general systems. The project contains a number of attractive
research problems for students from a wide variety of backgrounds, as well as
for mathematics students interested in opportunities to become familiar with
areas outside of mathematics where mathematics is applied at a high level.
Modern materials science, which very much relies on computational modeling and
design of materials, is an example.
