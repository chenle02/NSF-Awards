Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will be concerned with the
production of the W particle at high- energy colliders. Precise calculations of
the rate for production of this particle will be performed. The particle is the
carrier of the weak nuclear force, and the calculations to be carried out are
important to the testing of our understanding of this force and of the strong
nuclear force.
