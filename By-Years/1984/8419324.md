This research deals with an analytical investigation of the problem of fracture
under a moving contact, where the driving force for failure consists of both the
contact stresses and the elastic stresses generated by thermal distortions. The
project will consider both the isotropic (metals) and anisotropic materials
(composites and non-metals). The result of this research will be important in
many tribological applications, such as bearings, gears, brakes, and railway
wheels.
