High-latitude ecosystems are among the most sensitive to accelerating climate
change, with some of the highest rates of temperature increase and altered
hydrological patterns. The rich carbon reserves locked in northern soils are
increasingly prone to being released into the atmosphere as methane, a powerful
greenhouse gas that, as atmospheric concentrations increase, is liable to
further increase the speed of warming. The two major environmental factors that
affect the amount of methane being made and released from natural wetland
ecosystems are (1) how wet the soil is, and (2) how warm the soil is, but little
is known about how these factors interact during seasonal transition periods
like late spring, when soils thaw and lose snow cover. This project uses a
portable greenhouse gas analyzer to measure methane gas emissions from a
northern Finnish mire during the 2013 spring transition period and summer
growing season, using snow-melting and soil manipulation experiments to
determine the influence of these variables on methane emission
rates.&lt;br/&gt;Precisely because they are experiencing climate changes at
faster rates than the rest of the planet, methane studies in high-latitude
systems are critical to our understanding of future climate dynamics. This
research will contribute not only to scientific knowledge of methane cycling in
northern wetlands, but also to improving global climate models that inform
international climate change policymaking. Moreover, this research recognizes
that climate change is not merely a national issue, and facilitates trans-
national comparisons with the authors? ongoing study of Alaskan wetlands. The
field work will include the participation of a PolarTREC volunteer, an American
middle school science teacher, which will provide multiple outreach avenues for
informing young Americans about this research. Additional outreach and field-
based teaching opportunities will be conducted, both in Finland and
America.&lt;br/&gt;
