IVANOV, 98-01500 The proposer will work on further development and applications
of a geometric machinery of graded diagrams which was recently created to solve
the famous Burnside problem on periodic groups for all sufficiently large
exponents and has already been successfully applied to prove Gromov's conjecture
on periodic quotients of hyperbolic groups of bounded exponent. In particular,
the proposer will carry out this machinery to free products of groups,
investigate finitely presented groups given by periodic relations and subgroups
of free Burnside groups of large even exponent, and apply this machinery to
nonhyperbolic groups with classical small cancellation conditions. The field of
group theory is the mathematical theory of symmetry and interacts with many
other disciplines, for example physics and chemistry outside of mathematics,
coding theory, number theory and geometry inside mathematics. This research is
in combinatorial group theory which studies groups defined by means of
generators and defining relations and is the intersection of group theory, low
dimensional topology, geometry, and the theory of computability.
