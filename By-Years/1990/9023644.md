A research program will be carried out at the Brookhaven National Lab (BNL) AGS
facility and at Vassar College related to hypernuclear physics, specifically,
experiments aimed at a search for rare, strangeness -2 dibaryons and for sigma
hypernuclei in which sigma baryons are bound in nuclei. The dibaryon search is
motivated by serious quark bag model predictions. The sigma hypernuclear search
offers the possibility of new information regarding the force between sigma
baryons and normal nuclear matter, and ultimately how the introduction of
strange quarks into the nucleon modifies the strong force. Undergraduate
students will be integrated into this research program. The research will be
carried out in collaboration with a larger group including staff at BNL.
