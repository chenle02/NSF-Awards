9414594 Pignatello This is an award to provide support for research on an
advanced oxidation process for destruction of organic contaminants of water and
soil. The process involves use of iron in the ferric state, near-ultraviolet
light radiation and hydrogen peroxide. The objectives of this research are to
study key features of the inorganic and photochemical mechanisms that affect
oxidation of the target organic compounds and the applications of this
innovative environmental technology. The investigator plans on determining
whether a hypervalent iron-oxo complex is formed photochemically that
supplements the action of the hydroxyl radical in oxidation of organic compounds
and expects to clarify the role of ferric iron in this reaction. The
applications phase of this research will address the effect of light intensity
and temperature on the reaction rate, the kinetics and pathways of degradation
of organic substances subjected to the process, the influence of common anions
on the reaction rate and the feasibility of a two stage system combining this
advanced oxidation process with a biological process for treatment of water and
soil contaminated with organic wood preservatives. Results of this project are
expected to provide the basis for considering its use in treatment of soil and
water that has been contaminated with organic substances of commercial,
industrial and agricultural significance. ***
