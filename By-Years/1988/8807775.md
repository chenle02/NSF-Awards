The objective of this project is the study and development of hardware and
software for performance analysis of advanced multiprocessor systems. The work
is centered around the Cedar multiprocessor project, partly funded under another
NSF grant. The intent is to develop measurements and analytic tools that can be
applied to the performance evaluation of the Cedar machine as well as Alliant
FX/8. These include static analysis tools to address the algorithm/architecture
mapping issues related to the efficient use of multiprocessors. It also includes
the development of instrumentation for dynamic analysis; namely, hardware and
software for collecting run-time execution data from the Cedar system. Another
related goal is to investigate several techniques for virtual execution from
analysis of multitasked programs on Cedar. The evaluation of parallel machine
performance is in its infancy and it is likely that the field may benefit from
the work proposed. This is one of the strongest research groups in parallel
processing in the country. Their track record is impressive. The funding of this
work at reduced level is strongly recommended.
