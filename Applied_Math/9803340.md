In the past 40 years, spline functions (in their simplest form, piecewise
polynomials) have become a well-established computational tool, and are now
widely used by scientists and engineers. They are used for a variety of
purposes, including approximating curves and surfaces, fitting data, computer-
aided geometric design (CAGD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), solution of
differential equations, image processing, etc. The aim of this research is to
continue to develop the theory and applications of splines, and to create and
test algorithms for solving some specific applications problems, especially
problems arising in CAGD, CAM, geology, geophysics, and meteorology.
