9312523, PI-Veronis: This proposal is for the exploration of theoretical ideas
of processes that influence large scale ocean circulation. These theoretical
studies are partly analytical and partly numerical. They are to be supplemented
with experiments on the effects of topography on flows which simulate large
scale ocean circulation on a rotating turn-table in the laboratory. In addition,
an experimental study is proposed to determine the influence of the magnitude of
the heat and salt anomalies on the height of salt fingers in the laboratory.
