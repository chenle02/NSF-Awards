This is a post Loma Prieta earthquake (Oct. 1989) investigation project in
learning from this damaging event. This projects will study the damage and
document the museum contents losses during the earthquake in terms of both value
and failure mode. Several critical museums will be selected and their site-
specific art object/support system response criteria will be determined from the
recorded ground motions. The response criteria and damage survey will then be
used to develop recommendations for future seismic loss mitigation measures for
museum contents. This study will improve our ability to reduce the losses of
museums in their irreplaceable collections due to earthquakes.
