9451987 John Each of the six regional colleges of the Houston Community College
System is acquiring a Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometers for hands-on
use by over 3,900 students annually enrolling in chemistry. The instrumentation
is enabling the institution to: (a) utilize infrared spectroscopy in the organic
chemistry laboratories and facilitating the development of microscale organic
experiments; (b) incorporate infrared spectroscopy in special projects for
students participating in the Honors program; (c) to introduce modern
instrumentation to first year students through experiments involving
identification by infrared spectroscopy.
