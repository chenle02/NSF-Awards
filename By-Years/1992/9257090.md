This NYI award will support the research of a promising and accomplished young
investigator. His research will include the use of a silicon vertex detector
(SVX) in the CDF experiment at Fermilab to study the b-quark, and search for the
t-quark. The enhanced signal-to-noise derived from the SVX vertex information
will provide unique capabilities for b-quark physics and play an essential role
in extracting signals for t-quark production.
