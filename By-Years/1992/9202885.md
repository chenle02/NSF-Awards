This award is intended to facilitate a multi-disciplinary effort to integrate
the various research activities in the area of manufacturing controls in a
manner that focusses these efforts with greater emphasis and efficiency.
Research activities to be pursued will include, but not be limited to, motion
controllers for precision and sensorless actuators, predictive monitoring and
diagnostics systems for manufacturing equipment, Linear Induction Motor (LIM)
based manufacturing equipment and the surface measurement and processing of
sculptured surfaces. Further projects that will have a significant impact on
manufacturing in the United States will be identified by the research team in
close consultation with industry and the research community. All these projects
will be closely coupled with the Manufacturing Systems and Engineering program
to enable the transfer of the results of the research activity to the classroom.
Technology transfer to the industrial sector will be an essential part of the
activity. The integration of multiple investigators into a team focussed on
research in the area of manufacturing controls will assist in the research and
development of new solutions to traditional problems in manufacturing.
Significant long-term benefit could be derived if this is successfully coupled
with technology transfer in the classroom and to the industry sector.
