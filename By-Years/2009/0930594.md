This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will investigate
transparent metal oxide nanostructures, especially zinc oxide and titanium
oxide, suitable for a wide range of applications that require transparent
conductors.

If successful this project will create low cost transparent electrodes for
applications such as LCD displays, touch screens, and solar cells.
