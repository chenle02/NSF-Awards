Mr. Robert Rosenthal, Manager of NIST's Protocol Security Group,has proposed to
provide 1/2 professional person year effort of engineering and technical advice
to NSF's Division of NetworkingResearch and Communications Infrastructure. This
effort would be applied to areas relevant to NREN that include (but not limited
to) defac to and official standards and processes, network and relevant host
based security, naming and addressing, routing, acceptable use policies and how
they may be implemented via protocols, accelerating the privatization of
commodity network services via well structured networks and protocol support,
and peering at inter network exchange points. Mr. Rosenthal would join two other
highly respected and competent individuals who currently perform the same
function as members of the NSF Engineering Group (NEG), which reports to Bob
Aiken, the DNCRI NREN program manager.
