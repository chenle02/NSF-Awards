This is a project to define the shallow and deep structure of the lower reaches
of the relict Yellow River where it emptied on the outer shelf and the structure
of the presumed delta and fan in the Okinawa Trough. The study will use seismic
data previously collected by the principal investigator and his collaborators to
trace former channels of the Yellow River and define sediment depocenters. %%%
The Yellow River system is unique amongst the large rivers of the world in that
during low stands of sea level at least some of its sediment apparently empties
into an enclosed basin. It is even more interesting that this basin is a
tectonically active back arc basin. Dr. Milliman has done pioneering work on
this classic field area and this project is a continuation of that important
effort.
