The proposed program concerns distributed network architectures that are based
on reinforcement learning by individual users. The main goal of the program is
to develop a general framework for dynamic and distributed resource sharing
mechanisms that are suitable for large networks. A generic formulation is
considered in which users access network resources in one of several alternative
ways. Each user is restricted to observe its own interpretation of the outcomes
only, where this outcome depends also on the actions of other users. The
proposed framework involves non-cooperative decision making by network users
based on this local information, in turn it is scalable in the size of the
network. The research program will identify macroscopic dynamics of the network
in terms of nonlinear differential equations that are asymptotically exact in
algorithmic parameters. The limit system is closely related to certain dynamical
systems that arise in the context of evolutionary biology. Successfully
completed program will identify possible equilibrium regimes, will characterize
distributed algorithms that lead to stable network operation, and will develop
network design and management guidelines that maintain desired operating regimes
for the network. Robustness of the proposed algorithms will be investigated
analytically, and verification of obtained results will be carried out via
simulations and experiments.

Educational aspects of the proposed program involves course development and
teaching with the ultimate goal of a strong research program and close
industrial collaboration, mentoring at both graduate and undergraduate levels,
and active research participation from undergraduate students.
