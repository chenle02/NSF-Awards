Records of Earthâ€™s past climates (e.g., from tree rings, marine sediments, ice,
and corals) are key to understanding what the climate system is capable of and
for testing the climate models used to project future climate. At present, there
are a number of social and technical barriers that prevent the full use of these
paleoclimate observations to inform modeling. PaleoCube proposes to lower these
barriers by bringing scientists of diverse perspectives to work in the Cloud.
The data and code will be shared through hackathons, webinars, and YouTube
tutorials designed to engage scientists involved in different aspects of climate
science on an even playing field while building capacity among the geoscientific
workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PaleoCube will use and extend upon existing
cyberinfrastructure (LinkedEarth, Pangeo, Jupyter), emerging data standards, and
the scientific Python ecosystem (including an extension to the pandas library to
accommodate more general time representations) to bring scientists to the data
and associated reproducible workflows stored in the cloud. The proposed
activities will make these tools accessible, facilitate interoperability with
the Scientific Python Stack, and build a large library of reproducible
scientific workflows that inexperienced users can emulate and modify to serve
their own purposes. By providing easy and free access to interactive computing
at scale, coupled with didactic examples and hackathons, PaleoCube will broaden
participation in the geosciences to under-represented groups, enrich the STEM
pipeline, and provide transferable data science skills to geoscience
practitioners and enthusiasts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
