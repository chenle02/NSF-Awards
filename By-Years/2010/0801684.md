Abstract&lt;br/&gt;ECCS-0801684&lt;br/&gt;B. W. Wessels, Northwestern
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: Photonic crystals
(PC) have been proposed for a number of optical devices for high bit rate fiber-
optic communication and information processing systems. These include tunable
optical switches and ultra-wide bandwidth modulators. Non-linear photonic
crystal waveguide structures are proposed for improving the bandwidth of these
devices. Ferroelectric oxides will be used due to their large optical non-
linearities and photo and thermal stability. With the recent development of low-
loss, epitaxial ferroelectric thin film waveguides and low V electro-optic
modulators, a number of high bandwidth devices suitable for optical signal
processing are possible. This work builds on our recent demonstration of thin
film ferroelectric BaTiO3 with electro-optic coefficients of 360-440 pm/V. Non-
linear photonic crystal waveguide devices will be fabricated for ultra-wideband
frequency operation (&gt;100 GHz). Devices will be fabricated from the non-
linear oxide waveguides including 1-D and 2-D photonic crystal eo modulators and
optical switches. Devices will be fabricated using vapor phase epitaxial
deposition, and both conventional photolithography and nanolithography. Factors
limiting bandwidth will be determined through modeling and testing. Their
transmission, operating parameters and bandwidth will be measured. Chip-scale
integration of several devices with a single platform will be pursued using thin
film ferroelectric technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: By using
non-linear photonic crystals with large optical non-linearities, significant
improvements in bandwidth, operating voltage, and size are expected compared to
conventional devices. The program will involve training of undergraduates, and
graduate students as well as mentoring K-12 students. Industrial outreach
through related STTR programs and industrial and government lab internships will
be pursued.
