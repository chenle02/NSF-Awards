This proof-of-concept project provides a test of the use of Internet2 as an
infrastructure for professional development. The goal is to develop and test
prototype resources for professional development that will be delivered through
the Internet2. The project supports inquiry-based science practice at the middle
school level using STC, FOSS and Insights curricular materials as its content
framework. The use of Internet2 enables high quality access to educational
resources, which may include large data sets, real-time video interactivity and
high definition video on demand. These capabilities are well-suited for
supporting inquiry-based classroom practices.
