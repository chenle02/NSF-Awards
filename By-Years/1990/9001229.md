The development of geographic information systems (GISs) as analytic tools has
been parallelled by attempts to create media that allow people with varied
skills and backgrounds to manipulate and interpret computer-based spatial data.
The construction of more effective general user interfaces has been inhibited,
however, by the fact that people structure and deal with geographic
relationships in different ways. Language influences the ways in which people
perceive spatial relationships, but little attention has been given by scholars
to determining how linguistic differences affect the ways in which people use
GISs. This doctoral dissertation research project will examine different ways in
which English-speaking and Spanish-speaking persons describe, structure, and
manage spatial relationships. An oral questionnaire dealing with common spatial
relationships will be administered to persons in Spain, Ecuador, and the United
States; persons in those nations also will experiment with different types of
GIS user interfaces to determine if different formats are more effective for
person speaking different languages. This project will provide a valuable test
of different GIS user interface formats in different linguistic settings,
thereby helping to identify the degree to which linguistic differences must be
accommodated in the development of "user-friendly" GISs. The study will enhance
understandings of the ways in which language helps structure individual
understandings of spatial relationships, and it will provide an excellent
opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to develop independent
research skills.
