The driving of stellar winds from the radiation pressure of hot stars was
suggested early in the century, and has since been found to provide a good
explanation of mass loss in a wide variety of astronomical objects, ranging from
very hot ("O-type") stars, to active galactic nuclei, to quasars. In past NSF
supported work the Principal Investigator (PI) has demonstrated fundamental
flaws in earlier concepts of radiatively driven winds. For example, it is now
clear that scattering of photons in dense winds inhibits the growth of self-
induced instabilities so that the winds only develop mild inhomogeneities.
However, such instabilities have been observed in both optical and ultraviolet
spectral lines and are thought to indicate the presence of colliding winds
moving at different speeds. The shocks generated by these collisions may be the
primary source of x-rays in objects with radiatively driven winds. With this
three-year award the PI and a postdoctoral fellow will develop numerical
simulations with more realistic atmospheric models and to extend earlier
analytical solutions to two and even three dimensions. This work will assess the
role of turbulent instabilities in the evolution of inhomogeneities through the
wind flow. It is expected that this work will ultimately have a wide application
to extragalactic objects in addition to O stars.
