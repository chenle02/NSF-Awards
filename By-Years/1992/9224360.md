The University of Alaska requests funding to purchase shipboard instrumentation
in support of NSF-funded research. The instruments will be used aboard the R/V
ALPHA HELIX, a 133 foot vessel, which is owned by NSF and operated by the
University. The PI requested funding to purchase a CTD system, a multiple corer,
Niskin bottles, and a wire angle indicator. The instrumentation was requested to
provide adequate support for NSF-funded scientific research.
