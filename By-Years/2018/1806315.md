This research will explore the behavior of small clouds of atoms cooled close to
absolute zero and interacting primarily via their magnetic spins. This research
will advance the fundamental understanding of the quantum dynamics of many-
particle systems, which is an area of fundamental physics important to condensed
matter physics, nuclear physics and astrophysics. In addition, this research
will inform important technological applications including precision sensors for
navigation and magnetometry, atomic clocks and emerging quantum technologies
including quantum information and communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
experiments use small clouds of rubidium-87 atoms that are cooled to
temperatures less than 100 nanoKelvin above absolute zero and confined with
laser beams in an evacuated chamber. At these low temperatures, the atoms form a
Bose-Einstein condensate, which is a unique quantum phase of matter. This
project focuses on the dynamics of the intrinsic spin of the atoms, which is a
fundamental component of quantum magnetism. The experiments feature precise
control of the quantum states of the atoms using external fields, a well-
characterized dynamics, a quantum phase transition, and low-noise tomographic
quantum state measurement capabilities. These tools will permit studies of
finite size effects of a quantum phase transition in the neighborhood of the
critical point, demonstration of new methods of creating and controlling highly
entangled states of the ensembles, and investigation of new non-Abelian
geometrical phases unique to spin-1 systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
