0926503&lt;br/&gt;Swart&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). Granted funds
will support acquisition of a new stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer (SIRMS
- Thermo MAT 253) to replace an existing Finnigan-MAT 251 (vintage 1985) in the
Department of Marine Geology and Geophysics at the Rosenstiel School of Marine
&amp; Atmospheric Sciences. The SIRMS will largely be dedicated to the analysis
of stable isotopes carbon and oxygen in carbonates but also will be used for
analysis of stable isotopes in natural waters and organics. The MAT 253, a large
radius magnet, high voltage source instrument, also offers the capability to
analyze isotopologues of carbon dioxide to investigate new proxies for
paleothermometry. The PIs intend to explore this capability in the future. The
new SIRMS will immediately support NSF funded research in paleoclimatology and
paleoceanography including studies of Miocence sea level history based on the
carbon isotopic composition of platform carbonates, high resolution studies of
late Pleistocene tropical climate variability recorded with high fidelity in the
varved sediments of the Cariaco Basin and studies of coral calcification rates
in response to varying sea water pCO2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
