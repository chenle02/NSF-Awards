This proposal is a Research Opportunities for Women Research Planning Grant
request to demonstrate the feasibility of measuring segregation coefficients and
crystal melt velocities as a function of composition in picosecond pulsed laser-
quenched metal alloys. Velocities of the solid-liquid front are measured
optically and composition changes determined by Rutherford Back Scattering. The
planning grant permits completion of the equipment and associated testing and
initial experimental testing.
