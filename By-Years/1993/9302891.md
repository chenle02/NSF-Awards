This research seeks to understand the relationship between perceived risks and
emergency events better through an exploratory effort focused on data collection
and analysis. The study explores how prior risk perceptions affect public
response to a specific hazard, and compiles a data set of public perceptions of
risk during and after a significant fire at the Champion Chemical facility in
Odessa, Texas. The two primary goals of this research are to examine the effect
that emergencies have on the perceptions of risk among nearby residents, and to
analyze the impact of perceived risks on emergency responses during an chemical
accident. The study takes advantage of research conducted in the Spring of 1992
on perceived and acceptable risk in Texas communities. The pre-event survey data
are used in a panel design by re-interviewing respondents in Odessa and one
other Texas community studied in the Spring of 1992. The collected data will be
analyzed to lay the foundation for a more ambitious proposal on the relationship
between experience, and perceived and acceptable risk on the one hand, and
perceptions of risk and emergency responses, on the other.
