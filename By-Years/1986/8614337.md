Backstops of accretionary wedges must play a critical role in the evolution of
wedge development, but no agreement exists as to their significance or
fundamental structure, whether backstops dip toward or away from the toe of the
wedge. No region is sufficiently well imaged to answer this fundamental question
satisfactorily. We propose a large source, multichannel study of the forearc and
backarc areas of the eastern Sunda arc, Indonesia, where we have found evidence
of backthrusting in the forearc and backarc thrusting in the backarc. Imaging
the backthrust (the Sawu thrust near Sumba Island) and backstop geometry will
have significant implications for: a) defining the tectonic incorporation of
forearc basin strata into the rear of the wedge during backthrusting; b)
identifying the earliest accretionary products of the wedge, and thus initiation
of subduction accretions; and c) determining relative timing relations between
backthrusting and back arc thrusting in a zone of arc-continent collision. The
latter will require a program of drilling, and the multichannel study will
provide a framework for such a program. These questions will also be addressed
in a small accretionary wedge developed along the zone of backarc thrusting,
where we can completely image the structure of the backstop and lower plate
beneath the wedge. In addition, we propose to carry out 8 days of digital
single-channel seismic profiling within the Banda Sea, using a 1,000 cubic inch
tuned source array. The objective will be regional seismic stratigraphy in
preparation for drilling in l988.
