In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Professor Allinger plans to extend the capabilities of his
renowned computer program to enable it to better predict the geometries and
properties of a wide variety of molecules. The PI will develop the MM3 program
so that it will be able to handle the common functional groups, delocaized
electronic systems, and heterocyclic compounds. A more sophisticated formulation
of the approach for calculating vibrational spectra will be developed as well,
and increased use will be made of ab initio electronic structure calculations
for the parametrization of the method.
