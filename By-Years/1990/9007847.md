This grant supports the travel for a University of South Carolina faculty
member, and provides for the travel and stipends for two of his graduate
students. They will attempt to measure the half-life and spectral shape of the
2v BB decay of 76Ge, and improve searches for weakly interacting massive
particles using ultra-low background Ge detectors.
