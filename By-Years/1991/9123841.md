Rodman intends to study a variety of interrelated problems in operator theory
and matrix analysis. These include interpolation problems for matrix and
operator valued functions, completions of matrices and operators, linear
preservers, several aspects of perturbation theory, and spectrum assignment
problems. Operator theory is that part of mathematics that studies the infinite
dimensional generalizations of matrices. In particular, when restricted to
finite dimensional subspaces, an operator has the usual linear properties, and
thus can be represented by a matrix. The central problem in operator theory is
to classify operators satisfying additional conditions given in terms of
associated operators (e.g. the adjoint) or in terms of the underlying space.
Operator theory underlies much of mathematics, and many of the applications of
mathematics to other sciences.
