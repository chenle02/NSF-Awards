This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program is to Dr.
Alan H. Cowley of the University of Texas at Austin for fundamental work on the
synthesis of novel compounds containing main group elements. The elements to be
studied include E = P, As, Sb, and Bi from group 15 and M = Al, Ga, and In from
group 13. The goal of the research is to prepare low coordination number
fragments of RE (i.e., phosphinidenes, arsinidenes, stibinidenes, and
bismuthinidenes) and RM (four electron carbenoid species) and incorporate those
fragments into novel rings, clusters, and polymers or use them as ligands. The
substituent R may be methyl, ethyl, or a wide variety of bulky hydrocarbons. The
fragments will be generated by thermal, photochemical or electrochemical
elimination of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, or disilane and its
heavier congeners. The project includes the synthesis of group 13 heterocycles,
the synthesis of group 13 and group 15 compounds as potential sources of ME
fragments, the construction of molecules of the type (RMERR)n, where n = 1-3,
with unusual geometries, and the stabilization of ME fragments by coordination
to transition metals. %%% Preparation of compounds containing aluminum, gallium,
or indium together with phosphorus, arsenic or antimony may result in materials
with interesting optical or electrical properties. One goal of this research is
to attach different types of groups which absorb light (chromophores) to
compounds containing the pairs of elements mentioned above. Introduction of such
groups could enable use of these or related compounds in the manufacture of
semiconductors by photo-assisted growth. Because diffusion might be reduced and
sharper junctions produced, this would be a desirable alternative to present
thermal methods.
