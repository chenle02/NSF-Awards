This project is to organize and execute the annual principal investigator (PI)
meeting for the National Robotics Initiative (NRI). The workshop will bring
together all the PIs engaged in the NRI for a two day workshop to discuss
research, educational initiatives, and methods for transition of results.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop includes oral presentations by involved
program managers, the PIs, a poster session with presentation of all sponsored
projects, tutorials, and several keynote speeches. An important aspect of the
workshop is program-wide networking and exploration of mechanisms to optimize
the results of the overall initiative with respect to research, training, and
societal impact.
