As computing moves into the PetaFlop era, and beyond to ExaFlop levels, issues
of equipment cost, power consumption, reliability, programmability, etc., are
becoming increasingly important. Over the past few years more and more systems
are depending upon accelerator hardware technologies (AT). The Asian Technology
Information Program (ATIP) plans to hold a workshop that will explore the ways
Asian scientists are incorporating AT technologies into their research. Speakers
will present on their level of success and the impediments they have
encountered, etc. Their progress will be compared with that in the US, and ATIP
will generate a short informative report summarizing the findings for
distribution throughout the global HPC community. ATs can be very cost
effective. The most popular ATs are based on technology used in the game
community, and hence are familiar to younger researchers, and even to some
students in high school. Therefore, they have the potential to help migrate
high-performance computing broadly, into smaller research settings, including
small universities and beyond. Absolute cost as well as cost performance is
crucial in researchers decisions about the practical directions of their
research. This is especially true in most parts of Asia, where essential
hardware must be purchased from abroad (US), and Asians have been quick to
consider ATs as a result. This workshop brings together top scientists and
graduate students from both the US and Asia hoping that they will form
connections that may lead to future research collaborations or cooperative
commercialization efforts for practical HPC applications.
