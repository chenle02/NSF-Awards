The Instrumentation Project is introducing Mossbauer spectroscopy into upper-
division modern physics and nuclear physics laboratories in the Department of
Physics and Astronomy. This type of experiment can be very useful in directly
exposing students to basic concepts in quantum mechanics. A series of
experiments is focusing on (1) observation of quantum uncertainty; (2)
observation of changes in the nuclear charge distribution through measurement of
the isomer shift; (3) observation of nuclear Zeeman splitting and measurement of
the internal hyperfine field strength from the level splitting; and (4)
observation of quantum uncertainty through detection of virtual states produced
by RF/gamma-ray multiphoton absorption. Entrance and exit examinations are being
conducted in the laboratories to assess the educational outcomes. Also,
Mossbauer experiments are being used in cooperation with the Departments of
Chemistry and Geology to expose students to the use of this spectroscopic
technique in characterizing the chemical composition of materials.
