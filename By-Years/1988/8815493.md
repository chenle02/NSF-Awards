This award will support collaborative research in metallurgy between Dr. Didier
de Fontaine, University of California at Berkeley and Dr. H. Dreysse,
Laboratoire de Physique du Solide, University of Haute Alsace, Mulhouse, France.
This project concerns the theoretical study of phase quilibrium in metal,
semiconductor or superconducting alloys, including studies of surfaces and
interfaces. Electronic band structure calculations have progressed to the point
where quantitative prediction can be made concerning the stability of various
competing phases in metals, alloys and simple compounds. Statistical
thermodynamical methods have also been developed so that, by combining both
quantum and statistical techniques, certain classes of alloy phase diagrams can
now be derived almost from first principles. The purpose of the proposed
collaborative research is to combine the expertise of both the Mulhouse and
Berkeley groups to perform such combined quantum/statistical calculations by
means of methods which have been developed by the two groups independently. The
Berkeley group has gained considerable expertise in the theoretical study of
alloy phase diagrams by the Cluster Variation method; the Mulhouse group has
specialized in the electronic structure of solids. The results of this research
will contribute to the understanding of predictive thermodynamics of materials.
