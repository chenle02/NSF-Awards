I/O performance is often an issue for high-end computing (HEC) codes, due to
their increasingly data-intensive nature and the ever-growing CPU-I/O
performance gap. Portable parallel I/O benchmarks can help (1) application
developers to improve their codes' performance, (2) HEC storage systems
architects to improve their designs, and (3) future and current owners of HEC
platforms to reduce hardware cost and improve application performance through
better system provisioning and configuration.

To keep up with the growing scale and complexity of HEC applications, this
project develops automated generation of parallel I/O benchmarks, analogous to
the SPEC and NAS benchmarks for computation. Our approach will be embedded in
BenchMaker, a prototype tool that takes a real-world, large-scale parallel
application and automatically distills it into a compact, human-intelligible,
I/O-intensive, and parameterized benchmark. Such a benchmark accurately reflects
the original application's I/O characteristics and I/O performance, yet with
shorter execution time, reduced need for libraries, better portability, and easy
scalability.

Benchmarks and tools that benefit the computational science community at large
will be produced by this research. These benchmark prototypes will be used for
parallel computing course projects and student research contests.
