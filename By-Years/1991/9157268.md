Two complementary studies will be undertaken in evolutionary physiology. The
ultimate goal is to elucidate the bases for differences in organismal
performance that may exist among individuals and species, and to understand how
and how rapidly capacities for physiological performance may be modified through
artificial or natural selection (organic evolution). First, artificial selection
experiments with mice will test what proximate physiological and biochemical
factors are limiting to the evolution of increased capacities for locomotor
performance. At present, cross species comparative data cannot be properly
analyzed with standard statistical tests, because species are descended from
common ancestors in a hierarchical fashion, and so are neither biologically not
statistically independent. A second research thrust will involve using computer
simulation techniques to develop and compare alternative statistical methods to
correct for phylogenetic non-independence and so provide valid significance
tests and parameter estimates for comparative (interspecific) data.
