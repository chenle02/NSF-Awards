This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in geophysics
involves Peter L. Olson of Johns Hopkins University and Jean-Claude Nataf of the
Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris, France. They propose to conduct a series of
fluid dynamics experiments using liquid galium. The objective is to understand
the dynamics of the Earth's core, including the operation of the geodynamo, and
to eventually build an experimental model of the geodynamo. They will
investigate thermochemical convection in liquid gallium subjected to the
combined influences of rotation and magnetic fields and study the
crystallization of gallium alloys in the presence of convection, rotation and
magnetic fields. The project takes advantage of similar experiments conducted by
the French group and provides access to excellent facilities in France.
