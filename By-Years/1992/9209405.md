Prior research has examined applications that used shared memory in single site
systems and their extension to operate in a distributed environment. The
approach was to modify the underlying operating system to support a new facility
for memory management called distributed shared memory (DSM). This research will
relax assumptions which characterized the system as having a "tight" degree of
sharing among a small number of reliable, well-behaved, communicating sites.
This assumption may not be appropriate for a large scale, typical, distributed
computing environment. Reasonably common failure modes in some workstation
environments include site failures and network partitions. Prior work does not
specifically address the issue of communication breakages nor site failures.
This project addresses a manageable subset of these issues. Three issues are of
concern for creating a reliable DSM system. The first issue is to determine how
sensible it is for DSM to accommodate reliability extensions and for which
applications this support is appropriate. The second issue is to design and
implement changes to support reliability. It is only through the design,
implementation, and use of this facility that one can gain exposure to
analyzable failure modes. The third research issue involves a study of the
performance of the reliability mechanism using a "fault induction" testing
strategy.
