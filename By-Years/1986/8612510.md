A project for strengthening engineering education in the state of Washington is
undertaken which involves the coordinated efforts of industry and four
universities--Washington State University, University of Washington, Gonzaga
University, and the University of Idaho. Faculty curriculum coordinators from
the universities are responsible for developing Industry Instruction Modules
which are taught by industry faculty and incorporated into the classroom
instruction at the participating universities. Three instructional modules have
been identified in the areas of automated manufacturing, high-frequency
electronic circuit design, and electronic measurement. The Industry Instruction
Modules are produced on location at the industry sites. They are broadcast from
regional centers with electronic studio classrooms located near the industry.
Live two-way video and audio interaction between the campus class and the
industry instructor are provided during the broadcast.
