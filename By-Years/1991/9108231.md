As an approach to the common synthetic problems of selectivity, yield
optimization, ease of product isolation, and efficiency with regard to use of
expensive reagents, it is planned to explore the application of functionalized
polymer systems to complex problems in organic synthesis. The principle of
covalent substrate anchoring to control chemoselectivity has already been
successfully demonstrated in the context of intermolecular Pauson-Khand
cycloaddition. This work will first be expanded to intramolecular systems to
establish its scope and range. It will then be extended to several diverse
synthetic processes. Polymer linkage of nitroalkanes will be studied to control
tandem cycloaddition/electrophilic cyclizations of nitrile oxides with alpha,
omega-dienes, permitting stereocontrolled synthesis of differentially
substituted cyclic ethers. Next, polymer methodology will be applied to
asymmetric synthesis by covalent attachment of chiral auxiliaries to enhance
chemical yields, improve optical yields, and simplify recovery of the chiral
auxiliaries. Pauson-Khand systems will be tested as routes to optically pure
polyquinanes, using polymer-bound chiral alcohols. Polymer-bound chiral
oxazolines will be used as auxiliaries in stereoselective aza-Claisen
rearrangements to generate optically active 4-pentenoic acids. Finally, a range
of polymer-bound systems of C2-symmetry will be developed as means to approach
the synthesis of a variety of differentially functionalized nonracemic synthetic
systems. The Organic Synthesis Program is supporting this joint project between
Dr. Neil Schore and Dr. Mark Kurth to develop new synthetic reagents that are
based upon polymers. The former's background in organometallic and polymer
chemistry is being melded with the latter's background in the synthesis of
complex organic molecules. These new synthetic reagents will simplify techniques
and lead to more economic and convenient syntheses.
