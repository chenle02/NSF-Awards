&lt;br/&gt;0529104&lt;br/&gt;LUO&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
systematically explore a thinning and trimming approach to the production of
silicon nanowires (SiNW) from silicon microwires using a combination of
theoretical, numerical and experimental investigations. The thinning and
trimming approach will be used to generate SiNWs of diameters down to 20nm.
Subsequently, two types of new suspended-SiNW-based sensors of ultra-high
sensitivity will be developed to detect nontoxic and toxic targets of interest,
respectively. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One-dimensional nanostructures have
attracted great attention recently because of their potential applications as
excellent components in micro/nanodevices. SiNWs in particular have received
much attention since silicon is the most widely used material in integrated-
circuit and microfabrication processes and has unique mechanical and electrical
properties. However, due to the shortcomings of the existing fabrication
approaches, new methods are needed to produce SiNWs that cannot only be
massively fabricated but also batch integrated to functional devices. The
proposed thinning and trimming approach is believed to be such a method, and
would permit precise control of the structure, size and positions of SiNWs.
Furthermore, this method may be used to break through the limitation of
lithography in the sense that silicon features fabricated by any lithographic
methods can be further miniaturized using the approach. Compared with microbeam-
based sensors, the two types of sensors are expected to be several orders higher
in sensitivity. The project will contribute to nanotechnology education through
new teaching modules and presentations for undergraduate and graduate students,
and the animation of nanotechnology concepts on a website for K-12 students and
teachers. &lt;br/&gt;
