9555665 Sanders The Teacher Education Equity Project is a collaboration of 61
teacher educators at 38 colleges and universities in 26 states working together
to remedy the lack of attention to gender equity in the preparation of future
mathematics, science and technology teachers. Each of seven major teacher
preparation universities will form a team consisting of the education dean or
department chair and professors, and field placement school principals and
teachers. The teams will look at the need for gender equity instruction in their
programs and develop action plans to improve their programs. Professors who are
knowledgeable about mathematics, science and/or technology education as well as
gender equity will act as mentors to the teams. Teams will attend a seminar
about institutional change to extend their knowledge and enable them to have
gender equity impact on entire schools, departments of education, and field
placement schools with which they work. An electronic list will permit project
participants to exchange innovative ideas and teaching practices. Six national
professional associations will collaborate with the mentors by providing them
with opportunities and venues to work with additional teacher education programs
toward the end of the project and in the future. Over 7,000 student teachers
will learn about equity in mathematics, science, and technology teaching in new
courses developed by university teams. Advisors from universities that have
changed their teacher training courses will help others modify and improve the
way they teach the teachers. The benefit will include an improved classroom
climate for all children and an increase in the number of girls in science and
upper level math courses. ***
