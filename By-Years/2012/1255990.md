The project entitled - Self-Assessment Study of the Use of Evidence-based
Instructional Practices in Engineering - will conduct a self-study to determine
what fraction of courses and instructors use evidence-based instructional
practices, how frequently such practices are used and how the practices are
distributed across the undergraduate engineering courses at Pennsylvania State
University. The research consists of two phases: 1) a focus on the use of
evidence-based practices in courses taught by the faculty in the student's home
department, and 2) a focus on large enrollment courses such as Computer Science,
Mathematics, and Physics. The research design incorporates a mixture of
quantitative and qualitative methods.

The study will lay the foundation for future efforts to implement evidence-based
practices more widely within undergraduate engineering programs. The project
proposes to begin a cooperation between the College of Engineering and the
College of Science to impact large enrollment courses offered in both Colleges.
The project will engage administrative leaders to understand their awareness of
evidence-based practices, how they are supporting the use of such practices, and
what they see as barriers to wider use of such practices.
