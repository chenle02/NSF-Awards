The long range goals of this research are to define at the molecular level the
expression of the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) genome. Specific focus has been
on the regulation of expression of three representative early transcription
units including the major 2.7 kb and 1.2 kb RNAs and the 2.2kb family of
transcripts. In this application, the PI proposes to continue studies on the
cis- acting sequences and trans-acting factors (both viral and cellular)
necessary for the control of these three early genes. For these studies, site-
directed mutagenesis and in vivo transient expression assays will be coupled
with DNA-protein binding and in vitro transcription assays. To elucidate the
means by which specific HCMV immediate early gene products (particularly those
expressed by the IE1 and IE2 regions) activate transcription of early genes. The
proteins will be overexpressed, purify them to homogeneity, and analyze their
biochemical interaction with the early promoter elements as well as with the
basic RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. The proposed studies are
important not only to advance the knowledge of the regulation of the viral life
cycle, but also to help elucidate the general mechanisms that operate to control
eukaryotic gene expression.
