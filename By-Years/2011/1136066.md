This proposal asks for 5 additional years of support for the SWAB program. The
SWAB program has been going on for nearly 30 years as the mechanism for keeping
tritium (3H) and radiocarbon (14C) contamination of ships and associated vans
and laboratories to a minimum. The SWAB program proposes to continue operations
in order to minimize contamination on ships involved in measuring natural
abundances of 14C and 3H as part of global ocean programs such as CLIVAR and
IOCCP. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt; The principal impact of
the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support
for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support
of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo
separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition,
maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded
researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers.
