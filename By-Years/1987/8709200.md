The fields of surface modeling and solid modeling, which are likely to form the
basis for future computer-aided design (CAD) systems, have been developing
independently. Today users of systems based on one or the other technique find
they require the functionality of both types of systems simultaneously. The goal
of this research is to provide a technique for modeling free-form surfaces in a
manner which facilitates their incorporation in solid modeling systems. The
surfaces used in this technique will be described by algebraic functions defined
within a parallelepiped. By using control points contained in the
parallelepiped, the algebraic function can be expressed with B-splines,
automatically allowing for continuity throughout the surface. These algebraic
surfaces can be implemented easily in solid modelers since the implicit surface
equation defines specific half- spaces. A useful free-form primitive will be
obtained by clipping them against the parallelepiped and then rendering as
solids. Ray tracing methods will be efficiently applied to these surfaces, since
the ray intersection equation is a univariate polynomial whose degree is the
degree of the surface.
