9410628 Forbes During the past decade, the NSF and the aeronomy community have
conducted a science program called CEDAR (Coupling, Energetics and Dynamics of
Atmospheric Regions). Under this program, new thrusts in theoretical modeling
and new and upgraded experimental capabilities using optical and radar
techniques continue to be developed. To coordinate the effort among individual
researchers in the community and to provide scientific advice to the NSF, a
science steering committee exists with membership selected by the NSF program
officers. This proposal requests funds to continue the activities of this
committee with Jeffrey Forbes, the principal investigator, as Chair. ***
