The Electro Mechanical program prepares students for real world experiences and
addresses future labor shortages in several fields. Graduates are employed as
maintenance or operations technicians in regional manufacturing companies. The
college's Technology Department enhances and strengthens the Electro Mechanical
program by means of several activities. New courses are added and some revised
to provide real world experiences with industrial machines. Several courses are
improved by incorporating hands-on teaching equipment into these courses.
Examples of equipment are a portable pneumatics trouble shooting trainer and a
portable PLC. Scholarships are provided to underrepresented students, women and
students with disabilities. In addition, the project is recruiting students from
middle schools and high schools throughout the region. The Electro Mechanical
degree and certificate programs serve students and company employees throughout
the Southeastern Tennessee region of the Tennessee Valley Authority.
