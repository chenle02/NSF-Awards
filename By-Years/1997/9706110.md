9706110 Williams This project involves a workshop which will bring together a
collaborative group of U.S., Colombian and Ecuadorian scientists whose interests
involve the regional tectonics, and volcanic processes and hazards in the
northern Andes. The focus of the Workshop will be for all involved to learn what
research has been done, what resources are available, what are the local
logistical concerns and to plan a strategy for future research. ***
