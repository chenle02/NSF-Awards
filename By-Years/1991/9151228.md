This project will establish a Macintosh microcomputer laboratory with software
for two social science academic departments (the Department of Psychology and
Sociology and the Department of History, Political Science, and Geography) at
Southern Arkansas University (Magnolia). This laboratory will greatly increase
access of students to hands-on techniques of quantitative, scientific analysis
in these social science disciplines. Ten microcomputers plus a network computer
system server and other appropriate hardware and software, including a
statistical package and data sets, will enable students preparing for careers in
secondary education and underrepresented groups to become active participants in
the latest methodologies of their disciplines. With this laboratory, existing
courses in these departments will move from largely secondary study of social
science quantitative methods to extended hands-on activity in designing and
analyzing research problems, using large, real-life data sets and current,
state-of-the-art hardware and software in computer-assisted statistical
analysis.
