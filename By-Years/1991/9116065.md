Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL) is establishing a connection to
NSFNET via a privately-owned telephone line through the Colorado SUPERNET and
WESTNET mid-level networks. The connection enables collaboration between
researchers at RMBL and colleagues at their home institutions and elsewhere
throughout the Internet. This award funds four 9600 baud modems capable of
speeds up to 38,400 bits per second.
