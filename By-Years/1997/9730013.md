9730013 Flower This grant provides partial support of the costs of relocating
and upgrading a functioning electron microprobe (EMP) from Northwestern
University (NWU) to the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). A JEOL 733 that
was originally purchased in 1985 for ca. $415,000 with matching funds from NSF
in the amount of $250,000 will be housed in a new centralized research
instrumentation facility at UIC where trained and experienced microscopy
technicians and complementary microscopy facilities (i.e. TEM, SEM) already
exist. A large number of PI's will make use of this probe for research spanning
the fields of petrology, geochemistry, mineralogy and material science including
analyses of melt inclusions in oceanic basalts, thermobarometric studies of
mantle xenoliths based on high-resolution EMP data, phyllosilicate mineralogy,
high-temperature crystallography and analyses of impurities in ceramics and
semiconductors. ***
