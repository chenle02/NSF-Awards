This fellowship supports research and training in the area of microbial
genetics. The mechanism by which a bacterium survives exposure to the toxic
metal mercury is being studied using the Tn21 mercury resistance operon from a
plasmid of the bacterium Shigella flexeri. The study will determine how a
regulatory protein, MerR, binds to DNA and induces expression of a structural
gene, merTPCAD, in response to mercury exposure. It will be determined how MerR
distinguishes between mercury and other heavy metals also encountered in the
environment. Mutants whose MerR recognize cadmium and zinc will be generated and
characterized.
