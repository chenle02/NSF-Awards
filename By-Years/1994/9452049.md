9452049 Cassidy A thermal analysis system is providing students operational
experience with this technique in several courses, thereby enhancing the
contents of the courses and introducing state-of-the-art technology. These
courses include Polymer Chemistry and Engineering, a new course in 1992, one not
commonly available in undergraduate curricula, Physical Chemistry, and a new
course in 1994 for SWT, a senior-level, integrated laboratory sequence. The
first and third of these are somewhat unusual and a creative step to give
undergraduates an opportunity for extensive laboratory work with modern
equipment. Two modules are being used: Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA) and
Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC). Students are instructed on these
instruments and then actually operate each of them instead of merely hearing
lectures on them or observing their applications at regional laboratories. An
additional challenge grant has been committed by a local industry to support the
proposed special thermal analysis laboratory.
