VOXEL is focused on investigating the feasibility of building hollow, 3-D,
programmable-volume, nano-scale, artificial, non-biological volume-cells or
voxels. The aim is to make a shell to encapsulate nano-scale quantities of
various materials. The target size is of the order of 30 to 100 nanometers in
diameter, much bigger than a supra-molecule made by organic chemistry, but much
smaller than MEMS structures; small enough in fact to allow traversal through
the pores of biological membranes. This has never been done
before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work is a one-year
EXPLORATORY project and will focus, following an origami-inspired strategy, on
making the basic planar shaped platelets of the right size and shape that in
later work will be raised from the plane to join to make the desired volume.
Pentagonal platelets, the basis of a dodecahedral shell, will be made in this
one year plan, from assemblies of 5 and 10 n meter gold spheres using a Scanning
Probe&lt;br/&gt;Microscope and then fused by plating. Successful results will
give a good basis for focused collaborations with colleagues from a wide variety
of scientific disciplines most certainly including medicine, in order to explore
the biological implications including specifically the extension to the use of
bio-compatible materials.&lt;br/&gt;
