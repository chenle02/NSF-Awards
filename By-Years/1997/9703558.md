Kominiak, Tara Clark University The doctoral dissertation research will examine
how the decentralization of economic control is restructuring gender relations
in post-Soviet Russia. The privatization of state property has shifted decision-
making authority from the national to the local level. An investigation of the
connections among forms of restructuring and their implications for workers in
the female dominated textile industry will be studied. The research will
emphasize the importance of the decentralization of control in shaping
development outcomes and social relations. A collective case study approach will
be used to examine specific examples of privatization and restructuring in the
textile industry. Four firms will be selected for intensive analysis. The
research will provide new insights on the little studied area of liberalization
and gender relations under the process of economic restructuring.
