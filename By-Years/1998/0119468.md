0119468&lt;br/&gt;Simon&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed research is to
develop a method of optically imaging proteins. This research will adapt newly
developed methods for peptide/protein ligation for labeling various proteins and
imaging them via improved fluorescence or other molecular imaging probes. The
ability to study proteins in situ has come from the introduction of the green
Fluorescent protein (GFP). The goal of this research is to generate reporters
that share the power of GFP, but without its limitations. The specific goals of
this research are to generate reporters that: (1) can be genetically engineered
into proteins, (2) are significantly smaller than GFP, (3) have a narrower
emission spectra than GFP, (4) emit further in the red range or have a larger
Stokes shift than GFP, (5) are more photostable than GFP, (6) can be used to
simultaneously label and distinguish different proteins in living cells, and (7)
can be used to track proteins or cells as they move throughout an animal's body.
