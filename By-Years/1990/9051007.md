Introductory Zoology is taken by many non-science majors and is the only
laboratory course they will probably ever experience. This course is being
upgraded to include experimental laboratories in which data are gathered and
analyzed, so that students can better understand and appreciate the scientific
method. Modern data analyzing systems that are easily operated can help motivate
students, including minorities, to follow an interest in science. The enrichment
of the laboratory experience by the addition of the new equipment allows the
curriculum to be upgraded to include experiments in evolution, biometry,
biomechanics (form and functional complexes in locomotion and feeding), and
ecological relationships among organisms. The new laboratory exercises will be
incorporated into the laboratory manual. The university will contribute an
amount equal to the award.
