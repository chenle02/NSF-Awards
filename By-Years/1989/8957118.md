The main goal of this research award is the design and construction of proteins
that exhibit new and technologically interesting properties. This is to include
the building of specific metal-binding sites into protein surfaces, using both
site-directed mutagenesis and chemical modifications. Such proteins can provide
a simple and inexpensive means of purifying recombinant proteins that is also
highly selective. Other more complex alterations can be used to build specific
metal-binding agents for toxic waste treatment or metal detection. Another
project involves the identification of criteria for designing enzymes that will
be stable in nonaqueous solvents. This will be based on detailed nuclear
magnetic resonance structural studies of a natural protein that is stable in a
variety of polar organic solvents.
