This project will support the efforts of a team of undergraduate students from
various STEM disciplines at the University of Virginia. The team will design and
assemble a prototypical biological device for the International Genetically
Engineered Machines (iGEM) competition in synthetic biology. The development and
production of this device will provide undergraduate students with hands-on
training in a variety of scientific areas, including synthetic biology,
molecular biology and computational modeling. Broadening participation in STEM
research is an important goal of this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This

Engineered Machines (iGEM) competition in synthetic biology. The participants
will receive training in a variety of STEM disciplines, acquire a global
perspective on innovation and strategic road mapping, and have many
opportunities to network with leaders in STEM fields such as synthetic biology,
molecular biology and computational modeling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
