This project supports the continuation of the Significant Opportunities in
Atmospheric Research and Science (SOARS) program over the next three years.
SOARS is a well-established and evaluated undergraduate-to-graduate bridge
program designed to broaden participation in the atmospheric and related
sciences. The program is a student-centered, social learning model that includes
research, mentoring, community, and multi-year ongoing support for historically
marginalized students in STEM, called Protégés. SOARS has proven to be effective
in supporting talented diverse students to enter and succeed in graduate school,
post-secondary pathways, and beyond. There remains a strong need for the SOARS
program, as the percentage of underrepresented communities in the atmospheric
and related sciences remain far below those of the majority population. The work
proposed for the next three years includes continually maintaining a large cadre
of mentors who support the SOARS mission, enjoy institutional support from the
National Center for Atmospheric Research, the University Corporation for
Atmospheric Research, the University Community Programs, and partnering
laboratories; and continue to engage a strong alumni network. The program will
be preparing Protégés for leadership as the next generation of leaders in the
Earth System Sciences, through comprehensive mentoring and guidance. SOARS will
support 15 students over 11 weeks during the summer months. Over this time,
professional development will take place to include technical writing,
communication, computer software classroom instruction, conducting research, and
oral presentation of research results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
