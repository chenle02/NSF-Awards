This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project proposes to develop a
system to forecast ionospheric currents and related effects, such as
enhancements in the auroral oval heating, density irregularities and ground
induced currents at customer specific locations . These forecasts will depend
directly on real-time measurements of the solar wind velocity, density and
interplanetary magnetic field. A novel, new method, the state-space approach,
has been developed for classifying and predicting active geomagnetic intervals
and substorm occurrences. Application of this method to space weather
forecasting will provide, for the first time, 1 to 2 hour forecasts of impending
geomagnetic storm and substorm activity which can be used to improve ground-
based operations such as power distribution, pipeline management, and six-sigma
manufacturing, and positively impact the functionality and reliability of
communications, navigation and space operations. Complementing space weather
forecasting systems currently being developed for the NOAA Space Environment
Service Center (SESC) and the Air Force Space Forecast Center (AFSFC), the
proposed product will provide customer specific forecasts for both commercial
and government space and ground based applications. At the end of Phase III of
this proposed system Mission Research Corporation projects an operating value-
added space weather service, complementing the capabilities of the AFSFC and the
SESC, for commercial and government customers.
