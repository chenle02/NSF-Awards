9530464 The objectives of this research program are to investigate and clarify
fundamental questions in relation to the geostatic stress condition in
undisturbed ground, as well as in clays and granular soils subjected to
sampling, in situ testing, earthquake shaking, or construction operations,
including ground modification. Effective horizontal pressure has a significant
effect on resistance to settlement and liquefaction of granular soils. as well
as on ground response to in situ tests before and after ground modification. The
specific questions formulated for investigation include the permanent effect of
pre-shearing on the horizontal pressure in the laterally constrained level
ground condition, and settlement of clean granular soils subjected to cyclic
pre-shearing. The research method relies on exacting experimental techniques and
long-term laboratory and field observations, as well as mathematical modeling
and numerical analysis. High quality undisturbed samples of natural clays, as
well as reconstituted specimens of natural sand deposits, are used in the
laboratory investigations. ***
