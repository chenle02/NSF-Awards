This is a pilot study to determine whether a reliable chronology can be
developed via alkenone dating and magnetic paleointensity for sediment cores
from the Peru margin. If so, then follow on studies will investigate the
denitrification zone of the Peru margin, its possible links with productivity
and El Nino/ La Nina cycles, and the extent to which suboxic conditions in the
water column, leadng to denitification, are correlated with rapid climate change
events on decadal to orbital time scales for the last 60 k years. The study will
utilize scores drilled on ODP Leg 112, and eventually will be a multiproxy study
of several cores in a variety of water depths. Most of the cores contain only a
small carbonate fraction and some of the cores are laminated. For cores
containing forms, high resolution chronologies will be established with foram 14
C and S 18 O and for those without forams a combination of geomagnetic
paleointensity, alkenone 14C, and optical methods will be used. In this pilot
study, two cores, one with limited foram abundances and one with no forams, will
be studied to establish chronologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
