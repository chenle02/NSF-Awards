This award supports a project to utilize fission track analysis to address the
uplift and denudation history of the Transantarctic Mountains in the Horlick and
Thiel Mountains, and The Ellsworth Mountains in West Antarctica. Sampling
strategy in each region will vary according to relief, rock type, proximity to
tectonic features, and lateral extent of outcrop. Samples will be returned to
the Fission Track Laboratory at Arizona State University and processed for
counting using the external detector method, as well as track length
measurements.
