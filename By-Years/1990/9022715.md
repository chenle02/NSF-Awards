This project is an effort to collect temperature, salinity, and oxygen content
measurements from the Swedish icebreaker ODEN as part of the International
Arctic Ocean Expedition-91, a three- ship oceanographic investigation of the
eastern Arctic Ocean. The cruise track will cross the Nansen, Makarov and
Amundsen Basins, and represents one of the infrequent opportunities to obtain
basin-scale deep ocean sections in the Arctic. Hydrographic data to World Ocean
Circulation Experiment (WOCE) standards is basic to an understanding of the
circulation of the Arctic Ocean, as well as providing the physical framework for
the complementary oceanographic projects that will be carried out on the three
ships.
