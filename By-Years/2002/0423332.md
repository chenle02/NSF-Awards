Recent media coverage has highlighted egregious cases in which young innocent
suspects were wrongly convicted because they falsely confessed during coercive
interrogation procedures. This investigation will provide the first, nationwide
documentation of approximately 1,400 law enforcement officers' interrogation
practices, beliefs about the reliability of these techniques, and knowledge of
child development. Police of various ranks from three large law enforcement
agencies across three metropolitan U.S. cities and three geographical locations,
as well as from three small law enforcement agencies, will complete surveys on
interrogation practices and general knowledge of development. Participants will
receive one of three versions of an interrogation survey and one of two
developmental surveys. The interrogation survey consists of 49 questions about
actual interrogation practices, beliefs, and false confessions. The
developmental survey consists of 20 questions about developmental differences
between youth and adults. Factor analysis and ANOVA will be used to explore
relationships between version of developmental surveys and factors. These
analyses will determine whether police acknowledge developmental differences
between youth and adults and perceive children, youth, and adults differently
during interrogation. This research is the first collaborative effort to obtain
a standardized documentation of police practices, beliefs, and needs for
training regarding the handling of youth during the interrogation process.
