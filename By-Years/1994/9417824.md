Professor Lutful Bhuiyan, University of Puerto Rico Piedras, is supported by a
grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his
theoretical research on the influence of collective interactions between
colloidal particles on colloidal stability. Modified Poisson-Boltzmann (MPB)
theory will be used to investigate the importance of collective effects of all
the charged species of a colloidal solution on the interaction between two
colloidal particles. Four specific goals of the research are: 1) to adapt the
MPB equation to the situation where one or more of the species is the colloidal
particle so all interactions are treated on an equal footing; 2) to study the
interaction between colloidal particles on concentration, size, and charge of
both the colloidal particle and the simple ions; 3) determine the effect of
steric interaction with solvent molecules on colloid-colloid interactions; and
4) to consider further development of the MPB approach. A fundamental
understanding of the nature of interparticle forces in highly interacting
colloidal dispersions does not as yet exist. It is still not well understood
what keeps charged colloidal particles dispersed in water from coagulating.
Because of their unusual physical properties colloidal materials have found
widespread industrial use, and may in the future have important device
applications. In order to design materials with desired properties, it is
necessary to understand the detailed atomic level description of the strong
interactions between these charged particles in solution. Bhuiyan's research is
directed at a basic theory to explain these properties.
