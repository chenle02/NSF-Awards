9633105 Fisher The overall goal of this study is to quantify the productivity
and biomass of the tubeworms, associated free- living bacteria, and associated
fauna, and to identify and quantify trophic pathways within and out of the
tubeworm communities in a singel hydrothermal vent system. The experimental
design will allow modeling of these parameters with temporal variability of
venting, and the data will be suitable for inclusion in larger scale modeling
efforts of vent field scale productivity. The study site is a portion of the
Endeavour segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge, where many other programs are
underway and planned in conjunction with the seafloor observatory component of
the US RIDGE program. Valuable input from other studies and the results from
this project can be interpreted in the larger context of understanding the
variability of the geochemistry, biology and geology of ridge systems. ***
