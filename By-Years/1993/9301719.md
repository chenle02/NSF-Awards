9301719 O'Day This U.S.-Chile award will support Dr. Peter O'Day, of the
University of Oregon, Eugene, in a research collaboration with Dr. Juan
Bacigalupo, of the University of Chile. The researchers will investigate the
gating of light-activated channels in Drosophila photoreceptors and test the
concept that there is more than one biochemical pathway involved in
transduction. The mechanism by which light is transduced to an electrical signal
is still unclear. The overall goal of the research is to enhance our
understanding of visual transduction in Drosophila photoreceptors and the
activation and modulation of transduction pathways. Because of its similarities
to other biological systems, and because it can be genetically manipulated as
well as electro- physiologically studied, the use of Drosophila as a model
system will provide important clues to similar issues in cellular signalling in
general. ***
