This award will support an NSF/CMBS regional conference to be held at Clemson
University in the summer of 2013 on uncertainty principals in harmonic analysis.
The principal speaker will be Professor Alexei Poltoratski from Texas A&M
University. The lectures will cover such areas as gap and type problems,
Beurling-Malliavin theory for Teoplitz kernels, and Bernstein's Problem on
weighted polynomial approximation. In addition to the 10 main lectures by Dr.
Poltoratski, lectures will be presented by other experts in the field.

Hallmarks of the NSF/CBMS regional conference series are focus on a single
important and timely area of research by a leading practitioner, a published
monograph for a wider audience, and continued effect and local stimulation
through regional recruitment emphasis. The conference will provide a venue for
advanced graduate students and recent Ph.D. recipients to interact with leading
researchers in this field. This award will support approximately 30 participants
in the conference, mostly at early stages of their careers.
