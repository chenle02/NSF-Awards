Karsten Grove's research will be directed towards the important questions of
finding the relationships between the geometry and topology of Riemannian
manifolds. The main emphasis will be devoted to problems relating geometry
and/or transformation groups to homotopy theory. The general areas to be
considered are finiteness problems for manifolds with bounds on curvature,
diameter and volume; the structure of manifolds with non-negative curvature;
Riemannian foliations and isoparametric submanifolds; Morse theory for maps. In
the context of finiteness theorems he is seeking a result which would show that
for manifolds with curvature bounded below, diameter bounded above and volume
bounded below, there are only finitely many possible homotopy types. The focus
of attention in the case of manifolds of non-negative curvature will be the
conjecture that such manifolds are rationally elliptic. Finally he will
investigate relations between the homotopy and cohomogeneity of a manifold and
the geometry of orbit foliations of space forms.
