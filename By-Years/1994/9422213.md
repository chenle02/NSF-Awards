The PIs wish to study wave propagation and dissipation in solar coronal loops,
and their consequences for coronal heating. In particular, they will focus on
the consistency of coronal wave heating models with the observed high degree of
localization and intermittency of coronal x-ray emission. Specific goals are:
(1) investigating the magnetohydrodynamic wave transmission from the photosphere
to the corona in a realistic magnetic field geometry, (2) analyzing the
eigenmode spectrum of the coronal loop beyond the magnetohydrodynamic
approximation, taking into account the presence of the equilibrium current, and
(3) considering the anomalous wave dissipation that leads to localization and
intermittency consistent with the observations.***
