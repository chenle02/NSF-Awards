This award supports the travel of three language scholars, Dr. Seikman, Dr.
Thorne, and Dr. John and graduate student Ms. Sikorski, to participate in the
3rd International Conference on Language Education and Diversity in New Zealand.
The group will be participating in the conference and presenting their research
on language immersion programs among the Yup?ik of southwestern Alaska. Dr. John
and Ms. Sikorski are Alaska Natives and language scholars of Yup?ik and
Gwich?in. The research presented will inform the linguistics community about
indigenous models of language acquisition and the award supports the science
careers of two scholars from underrepresented groups and early career faculty
through participation in this global conference on language education and
diversity.
