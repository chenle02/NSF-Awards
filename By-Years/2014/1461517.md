This project will enhance understanding of atmospheric physics, chemistry, and
dynamics on tropical cyclone activity. It will advance scientific confidence in
projections of the influence of climate change on tropical cyclones. Linkages
across chemistry, radiation, dynamics, and meteorology provide an ideal
framework for the type of cross-disciplinary education needed for the next
generation of climate scientists.

Understanding of the factors that influence tropical cyclones has broadened in
recent years to include consideration of the tropical tropopause layer (TTL),
which can affect storm outflow temperatures and thereby potential and actual
intensities. Observations from multiple sources show that the atmosphere in the
vicinity of the TTL exhibits substantial variability on interannual and decadal
timescales, which could affect variability and trends in tropical cyclones.
However, the physical and chemical processes affecting these changes are not
well understood, and reanalysis products and coupled general circulation models
often do not agree on the magnitude of this variability. The effects of changes
in volcanic aerosol, water vapor, and ozone in a hierarchy of radiative and
chemical/dynamical modeling approaches will be examined, and implications of
radiative processes for tropical cyclones will be identified.
