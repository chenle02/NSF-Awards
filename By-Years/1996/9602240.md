9602240 Wraight This award provides additional support for a multidisciplinary
training research training program focused on the study of photosynthesis in
contexts ranging from agronomy to biophysics. Trainees at the undergraduate,
graduate and postdoctoral level participate in collaborative research projects
involving, in addition, at least two of nine participating faculty members.
Training provides a sound foundation in the application of a variety of genetic,
biophysical and biochemical techniques to the investigation of phenomena that
extend in scale from the molecular to the ecological. In addition to these
efforts, the program provides an intensive summer workshop in "Photosynthesis
and Global Climate Change" for regional high school and community college
teachers.
