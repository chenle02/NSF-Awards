This award will support collaboration in quantum field theory between a physics
research group at the University of Pittsburgh led by Daniel Boyanovsky, and a
group at the Pontificia Universidade Catolica in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, led by
Carlos Aragao de Carvalho. Based on a conjecture that a recently fixed point
theory describes the critical properties of thin film layers of superfluid HeII
in a substrate potential, the project aims to study with pertur- bative and non-
perturbative techniques both the renormalizable and the superrenormalizable
regime in statistical mechanics theories in which both order and disorder
operators are present. The research is designed to lead to an understanding of
the renormalization aspects of theories in higher dimensions in which
topological excitations play a leading role in describing the dynamics. The
project involves topics in quantum field theory that are of common interest to
both the U.S. group and the Brazilian group, and in which the collaborators in
both groups have experience. The joint project will enable the two groups to
combine their expertise and expedite the research results.
