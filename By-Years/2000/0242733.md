This three-year pilot project will develop and field-test three 2nd-3rd-grade
modules incorporating science and literacy. Each module will consist of a
cluster of inquiry-centered science investigations and a set of nine readers.
These research-based resources for literacy development will emphasize science
content related to the investigations. The staff of the Lawrence Hall of Science
and faculty from the Graduate School of Education at the University of
California-Berkeley will work with literacy experts from the School of Education
at the University of Michigan to develop the readers. The science materials will
be based upon successful GEMS (Great Explorations in Math and Science) units,
revised to enhance their alignment with the National Science Education
Standards.

Teachers involved in the field test will receive professional development in the
use of the resources. They will also have access to an assessment system,
developed as part of this project, that will provide formative feedback on
students' progress in both literacy and science. The research component of this
project will examine teachers' responses to these materials, to their
effectiveness in a variety of classroom settings and to merging science with
literacy instruction.
