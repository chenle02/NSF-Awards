A significant cost component in many civil construction projects is geotechnical
exploration. The research here focuses on development of a geotechnical
exploration system that would have capabilities not found in any currently
available system. The system under consideration is a combination of two known
technologies, electric cone penetration testing (ECPT), and ground penetrating
radar (GPR). ECPT, which involves forcing an instrumented cone into the ground,
is an economical technique for determination of in situ properties of soft
geologic materials, but is only applicable to the depth of the first hard layer.
GPR imaging techniques have been used to "look" into the ground, but existing
devices must operate from the surface or be lowered down expensive boreholes.
The new device would consist of a cone penetrometer with a radar antenna mounted
on the push rod, directly above it, thus creating means of investigating
subsurface rock and existing subsurface structures at a much lower cost and with
better precision than is possible with existing techniques.
