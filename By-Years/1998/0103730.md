NSF Award Abstract - DMS-0103730 Mathematical Sciences: Hyperbolic Conservation
Laws in Continuum Physics

Abstract

0103730 Dafermos

The research program lies on the interface between continuum physics and the
theory of hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. It involves the following two
projects: (a) the study of the geometric structure of weak solutions to
hyperbolic conservation laws that are merely bounded and measurable but not
necessarily of bounded variation; (b) the study of the interaction between
nonlinear hyperbolicity and damping induced by viscous or electromagnetic
effects.

Hyperbolic conservation laws are nonlinear systems of partial differential
equations that govern the dynamic behavior of materials with nonlinear elastic
response, such as air, rubber etc. Nonlinearity induces the development of
discontinuities propagating as shock waves. The research project will
investigate to what extent the destabilizing action of shocks may be checked by
damping mechanisms induced by viscous or electromagnetic effects.
