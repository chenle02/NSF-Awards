9419418 Sievering This project is part of the Southern Hemisphere Marine Aerosol
Characterization Experiment (ACE-1), which will be conducted in the remote
Southern Pacific in 1995 using aircraft, ship-board, and ground-based
measurements of a wide variety of chemical species, physical and meteorological
parameters with the central goal of investigating the formation, evolution, and
optical properties of atmospheric aerosol. In this component, the role of non-
sea-salt sulfate production from the oxidation of sulfur dioxide by ozone in
sea-salt aerosol water will be investigated. Aerosol particle samples will be
obtained with a high-volume cascade impactor at Cape Grim, Australia and aboard
the research vessel Discoverer during the ACE-1 intensives, as well as during
ship transit from Seattle, WA, to Tasmania. Ion chromatography analysis for
anions and cations from aerosols collected in the different stages of the
impactor, along with complementary data on the water associated with size
fractions of the sea-salt particle mode, sulfur dioxide, ozone, and other
ambient air concentrations as well as meteorological parameters will provide the
necessary data for a comparison of observed and model predicted non-sea-salt
sulfate in several sea-salt mode size fractions. These data, along with their
interpretation, will also provide an estimate of the contribution that this
mechanism of sulfur dioxide oxidation makes to sulfur dioxide loss rates as well
as the total sulfur budget in the marine boundary layer.
