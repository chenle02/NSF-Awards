This equipment grant is provided to purchase an optical multichannel analyzer
and an Excimer Laser. The optical multichannel analyzer will be used for
spectroscopic diagnostics of the laser chemical vapor deposition (LCVD) reaction
to determine temperature and chemistry at the interaction point. The Excimer
Laser will be used to develop a laser induced fluorescent method to determine
reaction product and reactant concentration distribution and flow at the
interaction region. This will provide insight into the rate of mass transport in
this process.
