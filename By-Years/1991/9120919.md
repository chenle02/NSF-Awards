People are able to perceive objects and boundaries successfully, despite the
fact that the visual input on which that perception is based is fragmentary
across both space and time. For instance, despite the fact that objects are
occluded a great deal by other objects and that patterns projected on the retina
change continually whenever objects or observers move, people can ordinarily
detect complete boundaries and shapes. There are other cases in which people
perceive boundaries in the absence of local visual information, known as
illusory contours and transparency phenomena. This project will address the
various cases of boundary interpolation; it will test and refine a proposed
unifying theory and extend that theory from static, two-dimensional displays to
the three-dimensional case and to cases in which boundaries are obtained from
information conveyed by motion. The project will also investigate convergent
methods to assess boundary perception, including both perceptual report and
objective performance measures. This research, in addition to its implications
for understanding human perception of objects, will aid in the construction of
object and boundary detection methods in computer vision systems.
