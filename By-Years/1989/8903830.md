This award provides one-half of the funds necessary to acquire a direct-current
plasma spectrometer (DCP) that will be housed and operated in the Department of
Geological Sciences at the State University of New York (SUNY) in Binghamton.
SUNY is committed to providing the other half of the required funding. The
primary use of the instrument will be for the chemical analysis of a variety of
samples needed by the research projects in the departments of Geological
Sciences, Chemistry, Physics and Biological Sciences.
