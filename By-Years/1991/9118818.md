The storage and relaxation processes of photoexcited charge carriers and
persistent photoconductivity (PPC) in II-VI semiconductor alloys is to be
investigated. Detailed studies will be made of PPC related critical phenomena,
including phase transitions, conductivity noise, and charge carrier decay
behavior under different conditions. It will explore the origin of PPC in II-VI
semiconductors and provide quantitative characterization of PPC effects. Studies
of transport properties, including Coulomb gap, hopping conduction, and
structure of electron networks in the PPC mode are proposed. Potential
applications of PPC in II-VI semiconductor alloys are discussed.
