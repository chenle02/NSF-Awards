In this project supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program, Derek J. Hodgson of the University of Wyoming will
investigate the synthesis of binuclear coordination compounds of manganese in
moderately high oxidation states. The structures, oxidation-reduction properties
and the electrochemical behavior of these complexes will be examined. The
compounds may be useful as electrocatalytic oxidants. They are also of interest
bcause they are related to the manganese compounds of Photosystem II, which is
involved in photosynthesis. The complexes to be investigated are mu-dioxo dimers
of manganese(III/III), manganese(III,IV) and manganese(IV,IV) with auxiliary
tetradentate ligands containing four nitrogen donor atoms. These non-porphyrinic
ligands will be modified with various substituents and other structural changes
so as to cause the redox behavior of the complexes to vary in a predictable
manner.
