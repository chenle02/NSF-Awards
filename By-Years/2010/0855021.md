Among of the most exciting events of recent years has been the mounting evidence
that the very early universe underwent a period of accelerated expansion known
as primordial inflation. During primordial inflation there is a vast enhancement
of quantum effects, which are ordinarily very small. These quantum effects can
become so strong that conventional techniques for computing them break down. The
main goal of this project is to develop new techniques for reliably computing
these quantum effects, so that people can know precisely what they are. Another
goal is to search for observable consequences of these enhanced quantum effects
that may be masquerading as modifications of the gravitational force.

Such a study is interesting because many aspects of the current universe can
only be understood, without using quantum effects, by supposing that
cosmological evolution is driven by enormous quantities (about 96% of the total)
of exotic mass and energy that has not been detected in Earth-bound
laboratories. It is possible that some of the inexplicable features of cosmology
are the result of quantum effects that became strong during primordial
inflation. The broader impacts of this project lie in the promotion of teaching,
training and learning.
