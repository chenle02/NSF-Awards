This research is directed at the investigation of formal mechanisms to focus the
reasoning and handle contradictions in formal common sense reasoning framework.
An important contribution of the research is the framework it will provide for
truly real time common sense reasoning. The proposed research is the directed at
enhancing the step logic formalism to provide a formal model to real time common
sense reasoning. Step logic is a formalism designed to model the ongoing process
of deduction. What makes the step logic formalism so unique is that the logic
explicitly allows unsound inferences (i.e. contradictions can arise). This is
done in the interest of efficiency (that is, to avoid the consistency check
problem). The objectives of the research are to investigate ways of focusing
one's reasoning, to develop a means of focusing the reasoning of the step logic
formalism, to investigate methods of handling contradictions efficiently, and to
develop a more general method of handling contradictions within the steplogic
formalism. The attainment of these objectives will result in a non monotonic
reasoning formalism that is not only tractable, but real time. The research
issues will be addressed both in terms of theory as well as implementation.
