The proposed research targets fundamental work in sensor networks. Specifically
the work addresses the central problem that distributed inference systems need
to be robust to a wide variety of sensing, and channel impairments. The effort
seeks to design a suite of robust, distributed detection and estimation
algorithms for sensor networks and Net-Centric applications. A comprehensive
approach to robust distributed inference for a wide range of communication
channels and topologies, with minimal assumptions about the sensing noise, is
proposed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcomes of the proposed work have the
potential to greatly impact many Net-Centric applications including
environmental, military and health care that require aggregation of data from
sensors which are linked only through wireless means. The work is supported by
the Industry Advisory Board as well as individual industry members of the center
and has the potential to extend the center?s portfolio while potentially
attracting new members. The PI has collaborative TUES Phase 3 software project
with HBCU colleges that will be tapped on for recruitment of minority students
for training in the Ph.D. program associated with this I/UCRC FRP.&lt;br/&gt;
