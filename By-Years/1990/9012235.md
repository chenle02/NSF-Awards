The causes of variations in the axial morphology of mid- ocean ridges is poorly
understood and has been related to a number of factors such as spreading rate
and distance from ridge-transform intersections. From bathymetric profiles from
the North Atlantic, the Principal Investigator has extracted the following
parameters: latitude, spreading rate, distance from ridge-transform
intersection, zero-age depth, rift-valley relief, rift-valley width, and
smoothed variations of the latter three variables. He has done linear
correlation and multiple regression analyses of these data and reached several
conclusions based on the correlations among parameters. This project will extend
this work to analyze in a similar manner a world-wide bathymetric and gravity
data set with the goal of determining which are the most important factors
controlling the overall morphology of mid-ocean ridges.
