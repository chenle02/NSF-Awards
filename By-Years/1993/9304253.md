PI and associate will search for fossil echinoderms in targeted Upper Cambrian
strata. Late Cambrian time is critical in echinoderm evolution because it marked
the transition between the archaic Cambrian fauna and the newly appearing
"Paleozoic" fauna. Results from this work with be used to reconstruct phylogeny
and evolutionary history of the echinoderms, determine their paleoecologic
settings, and test for possible environmental controls on their history.
