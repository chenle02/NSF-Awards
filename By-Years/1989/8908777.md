Multiple coefficient recoding techniques for implementing the hardware to
multiply a single number of many multiplicands in parallel are investigated.
Optimal techniques for recording and appropriate VLSI architectural realizations
are considered. Automated layout tools that produce multiple-recoded arrays in
VLSI are developed. The applicability of multiple coefficient recoding to
several important signal processing operations, including FIR and IIR filtering,
DFTs and matrix computations are also studied.
