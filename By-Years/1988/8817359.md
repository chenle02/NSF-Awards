This project is in response to the Program Announcement, WOCETechnology
Development Activities. There are two tasks that willbe done in this project.
First there will be an examination ofthe feasibility of preparing accurate,
stable mixing standardsfor at sea nutrient analyses. This would eliminate the
need forindividual preparation of standards during the WOCE fieldprogram. Second
the individual protocols will be analyzed toinclude more rigorous
standardization and quality controlprocedures.
