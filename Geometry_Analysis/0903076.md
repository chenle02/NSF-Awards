This proposal deals with curved spaces of higher dimension. An interesting
question is how to measure the curvature of a nonsmooth space. In the case of
sectional curvature, this was initiated in the 1930's by Alexandrov, who gave a
good notion of what it means for a singular space to have nonnegative sectional
curvature. Recent work by the proposer, joint with Cedric Villani, together with
related work by Karl-Theodor Sturm, has given a good notion of what it means for
a singular space to have nonnegative Ricci curvature. The proposed research will
explore properties of spaces with nonnegative Ricci curvature or, more
generally, with Ricci curvature bounded below. In a different direction, the
Ricci curvature gives a way to smooth out the geometry of a space, by means of
the Ricci flow. This flow was introduced by Richard Hamilton in the 1980's, who
used it to characterize the topology of three-dimensional smooth spaces with
nonnegative Ricci curvature. Recently, Perelman has proved the biggest
conjectures in three-dimensional topology, namely the Poincare Conjecture and
Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture, using Ricci flow. Despite Perelman's great
achievements, there are many open questions concerning the Ricci flow in
dimension three and in higher dimensions. The proposed research will address
some of these questions. Another way that singular spaces arise is when a
higher-dimensional space is foliated into lower dimensional spaces. The
parametrizing space for such a foliation is almost always topologically
singular. Part of the proposed research is to do analysis on such spaces, or
more precisely to prove a transverse index theorem.

There are various notions of curvature, which coincide in the traditional
setting of two-dimensional surfaces in three-dimensional space. For a higher
dimensional smooth space, not necessarily living in a flat space, these
different notions are called the sectional curvature, the Ricci curvature and
the scalar curvature. Each one is an averaging of the previous one, i.e. the
Ricci curvature is an averaging of sectional curvature and the scalar curvature
is an averaging of Ricci curvature. The Ricci curvature enters in physics
through Einstein's equations of general relativity. Part of the work described
above concerns ``optimal transport''. This is the study of the optimal way to
transport mass in a curved space. It was initiated by Monge in the 1780's and
has had a revival in recent decades, with application to partial differential
equations and applied mathematics. We have shown that it also has application in
differential geometry. Conversely, concepts from differential geometry have
application to optimal transport.
