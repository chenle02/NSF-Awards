The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is an energetically-based device to eliminate
pathogens safely.  The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has shown the importance of
sanitizing and protecting against viral pathogens known and unknown. The
proposed approach of using energy for disruption of viral particles has high
potential for sanitization.  This electromagnetic approach can penetrate walls,
thereby offering a method to sanitize hard-to-access building systems, such as
HVAC air ducts and air flow systems.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I
project proposes that an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) device can be used as an
antiviral and antibacterial mechanism.   This project proposes to develop the
world's first software-defined electromagnetic pulse into a wireless, “safe for
humans” anti-bacterial and anti-viral device.  This project will explore the use
of varying electromagnetic fields to compromise the viral capsid and inactivate
the virus.  The project will identify the frequencies effective for pathogen
inactivation and then will develop a device to deliver those
frequencies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
