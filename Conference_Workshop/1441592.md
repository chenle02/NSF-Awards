"Topological Methods in Group Theory" is a conference to be held at Ohio State
University, during the week of June 16th-20th, 2014. Group theory is an area of
mathematics that was developed in the early 1800's. It provides the appropriate
language for studying the collection of symmetries of an object, and is central
to much of modern day mathematics. The central player in this theory is an
algebraic structure called a group. In the early 1980's, the Russian geometer
Misha Gromov realized that one could apply geometric techniques to study these
algebraic structures. This remarkable insight led to the development of a new
field - geometric group theory. This field is extremely active, with a lot of
mathematicians both in the US and abroad. The conference is intended to bring
together experts in the field to discuss the latest developments in the area.

The conference will feature a large number of plenary talks, both from well-
established leaders in the field, as well as from promising young researchers.
Some of the topics that will be featured include:(i) groups of finite asymptotic
dimension, (ii) amenability of groups,(iii) special cube complexes and
applications, (iv)finiteness properties of groups, (v) Thompson's group and
analogues, (vi) Coxeter and Artin groups, (vii) L^2-cohomology techniques,
(viii) Cannon-Thurston style maps and applications. In addition to the plenary
talks, we plan on having shorter (20mn) talks run in parallel sessions, giving
younger mathematicians and graduate students the opportunity to broadly
disseminate their results. For more information, please check
