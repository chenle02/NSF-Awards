With this renewal proposal the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
continues its support for the work of Professor Robert A. Flowers of the
Department of Chemistry at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, PA. The research will
extend the PI's research on the mechanism of reaction of samarium-based
reagents. A systematic study of the influence of solvents, ligands, and
additives on the reactivity of these important synthetic reagents will yield
valuable fundamental data on their chemistry. Since there are nearly 100
papers/yr on the use of SmI2 in synthesis, the proposed investigations will
provide synthetic chemists with much valuable information and allow extensions
into new applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These studies are expected to lead
to broad understanding of the mechanism of lanthanide catalysis in organic
chemistry. In this connection, the PI will develop a graduate course on the
applications of lanthanides in organic synthesis utilizing results from this
research and from the recent literature. This work will provide important
professional preparation for students in an significant and emerging field that
bridges organic and inorganic chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
