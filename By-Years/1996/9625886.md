Abstract Hennage A request has been made for funding to help offset the costs of
travel and registration fees for invited speakers, faculty and student
presenters in order to attend the 1996 Laser Applications to Chemical and
Environmental Analysis Topical (LACEA) Meeting, to be held March 20-22, 1996 in
Orlando, Florida. This meeting is sponsored by the Optical Society of America
and will provide a forum which will include topics in new applications of laser
devices to chemical analysis of the atmosphere and environment, for diagnostics
of flames, plasmas, and material processing, and to chemical analysis of gas,
liquid, solid, and biological samples. LACEA provides a forum not generally
available at most regular scientific meetings because of its focus on optical
diagnostics measurement techniques.
