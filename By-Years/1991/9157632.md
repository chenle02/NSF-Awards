Efficient serial and parallel algorithms, backed by a mathematical programming
theory, are developed. Emphasis is placed on effective distribution of
constraints among processors as well as line-search stabilization techniques
nonlinear complementarity and other problems. Finite termination of algorithms
via weak sharp minima and related concepts will investigated.
