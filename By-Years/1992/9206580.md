The long term objective of this project is to define the role of D-raf mediated
signal transduction in the establishment and elaboration of pattern in
Drosophila melanogaster. The specific aims of this project are as follows: 1) to
test the model that activation of D-raf as a serine/threonine kinase depends
upon induction of the "terminal" signal transduction pathway, 2) to characterize
the pattern of D-raf protein distribution in development, and 3) to identify
genes encoding other members of D-raf mediated signal transduction pathways.
Since D-raf is the Drosophila homologue of the Raf-1 proto-oncogene, the
characterization of its developmental role and the determination of its
mechanisms(s) of regulation will provide clues toward understanding signal
transduction in higher organisms. Experiments have been designed in this
proposal to address the following questions. Does the D-raf protein display a
serine/threonine kinase activity as predicted by its homology with Raf-1? Is
there a relationship between the phosphorylation state of D-raf and its ability
to act as a serine/threonine kinase? Where in the cell, and at what
developmental stages is the D-raf protein present? What other types of gene
products act in D-raf mediated signal transduction pathways? These questions
will be answered using cell biological, genetic and molecular means.
