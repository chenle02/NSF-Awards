The focus of this research is to investigate a formulation that yields
simultaneously the essence of softening and localization phenomena. The three-
dimensional model will be based on viscoplasticity in which the yield function
contains a strain gradient in addition to the usual internal variables. The non-
local formulation circumvents many of the arguments against the existence of
strain softening. An investigation will be made of a numerical scheme to obtain
solutions to structural problems with localized softening features. The accuracy
of the model and the usefulness of the approach for predicting softening will be
demonstrated by making comparisons between theoretical and experimental data on
concrete specimens and on reinforced concrete beams subjected to combined
transverse and axial loading.
