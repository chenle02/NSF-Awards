The project will undertake an integrated geodynamic/seismic stratigraphy
analysis of the subsidence history of the extended margins off northwest
Australia. The objective is to test hypotheses that have been put forth to
explain regionally distributed subsidence on passive margins that is commonly
observed to exceed that which would be predicted by extension estimates derived
from mapping of syn-rift normal faults.
