This grant supports a program of research in nuclear astrophysics, intermediate
energy electro-nuclear physics, and the nuclear theory applied to these areas,
at the Kellogg Radiation Laboratory at California Institute of Technology. The
research is carried out primarily by a group of six faculty, a senior research
fellow, four postdoctoral associates, and ten graduate students, and four
undergraduate students. The nuclear astrophysics research utilizes the in-house
accelerator system to study nuclear reactions related to synthesis of the
elements and burning processes in stars. The intermediate energy physics
experiments are instrumented at California Institute of Technology and carried
out at facilities such as the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, the MIT Bates
Laboratory, and HERA in Hamburg, Germany. Both undergraduate and graduate
students are active participants in all aspects of the research activity.
