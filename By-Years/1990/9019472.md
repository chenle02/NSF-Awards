This study addresses the fate of fluvial sediment derived from the Ganges-
Brahmaputra River, the single largest fluvial sourceof sediment in the world.
High-resolution seismic profiles,combined with sediment cores from which both
Pb210 and C14 geochronologies will be determined, will delineate the
distribution and rates of sediment accumulation on the continental shelf seaward
of the river mouth. Textural and mineralogical studies will evaluate transport
pathways as well as sediment sources.
