The "Golden-Gopher", a mid-infrared, 2-dimensional imaging instrument was
completed in 1989. The focal plane uses a 20X64 element As:Si array manufactured
by Aerojet Electronic Systems Division with a plate scale of 0.83 arcsec/pixel.
The Golden- Gopher currently achieves SNR = 1 at a flux density of 3 mJy/pixel
in 30 minutes of on-source integration at 8.5 micrometer with a 1 micrometer
bandwidth. The optical design includes a spectroscopic option at R=100 by
rotating a plane mirror which has a grating back-to-back. Problems with the
rotation bearing mechanism have prevented observations in the spectroscopic
mode. In the coming year the Golden-Gopher will be modified to enable routine
spectroscopic observations, e.g. long slit spectra of the silicate feature of
galactic nuclei and the 8.7 and 11.3 micrometer "PAH" bands as well as the ıAr
III!, ıS IV) and ıNe II! lines. Imaging spectroscopic observations are to be
made of a wide range of galaxies, including systems from the IRAS bright galaxy
sample. These data will give information on the morphology of the nuclear region
and the physical extent of the emitting dust and ionized gas. Such measurements
will allow new limits to be placed on the proportion of flux due to unresolved
active nuclei as opposed to regions of star formation.
