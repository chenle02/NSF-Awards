The transport of energetic particles in the Earth's atmosphere and inner
magnetosphere is investigated theoretically and some resulting auroral
spectroscopic emissions are observed experimentally. Specifically, a generalized
transport equation is adapted for application to electron transport, without and
with an acceleration term, to proton/hydrogen atom beam, and to hot atoms
produced by auroral collisional interactions. Global spectral images are
analyzed to yield geophysical parameters for TIEGCM (thermosphere ionosphere
electrodynamic general circulation model) investigations and the resulting
global history is used in a detailed 1-D auroral model. Suites of auroral
spectral emissions features are used to investigate particle fluxes: species,
flux magnitude and characteristic energy, as well as changes in atmospheric
composition.
