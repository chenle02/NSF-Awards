Grassi Professor Grassi will study elliptic threefolds and Calabi-Yau
threefolds. In particular she will study fibrations in Calabi-Yau threefolds
with a view to showing their existence independent of the minimal model chosen.
She also intends to further study the recently discovered phenomenon of mirror
symmetry. This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, yet it directly
connects to two of the great advances in theoretical physics in this century--
quantum mechanics and general relativity. Algebraic geometry itself is one of
the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary
flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated figures that
could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials.
Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis
and topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields as well as
in physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics. ***
