9622426 Johnson The research involves developing accurate models of traffic
processes in queueing models for designing and operating communications and
manufacturing systems. The usual assumptions for making the models analytically
tractable such as Poissonian flow is generally not adequate to capture the
complex nature of real traffic processes in these applications. A methodology is
needed for identifying traffic-process descriptors for gaining accurate
performance measures from the queueing models. Once adequate descriptors are
defined, appropriate queueing models must be developed. One such promising
descriptor is traffic burstiness and research effort is required to quantify it.
Then, appropriate queueing models must be developed to reflect the quantified
burstiness descriptor. Finding more realistic queueing representations of
traffic process in communications and manufacturing would add immeasurable to
the design and operation of these crucial systems. This research, in combining
process descriptor development with queueing model development, is a sound
approach which should produce useful results toward this end and add to the
theory of queueing models in these areas.
