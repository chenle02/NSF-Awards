The principal investigators will explore terrestrial-to-marine sediment
transport using a framework in which rivers and river plumes act as a
dynamically coupled system. Laboratory experiments will separately target the
hydro- and morphodynamics of the coupled system. Numerical modeling will be used
to investigate sediment transport as well as topographic and stratigraphic
evolution at the river mouth. Finally, model results will be scaled to the field
level to explore implications for the Mississippi and Elwha river and plume
systems.
