9450322 The proposed research would identify differentially expressed genes in
the periderm of the sweet potato storage roots, isolate its regulatory sequences
and characterize the promoter element. The proposed research would contribute to
our knowledge of tissue-specific gene expression and control in plants.
Isolation of promoters which express genes differentially in the periderm would
be of immediate practical use in genetic engineering of sweet potato for disease
and pest resistance.
