The primary focus of the research is in the area of prediction of boundary value
problems based on non-linear elasto-plastic finite element analyses. The goal is
to develop a deep understanding of the failure mechanisms and possible
preventive measures through a research program which involves various facets of
geotechnical engineering. The research plan includes: 1. Experimental program to
characterize the material: 2. Constitutive modeling (elasto- plastic) including
undrained analyses; 3. Optimization based procedures to obtain the model
parameters; 4. Finite element analyses with localization analyses.
