The 1992 Theoretical Advanced Study Institute (TASI-92) will be held during
June 1992 at the University of Colorado. This Study Institute will provide a
series of lectures and seminars, aimed at advanced graduate students, on current
topics in theoretical elementary particle physics and related experimental
subjects. These topics will include the string theory of the basic forces,
quantum field theory, the "standard model" of elementary particle physics, black
holes, and astrophysical structure formation. These topics are very important
and timely, and TASI-92 will provide its students an invaluable opportunity to
learn about advanced subjects and recent developments from experts.
