This project introduces computer assisted testing of materials into the Civil
and Mechanical Engineering curricula at this institution. The laboratory that
supports this project includes a Tinius Olsen Universal Testing Machine with an
integrated microcomputer. This equipment not only permits students to carry on
many experiments in a given lab period, but, because of the automated data
acquisition and display capabilities of the equipment, students gain a greater
intuitive feel for the behavior of materials. This award is being matched by an
equal sum from the grantee.
