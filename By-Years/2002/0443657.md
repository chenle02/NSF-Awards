With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities -
Multiuser Instrument Acquisition (CRIF-MU) Program, the Department of Chemistry
at the University of Utah will purchase an integrated imaging X-ray
Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Scanning Auger Microprobe (SAM) system with
ISS (Ion Scattering Spectroscopy). This equipment will be used in a number of
research projects, including studies on a) organic-based magnetic materials; b)
environmentally responsive nanopores; c) crystallographic-templating of shape
memory alloy (SMA) thin film structures; d) patterning and functionalization of
silicon surfaces; e) interfacial chemistry of colloids and colloid-derived
structures; and f) room temperature ionic liquids. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) is used for chemical analysis. It
irradiates a sample with a beam of monochromatic X-rays and the energies of the
resulting photoelectrons are measured and related to specific elements. XPS
often plays a crucial role in defining the system under study. The work to be
carried out by these investigators represents a highly coherent attack on a
range of issues at the forefront of nanotechnology and environmental chemistry.
In addition, the interactions with local industry, other schools and area school
children will result in a strong impact well beyond the University of Utah main
campus.&lt;br/&gt;
