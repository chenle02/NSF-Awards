This project funded in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program
involves theoretical studies of chemically reactive collisions. Attention will
be focused on elucidation of current fundamental experiments in which an
electron is detached from ClHCl- to form neutral ClHCl. This species is not
stable, quickly dissociating to Cl+HCl. However it is metastable, with a short
but significant lifetime due to the existence of resonance states. This then
provides an important prototype system for study of the influence of resonances
on the mechanisms of chemical reactions. The project will utilize a reduced
dimensionality theory of reactive scattering to characterize the resonances at
and near the transition state geometry determined by ab initio electronic
structure calculations. The vibrational wave functions will be used to carry out
a three-dimensional Franck-Condon analysis for comparison to experimental
results.
