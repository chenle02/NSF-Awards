There are many applications where the interest is in learning about unknowns
from observed data. The goals range from predicting future data to learning
about scientific or societal truths. Bayesian signal processing allows for
explicit incorporation of all available information about an addressed task. It
amounts to optimally combining common-sense knowledge and observational
evidence. Due to its strength and appeal, Bayesian modeling and analysis has
been embraced by all of science and engineering. However, the main current
problems are those with large numbers of unknowns (complex systems) and/or large
amounts of data (big data). This raises the concern that Bayesian inference may
become computationally incapable of handling them because of the sheer size and
complexity of the studied systems. The goal of this project is to advance the
theory and practice of a class of Bayesian methods, adaptive importance sampling
(AIS), for dealing with problems where the numbers of unknowns and/or data are
large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on building a novel framework
for AIS that will extend its use for Bayesian inference to problems with large
amounts of unknowns and/or data. The research involves investigating in greatest
detail the intricacies of AIS on several areas including (a) novel schemes for
AIS with emphasis on new strategies for adaptive learning and for stable weight
computation, and on advanced approaches for dealing with high dimensional models
and big data, (b) model selection and machine learning, (c) global optimization,
and (d) application to a case-study where understanding the progression of
cancer from cancer stem cells is of interest.
