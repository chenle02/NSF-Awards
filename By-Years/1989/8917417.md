This award provides one-half the funds required to purchase a multiple
collector thermal ionization source mass spectrometer that will be installed and
operated in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at Rice University. The
University is committed to providing the remaining funds required for the
acquisition of this equipment. The instrument will be used for radiogenic and
stable isotope analyses of lead, strontium, neodymium and boron isotopes and for
high-precision uranium-lead system geochronology involving minerals such as
zircon, monazite and sphene. The analytical results will be applied to the
interpretation of the tectonic evolution of the western U.S. cordillera
province. The boron isotope studies will be applied to the study of volcanic arc
processes, in particular to investigate characteristic boron enrichment in arc
magmas and its implications for sediment recycling in subduction zones.
