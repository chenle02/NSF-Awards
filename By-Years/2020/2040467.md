The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) project is to provide ransomware countermeasures. Commercially
available antivirus solutions are not adequate for key critical infrastructures
and do not cope with new techniques developed by cybercriminals to evade
detection. The proposed project enables private and public organizations to
increase protection of sensitive data, reduce data ransom costs, and decrease
disruption to operational capabilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I
project proposes to explore the feasibility of a new method for continuous pre-
attack observation and characterization of the environment and the network.
Algorithms validate incoming interactions from the network and evaluate their
threat risk by observing and characterizing the built-in commands in the
software code. Simultaneously, they validate outgoing interactions assessing the
risk for malicious data exfiltration. Tasks include developing a sandbox
environment for the deployment and testing of the technology prior to developing
needed functionalities. The system will be extensively tested with the most
recent attack vectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
