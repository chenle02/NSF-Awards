The PI's research has focused on climate variability in Africa, especially
drought in the Sahel. She plans to enhance her background by gaining a further
understanding of ecology and of biophysical and hydrological processes, to
incorporate these new skills in the general circulation model experiments to
include explicit treatment of land surface processes, to explore the feedback
that may involve dust generation during drought episodes and its impact on the
atmosphere and to develop a model of atmospheric heating that explicitly
considers dust layers, and to link these concepts to the specific systems that
generate rainfall over West Africa, the easterly waves. The latter will require
a study of how the surface energy and water balance affect the mid-level African
easterly jet. The P.I. proposes this research with the goal of proving or
disproving the theory of land surface feedback in the Sahel droughts.
