This research program addresses the prevalent issues of failure computation
with particular emphasis on material nonlinearities. The main focus will be on
moving discontinuities either as localized shear bands or as macroscopic
fractures. Three primary areas are: Development of "Moving Grid Techniques" to
trace the formation of discontinuities that emerge from material failure,
Formulation and incorporation of on-line "Interactive Graphics", Computational
simulation of mesomechanical failure (progressive damage of internal material
structure), macroscopic fracture (cracking of a full-scale prototype). Reliable
failure predictions are among the most pressing issues related to accurate
safety prediction of new and existing structures. In fact, questions such as
maximum collapse load and the underlying failure mechanism require robust
algorithm to predict. This research project will develop the necessary algorithm
to resolve the failure mechanism(s) and at the same time follow the collapse of
the structure.
