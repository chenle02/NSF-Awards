A grant has been awarded to Indiana University and Purdue University
Indianapolis (IUPUI) to acquire a liquid chromatograph-tandem quadrupole mass
spectrometer (LC-MS/MS) system to support the research of 12 primary users with
interests in bioorganic, bioanalytical, biological, and analytical chemistry.
The diverse research projects of these investigators from the Department of
Chemistry &amp; Chemical Biology (CCB) and other collaborating departments
include the unraveling of biochemical pathways in fungi, plants, and moths,
functional proteomics and bioanalysis, dissecting the biosynthesis and
interaction of components of cellular membranes and ion transport, understanding
immune and plant environmental stress responses, and the development of new
biomedical imaging agents. The requested state-of-the-art LC-MS/MS system is
capable of sensitive and high resolution multi-dimensional analyses of complex
lipid, protein, and metabolite samples, which are important to the research
programs of all of the current investigators, and will be central to expanding
IUPUI?s research and graduate training in science.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interdisciplinary activities and the creation of new
collaborations with neighboring departments have fueled CCB?s rapid growth. More
than 60 percent of its graduates, from a chemistry student body containing a
high proportion of female (50%) and underrepresented (16%) students, are
employed in the nine-county region surrounding Indianapolis, which is the center
of Indiana?s growing life sciences initiative involving pharmaceutical,
agrochemical, medical diagnostic, and related industries. The proposed
instrument will be showcased in several advanced biology and chemistry courses
that allow direct student instrument training and foster the integration of
modern biological research and education.
