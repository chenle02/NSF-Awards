9452959 McCartney ABSTRACT The University Museum at the University of Arkansas
is conducting preliminary planning for expansion of their 1994 pilot project
entitled "Women in Science." During this planning phase, the staff will meet
regularly with experts and teachers to design an exhibit about non-academic
female scientists in Arkansas that will travel throughout Arkansas, outline a
workshop for teachers that would help them encourage their female students to
participate in math and science, and develop a program that enables female
scientists to work with groups of students. At the end of the three and a half
month planning stage, a final report will present a plan for the exhibition,
gender workshop, and scientist program which identifies personnel, gives
models/prototypes, and a budget for each facet of the proposed project.
