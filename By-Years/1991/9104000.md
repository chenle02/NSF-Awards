Technical Narrative: This proposed conference, organized by North Carolina
Central University and Cairo University, is scheduled for 18-20 September 1991
in Alexandria, Egypt. Topics to be covered include the entire spectrum of
nonparametric and order statistics. This conference will be a separate and
distinct session associated with the International Statistical Institute general
meeting. This proposal supports the participation of approximately 10 U.S.
mathematicians. Conference participants will present papers that will be
compiled and published as a conference volume. This conference in nonparametric
and order statistics fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States, Egypt and elsewhere
to combine complementary talents and present research results in areas of strong
mutual interest and competence.
