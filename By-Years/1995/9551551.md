This project instructs senior-level Radiological Health Engineers, Nuclear
Engineers, Safety Engineers, and Industrial Hygienists in the proper techniques
and procedures for measuring radioactivity levels in the environment. This area
has become a major focus of the nuclear industry in the years following the
accidents at Chernobyl and Three-Mile Island. The course utilizes state-of-the-
art technology in order to expose undergraduates to new radiation detectors
already in use in modern environmental analysis laboratories. In addition to the
laboratory aspect, three in-field exercises are used, including an emergency
response drill and field trips to local nuclear reactor utilities. The course
contains sections on measuring environmental radiation fields, environmental
sample collection and analysis, trace element analysis, radon assay analysis,
measurements of occupational radiation fields, and radiological emergency
response. At this time, no other institution offers a complete laboratory course
on these topics. The class culminates in a radiological emergency response drill
in which students participate in the annual NRC required reactor accident drill
at one of the school's research reactors. This phase allows students to use
portable radiation detectors to quantify any contamination surrounding the
facility using techniques presented during the semester.
