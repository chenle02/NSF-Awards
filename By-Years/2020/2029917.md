The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused many hospitals to dramatically shift
their normal operations, including delaying elective and non-emergency
surgeries, to accommodate a surge in critically ill infectious disease patients
while still admitting and treating other severe injuries and illnesses not
related to COVID-19. This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) grant will support the
collection of time-sensitive data from two major hospital systems, Samaritan
Health Services in Oregon and MedStar Health System in Washington DC/Maryland,
to document changes in admissions patterns due to COVID-19, operational changes
in practices to manage the surge, and patient outcomes during the pandemic. The
project has the potential to provide important decision support to hospitals as
they respond to future pandemics and other mass casualty events and should lead
to better understanding of how hospital systems can mount an effective response
to these major disturbances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will collect
qualitative and quantitative data to document hospital operations as well as
assess patient characteristics and outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data
collection will be sourced from medical records characterizing the patient
population treated, health outcomes, including diagnoses, length of stay,
treatment, as well as pre-pandemic planning guidelines, real-time operational
changes in ICU and hospital bed capacity allocation and staffing, equipment
availability, including personal protective equipment and testing equipment, and
other hospital, state, and federal interventions. Once collected, analysis of
these data is expected to lead to knowledge, through better models and
simulation, that can improve response to future
pandemics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
