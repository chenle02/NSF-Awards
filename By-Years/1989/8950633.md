This funding support replaces the existing introductory electrical engineering
and mechanical engineering laboratories at Christian Brothers College with an
introductory interdisciplinary instrumentation laboratory for all engineering
students based on the HP Vectra-386 Workstation. Programmable instrumentation
such as oscilloscopes, digital power analyzers, multimeters and universal
sources, as well as electric circuit elements and mechanical transducers, in
conjunction with the workstations will allow modern data acquisition, control,
and data processing in the laboratory. This award is being matched by an equal
amount from the principal investigator's institution.
