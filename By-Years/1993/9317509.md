9317509 Kechris This project concentrates on the descriptive set theory of
definable group actions and equivalence relations. In particular, it deals with
Borel actions of Polish groups on Polish spaces, their orbit equivalence
relations, the structure and classification of countable Borel equivalence
relations, the theory of general Borel equivalence relations, and definable
cardinality theory. Set theory lies at the foundation of all mathematics. On the
one hand, it provides a form of intellectual hygiene, protecting against paradox
and contradiction. On the other hand, it lies so deeply behind everything that
it sometimes permits derivation of very general results with application in
widely separated branches of mathematics. ***
