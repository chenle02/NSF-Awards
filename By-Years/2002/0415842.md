Summary: The PIs propose to study insect respiration using the synchrotron X-ray
imaging facility at Argonne National Laboratory. In previous studies, the PIs
used this approach to show that tracheae in the head and thorax rapidly contract
and expand in diameter, causing a change in tracheal volume that appears to aid
respiration. The PIs plan to extend these observations by determining the
muscle/skeletal mechanisms involved in these changes. The PI will also determine
how broadly the mechanism of tracheal compression occurs in the various insect
orders. In a second study, the PIs will investigate the role of tracheal
compression in respiration by correlating the release of CO2 with cycles of
tracheal compression. These studies will be done on several species. The PIs
also plan to study individuals of different sizes from the same species to see
how growth affects this process. Finally, the PIs will analyze the role(s) of
insect mouthparts in breathing to determine the coordination of respiration with
motions of the mouthparts during feeding.
