This award will help develop an accurate chronology of Icelandic glacier
fluctuations in order to understand the nature and timing of climate variability
in the North Atlantic region since the Last Glacial Maximum. The investigators
will apply cosmogenic 3Helium and 36Clorine surface exposure dating to well-
reserved glacial features in Iceland. This effort represents a significant
effort to apply surface exposure dating to glacial deposits and landforms in
Iceland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of the research effort is to
establish a well-dated record of ice cap fluctuations during the early to-mid-
Holocene. Prior research by the investigators and others has shown that
cosmogenic surface exposure dating can achieve 500 to 1,000 year resolution,
which is sufficient to allow the use of glacial geologic records as indicators
of climate forcing at millennial time scales. Preliminary field and laboratory
studies suggest that dating efforts in Iceland will yield results of similar
resolution and have the potential to establish a terrestrial record of
glaciation in the central North Atlantic of unprecedented
resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An improved chronology of glaciation in Iceland
will provide a new perspective on the terrestrial consequences of abrupt North
Atlantic climate change and, when integrated with other well-established climate
proxies from marine sediment and ice cores, will contribute significantly to
further understanding these environmental changes.
