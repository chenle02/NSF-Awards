A Research Planning Grant is sought in connection with the establishment of a
physics research laboratory. The research will comprise a study of the stability
of colloidal suspensions in aqueous solutions in the presence of alternating
electric fields. Computer simulations will also be carried out, aimed at
developing a possible model for the system.
