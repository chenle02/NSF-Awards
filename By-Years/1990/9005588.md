The southern part of the Death Valley area contains the intersecting Garlock
and southern Death Valley fault zones and the tectonic boundary between the
Basin and Range province and the northeastern Mojave Desert. The northeastern
Mojave province, previously thought to not be extended, has recently been found
to contain a west-rooting detachment fault system involving late Miocene strata
in the Halloran Hills. This project is designed to provide the detailed maps,
structural geometry and kinematic information of the detachment required to
reassess the tectonics of the Mojave block and how the new information affects
the late Cenozoic tectonic history of the region.
