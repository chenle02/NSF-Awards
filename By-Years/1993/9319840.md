9319840 Szeto This award will help fund a workshop that will be held in
conjunction with the 15th Annual International Conference of the IEEE
Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society meeting. The workshop is entitled
"Non-Stationary Signal Analysis and Applications in Biomedical Signal
Processing" and it will be held in San Diego, California on October 27- 31,
1993. The award will provide support for the three workshop instructors, allow
the registration fee for the participants to be reduced from the normal amount,
and provide funding for some administration. The workshop is important since it
will focus on advanced signal processing techniques that could be used in the
study of biomedical systems. ***
