This network of graphics workstations, file server and associated graphics will
support the condensed matter theory research group, providing computer
visualization and windowing capabilities. Research programs include Quantum
Monte Carlo methods applied to liquid and solid He, atoms and molecules;
calculations of dynamical structure factors; molecular dynamics for the study of
new and novel vibrational excitations in periodic anharmonic lattices; first-
principles electronic structure methods combined with molecular dynamics for the
investigations of properties of amorphous and crystalline phases of
semiconductor bulk samples and surfaces; and analysis of scanning tunneling
microscope and atomic force microscope images of biopolymers.
