The Oregon Graduate Institute of Science & Technology has operated a Raman
spectroscopy laboratory since 1970 with an outstanding record of national and
international research accomplishments in chemistry and bioinorganic chemistry.
Members of the Department of Chemical & Biological Sciences propose a major
upgrade of the instrument through the acquisition of a Raman spectrometer
equipped with a charge- coupled device (CCD) detector and customized sample-
handing optics. Preliminary tests have shown that the improvement in signal-to-
noise of a CCD-equipped instrument over a single-channel spectrophotometer
ranges from 20 to 50. This translates into an increase in light-gathering power
by the square of the S/N, or 400- to 2500-fold. The new instrumentation will
significantly increase spectral quality, reduce data collection times, and
permit the use of much lower laser power. In conventional resonance Raman
spectroscopy, laser-induced sample damage limits the utility of signal
averaging. Experiments will be possible with the CCD detector that cannot now be
performed, and include research on (1) the catalytic mechanism of cytochrome d
oxidase, (2) the biochemistry of lignin-degrading peroxidases, (3) the structure
of cupredoxins having isotopically labeled ligands and site-directed ligand
mutations, (4) the structure and reactivity of novel quinone redox cofactors,
(5) the role of b-cytochromes in phogocytic cells, (6) the inorganic chemistry
of water- slitting catalysts, and (7) ligand-directed spectroscopy of copper
mono-oxygenases.
