This Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project is in the general area
of analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfield of bioanalysis. It is
jointly supported by the Division of Chemistry and the Experimental Program to
Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) Office. During the tenure of this three-
year continuing grant, Professor Asouzu and his students will develop and study
enzyme immunoassay methods and immunosensors. The incorporation of avidin,
streptavidin, biotin, and their enzyme and antibody conjugates into immunoassays
and immunosensor design will be evaluated. Enzymes and antibodies will be used
in both their solubilized and immobilized forms. Enzyme immunoassay techniques
will be combined with flow injection analysis and amperometric detection to
develop a multi-antigen immunoassay method. %%% This project includes a well-
conceived, multi-step paradigm for introducing undergraduate students, including
freshmen, to applications of enzymes and enzyme kinetic methods for bioanalysis.
The research is expected not only to lead to new developments in this rapidly
expanding field, but also to contribute strongly to the research and training
infrastructure of Troy State University and enable Professor Asouzu, a minority
investigator, to initiate a competitive research program.
