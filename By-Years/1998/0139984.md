0139984&lt;br/&gt;Lieb&lt;br/&gt;The understanding of the interaction of many
particles, e.g., atoms,&lt;br/&gt;raises significant physical and mathematical
questions, some of which go back to the early days of quantum theory and
statistical mechanics. The theory encompasses such classical subjects as the
stability of solids as well as some very recent experimental developments on the
strange and wonderful properties of trapped gases of bosonic atoms -- which
might eventually shed light on how to store information on ultra-small
scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the topics in this project two stand out for
particular&lt;br/&gt;emphasis. One is the understanding of Bose-Einstein
condensation and&lt;br/&gt;superfluidity in Bose gases. Considerable progress in
this area has&lt;br/&gt;already been made in previous grants by the PI and
collaborators. The&lt;br/&gt;other concerns ongoing attempts to understand
quantum electrodynamics&lt;br/&gt;which continues to be one of the most accurate
physical theories, yet&lt;br/&gt;one of the most puzzling because of its
internal inconsistencies. The PI will continue his attempts to reconcile quantum
electrodynamics with true many-body physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
