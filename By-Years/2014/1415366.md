This is a proposal to manage and coordinate the Geospace Environment Modeling
(GEM) workshops until FY 2018. The team from Virginia Tech will provide support
for the annual Summer GEM Workshops in June and the Mini-workshops held on the
Sunday before the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting in December. In
addition to the organization of the workshops this grant will provide support
for approximately 64 students to attend the summer workshops. The Virginia Tech
team will work with the GEM Steering Committee to ensure a smooth and efficient
operation.&lt;br/&gt;The GEM program is one of the most success research
programs in magnetospheric physics. It supports basic research into the most
important problems in magnetospheric physics and in so doing supports the
National Space Weather Program (NSWP). The NSWP has major societal relevance.
GEM has a strong student orientation and a major educational element. As such it
contributes to the training of the next generation of space physicists. The GEM
student organization has been formalized with student leaders and student only
sessions with tutorial talks by students.
