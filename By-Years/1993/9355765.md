9355765 Woods The project will purchase diode array spectrophotometers to
measure rapid kinetics in the undergraduate biochemistry course. New experiments
will be centered about enzymatic kinetics with data collection required at less
than second intervals. The rates of formation and degradation of reactants,
intermediates, and products will be determined.
