This is a joint seminar proposed by Dr. William Wang, the University of
California, Berkeley, and Professor Ovid Tseng, National Chung Cheng University
supported by the AIT (U.S.)-CCNAA (Taiwan) Cooperative Science Program. This
seminar will focus on language and its psychobiological bases. The seminar will
explore how language is organized within the human biological systems, with
particular attention paid to the Chinese language. Three basic features of
Chinese stand out in contrast with "European" language: the virtual absence of
inflectional morphology, the use of lexical tones, and the morphosyllabic nature
of the writing system. Most theories in the psychobiological bases of language
have been primarily built on the features of "European" languages. The seminar
to include Chinese can greatly broaden the bases for deducing the current
theories and provide for a broad range of variations in human language. **
