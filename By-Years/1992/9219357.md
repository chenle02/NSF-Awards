The overall process of gene expression involves several events including
transcription, RNA processing, mRNA degradation, translation, and post-
translational protein modification. Very little is known concerning the
mechanism or regulation of mRNA degradation. The focus of the proposed
experiments is to characterize mRNA instability sequences that determine the
rapid decay rate of labile mRNAs. An instability determinant originating from
the E. coli chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene has been identified (287R)
that can function in a cis-dominant manner to destabilize the normally stablw
ompA mRNA. Several approaches will be used to characterize the 287R instability
determinant. 1) Deletions will be introduced into the sequence to identify the
smallest sequence that still has destabilizing activity. 2) Site- directed
mutagenesis will be used to further define the minimum instability sequence and
to probe the functional importance of potential structures within the sequence.
3) The ribonuclease that recognizes this instability sequence will be
identified. Initially the function of the instability sequence will be tested in
mutants defective in known ribonucleases. If these experiments indicate that a
novel ribonuclease interacts with the 287R sequence, it will be isolated and
characterized. An in vitro decay assay will be developed and used to monitor
enzyme purification. 4) If time permits, the effect of this instability
determinant on growth rate regulation of ompA mRNA decay in E. coli will also be
investigated. %%% The goal of this project is to elucidated the mechanisms by
which cells degrade messenger RNA molecules. mRNA degradation is a basic
metabolic process and is vital to the organism's survival and adaptation
abilities. The decay rate of a particular mRNA can influence the amount of
protein synthesized from that transcript and thereby have a critical impact on
the expression levels of the corresponding gene. The experiments outlined in
this proposal will characterize elements within mRNAs called instability
determinants that result in the rapid decay of labile mRNAs. The sequences or
structures that are required for the function of an instability determinant will
be defined, and the cellular enzymes that recognizes these sequences will be
identified.
