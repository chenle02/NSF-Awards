Catalyst Projects provide support for Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCU) to work towards establishing research capacity of faculty to
strengthen science, technology, engineering and mathematics undergraduate
education and research. It is expected that the award will further the faculty
member's research capability, improve research and teaching at the institution.
and involve undergraduate students in research experiences. Winston-Salem State
University (WSSU) is establishing a project that will infuse interactive,
multidisciplinary research activities in existing science courses that satisfy
their general education requirements. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project has
been designed to recruit more African American STEM students to study Astronomy.
The project goal will be accomplished the following objectives: (1) the
development of the hands-on research projects that will utilize the universityâ€™s
Observatory in physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, and math courses;
(2) the upgrade of the Observatory; (3) the infusion of the research projects
into the selected courses; and (4) the engagement learning community. The
project will enable and support the development, implementation, and study of
evidence-based, innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation
and success of WSSU and other HBCU undergraduates. Furthermore, it promises to
support student recruitment into existing STEM majors with this novel
approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
