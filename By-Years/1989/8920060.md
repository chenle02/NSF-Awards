I recommend that this proposal be funded as a SGER award at $50,000 for a one-
year period. A starting date of 11/01/89 is desirable. Dr. Reed originally
submitted this proposal (much too early) for the December 1 deadline date for
the NCR program. He claims to have a critical need for funding before we could
possibly make an award in that review cycle. It seemed to me that this proposal
was an excellent candidate for a SGER award, and Dr. Reed said he wanted to
apply for it. The proposal qualifies for the SGER under two of the award
conditions: (1) preliminary work on novel and untested ideas. (2) application of
new expertise and new approaches to "old research topics. If the work is
successful, it could have an enormous impact upon subsequent research and
development in coding theory and design of communication systems. This is
because algebraic decoding techniques, in contrast to search techniques, are
typically capable of implementation with appreciably lower circuit complexity.
This allows the use of longer, more effective codes in communication systems
within the constraints of receiver/decoder costs. Dr. Reed's preliminary results
yielded the first algebraic decoder for a certain Golay code, and further
results could do the same for the entire class of quadratic residue codes, and
possibly other classes of codes. Dr. Reed has an outstanding reputation as an
innovative researcher. He is the developer of the famous Reed-Solomon codes
which are extensively used in communication and recording systems.
