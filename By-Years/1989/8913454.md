The proposed program contains three major areas: Wetting and growth, surface
melting, and quantum monolayers and multilayers. The wetting and growth studies
deal with the epitaxy and perfection of multilayer films, as influenced by
substrate- induced strain, dynamics and metastability. Surface edge melting
studies emphasize boundary effects and interfaces between the liquid and solid
phases. Comparisons between the crystal-melt interfaces of hydrogen isotopes and
films of heavier atoms will test for quantum effects. Edge melting relates to
one-dimensional behavior versus the two-d character of surface melting. Studies
of quantum systems will emphasize phase transitions exhibiting an interplay
between quantum effects and dimensionality, such as critical and triple points
of individual layers, roughening and possible two-dimensional superfluidity of
helium-four and hydrogen adsorbed on crystalline MgO.
