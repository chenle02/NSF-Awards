This project will develop geospatial data analysis building blocks as core part
of the HUBzero Scientific Collaboration platform to enable researchers and
educators to create and share geospatial data sets and modeling tools. The
project will build upon geospatial capabilities that have been developed by IT
experts and validated by the science community and bring such capabilities to
the masses, hence any domain scientist can develop and deploy geospatial
applications with graphical user interfaces on the web. The deliverables include
(1) tools and web service interfaces of "data space" for managing and sharing
data, including geospatial data, and (2) Extended RAPPTURE Toolkit APIs to
support geospatial mapping, image processing, visualization, and access to
shared data in the data space. The building blocks software developed in this
project will be open source as part of the HUBzero open source releases.
