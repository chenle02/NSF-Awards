Natural gas, consisting primarily of methane is an accessible and abundant
energy source with high potential to meet energy demands in an environmentally
sustainable way. Recent developments in accessing methane trapped within shale
formations, and within ice formations further increase its utility. In order to
take advantage of this energy source in a practical way, methane is converted
into other forms, such as syngas (mainly hydrogen), where it is ultimately used
for production of fuels or in the chemical industry. The inefficiency of the
current industry conversion methods has led to the development of non-thermal
(low temperature) methods. The use of plasmas (a charged gas) for the conversion
of methane to syngas has shown potential as a solution to increased energy
efficiencies. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Tomohiro
Nozaki at Tokyo Institute of Technology in Japan, an expert in plasma-surface
interactions with extensive experience in this particular reaction. The results
from this study could ultimately lead to positive changes in the energy market
for a clean and efficient natural gas.

The proposed reaction is mixing methane with carbon dioxide (CO2), to produce CO
and hydrogen. Thus, CO2 is recycled from other industrial plants, while
converting methane in the process. The key challenge to overcome is to eliminate
the solid carbon buildup on the catalyst surface, which reduces efficiencies of
the reaction over time. The reaction chamber that will be used in this study
includes a catalyst bed, where a gas chromatograph and spectrometer will be used
to analyze the conversion. Other techniques such as x-ray diffraction will also
be used. Fundamental chemical mechanisms will be studied with the spectroscopy,
while the gas chromatograph will provide overall information for optimization of
the reaction. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan
Society for the Promotion of Science.
