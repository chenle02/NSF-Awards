ABSTRACT Joan F. Brennecke University of Notre Dame CTS-9522835 Supercritical
(SC) carbon dioxide has been shown to be a viable reaction medium for a wide
variety of reactions. For example, it has recently been shown that commercially
important processes, such as the asymmetric hydrogen-transfer hydrogenation of
prochiral olefins and ketones and the oxidation of cyclohexene to adipic acid,
can be run in supercritical carbon dioxide. The benefit of operation in CO2 lies
in its potential for replacing hazardous organic solvents (chlorinated solvents,
in particular). Being non-toxic, some reaction rates are actually accelerated in
SC CO2, there are some examples in which the use of CO2 as the solvent also
results in better selectivity for the desired compound, and the tunability of
solubilities in supercritical fluids suggests possible energy-saving downstream
separation schemes. Thus, chemical reaction and processing in SC CO2 is an
attractive alternative to conventional manufacturing techniques.
