Students are discovering the principles and concepts of calculus by using a
computer laboratory equipped with networked MacIntosh computers running
Mathematica. The graphics, symbolic manipulation, and computational capability
of the software is also used for experimentation and discovery in differential
equations and linear algebra. The institution will contribute an amount equal to
the award.
