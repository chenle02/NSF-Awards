The goal of this project is to modernize a large introductory course for majors
by exposing the students to current molecular biological techniques and giving
Honors students in the course the opportunity to do original research.
Electrophoresis equipment will be utilized to carry out DNA restriction analysis
to identify the culprit in a hypothetical murder; students work though the
biological principles involved and see the application of these abstract ideas
to a practical forensic situation. Fluorescence microscopes and microfuges are
used in the Honors section to allow students to isolate and characterize a new
gene in yeast, and thus experience firsthand the excitement of breaking new
ground.
