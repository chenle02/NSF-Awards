The Mathematics Improvement Project (MIP) represents a concentrated effort to
increase the numbers of underrepresented students majoring in science,
mathematics, or engineering at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) by
focusing on their successful completion of College Algebra and Pre- calculus.
The project is incorporating programmatic structures that facilitate faculty
training, curricular design, and implementation of pedagogical practices
designed to both meet the special needs of underrepresented students and to
promote critical thinking and mastery of mathematical concepts. Four faculty
within the Division of Mathematics, Computer Science, and Statistics (MCSS) at
UTSA are working as MIP faculty and are designing and implementing a culture-
sensitive learning environment as well as a non-traditional instructional
curriculum to insure that students are prepared to work in the global community
in the 21st century. Although the program is open to all students,
underrepresented students enrolling in College Algebra and Pre-calculus are
being targeted. Through collaboration with the university's Student Services
offices and by formalizing ties with local schools and community colleges, this
program is implementing an effective system of recruitment, retention, and
successful completion of the MIP mathematics sequence for underrepresented
students. MIP's pipeline is generating a new momentum which allows students to
build confidence and to achieve an incremental gain in skills powerful enough to
ensure success in future mathematics courses. The overall goal is to increase
the rate of undergraduate students successfully completing the math sequence by
at least 20%.***//
