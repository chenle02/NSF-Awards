This project will support the activities of the CEDAR Science Steering Committee
(CSSC) over the period 2012-2014. The CEDAR program supports research into the
Earth's upper atmosphere with an emphasis on how material, momentum, and energy
are transported through different atmospheric strata and across latitudinal and
local time boundaries. CEDAR research also has important Space Weather and
global change overtones. The CEDAR community meets annually, and the attendance
at the CEDAR Workshop is of the order of 300. The participation of undergraduate
and graduate students as well as of young professionals at the workshop is
strong, and the CEDAR program has helped to launch the career of numerous
individuals into the fields of aeronomy and space physics. The CEDAR Workshop in
particular and the direction of the CEDAR community in general are planned by
the CEDAR Science Steering Committee, working in conjunction with Program
Directors from the NSF. Specific actions of this committee include the
organization of the Workshop and an associated luncheon meeting, participation
in another meeting in the Fall at the NSF in Arlington, and the publication of a
newsletter, the CEDAR Post, which appears approximately semi-annually.
