9452567 Akingbehin Open Systems are computing systems which are based on
nonproprietary multivendor components. As computing installations of all types
(large and small) move away from single-vendor proprietary architectures to more
and more open architectures, U.S. colleges and universities are increasingly
faced with the responsibility of introducing open systems concepts into the
undergraduate curriculum. Most colleges and universities today lag behind in
introducing these concepts in a coordinated and conscious manner. Academic
laboratories today are still largely configured using single-vendor homogeneous
computing systems. The increasing popularity of computing networks which support
multivendor configurations (e.g. Novell Netware) is a first step in the right
direction and is also evidence of the inevitable eminence of open systems
computing. This development of an open systems computing laboratory is based on
the three most popular computing platforms today in the PC to Workstation range;
namely IBM/PC, Macintosh, and Sun/UNIX. Supporting equipment include a
postscript printer, a Novell network, a tape mass storage, and appropriate
software and interfaces. The number of platforms is kept to three to reduce
complexity, make the problem tractable, and still illustrate important open
systems concepts. The laboratory serves as the vehicle for developing and
offering a three credit-hour elective course titled Open Systems Computing. The
course will fully utilize the laboratory and will provide hands-on training in
the three important open systems concepts of multiple-platform
interconnectivity, interoperability, and extensibility. In addition to the
development of the new course, several undergraduate computing courses including
Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Computer Networks, Systems
Programming, Systems Integration, and Computer Interfacing are directly enhanced
by the laboratory.
