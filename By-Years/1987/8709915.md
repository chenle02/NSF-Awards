These studies of the global regulatory circuitry for the glucose response have
led to the identification of a gene (SNF3) from yeast that is essential for
high-affinity glucose transport. It has been cloned and the sequence analysis
indicates that it encodes a membrane protein with homology to a major human
glucose transporter. Thus, the evidence indicates that the SNF3 gene encodes a
glucose transport protein. SNF3 is the first glucose transporter gene identified
in yeast. The structure, regulation and function of this gene and its protein
product will be studied using the powerful genetic and molecular techniques
available in yeast. The objective is to understand the role of the SNF3 protein
in the response to glucose availability.%%% The analysis of a yeast glucose
transporter will lead to an understanding of mechanisms by which eukaryotic
cells respond to changes in glucose availability. This laboratory has carried
out a genetic and molecular genetic analysis of the glucose regulatory response
in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). This organism was chosen to study because
the genetics of this small eukaryote is highly developed. Thus biochemical and
molecular methods, and also very powerful genetic approaches can be brought to
bear on the problem. Studies in recent years have shown that yeast shares many
of the key features of higher eukaryotic cells; thus, much of what is learned
will also apply to mammalian cells.***
