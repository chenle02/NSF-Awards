The objective of this project is to determine the feasibility of using
electrochemically generated superoxide to rapidly dechlorinate organic compounds
such as the polychlorinated biphenyls, trihalomethanes, chlorinated phenols,
benzoic acids, and chlorinated polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons that are found
in wastewater. A novel compact electrolytic cell will be utilized for generation
of the superoxide used to dechlorinate the organic compounds. After
dechlorination, the resultant products are expected to be more amenable to
biochemical degradation than they were previously utilizing fixed-film and
suspended culture, bio-oxidation wastewater treatment processes. The proposal
leading to this project was submitted in response to NSF 88-8, Program
Solicitation for Small Business Innovation Research. The contamination of ground
and surface waters by organic compounds that are the target of this research is
a matter of great National concern. It is imperative that technologies be
developed that are responsive to the need to remove organic pollutants from
water and wastewater as well as to prepare substances that are not readily
biodegradable for treatment by passage through biotreatment processes.
