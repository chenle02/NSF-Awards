This proposal requests partial support of a conference organized to discuss the
state of the art of confocal microscopy. The tentative program lists 14 speakers
from both the United States and Europe who are the leaders in this rapidly
growing field. This group will be able to provide an in depth analysis of the
technical benefit and drawbacks of the procedures involved in the process as
well as the currently available instrumentation. The proceedings of the
conference will be published in book form. The conference will be held at the
Next meeting of the Electron Microscopy Society of America during August, 1989
in San Antonio Texas.
