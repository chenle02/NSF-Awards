This proposal requests funds in support of a ?scoping? workshop to explore the
needs and requirements for a community hydrologic modeling activity in
hydrology. This activity is tentatively called the Community Hydrologic Modeling
Platform (CHyMP) and it is proposed as one of two new major initiatives for the
next 5-year phase of the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of
Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI). The goal of CHyMP is to significantly advance
hydrologic simulation capabilities via a community modeling activity, including
the development, distribution and technical support of common simulation
software. The current vision for CHyMP is of a platform that would support
several modeling packages for forward modeling, inverse modeling, stochastic
modeling, graphical visualization, access to data sources, and other features.
This vision will be modified and refined through an initial scoping workshop
(proposed here) and two follow-on workshops. An important outcome of CHyMP would
be a framework for integrated water cycle modeling that could be applied across
scales and for solving complex hydrologic research questions that could not be
addressed in its absence. The goal of the first workshop is to survey the range
of perspectives on the scope and form that a community hydrologic modeling
activity should take. The outcome will be the establishment of a CHyMP working
group and a report to the community on the rationale and preliminary strategy
for undertaking community modeling in hydrology. Following the scoping and
follow-on workshops, we expect that a PI-led research team will make a formal
proposal to the NSF for the development and implementation of the platform. The
intellectual merit of the proposed workshop is the articulation of the form and
requirements for a community hydrologic modeling platform. The broader impacts
of the workshop are the potential provision of integrated water cycle modeling
tools to the hydrologic and related communities, as well as the new research
that these tools will enable.
