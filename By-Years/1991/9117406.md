The goals of this project are (1) To better constrain the viscosity and flow
structure of the mantle through joint geoid/seismic data fitting, (2) develop a
self-consistent inversion scheme for the body wave (S and P), surface wave, and
normal mode data that includes in the seismic inversion process the effects due
to the boundary deformations induced by any internal density anomalies, and (3)
explore the effects of phase transitions and lateral (temperature-dependent)
viscosity variations on internal mantle structure and the geoid through 2-D and
3-D numerical experiments and seismic dataset intercomparisons.
