This award supports a two year continuing grant for Dr. Sieburth and his co-
investigators to renew their work on marine microbiology. The award is an
Accomplishment Based Renewal of their previously funded research (1985 - 1987)
that has led to the isolation of a new genus of archebacteria from marine
waters. Dr. Sieburth has put forth the exciting hypothesis that there exists a
very active assemblage of marine bacteria that produce and consume simple carbon
compounds in surface seawater. This represents a previously undocumented pathway
for carbon in surface waters. The current award will enable Dr. Sieburth to test
this hypothesis and continue his analysis of the organisms responsible. The
award also supports the productive co- investigators that have adapted sensitive
techniques such as coloumetry for the measurement of seawater dissolved
inorganic carbon.
