93-21500 The PI requests funding to purchase shipboard instrumentation in
support of NSF-funded research. The instruments will be used aboard the R/V
BLUEFIN, a 72 foot vessel, which is owned and operated by the Institute.
Instrumentation requested includes a digital field fluorometer for continuous
underway measurements. The instrumentation requested is required for support of
NSF-funded cruises aboard the BLUEFIN during 1994 and will enhance the
scientific capability of the vessel in the future.
