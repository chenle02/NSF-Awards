The Sao Francisco craton region, one of two cratonic areas in Brazil initially
formed in the Archean as part of a much larger crustal block. Subsequent
tectonic activity has reduced the area to a relatively small remnant. In the
southern Sao Francisco region of Minas Gerais, Brazil a relatively complete and
reasonably exposed record of Proterozoic activity exists. This project will,
with the close cooperation of geologists from the Universidade Federal de Ouro
Preto, assemble detailed transects across this margin and conduct radiometric
age determinations in an attempt to identify the tectonic style and ages of the
precambrian tectonic events affecting the Sao Francisco craton of eastern
Brazil.
