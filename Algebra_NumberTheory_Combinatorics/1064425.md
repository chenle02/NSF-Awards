Cutkosky proposes to investigate several problems involving the interaction of
algebraic geometry and commutative algebra. Asymptotic properties of high powers
of ideals will be investigated. Good stable properties tend to hold for high
powers. Toroidalization of mappings of algebraic varieties will be studied,
continuing previous work of the PI. Ramification of varieties in positive
characteristic will be investigated, with an eye towards local uniformization.
The author will investigate the related problem of classification of semigroups
of valuations on a noetherian ring, and the construction of generating sequences
of valuations.

Algebra is of increasing importance in modern science and technology. Cutkosky
will investigate several problems of theoretical importance in algebra.
Undergraduate and graduate students will be trained and young researchers will
be mentored through this project.
