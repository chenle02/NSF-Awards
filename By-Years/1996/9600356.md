9600356 Wolf The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
scientists and engineers to conduct three to twentyfour months of research
abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions
abroad. This award will support a seven-month postdoctoral research visit which
will support Dr. Marty Wolf of Mankato State University to work with Dr. Brendan
McKay at the Australian National University in Canberra, Australia. The topic of
this research is to establish the complexity of p-partite tournament
isomorphism. The primary goal is to determine a tighter analysis of the
complexity of this open problem in graph theory. There is an interest in
studying this complexity on a variety of combinatorial objects because it will
help develop a deeper understanding of what makes the isomorphism problem
difficult and the relative complexity of combinatorial objects. This project is
also significant because some problems found in neural network algorithms result
in networks where the underlying structure is a p-partite tournament, and Dr.
Wolf and Dr. McKay will explore the application of convex subsets to try and
overcome these problems. ***
