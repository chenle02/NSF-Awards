9317894 Newbould Methodist Medical Center of Illinois (Methodist), a 420 bed
teaching medical center affiliated with the University of Illinois at Chicago,
proposes to connect the campus-wide ethernet Local Area Network to the NFSNET.
This will be done by consultation with and assistance from netIllinois, an
affiliate of CICNet, a regional NFSNET network. Methodist's ongoing development
and full implementation of an Integrated Advanced Information Management System
(IAIMS) requires a data repository that reaches external databases and
information exchanges. The absence of this capability can be solved by means of
Internet access. Methodist will provide Internet access to a variety of
professional staff and adequately equip the users through education and support
services. Further, this project will examine medical center professionals' use
of resources available through the Internet and the impact of subsequent use.
Three groups of 12 will be formed, each group representing a different category
of professional staff: clinical/research, ancillary and administrative.
Participants will be trained in proper uses of the Internet. During
participation they will keep a structured journal of Internet usage. The
Methodist Research Section will conduct periodic structured interviews of the
participants. Bimonthly, the journal entries will be copied for review and
analysis. Also, electronic records will be kept on usage. At the beginning of
the second year another cohort of groups will repeat the process. Content
analysis and descriptive statistics will be performed on the journal, interview,
electronic record and support services call data.
