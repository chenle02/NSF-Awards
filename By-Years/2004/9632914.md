9632914 Carpenter This project will provide support for 20 US secondary Earth
Science teachers and 10 post-secondary Earth Scientists and Earth Science
Educators to attend the Second International Conference on Geoscience Education,
which will be held in Hilo, HI July 28 through August 1, 1997. The focus of the
conference is to emphasize and demonstrate the Earth Systems approach to the
teaching of Earth Science. Participants will be selected on the basis of their
experience as leaders in Earth Science education and upon the nature of the
program they will be offering at the conference. 80% of those selected must not
have participated in more than two nationally supported institutes.
Dissemination activities include the Conference Proceedings and presentations by
the participants at professional meetings. Matching funds constitute 35% of the
NSF award.
