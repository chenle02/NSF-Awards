9732502 Yeh This U.S.-Brazil award will support a research collaboration between
Dr. William W-G. Yeh of the University of California, Los Angeles and Dr.
Benedito P. F. Braga, Jr. at the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil. They propose
to develop a model for the optimal management and operation of a large-scale
hydropower system. Brazil is home to the world's largest hydropower system,
located in southeast Brazil. The investigators intend to develop a model for
this system and apply the model to the study of capacity expansion to determine
the optimal timing, sizing and sequencing of new projects. This project provides
a unique opportunity to develop and test new optimization methodologies. The
research could contribute significantly to both countries' knowledge of large-
scale hydropower system optimization. ***
