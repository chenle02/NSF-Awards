9350662 Benenson The equipment is for an integrated lab-lecture elementary
physics course (enrollment about 180) for Lyman Briggs School, which is a part
of the College of Natural Science at Michigan State University. The course
serves as a model for future physics courses with much larger enrollment in the
Department of Physics and Astronomy. The course contains several innovative
features: 1) full integration of lecture and laboratory by team teaching with a
single syllabus, 2) maximum use of personal computers with existing general-use,
commercially available applications, 3) employment of video frame grabbing
techniques as a general purpose tool, and 4) an open laboratory structure. The
first three items have already been tested on a limited basis. In the first
lecture of the week, the lecturer describes the laboratory experiment and does
one case. For example the lecturer could video tape an air table with pucks
colliding. By reading back the video frame by frame, the lecturer can analyze
the puck positions and show that momentum and energy are conserved. Preliminary
experiments have been shown to give very good data. During the week, the
students schedule use of the camcorder and air table to do their own experiment.
After producing a few events on video tape, the students then analyze them on
the available computers. For this purpose, plotting, spreadsheet, drawing, etc.
applications are available. The course begins by training the students in the
use of these programs. A very large amount of extensive data is easily produced.
Analysis on a spreadsheet program and curve fitting with plotting packages
produces very professional looking results and introduces the students to the
modern ways in which research is actually performed. Data reduction includes
extensive error analysis via spreadsheets. ***
