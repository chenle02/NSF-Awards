A shortage of well-trained Braille teachers increases while case loads that may
span hundreds of miles soar. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
project from Exceptional Teaching Aids will create unique speech-assisted
Braille mathematics in the form of a stand-alone self-study system. Speech
Assisted Learning (SAL) system utilizes synthesized speech for tutorials,
verification of Braille symbols, and feedback. No keyboarding skills are
required. The overall objective of Phase I is to determine whether visually
impaired individuals can augment Braille math instruction via the SAL. The
research design includes developing a prototype, developing curriculum, and
evaluating human performance. Successful research and development of such a
system will benefit visually impaired persons of all ages having a variety of
abilities and needs. The versatility and user friendliness of the proposed SAL
system makes it broadly appealing and would greatly increase Braille math
literacy. For the first time, Braille math instruction will be available in
schools, offices, libraries, government agencies, or community centers.
Moreover, instruction in all academic areas could be offered.
