Winter Schools at the University of Central Florida are being designed to focus
on a topic of relevance to some part of the planetary community, either by
introducing something relatively new to people who are not yet heavily engaged
in it or by developing a new approach or technique within an established
research area. The first such Winter School is a three-day learning workshop
geared toward planetary scientists who are interested in exoplanets. By bringing
together (a) planetary scientists working on projects in exoplanets, (b) planet
searchers interested in planetary physics, and (c) exoplanet researchers seeking
planetary science students and collaborators, it will provide a base of
knowledge, a showcase for the latest results, and a productive environment for
networking and brainstorming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Winter School integrates
research and education directly, and promotes the training and learning of
graduate students. It will also facilitate the broad dissemination of current
research results, enhancing the understanding of these topics by planetary
scientists, and is specifically designed to act as an incubator for new research
projects and new collaborations.
