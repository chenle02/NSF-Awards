This grant is for purchase of a supercritical fluid chromatograph (SFC). It will
provide versatile analytical capabilities for an ongoing NSF supported projects
on novel bioreactor configurations and on development of novel enzyme- catalyzed
reactions to produce new materials which cannot be manufactured by conventional
chemical methods. SFC offers significant advantages over other methods for
chemical analysis such as gas-liquid chromatography and high- performance liquid
chromatography. SFC will enable the investigators to obtain essential
quantitative data efficiently and rapidly and will also enable them to make
quantitative measurements at very low concentrations that cannot be made with
conventional equipment.
