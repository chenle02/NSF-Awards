The School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology at the University of Hawaii
will acquire several items of oceano- graphic instrumentation to be placed in a
pool of shared use equipment. This equipment is maintained for use on or in
association with the research vessels and facilities operated by the University.
A large part of the ships' operating schedule during 1991 is in support of NSF-
sponsored research projects. The instrumentation will also increase the
capabilities of the ship and of the University to support research and
engineering activities. The instrumentation includes: -Newly developed
Continuous Profiling System that will provide a range of environmental data at a
long-term offshore sampling site, -Shipboard computer upgrade and optical data
recording device for increasing shared-use, sea-going computing capabilities,
-precision graphic recorder for displaying acoustically derived data of seafloor
bathymetry and sedimentary profiles, and -precision audio frequency signal
source for calibrating and testing seagoing acoustic instruments. The
instrumentation described above will increase the capability of the University
to support NSF-sponsored research and engineering projects.
