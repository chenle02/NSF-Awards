Motivated by considerations in topology, geometry, arithmetic and group theory
the proposal intends to study real, complex and quaternionic hyperbolic
manifolds. This will involve the study of discrete groups, their connections
with number theory, and expanding graphs. We will also explore various
interconnections between these topics with a view to better understanding the
topology of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three dimensional
manifolds are locally like the space we live in and understanding these objects
have been one of the central themes of research in the last 30 years. The
importance of these objects extends far beyond their intrinsic interest, since
their study connects to mathematical physics, mathematical biology and computer
science. One of the aims of this proposal is to explore some of these
connections via families of "expanding graphs". These graphs are well-known in
computer science because of their importance in building efficient networks.
Remarkably, this is connected to the main study of the proposal, "finite covers
of 3-manifolds".&lt;br/&gt;By their nature, many of the problems in the proposal
are cross-disciplinary, and hence progress will have a broader impact. In
addition, these have proved to be fertile grounds for the training of graduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;
