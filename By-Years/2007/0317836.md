With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Physics at North Carolina A&amp;T University will acquire a multi-
source reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometer. This equipment will enhance
research in a number of areas including a) the synthesis, structure and
properties of metal-containing nanoclusters; b) millimeter-wave spectroscopy of
mass-selected molecular ions and cluster ions; c) the synthesis, isolation and
characterization of melanogenic substrates and cofactors using mass
determination; and d) development of electrochemical techniques in the
decontamination of organic contaminants, especially pesticides.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe
intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast
array of organic, bioorganic, and organometallic molecules. The results from
these studies will have an impact in a number of areas including environmental
chemistry and nanosciences. &lt;br/&gt;
