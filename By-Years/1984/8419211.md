Aerobic coupling reactions which are induced catalytically by binuclear copper
compounds will be investigated to uncover additional couplig systems which are
of commercial and scientific interest in synthesis and separation processes, and
to fill in existing gaps in the understanding of existing aerobic coupling
reactions. New combinations of catalysts, ligands, and solvents will be sought
which are more effective than those presently known. In addition, the
possibility will be examined that surfactants and cross-coupling reactions
between different compounds may greatly enhance the engineering potential of
aerobic coupling reactions, and the effect of ultraviolet light on these
reactions will be determined. Finally, polymer-supported catalysts with
binuclear structures will be designed to support specific coupling reactions.
These new systems may lead to novel processes for the removal of toxic and
hazardous organic compounds from aqueous solutions and for the recovery of
certain types of biochemical compounds.
