The objective of the research is to investigate the use of analytic methods and
results from multiprocessor computing to design the most effective integration
structures. The scope of this research will include integration of distributed
engineering tasks involving decisions and designs in the areas of distributed
product design, production planning and quality assurance. Distribution will be
considered within and between plants and under dynamically changing conditions.
The research will focus on the theoretical analysis of models for three
interrelated integration issues: (1) static and dynamic organizational
configurations for the integration; (2) decomposition of engineering problems to
tasks that are designed for integration by the above configurations; and (3)
suitable classification and an analytic approach to compare integration
alternatives that will increase integration effectiveness, including fault-
tolerant computer-based integration. To achieve the objective, a multi-
disciplinary approach will be used, combining manufacturing engineering,
operations research, and computer engineering. The potential of creating
significant new knowledge on integration of distributed engineering tasks and
influencing its usefulness to American manufacturing is high.
