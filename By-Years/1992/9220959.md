The primary objective of this US-Czech Joint Fund research project between Dr.
Jan Pilar, the Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry, Czech Academy of Science
and Dr. Shulamith Schlick, University of Detroit, is to gain a better
understanding of segmental dynamics and phase structure of polymers and their
complexes in dilute solutions and solid polymer blends by means of Spin Label
Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The
information on dynamics will be obtained by analyzing line shapes of ESR spectra
of spin labels and/or spin probes incorporated in the polymer systems; the phase
structure will be characterized by both ESR and DSC data. An ESR imaging system
will be used to gain a spatial resolution of ESR data. This research in
materials research fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
knowledge by enabling leading experts in the U.S. and Czech Republic to combine
complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence. Funds for the project are awarded through the US-Czech
Joint Fund, Prague, in accordance with established guidelines.
