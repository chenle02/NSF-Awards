The capabilities of the existing Transportation Systems Laboratory in the
Department of Civil Engineering at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State
University are being improved to the benefit of undergraduate students enrolled
in transportation engineering-related courses. The laboratory project improves
existing hardware and software systems to introduce laboratory experiments in
traffic engineering and airport planning and design courses, and in an
introductory course in transportation engineering. The instrumentation added to
the project includes off-the-roadway sensors, intersection shelf counters, a
central CPU, and data acquisition hardware and software. This laboratory will be
used also as a monitoring center capable of replicating some of the primary
functions of an intelligent vehicle highway system.
