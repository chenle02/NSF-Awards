&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NIRT proposal focuses on developing a novel carbon
nanotube ionization chemical sensor for emergency rescue crews and first
responders that will enable "on-site" monitoring. The proposed sensor is light-
weight, compact, robust, affordable, consumes low power (battery operated) and
can provide definitive identification of contaminants in real-time mode with
fast response.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Our idea for sensing
takes advantage of the extremely high electric fields that are generated near
nanotube tips as a means of inducing ionization and electrical breakdown of the
gas at low voltages. By monitoring the breakdown voltage, the gas can be
identified (every gas has a characteristic breakdown behavior) and by monitoring
the discharge current, the gas concentration can be determined. In this project
we will perform a series of experiments with individual nanotubes as well as
ensembles of tubes (electrode arrays) to gain a fundamental understanding of the
basic mechanisms for ionization and breakdown of gas species and mixtures near
nanotube electrodes. The experiments will be supported by density functional
theory predictions for gas ionization near sharp nanotube tips. Based on the
understanding gained from this study we will assemble integrated devices to
detect trace amounts of analytes in mixtures and we will quantify the
sensitivity, selectivity and sensor power consumption.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: On-site chemical sensing is critical to
environmental monitoring, control of chemical processes, space missions,
agricultural and medical applications. Broader impact of sensing is also well
recognized in light of homeland security issues. To integrate teaching and
research we will introduce sensing experiments and multimedia virtual-labs into
the curriculum. We will also connect to the outreach of the NSEC Center to
introduce Nanotechnology to K-12 students and teachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
