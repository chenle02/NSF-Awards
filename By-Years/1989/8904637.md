During the 13-month tenure of his Mid-Career Fellowship in Environmental
Biology, Dr. W. Dennis Clark will apply the techniques of molecular genetics
(including DNA sequencing, restriction site mapping, and restriction fragment
pattern analysis) to resolving problems of phylogeny within the neotropical
plant family Bromeliaceae. These data will complement knowledge obtained from
traditional morphology-based research on the group. Cladistic analysis will be
used to extrapolate phylogenetic conclusions from the molecular data.
Significant insights will be gained regarding family-level relationships of the
Bromeliaceae, generic relationships within subfamily Tillandsioideae, subgeneric
relationships within the large genus Tillandsia, and taxonomic relationships of
species and species groups within Tillandsia subgenus Phytarrhiza. In addition,
it is expected that the molecular genetic information will permit precise
assessments of evolutionary patterns of habit types of tropical epiphytes. Dr.
Clark teaches at Arizona State University in Tempe, but for the duration of the
fellowship will be working at the University of California's Riverside campus.
