The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a universal design kit for silicon
photonics that will include, for the first time, the ability to design and
produce, in a fabless model, a cost-effective, silicon-controlled, tunable
laser.Â &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project goals will include the
analysis, design, and fabrication of silicon photonic integrated circuits for
back-reflection suppression. A key research objective will be to enable the
design of a customized, silicon-controlled, tunable laser capable of insertion
into a high-speed data communication link based on hybrid III-V/Si integration.
A key development objective will be to enable the assembly and manufacture of
the silicon photonic integrated circuits using industry-accepted back-end-of-
line integration methods.
