The origin and diversification of land plants have been long standing problems
in botany, which the fossil record alone has been unable to resolve. In recent
years, it is molecular data from genome analyses that have demonstrated great
promise in identifying the algal groups closest to the presumed ancestors of
bryophytes and vascular plants. Dr. Manhart of Texas A&amp;M University will
join the small network of researchers analyzing chloroplast DNA gene order and
sequences in order to determine the phylogenetic relationships of green algae
and primitive land plants. The spatial order of genes on the circular DNA
molecule of plant chloroplasts and the nucleotide sequences of functionally
important chloroplast genes are highly conserved features of plant genome
organization. By analyzing similarities and differences in these two major
features, Dr. Manhart will help determine the groups of Charophycean algae that
most closely match primitive land plants in basic genomic structure. Comparable
studies of select groups of mosses and ferns will provide an overall framework
for the evolutionary connections among algae and early land plants. The
molecular datasets will be evaluated using computer methods to generate
phylogenetic trees, and the results compared and integrated with morphological
and fossil evidence.
