This research consists of a three year study of the plastic deformation
properties of intermetallic compounds. This study combines theoretical and
experimental investigations of how dissociation within the "core" of a
dislocation controls the plastic deformation processes of hexagonal close packed
ordered compounds such as Ti3Al. Experimental studies of single crystal Mn3Sn
examines such properties as: active slip systems, critical resolved shear stress
as a function of temperature, and strengthening mechanisms. Atomistic modeling
of these plastic deformation processes involves application of the embedded atom
method.
