9870033 Edidin The focus of this project is intersection theory on quotient
moduli spaces that arise in algebraic geometry. This includes using localization
methods on moduli spaces of vector bundles to study surface invariants, as well
as calculating integral Chow rings of moduli stacks of curves and vector
bundles. We also consider the problems of determining which stacks are quotient
stacks and of obtaining an explicit Riemann-Roch formula for singular quotient
schemes. Much of the work will use the equivariant intersection theory developed
jointly by the principal investigator and W. Graham. This is research in the
field of algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest parts of
modern mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past
quarter-century. In its origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the
plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes
use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and
conversely is finding application in those fields as well as in physics,
theoretical computer science, and robotics.
