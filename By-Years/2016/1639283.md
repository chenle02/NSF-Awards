This workshop will bring together researchers from around the world to discuss
recent progress in the study of granular materials. Granular materials are
ubiquitous in a range of industrial and natural systems, yet a quantitative
understanding of many phenomena remains elusive and predictive capabilities
remain limited. Advances in this field require the participation of multiple
scientific and engineering disciplines, each of which has its own goals and
techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF funds will be used to support the
registration and travel costs for junior and early career scientists and
engineers at the 2016 Gordon Research Conference on Granular and Granular-Fluid
Flows. Support will also be provided to allow participation of members of
underrepresented groups. Such support will fill a crucial, national need to
continue to train the future work force in the science of particle technology.
