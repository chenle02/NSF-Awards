Informal Analysis Seminar that will be held Kent State University in Fall 2019,
Spring 2020, Fall 2020, and Spring 2021. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of these
meetings will feature plenary lectures that highlight connections between
different topics in Analysis, Probability, Convex Geometry, and Partial
Differential Equations. There will also be a poster session for all researchers
to showcase their work, and a special panel on open questions for graduate
students and early career researchers. This award gives early career
researchers, members of underrepresented groups, and researchers not funded by

committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups
through a number of different activities. More information will be made
