A comprehensive experimental study is being proposed to perform dynamic
characterization of monolithic and reinforced (fiber and particle) polymeric
materials using attached and embedded optical- fiber sensors. This study will
provide better understanding of the high strain rate behavior of these materials
and at the same time evaluate the performance of embedded optical fiver sensors
which is a key ingredient of "smart materials." Results from fundamental studies
will be relevant to the detection of acoustic emission from internal strains and
propagating cracks. Also, dynamic fracture studies will be conducted with the
fiber sensors being attached and embedded in monolithic and reinforced polymeric
materials, from which the instantaneous dynamic stress intensity factor will be
determined. These experiments will provide the complete dynamic strain field
history as the crack initiates, propagates and arrests in these materials.
