This three-year project provides a scanning electron microscope (SEM) for use by
research scientists and public educators at Carnegie Museum of Natural History
(CMNH). This instrument improves the quality and speed of microscopic
observations, expanding the kinds of research possible at CMNH. The instrument
permits non-destructive analysis of microscopic features of specimens in the
museum?s vast collections. Scientific goals include: 1) implementing an SEM with
x-ray capability for studying specimens; 2) enabling staff research programs in
archaeology, mammalogy, vertebrate paleontology, entomology, mineralogy, and
other disciplines; 3) expanding SEM use to improve research and scientific
services by Research Associates, visiting researchers, student investigators,
and specimen borrowers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project integrates research
and educational programming for public visitors through research-intensive
learning experiences in a museum setting. It provides hands-on opportunities for
visitors to use the SEM to observe real objects. These memorable experiences
promote understanding and appreciation of museum-based research by students at
all levels and the general public using museum collections, exhibits,
classrooms, and events. The SEM will be used within educational programs already
successful at CMNH, involving technological applications for learning: special
projection spaces (Earth Theater); research integration (Biotechnology
Laboratory); curricula for student classes in other states via Internet
(Distance Learning).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
