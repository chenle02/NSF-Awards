Conventional disc electrode (CDE) EEG is currently the primary diagnostic tool
for various brain, neurological, and psychological disorders. However, it
suffers from poor sensitivity/specificity, which is a root cause of
misdiagnosis. The market needs a better tool for understanding brain activities.
Surface Laplacian EEG increases the spatial resolution by decreasing the
blurring effects due to the strong attenuation of the skull. To increase the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), existing methods primarily rely on signal
processing techniques without addressing the limitations of CDEs, which result
in suboptimal outcome. The I-Corps team proposes transforming the electrode
configuration to improve the SNR of EEG by utilizing a new generation of
electrodes, tripolar concentric ring electrodes (TCREs), which perform the
Laplacian automatically taking bipolar differences of the potentials from
closely spaced electrode elements. TCRE EEG has significantly better spatial
selectivity, SNR, localization, and Laplacian estimate than CDE EEG. TCREs are
directionally independent to global sources and highly focused on local activity
due to their concentric configuration, which sharply attenuates distant signals
and artifacts such as eye blinks and ECG. Preliminary clinical data showed that
TCRE EEG revealed the patient?s brain activity during epileptic seizures which
was not possible with CDE EEG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TCRE EEG will fill clinical
and research needs unmet by CDE EEG. EEG technology is one of the mainstays of
hospital diagnostic procedure and pre-surgical planning. With the significant
technological improvement provided by the TCRE, EEG will continue to increase in
value as a tool to assist doctors in improving the quality of life for a wide
variety of patients. The fundamental improvement in EEG technology will advance
the diagnosis of and scientific research on various brain diseases and
neurological disorders (epilepsy, sleep disorders, stroke, Parkinson's,
Alzheimer's, etc.) and more effectively guide neurosurgical and other medical
procedures. The increased signal fidelity from TCRE may allow detection of
biomarkers to quantify neurological disorders (such as autism) with EEG which
was not previously possible. Furthermore, TCRE EEG will improve the performance
of Brain Computer Interfaces which may provide those persons who cannot use or
have limited use of their muscles but are cognitively intact with an alternative
for communication and control. Commercially, TCRE EEG may transform the market
landscape and setting a new standard for EEG equipment. This I-Corps award has
the potential to accelerate the transition of innovation from lab to market.
