The purpose of this project is to analyze and define the Huasteca region in
light of new archaeological developments in other Mesoamerican regions. Among
these are the increased archaeological activities in Central Mexico;
developments in Veracruz with respect to the Olmec; the intensive and extensive
studies in Oaxaca; and the great development of new cultural interpretations for
the Maya region. Few studies have been done in this region since the 1920's. The
investigator proposes to complete a survey of recorded and reported sites for a
subsequent selection, testing and excavation. The testing or excavation of sites
will locate those with preclassic components. He will attempt to relate the
Huastec with the Maya culture through material remains and perhaps through the
manifestations of belief systems or practices. The next step will be to analyze
the changes in the Huastec as they become part of the central Mexican sphere of
influence. An additional effort will be put forth to understand the relationship
between Spaniards and Indians at the time of conquest and in the early colonial
period. This analysis will be pursued from an archaeological perspective in an
attempt to see how rapidly change occurred in this region.
