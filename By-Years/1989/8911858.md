In this project, the P.I., in collaboration with several colleagues, will
investigate "coherent flow structures", and their behavior under environmental
forcing, using mathematical analysis and laboratory modeling. Examples of such
structures include dipolar vortices such as modons, isolated eddies similar to
those observed in the ocean, and vortex monopoles.
