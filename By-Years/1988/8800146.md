The project is an attempt to investigate past variations in the oxygen content
of the deep ocean. It has been observed that Molybdenum, Vanadium and Uranium
are highly enriched in sediments overlain by water that contains very low or no
oxygen. These elements are unreactive in oxic water and their dissolved
concentrations in the sea can be used as an index to determine thae 02
concentration level. The investigation proposes that the history of
concentration of these elements in sea water can be determined by measuring
their concentrations in planktonic foraminifera in marine sediment. The results
of the study will provide the first evidence of the oxygen concentration of the
ocean in the geologic past. The study will be important to paleoceanographic
studies.
