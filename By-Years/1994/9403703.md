9403703 Weyman The aim of this research is to study the varieties arising as the
collapsing of vector bundles. Several parts of the research correspond to the
most interesting examples of such varieties. The first part is to study degrees,
determinantal expressions and singularities of generalized discriminants and
resultants. Special attention will be paid to the classical discriminants and
resultants as well as the hyperdeterminants- the discriminants of
multidimensional matrices. The second part is concerned with singularities of
conjugacy classes of nilpotent elements in classical Lie algebras. The main goal
here is to prove the principal investigator's conjecture on non-normal orbits.
The third part is to sutdy the varieties of binary forms with multiple roots.
This research is concerned with a number of questions in commutative algebra and
algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry studies solutions of families of
polynomial equations. One can either study the geometry of the solution set or
approach problems algebraically by investigating certain functions on the
solution set that form what is called a commutative ring. This dual perspective
creates a close connection between commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.
