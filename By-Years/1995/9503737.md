9503737 SUTER, ROBERT This x-ray scattering equipment will be used to address a
wide variety of scientific and technological questions including, but not
limited to, a) the structure and thermal behavior of biologically relevant lipid
membranes, b) the structure of complex fluid films, c) the quality of novel
crystalline semiconductor materials, d) the structure and growth kinetics of
thin solid films, e) the structure of organic and oxide coatings on solid
substrates, f) the structure of layered materials and their internal interfaces,
and g) the behavior of polymers and proteins near surfaces. The research is
highly interdisciplinary, involving ten Carnegie Mellon University faculty from
five departments and collaborations between university and industrial
researchers. Funding of this proposal will 1)accelerate and expand work on
Federally funded research already using scattering techniques, 2) introduce
modern scattering techniques into Federally funded research not now using such
measurements, 3) strengthen existing University-Industry collaborations, and 4)
expand the Pittsburgh area user and funding base for synchrotron x-ray
scattering measurements.
