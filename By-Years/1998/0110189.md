The cereal crops, such as maize, rice, wheat, sorghum, barley, millet, and oats,
account for the majority of world's nutrition. In addition to the cereal crops,
there are approximately 10,000 species of wild grasses, which cover about 1/5 of
the earth's land surface. Nearly all grasses are characterized by the spikelet,
a short branch that contains floral meristems. Floral meristems produce the
seeds that are harvested. The arrangement of these spikelets in different
grasses, and the branches on which they are borne, reflects differing fates of
the meristems produced during inflorescence development. Identifying the genes
that determine meristem fates and understanding the mechanism by which these
genes integrate their activities would be of immense value for developmental
biology, evolutionary biology, and applied genetics and breeding. Development of
maize as a model system assumes that information from maize should be applicable
to other cereals, and indeed to any other plant. Comparisons between maize and
the other cereals, and between maize and wild grasses, will test this basic
assumption of model system development. Inflorescence genes will be identified
that will serve as tools for three different disciplines: investigation of
meristem development, quantitative trait analysis, and comparative biology in
the grasses. Sequencing of expressed genes and expression profiling will be used
to identify a subset of genes that are expressed at the earliest stages of
development, and that correlate with the proliferation of specific meristem
types in selected mutants. The function of these genes will be determined
through genetics and mapping. Map positions of the inflorescence genes will
provide a link to quantitative traits, and to mutations in maize and other
grasses. A selected group of genes will be mutated by reverse genetics to
determine their function in inflorescence development. A subset of the genes
will also be studied in other cereals and wild grasses. Whether these genes have
been modified over evolutionary time and whether they function in other grasses
the same way as they do in maize will be determined. These comparisons will
provide a valuable data set for the study of evolution and diversity across 60
million years of grass evolution.
