Western New Mexico University will provide the opportunity for 40 elementary
school science teachers, grades K-6, from southwest New Mexico and southeast
Arizona to upgrade their backgrounds in the physical sciences. A four-week
workshop, which will include the areas of physics, chemistry, geology, and
astronomy, will be held during the summer of 1986. The teaching of science for
inquiry will be stressed, and emphasis will be placed on a number of methods of
teaching physical science that require investigative approaches by both student
and teacher. The program will be liberally scheduled with laboratory and
problem-solving activities and will provide time and support for independent
study under faculty guidance. The project director and instructor will provide
follow-up support in classroom implementation of the science curriculum, in the
development of a laboratory resource center, and the science in-service training
program at the schools.
