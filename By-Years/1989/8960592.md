While the vast computational requirements of numerical forecast models dictates
the use of relatively coarse resolution, there is still a need to provide a
forecast tailored to local areas. Currently, the forecasting of local weather
elements such as precipitation, surface temperature, winds, and so forth are
done by a statistical adaptation of a large-scale forecast model. The principal
investigator and his colleagues will develop a model that computes the physical
processes that locally modulate the large-scale meteorological fields. The
parameters of such a model need to be adjusted to the local conditions. In doing
this work, these scientists will employ the adjoint model technique, a tool of
optimal control theory, to do this adjustment, that is, to find the set of
parameters that minimize the local forecast errors. This research will allow the
development of models that can be tailored to the specific needs of users of
local forecasts such as utility industries, airports, agricultural entities,
etc. There are many other potential applications of the technique such as the
calibration of satellite observations of ground characteristics, and the
indirect measurement of quantities that are difficult to measure routinely in
situ such as soil moisture.
