With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at the University of California in Riverside will
acquire a high field (600 MHz) NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable
researchers to carry out studies on a) the effects of disulfide bonds on peptide
hormones; b) the dynamics of cis/trans isomerization of peptide bonds; c)
interactions of peptides with heparin; d) allosteric transitions of insulin; and
e) the structure of DNA pentaplexes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for
the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out
frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in
biochemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
