This is a request for travel funds to support students participating in the
2004 IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC04) to be held in the Paradise
Island, Bahamas, December 14 -17, 2004. The funds will be used for travel
support of students from US institutions, who will be presenting papers at the
conference. Intellectual Merit: The CDC is one of the world's largest and most
important conferences on control theory and applications, with over a thousand
participants and very high quality presentations. The CDC is an annual
conference, now in its 43rd year.

Broader Impact: This travel grant will enable students to participate in the
43rd CDC, present their papers and interact with more senior researchers and
other students. The CDC with its consistently high quality papers is an ideal
place for dissemination of research results. The CDC attracts well-known
researchers from around the world and it offers a unique opportunity to meet and
interact with them. It is anticipated that the opportunity, made possible by
this grant, for students to go to the CDC will encourage them to further pursue
high quality research and will have significant impact on both research and
education in the systems and control area, which spans several science and
engineering disciplines.
