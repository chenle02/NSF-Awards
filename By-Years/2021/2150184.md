This REU site will enable a diverse group of undergraduates to participate in
the production of original, interdisciplinary research on artificial
intelligence for computational creativity. It will help individual students
build critical computer science research capacity, communication and
professional skills, to increase their confidence and gain a greater
understanding of the research process. They will gain understanding of pathways
to graduate degrees and prepare for the application process. More generally,
this project will develop a multi-year pipeline of diverse student researchers,
helping to improve diversity in the fields of AI and visual computing. While
students may be new to AI research, creativity applications in this field can
help bridge the gap and get students excited about computer science by helping
them realize the intersection of their personal creative visions and AI
research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This site will bring together the well-
established network of Leadership Alliance minority-serving and undergraduate-
focused institutions with multiple AI research opportunities to produce cohorts
of diverse students highly-qualified for graduate degree programs. The research
projects encompass the AI disciplines of machine learning, reinforcement
learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics, plus
adjacent disciplines such as graphics and human-computer interaction. Areas of
interest include creative generative models, evaluating generated content, and
user experience design for creative AI. Students will be closely mentored by
faculty and graduate students in their research labs, and supported by
surrounding research groups and the resources provided by the Leadership
Alliance. They will receive technical training in AI and machine learning
fundamentals, including deep neural networks. They will be trained in reading,
writing, and presenting their work and will put these skills into practice at
research symposia and workshops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
