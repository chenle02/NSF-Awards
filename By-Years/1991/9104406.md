This is an award to support research on development of a methodology that can be
used for optimizing the freshwater inflows into bays and estuaries for
concurrent, possibly conflicting purposes. The objective is a mathematical model
that can be used to determine the appropriate balance between freshwater inflow
required to maintain desired levels of water quality in estuaries needed to
maintain their biological productivity and water needs for upland agricultural,
municipal and industrial purposes. The research to find a general optimization
model involves incorporation of a hydrodynamic salinity model with nonlinear
statistical regressions of biological productivity as measured by the fishery
harvest from the estuary, bay or ocean. This project, involving as it does water
quality considerations in estuaries at the ocean/land-surface drainage interface
is jointly supported by the Environmental and the Ocean Systems segments of the
Environmental and Ocean Systems Program. Results are expected to be useful for
engineering design and management of amounts and quality of water inflows into
bays and estuaries for meeting concurrent and possibly conflicting requirements
such as water supplies for agriculture, municipal and industrial needs and the
need to maintain the biological productivity of estuarine, bay and ocean waters.
