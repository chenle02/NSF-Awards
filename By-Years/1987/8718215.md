This project will investigate the role of texture (preferred grain orientation)
in a high Tc superconductor. Compounds of the RBa2Cu3O7-x type have highly
anisotropic superconducting response. High critical currents at significant
fields are likely only when both current and field are nearly parallel to the
basal plane of the orthorhombic structure. The properties of polycrystalline
aggregates show a strong dependence on texture, and texture evolution can be
controlled in wire and tape processing. This project will evaluate crystallite
orientation and morphology in synthesized YBa2Cu3O7-x powder, and will use the
results to make textured powder aggregates through P/M and deformation
processing. Wire and tape will be produced, and texture and superconducting
properties will be measured.
