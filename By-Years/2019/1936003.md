This proposal supports student travel to attend the Cryptographic Hardware and
Embedded Systems (CHES) conference, to be held in Atlanta in August 2019. CHES
is one of the leading international conferences on research on both design and
analysis of cryptographic hardware and software implementations. The conference
is a premier venue for new results from the research community as well as from
the industry. Participation in conferences such as CHES is an extremely
important part of graduate students' research and career development, providing
the opportunity for them to present their own work, attend panel and keynote
speech sessions, interact with peers and senior researchers, and exposure to
leading edge work in all aspects of cryptographic hardware and security in
embedded systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
