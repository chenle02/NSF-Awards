In supercritical polymerization processes, polymer chains grow to molecular
weights determined by their solubility under the prevailing density (or pressure
and temperature) conditions of the solvent. Further growth in the chain length
results in phase separation and leads to precipitation. In this project,
polymerizations will be conducted under isopycnic conditions by adjusting the
density of the solvent environment to be identical to the density of the polymer
formed. This iso- density operation is expected to insure levitation by buoyancy
and prevent precipitation of the phase-separated polymer. Density adjustments
are readily achievable for supercritical solvents through manipulation of either
the pressure of the temperature, of the solvent composition (if mixtures are
used), and isopycnic conditions for a variety of polymers and polymerization
systems are possible. This is a way to simulate the micro gravity environment of
space-based processes on earth. The objective of the research project is to make
polymeric materials of precise geometries and morphologies by synthesizing them
in a supercritical fluid of precisely the same density as the product polymer.
This would prevent precipitation of the polymer and permit polymerization of
molecules of any desired structure to be fabricated. The research will focus on
testing his hypothesis by synthesizing polystyrene and crystallizing
polyethylene in isopycnic supercritical fluid solvents. He will explore using
mixtures of fluids such as carbon dioxide or butane with fluids of higher
density such as xenon or sulfur hexafloride.
