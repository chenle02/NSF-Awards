The Department of Chemistry will purchase seven novel mobile data acquisition
chemistry workstations which will dramatically enhance all levels of
undergraduate education in Chemistry at Clark University. One such mobile
chemistry workstation has been built and fully tested in two courses in 1989.
The workstation was found to be exceptionally useful in "Introductory Chemistry"
and "Instrumental Analysis". Each of the workstations comprises state-of-the-art
computerized instructional equipment capable of sampling, storing, analyzing and
sumulating data acquired at speeds ranging from pico seconds up to hundreds of
seconds. Early introduction and comprehensive incorporation of the workstations
will expand the breadth and depth of the science major, and additionally
motivate non-science majors towards an understanding of comtemporary science and
technology. The wide range of speeds, user friendliness, mobility, and the
ability to interchange each of the workstations will allow utility in all of the
undergraduate laboratories, and facilitate demonstrations and software
presentation in lecture courses. In the classroom, the workstations will
demonstrate direct comparison of measured and predicted principles, as
exemplified by dynamic comparison of simulated weak acid equilibria with direct
ion selective electrode measurements. The workstations encourage highly
interactive experimental procedures. In the laboratory, mobile units will be
connected to a wide variety of equipment, ranging in complexity depending on the
particular course or undergraduate research project.
