Abstract&lt;br/&gt;F.S. Roberts, Rutgers University&lt;br/&gt;EIA Special
Projects Program&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF CISE and EU IST have in place a
Memorandum of Understanding to conduct a series of joint program planning
workshops in order to develop plans for a series of joint programs in CISE-
related areas between the US and the European Union. The EU IST has designated
ERCIM as the coordinator of nine planning workshops to be held in Europe over
the three year period starting in 2001. NSF will support a travel grant program
through DIMACS as requested in this proposal to cover costs of the US delegation
to these international program planning workshops, beginning with the Bionics
workshop in Brussels on June 18, 2001. &lt;br/&gt;
