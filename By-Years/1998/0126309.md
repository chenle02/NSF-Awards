Detachment faults are large-scale extensional structures that are responsible
for much of the extension observed in the crust, however the origin and
evolution of detachments are poorly understood and controversial. This project
will attempt to address the mechanisms and rates of detachment and associated
basin development in an active modern example - the Cordillera Blanca detachment
fault in the Peruvian Andes. The work centers on the temporal and spatial
evolution of the supradetachment basin, the denudation history of the uplifted
footwall, and the Quaternary kinematic history. Results will be incorporated
into tectonic models for detachment faulting in oceanic-continental convergent
settings, which are expected to be of general application in this tectonic
setting.
