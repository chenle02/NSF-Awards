SoAR: AI in Electric Power Systems: A Survey of the Japanese Industry This
State-of-the-Art survey award will send Professor Saifur Rahman, of the Energy
System Research Laboratory of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State
University, to Japan to survey applications of artificial intelligence (AI) to
electric power systems. Professor Rahman has been commissioned by the Electric
Power Research Institute (EPRI) to survey the current level and future potential
of use of expert systems at U.S. electric utilities. This survey will add a
comparison of the experience of Japanese researchers, who are known to have made
significant advances in applying expert systems and other AI technology to power
systems, but who have not published widely in the English- language literature.
