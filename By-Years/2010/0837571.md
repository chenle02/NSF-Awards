INTERDISCIPLINARY (99)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project uses the watershed as a
means to instill an interest in the preservation and conservation of freshwater
resources and encourage environmental stewardship in non-major and pre-major
undergraduate students. The project empowers students with the tools, knowledge
and motivation to become citizen-scientists. An interdisciplinary approach is
used that integrates the natural and social science of watersheds to develop a
curriculum that is both rigorous and accessible to students across a wide range
of majors and disciplines. Tandem courses in Watershed Ecology and Watershed
Citizenship are developed that integrate service learning and undergraduate
research in the local watershed. Specifically, the project uses DNA barcoding of
aquatic macroinvertebrates and incorporates a cyber community-building tool,
WikiWatershedTM, to integrate students into the larger watershed community. The
focus on watershed science and social science assures relevance of this material
in any location. This project produces easily replicable and transferable
curricular material for broader implementation that can be modified to adapt to
any watershed address.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
