The purpose of this project is to examine long-distance virus movement in plants
in order to obtain a better understanding of plant virus resistance. In the past
few years, virus movement studies have centered around the role of virus-encoded
factors in cell to cell movement. This proposal focusses on host factors which
are involved in cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) movement in Arabidopsis plants.
New techniques that will be used to follow virus movement include a whole plant
in situ hybridization procedure and virus transactivation of a resident reporter
gene. These techniques will be used to examine different Arabidopsis ecotypes
and screen for Arabidopsis mutants with resistance to virus infection and
variation in patterns of long distance virus movement. Genes encoding movement
traits will be cloned using map- based cloning or deletion subtraction
hybridization. Insight into mechanisms involved in the movement of viruses in
plants will suggest mechanisms for preventing such movement and thereby creating
a virus resistant plant.***//
