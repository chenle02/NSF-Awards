The Scholarships Creating Opportunities for Applying Mathematics (S-COAM)
project at Indiana University of Pennsylvania establishes supportive connections
between Master's students and undergraduates through various cohort activities,
while increasing numbers of students pursuing mathematics degrees, improving
retention, and enhancing recruitment from regional community colleges.
Scholarships support ten students seeking the Master's of Science degree in
Applied Mathematics, and 18 undergraduates seeking a major in a mathematical
area or minor in mathematics with another science-related major; at least 49
students are supported over three years. Effectiveness is assessed by student
surveys and an outside evaluator.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The highlights of S-COAM
include the formation of a supportive cohort of students focused on applied
mathematics, mentoring and leadership opportunities for participating Master's
students and undergraduates, expectations of students doing research or
internships and attendance of STEM-related presentations by visiting scholars.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;S-COAM expands career options of women, minorities, first-
generation, economically disadvantaged, rural, and others by providing support
to pursue advanced mathematics coursework and providing workforce-ready
graduates trained on industry standard software. S-COAM builds university and
student connections in the region through internship and job placement with
local businesses as well recruitment visits to and research presentations at
local educational institutions.
