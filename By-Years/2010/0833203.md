The complexity of modern high-end computers has made it exceedingly difficult
for scientific applications to effectively manage resources such as extreme-
scale parallelism, single-chip multi-processors, and deep hierarchy of
shared/distributed caches and memories. In particular, as machines and
applications have both evolved to become complex and massively parallel,
compilers have failed to automatically bridge the gap between complex software
and diverse hardware platforms. Optimization models for parallel computing have
lagged far behind those for serial applications, and conventional compilers are
increasingly unable to accommodate emerging high-end architectures.

This research develops a new optimization model that allows 1) developers to
effectively interact with advanced optimizing compilers to provide both domain-
specific knowledge and high-level optimization strategies (e.g., directions to
enable new or choose amongst differing parallelization strategies); 2)
computational specialists to easily define arbitrary domain-specific
transformations to directly control performance optimizations to their code; 3)
architecture-sensitive optimizations to be easily parameterized and empirically
tuned to achieve portable high performance. The optimization model is supported
with an integrated environment that contains two main components: ROSE, a
C/C++/Fortran2003 source-to-source optimizing compiler developed at DOE/LLNL;
and POET, a transformation language together with an empirical optimization
engine developed at UTSA. This framework permits different levels of automation
and programmer intervention, from fully-automated tuning to semi-automated
development to fully programmable control. The research targets both the
optimization needs of computational kernels and the more general requirements of
whole program optimizations. The framework is integrated as an external
development mechanism for the widely-adopted ATLAS library and is connected with
empirical tuning research under DOE SciDAC program to improve the efficiency of
large-scale scientific applications.
