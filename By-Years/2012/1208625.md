The aim of this project is to establish original results and open new research
directions in stochastic analysis. A first objective is to derive new central
limit theorems applying techniques of Malliavin calculus in a variety of
settings including additive functionals of the fractional Brownian motion,
spacial moments of the Brownian local time increments, winding number of the
complex fractional Brownian motion, and diffusion approximations in a space-time
Gaussian velocity field. Rates of convergence of the Kolmogorov and related
distances, and convergence of probability densities will be also investigated in
these problems. A second objective of the project is to study stochastic partial
differential equations driven by a Gaussian noise which is white in time and it
has the covariance of a fractional Brownian motion in the space variable. The
existence and uniqueness of a solution, the regularity of its trajectories and
its probability distribution, and Feynman-Kac formulas for the moments, are
concrete goals of the project. The project also aims to establish the rate of
convergence of Euler-type numerical approximation schemes for stochastic
differential equations driven by a fractional Brownian motion using techniques
of fractional calculus and variational properties of the fractional Brownian
motion.

Stochastic analysis provides suitable mathematical tools to study ordinary and
partial differential equations perturbed by a random noise, which are useful
models in many areas of physics, telecommunications and economics. The
application of these equations requires efficient numerical approximation
schemes, and convenient estimates for the probability distribution of the
solution. This project will make a significant progress in these topics by
developing powerful mathematical techniques like the Malliavin calculus. On the
other hand, the project will broaden the range of applications of Malliavin
calculus, establishing new fundamental asymptotic results in probability and
statistics. Motivated by applications in telecommunications and mathematical
finance, the project will focus on input noises possessing long memory property
such as the fractional Brownian motion.
