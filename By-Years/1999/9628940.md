Lowe, Celia Yale University Bajau peoples of the Togian Islands, Sulawesi,
Indonesia are dependent upon marine resources for subsistence livelihoods.
Management of such resources are based on the need for their utilization in
livelihood. This research will document the convergence on Togian marine
environments of extra-local forces for change and the impingement of these
forces on local marine resource use. It will also explore dual processes of
Bajau identity construction within these fields of shifting power relations and
the effects of the relations on the biophysical spaces of marine environments.
Extra local development plans typically overlay diverse local traditions
including the regulation of marine resource space by coastal zone dwellers. The
research, through ethnographic and archival field work, will explore the ways
competing visions of spatial usage become reflected in biophysical environments
and the implications of Bajau experiences with state and conservation programs
for their use of sea products. The research will produce additional information
on the social construction of nature and will contribute to knowledge concerning
the state and conservation practice as reflected by local peoples survival on
the margins of centralized state power.
