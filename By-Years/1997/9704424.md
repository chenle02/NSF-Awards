9704424 Lawson This award is to provide partial support for a week long
conference in gauge theory and low dimensional topology at Tulane University in
the fall semester of 1997. The conference will be held in conjunction with the
annual Clifford Lectures, given this year by Peter Kronheimer. Gauge theory has
been the source of dramatic advances in low dimensional topology in recent
years, and the work of Kronheimer and Tomasz Mrowka has been fundamental,
particularly their settling of the Thom conjecture. A dozen other significant
contributors to this area will give major talks, and additional shorter talks
will round out the program. Despite the fact that we live in a universe of three
spatial dimensions and one time dimension and have available all the intuition
that this experience provides us, three and four dimensional objects have
remained remarkably resistant to full understanding. In fact, mathematicians
have found that in some respects higher dimensional spaces are more tractable,
whereas some of the analytic tools available in higher dimensions cannot be used
in dimensions three and four. This means that other methods that will apply in
these so-called low dimensions are at a premium and is what makes so important
the gauge theoretic methods first introduced by Simon Donaldson and more
recently strikingly simplified by Nathan Seiberg and Edward Witten. ***
