In this project supported under the Optical Science and Engineering initiative
in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Peter Rentzepis of the
University of California at Irvine will use picosecond laser based x-ray and
electron sources to probe the structures of transients in the liquid and solid
phases. Specific problems to be addressed include the mechanism of lattice
distortion in metals and semiconductors and studies of energy transfer from hot
electrons to the lattice. Time resolved electron diffraction of gas phase
species will be used to investigate photodissociation and isomerization
processes. These studies will make it possible to identify structures of
ultrafast intermediates and metastable ground state species by directly
observing bond and angle changes. These techniques will have application in
areas such as protein and enzyme kinetics, molecular electronic devices, and the
physics of thermal transport in crystal lattices. X-ray and electron diffraction
studies have provided a wealth of information concerning molecular structure.
Professor Rentzepis will use ultrafast x-ray and electron pulses to probe, in
real time, the structural changes caused by optical excitation. Basic phenomena
such as melting, crystallization, heat transport, and the transient structures
involved in primary events in chemical and biological systems will be studied by
means of this new technique.
