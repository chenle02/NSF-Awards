Absolute and essential instabilities in spatially extended systems

Abstract

0203301 Scheel

This project explores several instability mechanisms of coherent states, such
as fronts, pulses and spiral waves, that occur in spatially extended systems far
from equilibrium. The common theme of these mechanisms is that they involve
transport phenomena caused by diffusion and nonlinearities. Examples of such
transitions are backfiring instabilities of fronts, period-doubling bifurcations
of spiral waves, and the effect of inhomogeneities on the dynamics of spiral
waves. While transport is most conveniently modeled and described using an
idealized unbounded domain, boundaries may well enhance or inhibit the
instability through partial reflection or generation of waves. It is the aim of
this project to develop techniques that can help to investigate instability
mechanisms simultaneously on bounded and unbounded domains. One of the expected
outcomes will be a description of instability mechanisms that is robust with
respect to typical boundary conditions in large reactors. Technically, our
approach is based on methods from spatial dynamics that allow us to derive sharp
pointwise estimates which capture explicitly the effects of boundaries.

Complicated spatio-temporal patterns that arise due to the interplay of chemical
reactions and diffusion have been observed experimentally in a number of
specific reactions (among them the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction and the
chlorite-iodide-malonic acid reaction). Similar phenomena have been observed
during fibrillation of cardiac tissue where spiral waves act as organizing
centers for the complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Other examples where irregular
patterns occur are the interaction of pulses in oscillatory media, backfiring of
excitation pulses in catalytic reactions, and optical bistability in nonlinear
photonic gratings. The focus of this project is to analyze some of these
instability mechanisms by analytical means. This will not only further our
understanding of pattern formation in chemical and biological systems, but will
eventually allow for a systematic control of patterns, for instance, in the
catalytic oxidation of carbon-monoxide and in the propagation of calcium waves
in intracellular tissue.
