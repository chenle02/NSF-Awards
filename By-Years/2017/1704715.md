The project implements methods to improve the resource-efficiency of numerical
computations on a variety of computing machines, ranging from supercomputers to
mobile devices, by adaptively reducing data-precision based on the needs of the
application. Efficiently adapting data-precision permits these machines to run
larger computations and also improves the overall performance (including energy
consumption) made possible by a combination of reduced computational burden as
well as reduced data movement. The intellectual merits of this project are to
research and develop the key steps to understand the nature of applications and
computing systems, and to suitably minimize computing demands through targeted
data-precision adjustment. Broader impacts of the work include training graduate
students and releasing tools that the community can employ in future hardware
and software product, to help minimize overall energy consumption and improve
performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unused precision in floating-point
computations ends up wasting allocated space in caches, and also causes
unnecessary data movement. The technical parts of the project are to identify as
well as pursue opportunities for optimally allocating precision, and to
efficiently implement such allocation methods in actual codes. In addition to
developing new algorithms to tune precision assisted by automated learning
methods, the project develops symbolic analysis methods to serve novel roles in
floating-point instruction selection and optimization in the form of
superoptimizers. These tools will be released to a community of researchers
interested in working toward exascale computing, and deploying applications in
safety-critical devices. This work represents a synergistic combination of the
investigator's skills ranging through high performance computing, formal
methods, and compiler technologies.
