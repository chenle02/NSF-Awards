9509270 D'Arcy The Bignoniaceae family of flowering plants are mostly tropical
vines, shrubs, and trees, known to temperate-zone botanists from such species as
trumpet-creeper and several ornamentals. There are an estimated 900 species,
nearly 800 of which occur in the American tropics. The foremost student of the
Bignoniaceae was the widely traveled botanist Dr. Al Gentry, who died in an
airplane accident two years ago while on botanical reconnaissance in South
America. He left at his home institution, the Missouri Botanical Garden, a
wealth of unpublished information on these plants as well as the major
collection of herbarium specimens documenting the geographical distributions of
all the known species. His colleague Dr. William D'Arcy is now leading a small
group of specialists, soon to be joined by a postdoctoral associate specializing
on these plants, to finish the taxonomic revisionary work that was underway
during Gentry's lifetime. Work to be done includes computer databasing of the
several thousands of species identifications completed by Dr. Gentry, for
specimens from the American tropics, which in turn provides the foundation for
all regional plant inventories. Identification keys, illustrations of detailed
botanical parts, descriptions for new species, and comprehensive taxonomic
treatments for several neotropical genera are also scheduled, as core activities
for a newly trained specialist on the Bignoniaceae.
