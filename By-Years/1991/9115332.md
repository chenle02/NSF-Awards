This proposal is a request for travel assistance for about 30 U.S. academic
participants in the Conference. Travel and associated conference expenses have
been estimated at $2,400 per U.S. attendee. Under this great thirty assistance
awards in the amount of $1,000 each would be made to each participating
academic. The primary aim of the conference on adsorption is to allow scientists
and engineers from many countries to present their most recent research
findings. Adsorption is a broad field and this conference will present
participants with the opportunity for informal interaction. Moreover, it will
permit U.S. participants to get a better view of Japanese activity. It is
expected that new course materials at the graduate and undergraduate levels will
result from conference participation.
