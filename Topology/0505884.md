The goal of this project is to develop new topological invariants in the
framework of Floer homology. A major part of the project is to develop "embedded
contact homology", a new invariant of contact three-manifolds which counts
embedded pseudoholomorphic curves in the four-dimensional symplectization of the
three-manifold. Embedded contact homology is conjecturally isomorphic to a
version of the Seiberg-Witten or Ozsvath-Szabo Floer homologies. It provides a
bridge between the topology of smooth manifolds in three and four dimensions,
and the geometry and dynamics of holomorphic curves and contact structures.
Another part of the project is to construct Floer-theoretic invariants of
families of equivalent objects for different versions of Floer theory, thus
obtaining homotopy invariants of families of three-manifolds,
symplectomorphisms, Legendrian knots, and other types of objects for which Floer
theory can be defined.

This project fits into the broad theme of developing tools to understand the
possible global shapes of three- and four-dimensional spaces, such as the
universe that we live in. The tools used here to understand the shape of a space
involve counting interesting geometric objects inside the space. An important
class of such objects are pseudoholomorphic curves, which are surfaces
resembling soap films. By counting the number of such surfaces that exist in a
space, one can gain deep information about the global structure of the space.
