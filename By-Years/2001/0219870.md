Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;0219870&lt;br/&gt;PI: Morris Chang&lt;br/&gt;Iowa
State&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The thesis of this project is very simple: the
performance of garbage collection is critical to the successful deployment of
distributed Java embedded systems. Applications for such systems have different
operating requirements than applications written for desktop or server
environments. They include frequent software update, low power consumption, low
resource availability, distributed computing capability, and real-time operating
constraints. Therefore, garbage collectors for such devices must be designed to
support those requirements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Garbage Collection (GC), or
automatic dynamic memory management, is one of the many attractive features
available in Java. It allows programmer to be more productive and software to be
more robust. On the other hand, it is also notorious for being intrusive and
consuming large amount of power due to frequent memory accesses. As a result,
the garbage collection can severely degrade the performance and affect the
viability of Java embedded devices. &lt;br/&gt;
