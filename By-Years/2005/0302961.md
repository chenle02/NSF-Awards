Wolbachia are inherited bacterial parasites of a large number of invertebrates.
There has been an upsurge in research interest in these organisms in recent
years because of their newly appreciated wide host range together with the array
of newly discovered effects they have on the hosts they infect. These include
inducing developmental defects such as cytoplasmic incompatibility in young
embryos, overriding chromosomal sex-determination, inducing parthenogenesis and
even selectively killing male hosts. This proposal plans to provide a research
infrastructure to support this newly established and rapidly growing field of
scientific research. This will be done through the establishment of an internet-
based research resource for Wolbachia workers. This web site will collect and
distribute data and resources for the international community of scientists
working with this system. In addition this proposal will help to fund a series
of scientific meetings aimed at bringing established workers in this field
together with new investigators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project will help to
provide an important infrastructure to this emerging research area. It will
allow for the global dissemination of data and resources as well as provide a
forum for scientists worldwide to meet and exchange data. This infrastructure
will promote the rapid development of this young and emerging area of biological
research.&lt;br/&gt;
