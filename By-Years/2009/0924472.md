Dr. Shalini Shankar, of Northwestern University, will investigate how the many
contemporary public meanings of race and ethnicity in the United States today
may be affected by the mirco-level processes through which advertising is
developed and produced. She will focus particularly on images of Asian Americans
created by first and second generation Asian immigrants employed in these
agencies, who must reformulate the numerous Asian and Pacific Island
nationalities encompassed by the term "Asian" to reflect its ethnic, national,
religious, and linguistic diversity, while also making "Asian American" a
relevant marketing category for commercial circulation and
consumption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researcher will employ a mix of social
science methodologies, including participant observation, discourse analysis,
and interviews, to collect data in three New York City agencies. She also will
use archival resources to analyze historical and current campaigns featuring
Asian Americans. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is significant because it
will further understandings of the processes by which racial and ethnic meanings
are actively negotiated from census and market research, produced for commercial
purposes, and circulated in a variety of media. In this way, the research offers
an ethnographic and sociolinguistic complement to more common textual analyses
of racist advertisements. The project will chronicle the emergence and
interworkings of the Asian American segment of the advertising industry, and use
these findings to extend studies of globalization, diaspora, and new immigration
to the United States.
