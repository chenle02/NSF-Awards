The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve
patient care, decrease patient discomfort and infection, decrease user
discomfort, and decrease prevalence of disease within a given population due to
early detection. Adoption of this technology would provide broader implications
for both administrative and financial operational goals. Further, using this
technology would reduce resources used within diagnostic imaging and help reduce
preparation time for pelvic MRI procedures and this cannot be over emphasized.
Decreased time translates to increased throughput by increasing available
imaging slots for additional MR examinations and leading to higher revenue
capture.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will explore the commercial
potential for a novel technology to deliver positive contrast. This would be a
beneficial introduction to the field of diagnostic imaging. The device would be
able to increase the diagnostic ability of staging examinations (increased
sensitivity and accuracy) for detection of primary and/or metastatic pelvic
tumors. This project will lead to a better understanding of current practices
and see how this product can be incorporated to enhance clinical
operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
