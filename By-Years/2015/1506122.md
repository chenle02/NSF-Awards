This project investigates the speculative possibility of storing energy in
turbulent fluid eddies, and then suddenly releasing this energy. When gas is
compressed, its temperature increases. However, the increase in temperature
might be less if there are other degrees of freedom that absorb the energy.
Suppose, for example, that the gas energy resides mainly in whirling eddies,
rather than in completely random motion. We ask the question whether there are
conditions under which compression of the gas might increase this eddy energy.
The significance of this question is that energy in eddies acts differently than
random energy because neighboring molecules tend to move in the same direction.
That means that there would be fewer times that gas molecules would make high-
impact head-on collisions. Important processes such as nuclear fusion depend on
this relative motion, so the fusion reactions would be fewer in gases where the
energy resides in whirling eddies rather than in random thermal motion. If this
were true, then one might also speculate that the effect could be used
advantageously in controlling nuclear fusion in a highly compressed plasma.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates the possibility of storing and
then suddenly releasing the energy that can be deposited into turbulent fluid
eddies in a plasma. It is conjectured that, under compression on a time scale in
which viscosity may be neglected, the energy in such eddies might increase.
Also, if the energy resides in hydrodynamic eddies rather than ion temperature,
it means that it is unavailable to electrons through collisions. Thus, this
energy cannot be easily captured by electrons and radiated. If the compression
increases eddy energy more than the random energy, a new paradigm for storing
energy in a highly compressed plasma might be advanced in which the energy
content is increased under compression in a non-radiating plasma, and then
suddenly released under viscous dissipation. To test these speculations,
particle-in-cell simulations will be performed to describe compressing turbulent
eddies, with guidance obtained from Z-pinch experiments that already appear to
exhibit certain features of a turbulent inviscid plasma. This work will involve
a collaboration between Princeton University and the Weizmann Institute of
Science in Israel, and will be performed under the umbrella of the Memorandum of
Understanding on Research Cooperation between NSF and the US-Israel Binational
Science Foundation. This project is co-sponsored by the NSF's Physics Division
and the Office of International Science and Engineering.
