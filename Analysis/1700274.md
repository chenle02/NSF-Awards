The main theme of this research program is to develop minimizing techniques in
the geometric theory of functions and in the theory of elasticity. These two
theories are related through challenging problems in the calculus of variations
and nonlinear partial differential equations. They both rely on geometric
intuition and an in-depth analysis of energy minimizing deformations of material
bodies or, more mathematically, higher dimensional curved surfaces. In the
search for mathematical models of hyperelasticity, one must accept and explore
the limits of elastic deformations. This approach turns out to be particularly
effective in the two-dimensional theory of flat plates and thin films.
Theoretical prediction of failures of bodies caused by cracks and fractions is a
good motivation that should appeal to both pure mathematicians and researchers
in applied fields. Experimental answers to practical problems will lead to
solutions or deeper insights into mathematical problems investigated in this
project; for example, the existence and uniqueness of deformations of smallest
average distortion.

The research originated from the Riemann Mapping Theorem; conformal mappings
being univalent solutions of the Cauchy-Riemann system. Moving to the second
order variational equations and their homeomorphic solutions offers new
challenges. The goal is to characterize energy-functionals whose minimizers
exist and closely follow conformal maps. It is a common struggle in mathematical
models of nonlinear elasticity to establish the existence of energy-minimal
deformations which comply with the principle of no interpenetration of matter.
To build a viable theory the PI will adopt monotone Sobolev mappings as
legitimate deformations in 2-dimensional elasticity. Minimizing among Sobolev
homeomorphisms the basic questions such as existence, uniqueness and regularity
of energy-minimal mappings become challenging problems. Building new tools to
solve such problems is the central part of this project.
