This project aims to serve the national interest by improving student
persistence and commitment to the profession of engineering by implementing a
person-centered, data-informed approach to proactive advising. The proactive
advising curriculum will help students take advantage of, internalize, and
optimize the ever-increasing array of resources, co-curricular activities, and
support services that are available. The approach is individualized using data
analytics to match formal and informal learning opportunities to the unique
strengths, needs, and goals of each student. In addition to addressing the
immediate challenge of persistence, the approach offers a rare and potentially
revolutionary opportunity for harnessing the potential of big data for
understanding, documenting, and informing personalized learning for all
students, including students from groups underrepresented engineering, which is
recognized as one of the grand challenges of engineering.

This project will develop a proactive advising approach grounded in an evidence-
based conceptual framework and explicit equity focus. The proactive advising
curriculum builds on evidence-based personas and individually optimized
programmatic supports. The personas will result from a first-of-its-kind
multidimensional data integration model. Specially trained peer and professional
advisors will use the evidence-based personas, constructed by integrating new
forms of person-centered motivational data, as part of the collaborative
decision-making process to optimize resources and support in a manner consistent
with the studentâ€™s strengths and for building efficacy and agency. The NSF IUSE:
EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the
effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student
Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and
implementation of promising practices and tools.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
