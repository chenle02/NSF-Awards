This program is a companion project to OCE-9302182 (R. Peterson, SIO, PI). The
objective of the joint project is to perform a pilot experiment for the Fast
Hydrographic Profiler (FHP). The FHP is an autonomous, prototypical high-speed
vehicle to make full-depth CTD profiles developed by A. Bradley at WHOI. Because
a full-depth CTD cast with the FHP can be done in just 40 minutes, the FHP is a
very attractive instrument for further minimize the cost of the field programs.
The aim of the pilot experiment is to run the FHP through a pair of thorough sea
trials, during the ongoing CalCOFI (california Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries
Investigations) program. Funds were granted to prepare the FHP and its support
gear, adapt the gear to the ship that does the CalCOFI survey work and joint two
separate eight day cruises in the later half of 1993.
