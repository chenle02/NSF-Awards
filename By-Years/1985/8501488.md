The application of VLSI technology to communication systems has played a key
role in reducing the cost of many types of systems in use today and will play an
increasingly important role in the future. This research is directed at
exploring new ways to use silicon integrated circuit technology to improve the
performance and reduce the cost of communication systems of various kinds. A
broad program aimed at more closely approaching the limits to the frequency and
dynamic range in metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) integrated circuits is
suggested. In this endeavor, the following research problems are included: high-
frequency switched-capacitor filters, high frequency continuous-time filtering
techniques, generation of arbitrary nonlinear functions for communications, MOS
signal conditioning and sensing circuits, temperature compensated crystal
oscillators and broadband MOS analog circuit design applications. The research
requires the extensive use of the newly renovated and expanded microelectronics
fabrication facilities for the purpose of fabricating experimental integrated
circuits.
