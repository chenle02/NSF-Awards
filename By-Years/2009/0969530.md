The main long term goal of this project is to develop theoretical and
computational tools that will allow researchers to predict behavior of atomic
and molecular systems or explain the results of experiments on atoms and
molecules. Because the difficulty in calculating the behavior of these objects
grows exponentially with the number of particles, even a small increase in the
number of objects can have a huge impact on the effort needed. The main focus of
this project is on systems where two or more electrons can simultaneously escape
the atom/molecule, or where highly excited atoms are exposed to strong fields.
These systems can exhibit highly correlated motion which is difficult to
understand without new theoretical or computational
techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this project is that it
advances the base of knowledge in atomic physics and provides an environment
where undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers learn the
art of scientific research. Young researchers from underrepresented groups are
actively encouraged to join this project and they have had good training during
previous projects. The results of the research projects are published in peer
reviewed journals and presented at divisional meetings, topical workshops, and
colloquia, and they can have impact on other scientists.
