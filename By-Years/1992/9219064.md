The eastern Mediterranean ophiolites form discontinuous linear belts of oceanic
fragments immediately north of the Bitlis-Zagros suture, which marks a
congenital collision zone in the Alpine-Himalayan orogenic belt. The
paleogeography and timing of this ocean closure however is very complex and
poorly understood. This project will study the Alihoca ohiolite which occupies a
key position between the relatively undeformed and stratigraphically complete
ophiolites to the south (Troodos) and deformed and fragmented complexes to the
north. It is juxtaposed against a continental fragment of Afro-Arabia affinity
and intruded by island-arc rocks, thus potentially preserving evidence of
subduction and collision zone tectonics. The main thrust of the work is field
mapping, structural analysis followed by petrologic and geochronologic studies.
Results will test current models for the evolution of the eastern Mediterranean
during the Mesozoic.
