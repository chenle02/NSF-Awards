This research program considers the spatial variation and correlation of strong
earthquake ground motion. It is common in earthquake engineering to focus on the
time history of ground acceleration at a given location. However, the spatial
variation of ground motion is potentially just as important as the time
variation, and is the focus of this study. This research program includes
analytical modeling of ground motions, and statistical analysis of closely
spaced accelerograms, principally from strong motion instrument arrays, and
especially the accelerograms recorded during the September 19, 1985 earthquake.
It also involves a study of patterns of building damage and variations in local
geology, all to obtain insight into the spatial variation of strong ground
motion.
