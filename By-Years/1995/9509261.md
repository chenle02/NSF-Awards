9509261 Smith The project aims at establishing a direct tie between regional
climatic and lake histories by linking the paleolimnological record of the lake
fluctuations, melt water and microfauna and flora. It will extend the
paleoclimatic record, especially the annual variability record back to Younger
Drayas. Oxygen isotope measurements on ostracode valves, and faunal studies will
establish a temporal framework. AMS dates will provide absolute chronology.
Synthetic seismograms of core sediments will link them to seismic records.
Physical properties measurements and pollen studies will tie the history of lake
levels to climatic history. A coring, side-scan and seismic profiling cruise is
planned in mid 1995 in Lakes Michigan and Huron. ***
