The PI will investigate a variety of projects on the borderline of probability
theory and statistical mechanics. A common feature of these is their focus on
overcoming the technical obstacles that have insofar held progress to the
mathematical understanding of the underlying physical phenomena. The first set
of specific problems studies the role of spectral characteristics of random
lattice Laplacians in the derivation of scaling limits of random walks in
disordered media. The second project investigates the effects of introducing
non-attractive potentials on the statics and dynamics of random gradient fields.
The third project focuses on developing a detailed approach to localization of
random walks in a random potential landscape based on eigenvalue extreme order
statistics for lattice Anderson Hamiltonians. The fourth project utilizes new
ideas to control the rigidity of interfaces in statistical mechanical models.
The final project outlines a new approach based on exchangeability to quantify
the effects of a singular interaction on the time evolution of a large system of
interacting quantum indistinguishable particles.

The project will impact our understanding of various systems of practical
interest where the analytic techniques of homogenization theory, spectral
analysis, differential equations as well as probabilistic methods, e.g.,
stochastic analysis, extreme order statistics and theory of disordered systems,
etc., play an important role. A number of projects are devised to facilitate
training, and inclusion in research, of postdocs and graduate students who have
interest in Probability Theory and Mathematical Physics.
