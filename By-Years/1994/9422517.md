The focus of this research is the use of Fischer carbene complexes for the
synthesis of natural products. The reactions of monoynes, diynes and triynes
with carbene complexes will be studied with target molecules including
triquinanes, steroids, biaryls and trimeric quinones. Studies aimed at
elucidating the mechanism of the benzannulation reaction of carbene complexes
with alkynes will also be carried out. With this award, the Synthetic Organic
Program is supporting the research of Dr. William D. Wulff of the Department of
chemistry at the University of Chicago. Professor Wulff will focus his work on
increasing the synthetic utility of the reactions of Fischer carbene complexes
with acetylenes. The methodology will be put to use in preparing biologically
important natural products.
