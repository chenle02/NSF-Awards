9618641 Bond This project will test preliminary findings of millennial
(1500-year) cycles in North Atlantic surface circulation during the Holocene.
The PIs will analyze existing sediment cores and collect new ones from a wide
area of the North Atlantic, focusing on sites with very high sedimentation rate.
Analyses will include concentrations of planktic foraminifera as well as
alkenone analyses on bulk sediment. If preliminary findings are confirmed, it
may be possible to predict future natural climate variability, at least on
millennial timescales, in the region.
