Dr. Ronald Kettner will study two basic questions: 1) how dofrontal cortical
areas control rapid arm movements to a sequenceof targets in space; and 2) how
are these sequences stored inshort.term memory during a delay period before
movementinitiation? His basic approach will be to record from singleneurons in
the frontal cortex of well.trained rhesus monkeysperforming a simple arm
movement task. The data he collectsalong with previously collected data will
allow Dr. Kettner todevelop and test mathematical models of frontal
corticalfunction. This work is important because it will give us abetter and
more detailed understanding of how arm movements aregenerated from cortical
initiation.
