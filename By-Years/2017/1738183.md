The Colorado Education Initiative (CEI), in collaboration with McREL
International (McREL), proposes a project -- the Computer Science Colorado
Learning and Identity Collaborative (CS-CLIC) -- to work with educators at eight
high schools located throughout Colorado on understanding the importance of
engaging a diverse audience of students in Advanced Placement Computer Science
Principles (APCSP), understanding and using strategies to do so, and improving
their use of evidence-based practices for effective student learning in the
classroom. CS-CLIC's professional development will dramatically increase
equitable access to rigorous computer science (CS) coursework, increasing number
and diversity of students who see CS as relevant, possible, and important to
them, enroll in APCSP, and earn qualifying scores on the APCSP
exam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CS-CLIC will employ an iterative Networked
Improvement Community (NIC) structure to co-design and refine professional
development (PD) and targeted recruiting materials focused on the problem of
practice: Students, and, particularly historically underrepresented students, do
not perceive rigorous CS coursework as important, possible, or relevant to their
lives. Working together with classroom teachers, CS-CLIC researchers will
develop, implement, and test strategies to improve recruitment and retention
based on the Identity-Based Motivation model, building on an existing Colorado
Legacy School effort that attracts historically underrepresented students into
AP courses in other STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
