Abstract for proposal EAR0106537 (PH #57x)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Local and
teleseismic studies of Hawaiian earthquakes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI's: Cecily
Wolfe, Univ Hawaii&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earthquakes in Hawaii are abundant, and
provide key information on the nature of magmatic and tectonic processes at this
oceanic hotspot. There are shallow crustal earthquakes associated with magma
intrusions and eruptions, earthquakes in the middle-to-upper lithospheric mantle
suggested to reflect magma migration, earthquakes that relieve stresses due to
volcano growth and volcano spreading. In addition, there are enigmatic crustal
and mantle earthquakes that may be due to a variety of factors, including
inherited zones of structural weakness, stresses due to volcano loading and
lithospheric flexure, magma movement, and thermal cooling stresses. This project
will conduct two studies: 1) waveform modeling of teleseismically-recorded
earthquakes (Mw &gt; 4.5) in order to constrain earthquake mechanisms and
moments throughout Hawaii, including in many regions where the United States
Geological Observatory Hawaii Volcano Observatory seismic network geometry is
insufficient to provide a first-motion mechanism; and 2) the relocation of
locally-recorded seismicity for specific targets using high-precision
techniques. The combination of teleseismic waveform modeling to yield accurate
mechanism solutions and high precision relocations to yield accurate hypocenters
promise to improve our view of the seismotectonics of the Hawaiian Islands and
will aid in the evaluation of earthquake hazards.&lt;br/&gt;
