9733030 Brenner This work is supported by a National Science Foundation Faculty
Early Career Development Award. The research component will focus on an array of
problems applying techniques of nonlinear dynamics to fluid dynamics, acoustics,
and biophysics. The uniting theme is the mathematics of nonlinear partial
differential equations. Specific projects include the breaking of fluid drops as
an example of singularity formation in partial differential equations; the
dynamical mechanisms behind electrosprays; a theoretical investigation of single
bubble sonoluminescence, the conversion of acoustic energy into light; and a
study of experiments in bacterial chemotaxis, done in collaboration with
biologists. The educational component of this activity aims both to improve the
learning environment in applied mathematics at MIT, as well as provide concrete
mechanisms for using teaching opportunities to extend the principal
investigator's research program to new areas. These are several specific points:
There will be an initiative to involve undergraduate students in the research
program by carrying out simple experiments to test theories and extend research
directions. To identify and train undergraduate students for this research, it
is proposed to develop a short course during the Independent Activities Period
on the application of mathematics to physical experiments. The undergraduate
course in basic fluid dynamics will also be revamped. For graduate students,
several new courses will be developed that describe important mathematical
techniques in the context of current research. Finally, a special student
seminar series for informal discussion of topics of current research interest
has been established. The National Science Foundation strongly encourages the
early development of academic faculty as both educators and researchers. The
Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program is a Foundation-wide program
that provides for the support of junior faculty within the context of their
overall career development. It combines in a single program the support of
quality research and education in the broadest sense and the full participation
of those traditionally underrepresented in science and engineering. This program
enhances and emphasizes the importance the Foundation places on the development
of full, balanced academic careers which include both research and education.
