This research project spans several distinct but related areas of theoretical
computer science. Under investigation are topics in complexity theory, logics of
programs and program semantics. Complexity theory topics to be investigated
include algorithms for chordal graphs and polynomial decomposition. Finite basis
theorems, the propositional mu-calculus and the duality of powerdomains and
predicates will be investigated as part of the research program in logics and
semantics of programs.
