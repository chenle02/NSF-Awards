Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;In this seed project, we will&lt;br/&gt;1) prove
the feasibility and realize a new class of microfabricated three-dimensional
inductive coils for telemetry devices used in biomedical
applications;&lt;br/&gt;2) develop microantennas operating in the microwave
frequency range for high data transmission rate implantable
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will investigate several unique approaches to
create the desired structures for low-frequencytelemetry links (coils) and dual
frequency power/data telemetry links (coils and microantennas). These approaches
will require both numerical investigation of the coils/antennas and experimental
validation of the designed devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activity is the result of an interdisciplinary
collaboration between&lt;br/&gt;bioelectromagnetics and solid-state researchers.
This activity will have an immediate impact on our students that will be exposed
to diverse disciplines to develop the next generations' biomedical systems. We
anticipate that the proposed SGER will initiate a larger program at NCSU that
will use the combined strengths in the bioelectromagnetics and solid-state
research areas toward the realization of a new generation of biomedical
electronics devices.&lt;br/&gt;
