The NSF CREST Center for Mesoscopic Modeling and Simulation"(CMMS) will be
established at the City College of the City University of New York (CUNY), in
partnership with Hunter College of CUNY. The center will be reinforced by the
active participation of CUNY diversity partners, Alliances for Graduate
Education and the Professoriate and Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority
Participation, and by key external scientific and educational outreach
collaborations. The scientific focus of the proposed center will be devoted to
physicochemical modeling, simulation and analysis at the mesoscale level of
several distinct, but physically related, condensed matter and materials
systems. The mission of CMMS will be to significantly advance scientific
knowledge of complex mesoscopic condensed matter and materials systems and the
capability for their simulation and to increase the numbers of persons from
underrepresented groups entering research careers in areas related to CMMS's
scientific focus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CMMS will bring together researchers from
chemistry, physics engineering and computer science departments into five highly
interdisciplinary research groups (IRGs), with each IRG responsible for one of
the Center's five research subprojects/thrusts. All five IRGs will focus on
mesoscale modeling and simulation of complex condensed matter without a crystal
lattice structure. IRG I is concerned with polymeric materials interfaces. IRG
II investigates soil as an unconsolidated granular material. IRG III concerns
biomolecular electron transfer processes. IRG IV concerns large biomolecules in
membranes. IRG V deals with superfluids. All of the IRG topics share the
unifying and computationally challenging characteristics of multiscale
phenomena, highly nonlinear behavior, nonequilibrium with the surroundings and
complexity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational activities of CMMS for graduate
students will include: specialized courses in mesoscopic modeling,
interdisciplinary courses in computational science, seminars, internships and
training in administration of the Beowulf cluster that will be the Center's
primary student training machine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CMMS will also implement
a multi-faceted diversity recruitment, retention and outreach plan.
