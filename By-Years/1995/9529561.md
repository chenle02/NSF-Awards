CDA-9529561 Cook, Diane J. Shirazi, Behrooz A. Kavi, Krishna M. University of
Texas- Arlington Design of a Distributed Computing Environment Using Power PC
Micro Kernel The goal of this project is to investigate, design, and develop a
unique distributed computing environment using a cluster of 12 networked
PowerPcs. The uniqueness of the proposed research is based on the development of
a set of tailor-made, PowerPC micro kernel routines to efficiently manage the
overall system for a specific, large-scale AI application: parallel knowledge
discovery from large complex databases. The main objectives are: (1) Developing
a set of new and unique load balancing schemes for management of distributed
systems. The schemes will be tailored for AI applications and implemented using
the PowerPC micro kernel routines. (2) Developing a new distributed system for
parallel knowledge discovery from large complex databases. The application will
be carried out using the computing facility and proposed load balancing
environment.
