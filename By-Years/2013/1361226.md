In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms A
(CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Stephen R. Leone of the
University of California - Berkeley and his graduate student researchers are
investigating the fundamental processes that govern chemical reactivity, namely
how electrons in molecules move, and how the movement of these electrons
influences the movement of the heavier nuclei. In doing these experiments, Prof.
Leone and his group are developing new tools and methods for conducting these
studies, based upon attosecond lasers. Graduate students working on this project
will receive training in experimental physical
chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prof. Leone and his research group are
conducting experiments on atoms and molecules, using attosecond laser-based
methods. Among the projects being carried out are: (1) the study of attosecond
dynamics of strong-field ionization in atoms; (2) the investigation of
coherences in doubly-charged ions and a study of the phases of electronic
coherences; (3) the exploration of alignment in sequential and nonsequential
double ionization of atoms; (4) the detection of electron reconfiguration of the
ion core during tunnel ionization; (5) the study of spin-orbit state
superposition in methyl bromide; (6) an investigation of charge migration in the
strong-field ionization of a series of 1-bromo, n-iodo alkanes (where n is the
length of the alkane); and (7) the study of the dissociation of bromine in mixed
electronic states. Over the course of these measurements, Prof. Leone and his
students will further develop new experimental tools and methods in attosecond
chemical dynamics, a domain in which the US has lagged until recently.
