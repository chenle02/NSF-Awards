DMS-0405255 Title: Geometric properties of the Ricci flow P.I.: Peng Lu
(University of Oregon)

ABSTRACT The P.I. will study the geometric properties of the Ricci flow in
dimension bigger than three from three aspects. The first one is about the Ricci
flow on manifolds with positive isotropic curvature. We want to work out a
classification of closed 4-manifolds with positive isotropic curvature. The
second one is about the Ricci flow on cohomogeneity one manifolds. One question
is to explore when nonnegativity of sectional curvature is preserved and when
the sectional curvature becomes positive. Another question is to explore when
Hamilton and Ivey's pinching theorem will hold. The third one is about the
relation between the Ricci flow and quantum field theory; especially we will
focus on the duality property of the Ricci flow with symmetry. We will look for
mathematical applications of new ideas in physics which are related to the Ricci
flow.

The Ricci flow is a very important mathematical field and has the potential to
solve very challenging problems relating to the geometric and topological
properties of spaces of dimensions three and four. Recently the fundamental work
of Perelman has drawn a lot of attention to the field. The Ricci flow has a
close connection with string theory; more precisely, Ricci flow is the first
order approximation of the so-called renormalization group flow (RG flow). The
proposed study will improve our understanding of the Ricci flow and demonstrate
that Riemannian Ricci flow is a powerful tool in studying geometric-topological
properties of manifolds of dimension greater than three. Furthermore we hope the
proposed study will improve our understanding of the RG flow in string theory.
