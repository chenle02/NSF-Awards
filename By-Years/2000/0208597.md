Abstract:&lt;br/&gt; As the recording technology further matures, more complex
coding&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for recording channels are challenging integrated
circuit&lt;br/&gt;manufacturing technology limits. The implementation of recent
major&lt;br/&gt;conceptual advances in coding theory, including iterative
decoding,&lt;br/&gt;codes on graphs as well as constrained codes, has been
limited mainly by&lt;br/&gt;the speed and recording density requirements of
modern recording&lt;br/&gt;systems. This research is developing coding schemes
for&lt;br/&gt;ultra-fast high-density recording systems that can lend themselves
to&lt;br/&gt;very low complexity implementations.&lt;br/&gt; The focus of the
research is the idea that good codes can be&lt;br/&gt;constructed without using
random interleavers or random sparse parity&lt;br/&gt;check matrices. The
constructions are based on combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;designs and finite
geometries. Such codes have a simple and well-defined&lt;br/&gt;structure, which
means lower decoder complexity. This approach also&lt;br/&gt;offers a large
flexibility in choosing code parameters. The fundamental&lt;br/&gt;code
construction issues addressed in this research include&lt;br/&gt;understanding a
structure of good codes and tradeoffs among code length,&lt;br/&gt;rate and
structure as well as matching a code to a partial response&lt;br/&gt;channel.
The second class of codes studied in this research are&lt;br/&gt;constrained
codes and graph constrained codes.
