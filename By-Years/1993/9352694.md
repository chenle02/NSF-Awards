Shearon 9352694 This project allows the development of laboratories in
experimental and comparative psychology by using basic computer hardware and
software plus video equipment. Specific experiments and hands-on research
include birds of prey, various endangered and threatened species in our desert
region, large numbers of migratory species, and large tourist and outdoors
populations using wilderness areas in Idaho. The project allows the department
to increase the research productivity of undergraduate students and faculty.
More traditional areas of psychology, such as, cognition, sensation, perception
and memory, are also opened to investigation with the precision afforded by the
computers. ***
