The principal investigator has requested funds for the purchase of a DNA
Synthesizer System. The equipment will be shared by five investigators who use
recombinant DNA techniques and whose research programs are in critical need of
on-site oligonucleotide synthesis capability to produce primers for DNA
synthesis and in vitro mutagenesis. The synthesizer will be utilized initially
in projects that are concerned with the molecular genetics of the Drosophila
myosin heavy chain gene; enzyme degradation in mammalian erythroid cells;
regulation of RNA virus gene expression; expression of genes encoding the small
nuclear RNAs; and initiation of DNA replication in E. coli. The instrumentation
will directly benefit the San Diego State University's techniques increases and
students gain familiarity with current technology.
