This grant will be used to purchase index-matching fluid to operate an existing
large-scale flow facility to explore flows over complex topography (relevant to
aerodynamics and geophysical phenomena), within complex geometries (flow in
porous media and coral reefs, turbines, etc.) and in the presence of
particulates (sediment transport, nutrient transport, pollutant and aerosol
dispersion, etc.). The RI-matched (RIM) flow facility will permit Illinois
researchers to render complex acrylic solid models and/or particulates optically
transparent when immersed in a sodium iodide solution at ~63% by weight, thereby
minimizing reflections and distortion and facilitating thorough non-intrusive
experimentation. Intellectual Merit - The uniqueness of this facility lies in
its large size (0.45 m x 0.45 m x 2.5 m test section), allowing flow studies at
relevant scales and Reynolds numbers. This funding from NSF overcomes the
remainder of the funding shortfall. Doing so will prevent the team from having
to pursue volume reduction that would undermine the novelty and paradigm-
shifting capabilities of the large-scale facility as intended with the original
MRI funding. Broader Impacts - Researchers on multiple levels (46 undergraduate
and 812 graduate students, 35 postdocs and 35 visiting researchers per year
anticipated amongst the research groups of the Illinois faculty on the MRI
proposal) will immediately benefit from one-of-a-kind training and research
experiences once the facility is operational. In particular, this unique
training and education will position these researchers as the next generation of
leaders in experimental fluid mechanics in both academia and industry. The
facility will be run in a shared-use manner, meaning its positive impact will
extend well beyond Illinois to researchers at other universities and in the
private sector (in addition to the numbers listed above).
