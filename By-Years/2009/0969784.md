With much of rock engineering involving large scale projects, the effects of
scale - both spatial and temporal - on rock deformability and strength are
central issues that are still not well understood. Joints and similar large-
scale geological discontinuities are assumed to be the primary factor in
reducing strength, but there is evidence to support the existence of a
significant size effect even in "intact" rock. Recent developments in numerical
modeling allow the interaction of fractures and the bridges of intact rock
between them to be analyzed more realistically than in the past. The deep
underground science and engineering laboratory (DUSEL) in Lead, South Dakota
provides an excellent location to carry out fundamental research to evaluate and
improve the numerical predictions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Large-scale in situ
compression tests, in which pillars will be loaded to failure, are proposed for
DUSEL Complete load-deformation curves will first be obtained in laboratory
tests to assess the potential for brittle failure. Numerical predictions will be
made of the pillar response to loading - using the Synthetic Rock Mass model -
for all stages of pillar excavation. It is anticipated that the test specimens
will range in diameter (or side width, if square) from about 2 m to 5 m, all
with a final height to width ratio of 2:1. Knowledge transfer will be
accomplished through a Grand Challenge, whereby research and consulting teams
will be invited to submit blind predictions of the outcome of key stages of the
in situ studies. This is intended to establish the state-of-the-art of
predictive modeling, and to stimulate development. The educational mission will
be to create and develop mechanisms and technologies that demonstrate,
investigate, and enable the control of subsurface excavations through machine
stiffness effects.
