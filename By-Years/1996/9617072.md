9617072 Toole The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will continue development
and testing of a moored profiling instrument. This device, shaped like and
affectionately named the M&amp;M, uses a traction drive to propel itself up and
down a mooring cable to full ocean depth. Any number of profiling instruments
may be attached to the device that is designed to accomplish up to 100 round
trips between the seafloor and the surface. This work will provide additional
deployment time in the ocean off Bermuda to document long-term instrument and
sensor behavior. A series of three deployments will be made there of four to
eight months' duration over a two-year period. Beyond acquiring technical and
performance experience with the Moored Profiler, the acquired data will document
the intensity of high frequency thermohaline stratification variability offshore
Bermuda. These signals are not resolved by conventional ship-based time-series
station work at this site.
