9803239 Houdre

Professor Houdre is investigating various topics in probability and statistics.
His theoretical work includes isoperimetric problems for product probability
measures, graphs and Markov chains, jackknife based deviation inequalities and
new directions in the study of random Fourier series. His applied projects
include studying the probability of error in biostatistical modeling as well as
the application of deviation inequalities in aerospace engineering.

Professor Houdre's work in bioinformatics addresses questions of error inherent
in popular genome sequencing algorithms which were used in the mapping of E.
Coli and more recently, H. Pylori. His work in aerospace engineering involves
the application of stochastic algorithms to the design of high speed civil
transportation aircraft. The theoretical underpinnings of these applied
activities will also be advanced since isoperimetric methods often provide good
estimates of probability distributions which have a tremendous number of
applications. In particular, Professor Houdre will continue to bridge modern
statistical resampling methods and distribution estimates for general classes of
statistics. Finally his work on random Fourier series will provide tools and
methods for the analysis of fractal-like physical phenomena.
