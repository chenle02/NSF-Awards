The purpose of this project is to develop a general analytical framework that
can be used to determine the technological conditions under which firms in an
industry operate, as well as to answer questions dealing with market structure,
pricing behavior, and the exercise of market power. The analytical framework can
be used to analyze multiproduct firms operating in competitive, monopolistic, or
oligopolistic market structures. Applications of this framework will involve
rail roads and the auto industry, which respectively represent monopolistic and
oligopolistic industries. The empirical research on rail roads will focus on the
technological structure of the industry and its pricing and market behavior in a
regulated and quasi regulated environment, while the empirical research on the
auto industry will analyze the pricing behavior of individual firms, the extent
to which they take into account demand interdependence, and their technological
structure. This research is important because it will provide a better
understanding of technological change in industries exercising significant
market power.
