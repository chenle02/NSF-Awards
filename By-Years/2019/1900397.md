The Second Northeast Conference on Dynamical Systems will be held in the third
weekend of September 2019. The conference is a part of a biennial conference
series that periodically provides a forum for the dynamical systems community in
the northeast area. The goal of this conference is to promote progress in
dynamical systems by bringing together researchers in dynamical systems,
presenting latest research progress, exchanging ideas, encouraging
collaborations, and fostering young researchers and students.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Invited speakers and participants come from many areas of
dynamical systems with an emphasis of connections between dynamical systems and
statistical physics. The conference will also arrange many short talks for young
researchers to announce their recent results. More information can been found
