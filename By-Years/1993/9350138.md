9350138 Navarro The El Paso USI will be implemented through the El Paso
Collaborative for Academic Excellence, an organization of school district
superintendents, university officials, civic leaders and the mayor. The
Collaborative will focus on three areas: establishing community consensus on a
set of competencies; determining current policies and practices that affect
mathematics and science; developing comprehensive plans for change that build
upon district strengths. Upon completion of the self study, the El Paso USI will
continue with the development of a comprehensive plan for change for the
district that will build on identified strengths and focus attention on areas of
greatest need. The University of Texas at El Paso will house the Collaborative
and provide leadership over USI activities. The award period is for 12 months.
