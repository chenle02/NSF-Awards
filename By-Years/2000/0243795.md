PI: Wilson &lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of North
Texas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of North Texas (UNT) for the summers
of 2003-2005. Angela Wilson is the program director. Thomas Cundari is the Co-PI
of the project. Twelve students will participate in a ten-week program. The
students will be recruited on a national basis with special focus on the
ethnically diverse Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas region (ArkLaTex). Thirteen
problem areas are proposed for research in various fields of chemistry including
organic, inorganic, physical, analytical, polymer and environmental chemistry.
The REU experience will be enhanced by discussions with chemical leaders on
topics such as ethics, non-traditional career options and chemists in industry.
Training opportunities in computational chemistry and x-ray crystallography will
be provided. An external advisory board will be formed to assist and advise the
REU program. The REU students will participate in activities with Mexican
students, who are hosted each summer by the UNT chemistry department, providing
an international dimension to their experience. &lt;br/&gt;
