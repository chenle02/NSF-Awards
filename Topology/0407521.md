ABSTRACT

Ion traps are devices used to contain charged particles, and for highly
selective mass spectroscopy. For a nonlinear trap subjected to secondary end-cap
excitation and including a buffer gas, the equations of motion are coupled,
damped, nonlinear, quasiperiodic Mathieu equations. The attractors for this
system are non-trivially "knotted" in the 4-D phase space. The investigator and
his colleagues have developed tools to characterize them topologically and
geometrically, and have identified new bifurcations associated with their
changes of type. Important outstanding problems include: how topological
equivalence of attractors through torus braids and through surfaces is related;
whether chaos is associated with transverse intersections of stable and unstable
manifolds of saddle-type knotted tori. A sequence of the newly identified
bifurcations leads to chaotic dynamics through a route observed, but not yet
characterized. In some cases, two bifurcations bound extremely sharp resonances
which are useful in applications.

The new knowledge being developed about this system can be used to suggest new
operating regimes for ion traps used in discrimination of species in mass
spectroscopy. The sharp resonances already observed suggest the use of an ion
trap as a tunable electromechanical filter. Two similar ion trap systems may be
used for the purpose of masking and unmasking signals for secure communication.
Finally, the results suggest that a trapped charged particle or ion can be used
as an accelerometer and gyroscope. These technological innovations or
improvements flow directly from a detailed understanding of the underlying
mathematics.
