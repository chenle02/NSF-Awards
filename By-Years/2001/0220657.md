This program provides scholarships to low-income, academically talented students
in architectural technology, civil engineering technology and electronics and
mechanical design technology programs. Our efforts are expanded to recruit
individuals from groups underrepresented in CSEM fields, including women,
ethnic/linguistic and racially underrepresented groups and students with
disabilities. Strong and varied student supports are in place to retain
scholarship recipients through services such as academic support, counseling and
mentoring activities. The College has successfully administered similar
scholarships and fellowships and this scholarship program compliments existing
resources. MATC and the MATC Foundation are providing additional funds and
services to enhance the program. Our main objectives of the ACE'M program are to
increase enrollment of underrepresented students, including women, minorities
and persons with disabilities in CSEM programs at MATC, monitor their progress
to promote and assure timely completion of their programs, increase overall
graduation rates and achieve either full employment for CSEM graduates related
to their program or continuing on to a four-year college within six months of
graduation.
