9422572 Hall The research investigates the design, fabrication, and properties
of electrically pumped concentric-circle-grating, surface-emitting (CCGSE)
semiconductor lasers. Conventional Fabry-Perot semiconductor lasers emit broadly
diverging beams with elliptical cross-sections. An optically pumped A1GaAs/GaAs
CCGSE laser has already been demonstrated to emit a spectrally narrow (&lt;1nm),
low divergence (1o), 10 milliwatt circular beam. CCGSE lasers have the potential
for high power operation and superior beam quality. Such a laser would likely
find widespread use in optical data storage, communications, medical
instrumentation, sensing, inspection, and a variety of other applications. ***
