Unification algorithms form the core of almost all automated deduction systems,
and generalizations of the basic paradigms to first-order logic with equality
and to higher-order logic have motivated the design of more general forms of
unification. This report proposes to continue the PI's work in developing a
theory of general unification using the method of transformation on systems of
terms invented by Herbrand. Also under investigation is the development of the
first known algorithm for general E-unification and new techniques for
implementing higher-order unification. In addition, an extension of Andrew's
method of matings to account for equality, which involves a new form of
unification called rigid E-unification will be studied.
