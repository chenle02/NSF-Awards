The Vertebrate Paleontology collection at the Texas Memorial Museum, University
of Texas, includes 150,000 catalogued specimens, 156 types and vouchers, and is
one of the most valuable research collections of its kind in the U.S. The
collection's strengths are in the diverse Texas Mesozoic fauna, Devonian fishes,
and Tertiary mammals of the south and southwest. Dr. Ernest Lundelius, Director
of the Vertebrate Paleontology and Radiocarbon Laboratory in the Texas Memorial
Museum, has devised a three-year plan for continued improvement to the
collection. This phase would include installation of new specimen storage
cabinets, new storage racks for very large specimens, and would replace the
outdated computer equipment that currently hampers the database operations.
Curatorial projects would continue to improve the availability of specimens and
the accuracy and accessibility of specimen-related data. The proposed collection
improvement will have significant impact on the paleontological research
community. The vertebrate fossils in the Texas Memorial Museum are heavily used
by research paleontologists in studies of evolution, paleoecology, and global
change. Improving the accessibility of these collections will benefit
generations of research scientists.
