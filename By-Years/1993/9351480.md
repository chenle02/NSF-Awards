FPGAs are used in the computer engineering educational program, starting at the
introductory logic design course and continuing in two advanced capstone
computer engineering courses. Additional courses also benefit from the new FPGA
laboratory. Developed are course material, FPGA technology expertise, and a plan
to integrate the key computer engineering courses with FPGAs. The FPGA
laboratory is used both in the sophomore logic design course and in upper level
capstone courses. The significance of this approach is that integration of the
courses from the sophomore level logic design course to upper level capstone
design courses is effected, and major interaction among all levels of
undergraduate students is fostered.
