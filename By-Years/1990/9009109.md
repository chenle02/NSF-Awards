This is part of a joint project at Carnegie Mellon University and the University
of Southern California to build a massively parallel processor and use it for
natural language translation. The system to be built is an array of custom
processors that are specialized for marker passing in semantic networks. A
specific goal of this project is to implement a real-time speech-to-speech
dialogue translation system with about 500 words in its vocabulary. This system
will necessarily include natural language understanding and generation
components. The culmination of this project will be an array of 16,384 semantic
network nodes with software implementing the translation system.
