Support is provided for the conduct of a Gordon Research Conference on chemical
reaction pathways between substances present in natural waters that are affected
or impacted by the presence, growth, and metabolism of microorganisms. The
diffusion, dispersion, and interactions of pollutants in both surface and
groundwaters are partially determined by the presence and activities of
microorganisms which in turn affect the quality of the water. The Conference
will be held at the New Hampton School, New Hampton, New Hampshire from June
16-20, 1986.
