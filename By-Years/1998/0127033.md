Astronomy (11) This project updates computers in two laboratory courses in
astronomy and meteorology in the Department of Physics and Astronomy for use by
nonscience students. About a quarter of the college's enrollment are using the
computing facilities in this project. The project is adapting material from the
internet to access scientific and technological databases worldwide, for
example, meteorological and astronomical images. In addition, the project is
using the CLEA labs for astronomy and adapting labs for use with an existing
remote-controlled telescope. The project has several objectives. First, students
gain valuable experience with computers. Second, students use data from the
latest science and technology. Third, computer projects properly integrated into
a laboratory are a good mechanism to increase the interest of non-science
students.
