Enormous demand to analyze and construct stochastic models describing
various&lt;br/&gt;situations in the modern world has created new fast growing
research fields that include&lt;br/&gt;financial mathematics,
telecommunications, transportation, manufacturing, energy
and&lt;br/&gt;biomedicine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Powerful techniques from
stochastic theory and stochastic control have allowed to&lt;br/&gt;formulate and
to solve a number of problems arising in these cutting-edge
disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will focus on building closer
collaborations among stochastic&lt;br/&gt;control researchers .It will focus on
promoting collaborative initiatives in stochastic&lt;br/&gt;theory and control
as well as in stochastic theory and control education.&lt;br/&gt;
