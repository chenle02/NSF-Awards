This action funds Rachael Tomasino of the University of Denver to conduct a
research project, entitled "Removing anomalies from images of planetary nebula,"
during the summer of 2012 at the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA),
Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) in Sagamihara. The host
scientist is Dr. Yamamura Issei.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is improve visualization tools
for the study of stellar ejecta, critical to understanding the evolution and
circulation of matter in the Universe as a whole. Understanding stellar mass
loss is synonymous with understanding the primary means to distribute matter
synthesized in stars into the surrounding space as the seed for the following
generations of stars, planets, and, ultimately, life. The research focuses on
generating the cleanest maps of circumstellar dust shells by using interactive
software named FAST (Far-infrared surveyor AKARI Slow-scan Tools) to optimize
the images generated when data are reduced using a process known as AKARI MLHES
(excavating Mass Loss History in Extended dust shells of Evolved Stars). This
procedure optimizes the observational characterization of the history of stellar
mass loss.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
