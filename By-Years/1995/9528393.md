9528392 Body size of animals is controlled by adjustments in cell size and cell
number. We know relatively little about mechanisms that regulate cell size and
cell division to yield an animal of a particular size. This research seeks to
understand the relative importance of changes in cell size and cell number
during evolutionary changes in body size, and to identify the genes that control
such changes. It will focus on Drosophila because they exhibit a wide range of
sizes and because of the extensive data that exist on their genetics and
developmental biology. Measurements of cell size and number during development
of imaginal discs will identify the developmental steps that lead to changes in
body size. A comparative analysis will identify the pattern of evolution of body
size differences, and a hybridization study will seek to map the genes that
control body size. The results will increase our understanding of the factors
that control body size, and the mechanisms that lead to changes in cell size and
body size of animals.
