Computer-based training simulations can do more than teach facts and specialized
skills, they can help students learn the high level skills involved in finding
and evaluating information, solving problems, cooperating with colleagues, and
resolving conflicts. While the simulators used to train pilots or tank crews are
very expensive, new generation of authoring tools will enable low-cost
development of many broadly-used training and education simulations. The new
simulations will use personal computers and will build on evolving work on
digital libraries and multimedia techniques. The new authoring tools incorporate
knowledge-based techniques for model-based simulation, automated planning, and
concept-based information retrieval. Military applications have demonstrated
successful applications of these knowledge-based techniques. Authoring tools
that package these techniques will allow trainers to develop simulations that
adapt to varying learning levels and accommodate the opportunistic, exploratory
behaviors of individual learners. Reuse of the authoring tools, domain
knowledge, digital libraries, help modules, and other software components will
spread development costs over many simulations and make it cost effective to
develop simulations that dramatically extend the effectiveness of training and
education software.
