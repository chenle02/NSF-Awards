9753064 Souvaine, Diane L. Rutgers University POWRE: Geometric Computation and
Applications Computational geometry deals with algorithmic aspects of geometric
problems. The problems studied have often been abstracted from real life
applications, but these abstractions are frequently so far removed from the
original problem that the solutions cannot possibly impact real-life
calculations. Furthermore, the original problems may be so complicated that the
state-of-the-art techniques in theoretical computational geometry are
insufficient to provide major breakthroughs in the application area. Finally,
collaborations between theoretical computational geometers and researchers with
geometric applications are impeded by differences in training and in vocabulary.
While devoting again full energies to research after several years of academic
administration, the PI proposes exploratory work in how to conduct research in
theoretical computational geometry, to be valued by that community, while
maintaining real collaborations with applied scientists and demonstrably
impacting the applied field as well. The particular application areas selected
are wireless communications and cartography.
