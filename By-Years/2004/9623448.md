w:\awards\awards96\*.doc 9623448 DeLozanne This condensed matter physics
project will continue development of a low-temperature, ultra-high-vacuum,
scanning tunneling microscope (STM). The STM is used for in-situ cleavage of
high-Tc materials. Preliminary STM study of the clean surfaces has revealed
novel structural features and an reproducible gap in YBCO materials. The origin
of the structural features is uncertain and will be further investigated in this
project. The instrument capabilities will be improved to allow a lower base
operating temperature, and lower noise. This will expand the range
superconducting materials that can be investigated. Of particular interest are
measurement of vortex structure and charge density waves in superconductors.
This is a fundamental project. The results will be of significance for theories
of superconductivity, and may lead to development of new superconducting
materials. %%% This project will continue development of a surface structure
determination tool, a scanning tunneling microscope (STM), which has unique
capabilities. With this instrument it is possible to take a small single crystal
of a high-Tc superconductor, cool it to very low temperatures (20 K), cleave the
crystal, and study the surface structure with the STM at the low temperature.
Preliminary data have revealed unusual structural features in high-Tc materials
whose origin is uncertain, but which certainly relevant to mechanisms of high-Tc
superconductivity. This project will clarify the nature of the structural
properties of several high-Tc materials, and will study the temperature
dependence of the phenomena. The instrument will be further developed to allow a
lower base temperature, which will increase the range of superconducting
materials that can be investigated. This is a fundamental project in condensed
matter physics. The results will be of significance for theories of
superconductivity, and may lead to development of new superconducting materials.
