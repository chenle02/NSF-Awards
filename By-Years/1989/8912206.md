Sunlight drives the chemistry of the atmosphere by forming reactive species
through photochemical processes. Several photochemical processes for gases in
the atmosphere are well- known to be important to the foundation of smog and
acid rain, for instance. Less understood is the role and importance of
photochemical processes in the natural waters of the atmosphere, i,e, clouds,
fog and rain. The objective of this project is to characterize, geographically
and temporally, the formation of reactive oxidants in these atmospheric aqueous
systems. The project will monitor the oxidation of chemical traps that are
selectively sensitive to particular oxidants so that oxidants formed in
atmospheric waters can be identified and quantified. The results will provide a
data base on the photo-oxidants that are formed in atmospheric waters. This data
base will assist the modelling of atmospheric oxidation and lead to improvements
in the understanding of the atmospheric cycling of sulfur and organic compounds.
