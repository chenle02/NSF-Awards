This award will partially support the 2011 Gordon Research Conference (GRC, June
5-10) and the first ever Gordon-Kenan Research Seminar (GRS, June 4-5) on the
Interior of the Earth, which will be held at Mount Holyoke College in South
Hadley, Massachusetts. The GRC is the eighth in a series of highly successful
Gordon Research Conferences that focus on the structure, dynamics and evolution
of the Earth's interior. For the first time, the 2011 Interior of the Earth
Gordon Conference will be preceded by a Gordon-Kenan Research Seminar
(http://www.grc.org/ programs.aspx?year=2011&amp;program=grs_inter), a unique
forum for graduate students, post-docs, and other scientists with comparable
levels of experience and education to present and exchange new data and cutting
edge ideas. NSF funds will be used to attract young scientists from a diverse
range of institutions, backgrounds and scientific
disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This year's Gordon conference will focus on
the shallow Earth with a particular emphasis on the link between the interior
and surface processes. A wide range of topics will be addressed from a multi-
disciplinary perspective. Invited speakers from the fields of geochemistry,
geodynamics, mineral physics and seismology will define the forefront of
knowledge and set the stage for a freewheeling discussion and debate of the most
pressing scientific questions. Specific session topics include the link between
mantle dynamics and sea level, great earthquakes, dynamics of subduction zones,
volatile recycling in the upper mantle, the nature and dynamical role of the
asthenosphere, and the origin and evolution of continents. The conference will
also provide the opportunity for junior scientists and graduate students to
present their work in poster format and exchange ideas with leading researchers.
The latter will be greatly facilitated by the preceding GRS, which will focus on
the nature of the asthenosphere providing particular synergy with the GRC to
follow.
