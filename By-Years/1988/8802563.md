This award supports cooperative research on small mammal desert ecology to be
conducted by Dr. Michael Mares of the University of Oklahoma and two Argentine
scientists, Ing. Virgilio Roig at the University of Cuyo and Dr. Ricardo Ojeda
of the Institute of Arid Zone Studies, both in Mendoza. This research project
will examine habitat selection, population ecology and the physiology of small
mammals in the arid zone of west-central Argentina. The data collected will help
identify the patterns of adaptation and colonization by two disparate
assemblages of rodents. The validity of a density-dependent habitat selection
hypothesis will be tested. The results will help provide an understanding of how
small mammals of the southern desert function within the larger desert ecosystem
and will offer insights into the development of an important desert region of
South America. Ing. Roig will investigate the physiological adaptations of small
mammals to deserts while Dr. Ojeda will monitor over the long term the
population biology, reproduction and habitat selection in a study area. Dr.
Mares will examine patterns of habitat selection in various habitats with
emphasis on the dependence of habitat choice on population density. Thus the
scope of the research is broader than if done by one scientist alone. Roig and
Ojeda are the permanent on-site investigators and Mares will add extensive
experience in ecological, physiological and systematic research. Also, training
of both North and South American technicians and students will be an additional
mutual benefit to both countries of this research.
