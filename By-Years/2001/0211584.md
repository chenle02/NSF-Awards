This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase Iproject proposes to develop
a urea sensor using enzyme polyurethane polymers. The product concept is
inexpensive, very easy to use and requires no additional analytical equipment or
electricity. The strict specificity of the enzymes used in its formulation will
provide the sensor with high precision in detecting urea and should limit false
positive and negative signals. Sampling of surfaces and solutions will require
only 1 simple step, limiting the potential for user error. Finally, rapid
response times, on the order of a few minutes, will correspond well with the
target applications of the sensor.

The commercial applications of this project will be in the area of regulatory
testing linked to the food service industry and health care establishments.
Because improper cleaning practices of restrooms can lead to bacterial
contamination, the use of urea-detecting sensors in hospital bathroom facilities
may aid in reducing patient infection rates.
