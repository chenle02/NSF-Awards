Studying how information, diseases, and ideas spread through society is crucial
for understanding and addressing pressing societal issues, including public
health crises, misinformation, and national security. Our current understanding
of these processes is fragmented because research on contagion processes occurs
in silos. This award provides funding for the second edition of the "Contagion
on Complex Social Systems" (CCSS) conference, which serves as a platform for
researchers from diverse fields to exchange ideas and develop innovative
approaches for modeling contagion in complex social systems. There will be six
invited talks from leading researchers in their respective fields, the
opportunity for up to 25 contributed talks, and expert-led discussions. An
essential focus of the conference is training the scientific workforce in
cutting-edge methods and tools, thus fostering the growth of a skilled research
community.

The CCSS conference aims to promote interdisciplinary collaboration and advance
the understanding of contagion processes in social systems by bringing together
researchers from applied mathematics, social sciences, public health,
epidemiology, economics, ecology, and computer science. The conference features
presentations on topics such as epidemic modeling, misinformation spread, and
financial contagion, with the explicit aim of attaining an integrated
understanding of contagion processes. The conference will emphasize support to
early career researchers and is committed to fostering diversity and inclusion
by encouraging participation from underrepresented groups. Videos of the
lectures and transcript will be uploaded on the conference website:
