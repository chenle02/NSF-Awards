A UNIX-based laboratory equipped with Sun SPARC workstations will be established
for the enhancement of several courses in the computer science curriculum at
Winston-Salem State University. The computers are used to teach courses in UNIX
and FORTRAN and provide enhancement for courses in Graphics, Numerical Analysis,
and System Simulation and Modeling. They also provide facilities necessary for
student design projects in a Software Development course and in the Computer
Science Seminar; these projects are taken from areas such as neural networks or
scientific computing in FORTRAN. Since these workstations replicate the kind of
equipment found in scientific laboratories across the country, the projects can
be parts of ongoing research. This equipment, with its interconnections, modems,
and links to state networks, give students experience in networking. In summary,
it provides attractive exposure to the scientific/technical side of computer
science.
