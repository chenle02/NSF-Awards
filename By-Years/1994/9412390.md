This proposal requests support for a three year effort to investigate the
electrodynamic coupling between the solar wind, the Earth's magnetosphere, and
the ionosphere. Investigations focus upon the high latitude polar cap and the
region around the polar cleft. In open models of the magnetosphere, the cleft is
the dayside boundary between open and closed geomagnetic field lines. There is
considerable evidence that, within the cleft region, the effects of the full
range of solar wind - magnetosphere - ionosphere coupling phenomena can be
observed, including: Birkeland currents, strong electric fields and plasma
drifts, rapid motions of small scale field-aligned current structures, particle
energization within localized regions, intense ionospheric heating, etc. The
proposed research is directed toward investigations of the cleft and its dynamic
behavior in response to variations in the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic
field (IMF). Fundamental questions center around the identification of
ionospheric signatures of phenomena which occur at the magnetopause or
magnetospheric boundary layer and which relate to solar wind - magnetosphere
interactions. Processes such as reconnection, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability,
impulsive plasma penetration, the magnetopause response to dynamic pressure
variations or sudden changes in IMF orientation all produce dynamic variations
which couple electrically to the conducting ionosphere via field-aligned
currents. It is propose to undertake a variety of incoherent scatter radar
observations and the coordinated analysis of these data with combinations of
magnetometer array data, a variety of satellite data, as well as data from other
Greenland ground instruments such as the imaging riometer, all sky camera, etc.
to investigate both large scale and small scale high latitude electrodynamic
phenomena which are thought to be associated with the coupling of energy and
momentum from the solar wind to the magnetosphere and ionosph ere.
