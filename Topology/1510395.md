As our world, with time included, is four dimensional, exploring similarities
and differences of 4-dimensional spaces through geometric and topological
methods leads to better understanding of the universe we live in. Smooth and
symplectic structures on 4-dimensional spaces are broadly featured in
theoretical physics; e.g. in classical mechanics, string and quantum field
theories. The research projects invoke new ideas and techniques, creating
leverage to address several important problems regarding the topology of smooth
and symplectic 4-manifolds, and that of contact 3-manifolds and their fillings.
A key aspect of this program is the reduction of many intricate problems to
fairly simple algebraic relations between curves on surfaces, which sets an
excellent ground to present problems accessible to graduate and advanced
undergraduate students. The PI will engage and mentor students in related
research topics.

This is a project in low dimensional geometry and topology, focusing on a
variety of profound questions involving symplectic 4-manifolds and contact
3-manifolds. Some of the projects on 4-manifolds are pertinent to classification
of symplectic Calabi-Yau surfaces, diversity of Lefschetz pencils and
fibrations, novel constructions of small exotic and symplectic 4-manifolds, and
complexity in various stable equivalences. As for 3-manifolds, the PI will probe
the complexity in Giroux correspondence in terms of open book support genus, the
characterization of newly discovered contact 3-manifolds with arbitrarily large
Stein fillings, diversity of complex curves bounding links in the 3-sphere, and
generalizations of quasi-positive links. Gauge theory, new mapping class group
techniques and symplectic surgeries will play a vital role in this program.
