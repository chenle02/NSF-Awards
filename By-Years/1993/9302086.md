9302086 Torr Under a previous award, a new photometric technique was developed
which allows observations of weak airglow signals to be observed in the daytime.
Such measurements made at twilight provide a means of retrieving thermospheric
composition and temperature and a scaling factor for the solar EUV flux. A
prototype of the instrument was designed, fabricated and tested. In the
continuing award, tests will be conducted with the instrument in Huntsville,
Alabama, and at McDonald Observatory, in Texas. This will allow assessment of
the effects due to the underlying water vapor absorption features which are not
as severe in the arid climate at McDonald. These measurements will provide
important information for the interpretation of atmospheric composition and
temperature data. ***
