The Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division of the National Science
Foundation will support the research program of Professor Albert Stiegman at
Florida State University. Dr. Stiegman and his students will carry out studies
targeting the development of microwave absorbing catalytic materials that will
be tested in partial oxidation catalysis reactions driven by microwave energy.
The goal of this work is to obtain the fundamental understanding needed to
implement energy efficient catalytic process routes taking advantage of the
local microwave heating of the catalytic surface. In addition to the examination
of a range of spinel structured oxides with high microwave absorption cross
sections, nano particles of gold and other noble metals will be investigated in
this context. The research will train students in this broadly interdisciplinary
area, which includes synthesis, materials characterization, spectroscopic
studies, and catalytic evaluation. Fundamental understanding obtained in this
work will impact the design of more efficient and energy conserving catalytic
process chemistries. Graduate and undergraduate research students will be
recruited to the research team through the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority
Participation.
