A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to the
University of South Alabama that will provide research training for 10 students,
for 10 weeks during the summers of 2012-2014. The program focuses on integrative
sciences at the junction of engineering, biology and chemistry, with links to
understanding protein structure and function. Undergraduates participating in
the program will conduct independent research under the mentorship of faculty,
explore the implications of their research with peers and mentors through formal
and informal discussion groups, develop an understanding of the ethical
implications of the research process and professionalism, and present their
research at an end of program symposium. Research projects will relate to the
central theme of protein structure and function and be collaborative in nature
with pairs of students working on different aspects of a specific project guided
by faculty from the three disciplines. The program's recruitment effort consists
of traditional mailings, digital-based advertising, and campus visits.
Preference will be given to students with a GPA of 3.0 or higher and who have
completed either an organic chemistry or biochemistry course. Students are
selected based on academic record, research interest, and potential for
outstanding research in the biosciences. Students are tracked to determine their
continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the
lasting influences of the research experience. Information about the program
will be assessed by various means, including use of an REU common assessment
tool. More information is available by visiting
