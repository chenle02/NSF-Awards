Summer Project for High School Teachers of Honors Chemistry This three-year
chemistry program is designed to increase the effectiveness of 120 teachers in
the laboratory, strengthen their subject-matter background, and assist them in
providing outreach to other teachers in their system and in their region. In
each of three summers, a different group of forty leader teachers of honors and
Advanced Placement chemistry will participate in an intensive five-week
residential program structured on chemical laboratory experiences and integrally
incorporating attention to practices of potential success in peer leadership
activities. In addition to the goal of extending the effect of this program to
other teachers, it is expected that the participant teachers will strengthen the
disciplinary base of their students and positively influence career decisions
for science among able students. Extensive follow-up activities by the
participants will provide a system for networking the teachers with each other
and with the project staff.
