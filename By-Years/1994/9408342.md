9408342 Hopkins Crustaceans regenerate new walking legs when old ones are lost
or injured. Ecdysteroids (the invertebrate steroid hormones) which control
growth in virtually all arthropods also influence the special kind of growth
involved in regeneration. The research proposed here will investigate the role
of these steroids in leg regeneration in the crab, Uca pugilator. Since
regeneration in crabs involves both cellular differentiation and anabolic
activities, this research will yield new insights into the molecular controls of
these two very different events. Using our recently isolated DNA probe for the
ecdysteroid receptor, Dr. Hopkins will look at the patterns of receptor
expression during regeneration and the structural/functional relationships
between steroid hormones, other growth-affecting compounds (such as the
retinoids), and their receptors. Because steroid receptors of invertebrates are
so similar to those of higher vertebrates, the data generated by this research
should provide a better understanding of how steroids, in general, control and
coordinate the complicated phenomena of growth. ***
