9316912 Westpheling Streptomyces are Gram-positive soil bacteria that are of
special interest because of their remarkably complex morphological development
and because they produce as secondary metabolites most of the antibiotics used
in human and animal health care. Although little is understood about the
molecular physiology of these bacteria, it is apparent that the regulation of
carbon utilization is of central importance in the gene expression pathways for
both morphological development and antibiotic biosynthesis. To gain an
understanding of the mechanism of catabolite control in Streptomyces we are
studying the regulation of a family of genes involved in the utilization of
chitin, a complex carbohydrate and a major source of carbon in the soil. The
synthesis of chitinase enzymes is tightly repressed by glucose and strongly
induced by chitin. In preliminary work we have established that regulation for
at least one of the chitin. In preliminary work we have established that
regulation for at least one of the chitinase genes, chi63, occurs at the level
of transcription initiation. We have been a systematic analysis of mutations
within the promoter region of chi63 and used a transcriptional fusion to the
xy1E reporter gene, to identify chromosomal mutations that define the pathway
for glucose repression and chitin induction of chitinase synthesis. We are
defining the elements of the chitinase promoters that determine regulation and
promoter activity; beginning a study to identify and characterize genes that act
to facilitate the global regulation of catabolite repression in Streptomyces.
%%% We hope as a result of this work to contribute to the understanding of gene
regulation in an important class of bacteria where relatively little is known
about the way in which gene expression is controlled. ***
