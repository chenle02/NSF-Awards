Within recent years there has been increasing interest in the concept that some
genetic elements may be "selfish" or "parasitic", i.e. they may have no function
other than their own propagation within a species. Research here concerns the
most extreme example of a parasitic element known, the psr (paternal sex ratio)
chromosome in Nasonia vitripennis. Psr is transmitted normally, but then causes
loss of the paternal chromosomes. Because males are normally haploid and females
diploid in this insect, the effect of psr is to convert diploid female eggs into
haploid male eggs (which carry psr) by totally destroying the paternal genome.
Psr gains a transmission advantage from this phenotype because it has a high
transmission through males and a poor transmission through females. This is an
excellent system for studying the evolution of parasitic genetic elements.
Research will be undertaken to answer the following specific questions, (a) What
is the distribution of psr in natural populations?, (b) How does population
structure affect frequency of psr? and (c) What is the origin of the psr
chromosome? These questions can be answered because recombinant clones can be
used to characterize the chromosome and for population studies. In addition,
procedures are established for population genetic studies of psr in both the
laboratory and field. Genetic, cytogenetic and molecular studies will determine
the structure of the psr chromosome. Field studies will determine the
distribution of psr in North American wasp populations of 3 closely related
Nasonia species. Laboratory population experiments will examine psr population
dynamics under different population structures. Finally the possible origin of
sequences on the psr chromosome will be determined by comparing patterns in the
3 wasp species. Besides providing basic insight into the genetics and evolution
of "selfish " DNA, the psr chromosome could be a tractable system for studying
the genetic basis of chromosome imprinting. Psr also has significant potential
as a biological control agent of pest insects.
