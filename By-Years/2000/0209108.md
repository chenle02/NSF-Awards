Recently a new generation of P2P systems, offering distributed
hash&lt;br/&gt;table (DHT) functionality, have been proposed. These systems
greatly&lt;br/&gt;improve the scalability and exact-match accuracy of P2P
systems, but&lt;br/&gt;offer only the exact-match query facility. This proposal
outlines a&lt;br/&gt;research agenda for building complex query facilities on
top of these&lt;br/&gt;DHT-based P2P systems. There are three defining
directions of the&lt;br/&gt;proposed research agenda:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Core
Algebra: Explore the implementation of a core set of&lt;br/&gt; algebraic query
operators that run over DHTs in a P2P network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; DHT APIs:
Identify the minimum set of primitives and functions that&lt;br/&gt; need to be
implemented by a P2P network in order to efficiently&lt;br/&gt; support the
query operators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Query Optimization: P2P networks are
often distributed across slow&lt;br/&gt; network links, and may benefit from
distributed database&lt;br/&gt; optimizations like the use of semi-joins.
However, it is not clear&lt;br/&gt; how the various ideas in the query
processing literature map into&lt;br/&gt; the P2P context, particularly when
using DHTs for routing during&lt;br/&gt; query processing. This proposal intends
to study the costs and&lt;br/&gt; tradeoffs of various alternatives for the
query plan space in this&lt;br/&gt; context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simulation of
large networks will be used to study the proposed&lt;br/&gt;techniques at
Internet scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
