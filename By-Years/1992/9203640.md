Dr. Craig A. Coburn has been awarded a Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr.
Coburn's doctoral degree was from Brown University with Professor Kathlyn
Parker. Dr. Coburn intends to continue his research with Professor Samuel
Danishefsky at the Sloan-Kettering Institute. In his postdoctoral work, Dr.
Coburn will learn the techniques of the synthesis of complex biologically active
molecules. This will complement his graduate work developing methods towards the
synthesis of Gilvocarcin and help to prepare him for his career goal of
synthesizing difficult natural products such as taxol and its analogs. %%% The
Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important
infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new
Ph.D.'s and attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical
research and teaching.
