Mark Schell is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to study the theoretical and experimental nonlinear behavior
in electrochemical oxidation of alcohols. The nonlinear kinetic processes to be
studied are the electrochemical oxidations of alcohols in acid solution under
the condition of constant current. Two fundamental problems will be addressed:
1) the investigation of the fundamental chemical steps underlying temporal
instabilities during the elcetro-oxidation of methanol at a Pt electrode; and 2)
the development of new techniques for describing nonlinear kinetic problems that
are global in parameter space and phase space. Much of the proposed experimental
work will center on the instabilities in the electro-oxidation of methanol.
Preliminary experimental work has shown this system to be tristable. The PI will
attempt to model this behavior by theoretically deriving the potential vs.
current curves and oscillatory nonlinear behavior. The proposed work has
practical implications with regard to the commercial feasibility of an ambient-
temperature, methanol-air, fuel cell
