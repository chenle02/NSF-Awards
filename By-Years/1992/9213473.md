In this Experimental Physical Chemistry project funded by the Chemistry
Division, Prof. Richardson (University of Virginia) will use time resolved
luminescence measurements to study differential reaction kinetics in mixtures of
optically active components. Parameters derived from these measurements carry
information about both the magnitude and sense ("handedness") of the
luminophore-quencher interactions, and provide a new and useful tool for
studying chiral aspects of structural dynamics. %%% Molecules whose mirror
images are not superimposable have long fascinated chemists, because of the
subtle interplay between reactivity and symmetry. Prof. Richardson has developed
a new spectroscopic method for studying fast chemical reactions among such
molecules, which has the capability of measuring reaction rates without the need
for tedious and difficult separation of the mirror image species. This method
will be used to provide important information on how the "handedness" of excited
molecular states leads to recognition of similar handedness in final products.
The result will be a deeper understanding of the stereochemistry of fundamental
reaction mechanisms.
