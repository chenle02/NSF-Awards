William Firey will carry out research into some of the classical problems of
geometric convexity. His approach is very much in the modern vein and will
involve extending results about spherical functions to functions on more
complicated manifolds. Many of these problems involve inequalities which have
significance in geometric probability and stochastic geometry. Firey will
investigate higher order support functions of convex bodies. These are natural
extensions of support functions to Grassmannian manifolds. He will study their
relationship to various inequalities and investigate how their derivatives
relate to the curvature of the bodies. This work holds out the prospect of
contributing to the intermediate Christoffel-Minkowski problem concerning
preassigned intermediate curvature functions. It may also shed light on the
extremal conditions in the Alexandrov- Fenchel inequalities.
