The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to bring biomimetic ideas to traditional
architecture. This project consists of a development of a robust and innovative
database to catalyze incorporating scientific concepts into designs for the
built environment. This project will inspire the design of naturally resilient
structures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop
an innovative sustainability tool that abstracts the knowledge of biology from
scientific literature and makes it available to architects and designers such
that the built environment sector can support biomimetic ideas implementable in
terms of material availability and structural codes. The project will be
organized by building challenge category, biome, and function. It will filter
champion organisms that have already solved the specified function, and provide
translated principles and images to explain the solution. The project will
interpret, capture, store, and systematically distribute their translation of
natural systems models for diverse application in the built
environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
