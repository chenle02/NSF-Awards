This project will establish a national clearinghouse for Loma Prieta earthquake
materials for collection and distribution of all information produced by the
Loma Prieta earthquake. The Clearinghouse will be administered by the National
Information Service for Earthquake Engineering (NISEE) whose objective is to
disseminate information on earthquake engineering and allied fields to
professional users and the general public. The NISEE program at the University
of California, Berkeley, includes the EERC Library, Earthquake engineering
Abstracts and Computer Applications. Each unit has a role in establishing a
Clearinghouse. Material from the earthquake will be collected, indexed in the
NISEE database and through library resource sharing utilities, publicized at
conferences, in publications and through a printed catalog. Strong motion data
will be analyzed for energy input and inelastic response spectra. Since
buildings and other structures are often designed to respond inelastically when
subjected to an earthquake, these data will provide valuable feedback on the
response of buildings during the event. This project will archive the valuable
data base of this important event and provide central clearinghouse services to
researchers and other users worldwide.
