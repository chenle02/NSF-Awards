Colorado State University is awarded a grant to expand housing at the Shortgrass
Steppe (SGS) Field Station with a 5 bedroom house that will increase housing
capacity to 30 individuals, located in a small campus adjacent to a new
classroom/meeting facility. The new housing, along with the recently constructed
classroom building, will increase the number of students and underrepresented
groups visiting the site as well as support a growing research program.

The Shortgrass Steppe Field Station is located on the Central Plains
Experimental Range (CPER) in northeastern Colorado. Experiments have been
conducted on the CPER since 1938, and the Field Station has been in existence
since the 1960?s. The research conducted at the SGS Field Station is recognized
worldwide as one of the most important sources of new ideas and important
results in grassland ecology. Research at SGS has also had major implications
for land management in the region. The enhancements through this award enable
the Shortgrass Steppe Field Station to remain a multi-institutional center of
excellence for research, education, and natural resource interpretation for
shortgrass steppe ecosystems.
