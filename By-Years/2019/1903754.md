This award supports the workshop "Geometric Representation Theory and
Equivariant Elliptic Cohomology'' to take place June 10--14, 2019, at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. This workshop will provide the
opportunity for mathematicians working in the fields of representation theory,
topology, and mathematical physics to share their research findings and develop
collaborations. Grant funds will be utilized primarily to support the travel and
attendance costs of conference participants, particularly graduate students,
recent PhDs, and researchers who lack their own travel funds.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broadly speaking, representation theory studies
symmetries, topology studies mathematical spaces, and mathematical physics looks
to find mathematical underpinnings for ideas from theoretical physics. These
three areas come together in the burgeoning field of equivariant elliptic
cohomology. This is a particular mathematical object with roots in all three of
these areas of mathematics. A better understanding of this object would both
have deep impacts in these areas and also forge previously unseen connections
between them. The workshops will be advertised internationally, and graduate
students and members of underrepresented groups will be given top priority for
funding. The website for the workshop is

award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
