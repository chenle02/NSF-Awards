Montgomery College - Rockville is annually awarding 40 scholarships to community
college students and 8 scholarships to students who are transferring to a four-
year institution to complete their studies in the fields of computer science,
engineering or mathematics. The scholarship recipients enroll in a one-semester
career development seminar in addition to the normal course of study. During
this seminar course the students write resumes, practice interview skills,
gather information about the offerings of several four-year institutions that
they have interest in attending and are learning to work collaboratively.
Another feature of the program is student - to - student mentoring via the
internet.
