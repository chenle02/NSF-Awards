The research objective of this award is development of a comprehensive theory
and a systematic methodology for design of robotic mechanisms with which human
users interact physically. These mechanisms are often designed to aid people
with disabilities to perform common everyday tasks such as reaching or moving
from one chair to another. Humans in general, and people with disabilities in
particular, possess enormous variability in their capabilities and preferences,
requiring such mechanisms to be flexibly adapted to functional variations.
Solution of such problems often leads to mechanism configurations that do not
conform to either the serial chain or fully parallel architectures that have
historically been the focus of most studies in robotics. The research will
combine fundamentals of kinematic theory, control theory and sensor design to
achieve a comprehensive design methodology. The theory will be developed and the
methodology will be validated through the design of examples of mechanisms
intended to assist disabled individuals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; If successful,
the results of this research will provide researchers with a design framework
for mechanism design that incorporates human interaction as an integral part of
the overall design objective. Because this research will accommodate alternate
mechanism configurations, it has the potential to significantly improve our
ability to design new human-assist devices. The systematic methodology will
provide designers with the tools needed to incorporate the theory of mechanism
design into the design process. A unique user interface for mechanism design,
prototype design solutions, and documentation of the methodology will result
from this research. The PI and research team will promote science and
engineering education among grade school and high school students through
presentations and demonstrations in his Stanford freshmen seminar course, the
FIRST Robotics and FIRST Lego League programs. The project also includes
international collaboration and exchange of personnel with a team at the Centre
for Autonomous Systems at the University of Technology, Sydney, in Australia.
