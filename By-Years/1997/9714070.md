A field model of the sun's inner coronal magnetic field , as observed by the
Ulysses spacecraft at very high latitudes, explained 26-day recurrent energetic
particle events. This project explores the consequences of a revised
heliospheric magnetic field model (Fisk, 1996), including explanation of the
slow solar wind, elemental abundance's in the solar wind, dynamics of pick-up
ions, and cosmic ray modulation. Investigators will research the consequences
on: (1) high latitude recurrent energetic particle events, (2) the propagation
of cosmic rays in the heliosphere, (3) the acceleration of the solar wind, and
(4) the propagation of pick-up ions in the heliosphere. Simultaneously, this
investigation will test the revised model from many vantage points. The
investigators hope to increase understanding of heliospheric dynamics through a
deeper understanding of heliospheric magnetic field.
