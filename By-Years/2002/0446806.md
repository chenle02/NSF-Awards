How do we control our thoughts and actions? This is a age-old question that
penetrates to the heart of studies in mind and behavior. In trying to answer
this question, it has been difficult to avoid the invocation of a "homunculus",
or controller of the mind that essentially runs the show. The problem with the
homunculus is that it sidesteps the fundamental question of control: if the
homunculus is controlling the mind, then who or what is controlling the
homunculus?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With funding from the National Science
Foundation, Dr. Logan and his colleagues will tackle the problem of the
homunculus. The aim is to develop theory and experimental procedures that allow
us to distinguish between thoughts and actions that are controlled voluntarily
by a person (top-down control), from those that are controlled by aspects of the
environment (bottom-up control). This research will extend prior work funded by
NSF on a formal model of control, in which the environment was the only source
of causation for thoughts and actions. The success of this model in accounting
for human performance was surprising and informative, because it suggested that
top-down control was unnecessary to explain behavior that would otherwise appear
volitional. The current research will continue to push this idea in the context
of experiments in which participants must voluntarily switch between two tasks.
Task switching is known to take a toll on performance, but it is debated whether
this toll reflects the workings of voluntary control, or more automatic
processes of memory. The proposed experiments and models promise to make
substantial headway on this debate.
