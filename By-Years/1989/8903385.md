Research will be concentrated on analytical and computational methods for
optimization with emphasis on large- scale problems and parallel solution
methods. Research will focus on several algorithmic areas of nonlinear
programming, network optimization and distributed computation. Particular areas
to be considered include relaxation methods for network flow problems,
convergence analysis of distributed asynchronous optimization algorithms,
communication aspects of parallel algorithms and decomposition methods and
proximal point algorithms for linear and nonlinear programming.
