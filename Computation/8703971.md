This research program investigates by both analytical and computational methods
a broad class of nonlinear waves in continuum mechanics and kinetic theory of
gases. The principal analytical tools include characteristic methods, energy and
spectral methods, the principle of nonlinear superposition. Computational tools
include higher order Godunov schemes, the method of random choice, etc. Research
results will have implications in equilibrium and nonequilibrium gas dynamics,
flood waves, shallow water phenomena, behavior of elastic materials with memory,
elastic- plastic flows, dusty gases, porous media flows, etc.
