DMI-9561304 Trantolo This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will explore ferroelectric (FE) behavior of poly(gamma-benzyl-L-
glutamate), PBLG, which is an alpha-helical polymer when cast from appropriate
solvents. PBLG is known to display peizoelectric (PE) properties when aligned in
magnetic or electric fields. Analysis of the molecular conformation of the
aligned dipoles suggests that the direction of the dipole vector in aligned PBLG
films may be reversed by application of an electric field, thus producing FE
behavior. PBLG also has notable thermal stability, film-forming capability, and
ease of alignment. Phase I will demonstrate FE behavior and continue to explore
mechanically compliant blends of PBLG with poly(isoprene) and poly(styrene).
This material could be useful for its PE and FE behavior and fi9nd application
in transducers and and electro-optical switching. These include pyroelectric
detectors, ultrasonic and electro-acoustic transducers, and ultrasonic light
modulators.
