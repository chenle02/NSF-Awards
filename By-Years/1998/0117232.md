0117232 &lt;br/&gt;Batarseh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This project
supports a US-Jordan Workshop on Modern Power Electronics to be held in Amman,
Jordan in May 2002. The co-organizers are Dr. Issa Batarseh, School of
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Central Florida,
Orlando, and Dr. Sadeq Hamaed, Faculty of Engineering, University of Jordan,
Amman. The workshop will include sessions on power electronics curriculum
development, hardware and software laboratory support, possibilities for joint
research collaboration projects, and academic-industry relations in both
countries. It is expected that at least 25 US and Jordanian scientists from
academic institutions will participate. Representatives from Jordanian
industries will be invited. A publication of the proceedings is planned.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: This project enables eight US scientists to attend
this workshop to discuss with Jordanian scientists the changes taking place in
the engineering curriculum for training power electronics engineers in the two
countries. With its focus on discussions of detailed course offerings, at both
undergraduate and graduate levels, the workshop will explore the current
industry needs for power electronics engineers. &lt;br/&gt;
