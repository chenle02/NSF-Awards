Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Proposal 0427202&lt;br/&gt;U of Cal Los

Quality&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Event-driven programming, where tasks are divided
into cooperatively-scheduled "handlers" that react to external events, has found
pervasive acceptance from high-performance servers to embedded systems
&lt;br/&gt;as an efficient method for interacting with the world. Unfortunately,
the loose coupling of handlers obscures program control flow and
interdependencies, making programs hard to debug, maintain, and
validate.&lt;br/&gt;This research program investigates a new generation of
programming language and tool support for event-driven programs constructed out
of modular components. As representative test systems, it focuses on Click, a
performance-constrained modular software router, and TinyOS, a resource-
constrained operating system for embedded wireless sensors. All phases of the
programming process are addressed, from the languages used to write event-driven
programs, through automated verifiers and analyses that&lt;br/&gt;ensure safety
properties (such as bounding the latency required to handle an event), to
optimizers that reduce code size, optimize system structures, and meet global
resource constraints. Next-generation language and tool support will lead to
increased confidence in a wide variety of event-driven systems, including Web
servers, sensor networks, medical implants, engine control, and fly-by-
wire/drive-by-wire systems, and will make this important methodology easier to
teach. New compilers and analysis tools will be made publicly available.
