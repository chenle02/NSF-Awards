9732353 Smith Scripps Institution of Oceanography will continue development of
a deep sea autonomous vehicle (AUV) capability that will provide a platform for
a variety of sensors of interest to the ocean science community. This proposal
builds on the work and experience gained during development of the ROVER
vehicle. The project involves development of an advanced ROVER II, with major
modifications in the instrument assembly and payload configuration to
accommodate an optical acoustic imaging system and a sequential multiple coring
system. These new sensing and sampling systems also will require modification of
the central controller package. ROVER II is envisioned to be an autonomous
bottom-transecting instrument for making time-series measurements of
phytopigmnet fluorescence and acoustically detectable sediment structure. This
vehicle addresses questions of significant interest and concern to a broad
spectrum of marine biogeochemists and benthic biologists. Time-series
measurements of the responses of benthic communities to pulsed Particulate
Organic Matter (POM) delivery, and the resultant distribution and fate of
organic matter within surface sediments, is critical to our understanding of the
role of benthic-pelagic coupling in basin- wide chemical cycling budgets.
