The proposed work will explore the feasibility of fabricating a tactile sensor
entirely with optical materials such a sensor would be useful for robotic
applications in harsh environments where electronic sensors could not survive.
The initial work will be directed at the fabrication of a 3x3 sensor array,
using sensors made of hirefringent material in the shape of a cube about 1mm on
a side. Forces on the sensor are detected using polarized light and transmitted
using fiber optic cable.
