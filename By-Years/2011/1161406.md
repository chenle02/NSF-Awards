Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The 2012 Origins of Life Gordon Research
Conference (GRC) and Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) will be held on January 8-13
and 7-8, respectively at the Hotel Galvez in Galveston, TX. The overarching goal
of the 2012 Origin of Life Gordon Conference, (GRC), will be to foster new
collaborations that will move us toward a more complete understanding of the
origin, distribution and early history of living systems. Towards this end, the
2012 GRC will create a forum for the synthesis and evaluation of new concepts,
and a mechanism to clarify and crystallize new research directions. The Origin
of Life GRC fills a unique role: there are no other meetings allowing focused
discussion on just the Origin of Life problem in the US. The GRC will bring
together scientists with a common interest in the Origin of Life and overlapping
specializations for a week of intense discussion and examination of the most
advanced topics in the field. Some of the proposed meeting topics
include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genetics, Energetics and
Compartmentalization&lt;br/&gt;Organics in Meteorites&lt;br/&gt;Early Earth
Environments&lt;br/&gt;Prebiotic Chemistry and Self-
Organization&lt;br/&gt;Laboratory Models of Cellular Processes&lt;br/&gt;Early
Translation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;At this year's
conference, approximately 25% of the speakers will be women. It is anticipated
that the majority of the session chairs for both the GRS and the GRC will also
be women prominent in their respective disciplines. A concerted effort has been
made to advertise the meeting to national and international organizations,
including former attendees of GRC and GRS meetings in this and other
disciplines, the members of all of the major international astrobiological
societies, as well as SACNAS (a society of scientists dedicated to advancing
Hispanics/Chicanos and Native Americans in science) and Spelman College, a
historically black women?s college in Atlanta, GA.
