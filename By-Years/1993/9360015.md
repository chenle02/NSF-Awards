9360015 Mandel This project is to study a new class of very promising highly
parallel iterative methods for the solution of large scale systems which arise
from high order elements (the p- version finite element method) in three-
dimensional elasticity for structures with plates, shells and junctures. The
size of problems on interest now rules our direct solvers, but high order
elements, particularly thin elements, give rise to very ill-conditioned systems
of equations, which necessitate new specific preconditioners. The plan in Phase
I is to investigate new methods for preconditioning thin solid high order
elements and to study their performance on three-dimensional problems with up to
over one million degrees of freedom. The design and development will be guided
by theoretical analyses as well as extensive experimentation. Phase I will
result in a coarse grained parallel prototype code running on CRAY-YMP. Phase II
will be concerned with eliminating bottlenecks for very large problems,
extending the capabilities of the method to include complicated goemetries and
development of production level software for CRAY-YMP and IBM SP-1. The project
will further knowledge in the areas of multilevel and domain decomposition
computational methods on parallel supercomputers. The availability of the
proposed methods will have a significant impact on mechanical engineering
practice.
