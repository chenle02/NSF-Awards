9802855 Saloff-Coste This research focuses on certain Markov processes that
evolve in a geometric environment. The relations between the long time behavior
of the process and the geometry are studied. In the context of finite Markov
chains, analytic and geometric tools are developed to obtain quantitative
results concerning ergodicity. The role of Sobolev type inequalities is
investigated. For random walk on finite groups, the relation between the
behavior of the walk and the structure of the group is studied. The behavior of
random walk on infinite Cayley graphs and its relation with isoperimetric
inequalities are investigated. Examples showing exotic behaviors are produced by
considering wreath products and studying the Laplace transform of the number of
visited points and other related functionals. In the context of Brownian motion
on Riemannian manifolds, the investigator will study two-sided global heat
kernel bounds on manifolds with ends. This requires hitting time estimates for
compact regions and bounds on the Dirichlet heat kernel of unbounded regions.
Some problems concerning Gaussian measures on locally compact groups will also
be investigated. This research is concerned with basic properties of certain
random processes. A familiar yet typical example is the question of how many
times a deck of cards must be shuffled to be mixed well. Random processes
similar to card shuffling are used in computer programs to perform tasks for
which no efficient deterministic algorithm is known. Understanding how well
these stochastic algorithms work is important and calls for precise mathematical
studies. Different generalizations of card shuffling lead to the study of random
processes on different types of mathematical structures. The investigator will
study the long time behavior of these processes.
