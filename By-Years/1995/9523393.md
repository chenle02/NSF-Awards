Abstract - Bequette - 9523393 This grant is to permit the PI to spend a one-
semester internship at an industrial research laboratory. The objective of the
collaborative research to be done by the PI and the industrial researchers is to
develop techniques to rapidly reform batch chemical reactor modeling, scale-up
and control. The industrial researchers use reaction calorimetry for research,
development and safety applications, treating the kinetics of a wide range of
reactions from sulfite chemistry to chiral heterogeneous catalytic and
homogeneous catalytic hydrogenations. For the planned collaboration, reaction
calorimetry will be used to understand kinetic and heat effects in chemical
reactors. Pilot scale tests will be performed to determine the heat transfer
characteristics of pilot plant vessels. Simulation and experimental control
studies will be performed using pilot plant reactors. These results will be used
to develop scale-up and control strategies for production-scale reactors.
