This is a research program in a northern peatland ecosystem to improve the
understanding of surface fluxes of methane. Included in the program are the
measurement and analysis of "really-integrated" methane fluxes, the
characterization of pertinent environmental factors that control methane
emission, and modeling to estimate annual methane emissions from major peatland
types in the northern hemisphere. Our experimental approach will utilize
micrometeorological eddy correlation techniques, employing tunable diode laser
spectroscopy (TDLS), for measuring surface fluxes of methane. Conventional
chamber methods will also be used to provide supporting information.
