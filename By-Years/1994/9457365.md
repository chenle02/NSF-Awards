Susan Tucker is supported by an NSF Young Investigator Grant from the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to study solvent effects on
solute reactivity in supercritical fluids. In the supercritical regime, solvent
properties vary dramatically, but continuously, with modest changes in
temperature and pressure. Tucker will use computer simulation techniques, such
as reactive flux molecular dynamics and umbrella sampling Monte Carlo, to
explore the microscopic details of both dynamic and static solvent effects on
solute reaction rates. Initially she will focus on the hydrolysis of alkyl aryl
ethers, e.g. anisole, 2-methoxynaphthalene, in supercritical water. The rates of
these charge transfer reactions are sensitive to solvent properties, and thus
provide a stringent test of theoretical predictions. These reactions have also
been subjected to extensive experimental studies. In addition, mathematical
models for solvent effects within the generalized Langevin equation and the
Caldeira-Leggett/Zwanzig Hamiltonian will be explored in order to develop new
theories for describing the effect of changing solvent properties on solute
reactivity. Supercritical fluids have found widespread application in many
industrial extraction processes. They are also being used for environmental
remediation. A unified theoretical description of the unique behaviors observed
in supercritical fluid solvents would provide a significant contribution to
predicting how thermodynamic conditions might affect solute reactivity in
supercritical fluids, and aid in the development of industrial processes which
make use of these technologically important solvents.
