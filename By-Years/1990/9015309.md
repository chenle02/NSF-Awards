This research is focused on developing a general lubrication theory based on
the principles of modern continuum mechanics that could account for the
existence of both solid particulates and fluid additives in the lubricant.
Specifically, the theoretical development shall be based on the balance laws of
the interacting contua known as the mixture theory. The governing equations and
appropriate boundary conditions are to be derived. It is proposed to apply the
theory to predict realistic performance characteristics of various multiphase
lubricants in the most common types of mechanical components such as the
hydrodynamic slider and journal bearings. The governing equations are to be
solved numerically on the CRAY Supercomputer at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing
Center. Result shall be presented in dimensionless form useful to the designer.
Based on the findings, recommendations shall be made for the development of
alternative lubricants that can perform under severe operating conditions.
