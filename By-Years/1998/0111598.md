Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0111598&lt;br/&gt;R. Arndt, Et. Al, University of
Minnesota&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI requests funding for the purchase of a
high-resolution stereoscopic particle image velocimetry. This system will be
used to characterize complex turbulent flows at very small scales in four
different projects under the directions of the PI and the three Co-PI's. The
projects include atmospheric boundary layers, relationship between interfacial
mass transfer and free-surface turbulence, effect of small-scale motion on
biological systems, and two phase flows associated with partial cavitation. All
four investigators have currently funded projects in each of the four proposed
fields of study and research studies are in active progress.
