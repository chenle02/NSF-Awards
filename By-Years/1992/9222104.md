This research is part of a broad effort to determine the means by which the
human visual system processes the pattern of light falling on the retina, in
order to determine the white, gray or black level of surfaces within a person's
field of view. It is generally accepted that perceived surface gray levels are
based on relative light intensities extracted from intensity gradients in the
retinal image, but little is known about how these relative intensities are
anchored, that is, processed to yield the specific shades of gray that we see.
Strictly speaking, relative intensities provide information only about relative
shades of gray. Absolute shades of gray can be derived only with the addition of
an anchoring rule. For instance, in many scenes the visual system automatically
treats the highest intensity as white. This can be demonstrated under the
simplest conditions by placing an observer's head inside a large dome, half of
the interior of which is painted black and half of which is painted gray. The
gray part will appear white and the black part will appear gray, consistent with
the highest-intensity-as-white rule. However, if an observer's head is placed
within a uniformly painted black dome containing a white disk at its center, the
black dome appears white and the disk appears luminous. This would follow from a
rule by which white is assigned to the surrounding region, not to the highest
intensity. In this research, human observers will be placed in a variety of
visual environments, chosen to distinguish different potential anchoring rules.
These will include simple patterns on large plastic domes that completely
surround the viewer, more complex lab displays, computer simulated displays, and
on-site natural scenes. Analysis of how the anchoring rules change as the visual
field becomes increasingly complex may well fill an important gap in the
modelling of surface color perception.
