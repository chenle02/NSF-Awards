The objective of this award is to provide support for 80 students to participate
in the Twenty-Ninth Annual International Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF)
Symposium - An Additive Manufacturing Conference, to be held in Austin, Texas,
12-14 August 2019. The SFF Symposium is widely considered the premier academic
conference on additive manufacturing (AM) related research in the world. In
2018, it brought together 683 researchers from universities, national
laboratories, and companies from 19 countries around the world, who together
presented 529 technical presentations and posters during the 3-day event.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By attending and presenting their work at this symposium,
students will have the opportunity to interact with leading researchers in their
field, learn about cutting-edge research and challenging problems across the AM
research community, and mature themselves professionally as future leaders in AM
research and development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
