9410626 Jackson This research will examine how commercial bank deposit rates
respond to changes in market interest rates, and how the speed of response
depends on market characteristics. The empirical study uses data on the interest
rates banks set for different types of deposits. The empirical models control
for the way banks in different localities change prices in response to changes
in national Treasury Bill rates, and allow for the possiblity that banks
determine service quality, among other things. This project is significant
because it provides results that would be a useful contribution to our knowledge
of the importance and determinants of price rigidities in the banking industry.
