Agricultural crops, which are usually planted as genetic monocultures, are
notoriously prone to disease. Natural plant populations, by contrast, are rarely
as infected by disease; they are also typically genetically variable. Recently,
biologists have postulated that the genetic diversity typical of natural
populations may be a product of natural selection exerted by disease organisms,
but few studies have tested this hypothesis. The investigators will examine the
role of disease in maintaining host genetic variation by comparing resistance of
closely related species in the mustard family to a rust disease. Some of these
mustard species have no genetic variability, whereas other species are
genetically variable. For disease to be capable of promoting genetic variation,
the disease must exert strong selection on its hosts; that is, it must decrease
survival and/or reproduction of the hosts, and resistance must be inherited. The
goals of this study are to determine whether these conditions are met, as well
as to determine whether the genetically uniform species are less resistant to
disease than the genetically variable species, and whether the composition of
natural vegetation is different in places with and without this disease.
