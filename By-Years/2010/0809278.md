Wiley College is a Historically Black College, founded in 1873. The institutions
will utilize HBCU-UP funding to 1) assess Wiley College student perception of
science; 2) assess effectiveness of teaching/learning strategies; 3) assess the
strength of the college's student support services. The expected outcome of this
project will be a better understanding of the institution's STEM programs, and
the development of strategies that will strengthen the undergraduate STEM
program at Wiley College.
