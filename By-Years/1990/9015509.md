This project will focus on the Colorado Plateau and adjoining regions where an
inferred Proterozoic-aged, peridotite root extends to a depth of approximately
80-100 km and is surrounded by rifted continental lithosphere. Abundant samples
of the upper mantle occur in volcanic rocks on and off the Colorado Plateau, and
some mineral phases in these xenoliths record the recent compositional history
of the lithosphere. Trace element abundances (REE,Ti,Zr,Hf,Sr) of mineral phases
will be used to deduce the variation in the bulk composition of the lithosphere
vertically and laterally, the nature of the phases involved in recent magmatic
or metasomatic events, the nature of any trace element fractionations (e.g.,
REE/HFSE) coincident with these events, and the timing of these events from
modelling of zoning profiles. Principal analytical tools will be the ion and
electron microprobes for in situ analysis of trace and major elements.
