This study examines the relationship between agrarian change and social
inequality. It is concerned with the local level effects of the shift from self-
provisioning production to participation in the commodity economy in
northeastern Ghana, where labor migration and market agriculture have been the
major factors precipitating this kind of transformation. The student has an
excellent background. She has already produced publishable work and has spent
time in Ghana preparaing for this research project. Her dissertation research
should result in valuable insights into the current African agrarian crises, of
interest not only to anthropologists but to those concerned with agricultural
development in Third World countries.
