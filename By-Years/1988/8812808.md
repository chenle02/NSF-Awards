People in class and multiethnic societies often use langauge and religion as a
means to assert identity. Class relations in turn affect kinship relationships
and ideas about gender. During this project the researcher will test the
hypothesis that working classes in developing countries use religion as a means
to counter the claims of, and in opposition to, elites. He will specifically
study the linguistic and social dimensions of Circum-Caribbean popular religion
in Cartagena, Columbia which Columbian elites have defined as insufficiently
Christian and as a cause of purportedly deviant family structures. He will focus
on how both men and women have been affected by this categorization. Religion is
the most important public domain in Latin America. This project will increase
our understanding of how class and religion interact and affect other areas of
life in developing countries.
