At least five independent research programs in the Department of Zoology at the
University of Florida depend upon ready access to a modern, reliable Atomic
Absorption Spectrophotometer (AA Spec) for elemental analysis. These include
studies on mechanisms of ion and acid-base regulation in decapod crustaceans,
mineral nutrition of the green turtle Chelonia mydas, ion transport in
elasmobranch red cells, the role of ions in the evolution of viviparity in
reptiles, and ions and body fluid regulation in snakes. The requested AA Spec
would replace an inoperable instrument, the only one of its kind on campus. The
model requested is fully automated, offering the most versatile state-of-the-art
capabilities for multiple users.
