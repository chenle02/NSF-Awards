In conjunction with Dr. Knupp of the University of Alabama, the Principal
Investigator will conduct an observational and numerical modeling study of deep
convective storms. Specific objectives include: Investigate the effects of
condensate loading/unloading and phase change on updraft/downdraft vertical
acceleration. Using advanced radar techniques, determine the mix of various
hydrometeor species within deep convection. Develop and apply a radar scan
simulation model which will be used to evaluate the accuracy of wind and
hydrometeor fields derived from the respective multiple Doppler and multi-
parameter radar analyses. If successful, this research will help clarify the
relationships and interactions between the thermodynamics and microphysics of
deep convective storms.
