Ball State University will initiate a four-week, residential Young Scholars
project in Physics and Engineering for 24 students entering grades 11 and 12.
Instructional workshop materials will emphasize the use of electronic
instrumentation such as oscilloscopes and meters as well as the use of
integrated circuits as modules in building electronic circuits. During the on-
campus portion of the workshop the students will be divided into six independent
research groups and each group will develop a research project to be completed
by the end of the fourth week. Each participant will be given a kit of
electronic components and reference materials which they will use during their
follow-up activities.
