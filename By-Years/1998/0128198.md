This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop as well as
establish technical and commercial feasibility of the advanced low weight
thermal and electrical insulation materials using fullerenes. This approach
combines high reflectivity of metal foil and high absorptivity of low thermal
conductivity fullerenes in attempt to produce effective structurally integrated
low cost insulation material, which is expected to be much thinner than any
other option currently available on the market. During the course of
investigation, the proposed insulation materials will be fabricated and fully
characterized in terms of density, thermal conductivity as well mechanical
integrity and compared with other candidate materials. The approach should
provide viable solutions to various heat management problems in numerous fields.
If proved viable, this insulation will find extensive applications in rockets
and satellites, cryogenic industry, electronic devices, fire-retardant packing
materials, thermal insulators for temperature-sensitive products, insulative
clothing, insulation of buildings, cars, refrigerators, water heaters, etc.
