9322115 Elliot Stellar occultations can probe ring systems and atmospheres of
planets in the outer Solar System with spatial resolutions of a few kilometers
-- about a thousand times better than the resolution of any other Earth-based
method. Drs. James Elliot and Heidi Hammel will observe the highest quality
occultations by the giant planet systems that occur during the period 1994-1998.
They will use these data to investigate various physical characteristics of
rings and/or atmospheres of Uranus, Jupiter, Saturn, Titan, and Neptune. The
first year of the award includes support to involve undergraduate students in
the research effort.
