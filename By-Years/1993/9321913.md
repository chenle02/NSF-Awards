9321913 Oka This work continues the success efforts to observe and analyze their
strong infrared emissions of H3+ in planetary ionospheres and possibly in
supernova 1987A. The effort will be continued to find the H3+ spectrum in other
astronomical objects, especially in molecular clouds. The experimental and
theoretical studies will be attempted using hot laboratory plasmas and new near
infrared lasers along with midinfrared laser sources. Two new discharge cells
will be used to identify novel spectra of molecular ions. A determined effort
will be made to identify spectra of protonated methane and oxygen using a hollow
cathode discharge cell in a magnetic field. Furthermore, a new method of ion
spectroscopy will be introduced using ionized cryogenic solids instead of hot
plasmas. Gamma rays from 60Co will be used to ionize para-hydrogen crystals to
form atoms and ion clusters. A Fourier transform spectrometer and possibly laser
spectrometer will be used to observe their infrared spectra. If successful, the
method will be extended to other cluster ions by introducing other molecules in
crystals as impurities. ***
