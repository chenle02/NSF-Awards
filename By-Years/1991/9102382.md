Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have the potential to revolutionize rapid
hardware prototyping both in industry and in university research and
instruction. To realize this potential, FPGA placement and routing tools must be
orders of magnitude faster than those currently available. This project is
investigating the use of incremental placement and routing to speed up FPGA
design. Design is an iterative process characterized by small changes. By
processing design changes as minimally as possible, incremental placement and
routing has the potential to be dramatically faster than conventional tools
which must reprocess an entire design from scratch. For placement, a generalized
incremental form of the force-directed algorithm with time-varying cost
functions is being investigated. Routing is being investigated using incremental
penalty-driven iterative improvement and a generalized graph representation of
routing resources. The algorithms produced will be implemented to demonstrate
their efficacy and at the same time provide high-quality FPGA design tools. As a
side benefit, the algorithms will also be applicable to conventional IC and PC
board placement and routing tasks.
