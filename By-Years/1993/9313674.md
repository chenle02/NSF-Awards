9313674 Wiebe Wiebe and collaborators will establish and operate a Program
Service and Data Management Office for the U.S. GLOBEC Northwest Atlantic
Georges Bank program. This Program will investigate the potential effects of
climate change on the Georges Bank ecosystem through understanding of the
physical and biological processes which control the zooplankton and larval fish
populations on the bank. The Program Service and Data Management Office will
provide the basic common services, logistical support, and data management
required by the principal investigators (and the Program) as they conduct their
field research, analyze the data from their individual efforts, and integrate
the results with those from other research components. For this initial phase of
the Georges Bank Program, the Chairman of the Executive Committee will serve as
the operational coordinator and will oversee the Office.
