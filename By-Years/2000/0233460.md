This design study will help funded MSP project "pull it all together" and
reflect on their designs in light of the challenges posed by large-scale reform
and will help to ensure that the assistance the MSPs receive from multiple
sources is more coherent. The PIs list key challenges for the MSPs (creating and
sustaining a shared vision for reform; designing, implementing and evaluating
reform interventions; and ensure that reforms become institutionalized. This
design study will provide assistance to the individual sites to help them work
effectively with these challenges. The outcome will be a web-based Handbook that
incorporates the most current thinking approaches to meeting these challenges.
