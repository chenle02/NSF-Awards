This award provides funding to help cover the travel expenses of participants
from the U.S. in the "Workshop on partial differential equations and several
complex variables" that will be held August 3 - 7, 2015, in Serra Negra, Brazil.

The workshop will focus on recent developments in closely related areas of
analysis and geometry, namely, several complex variables, overdetermined systems
of partial differential equations, and CR geometry. Two mini-courses designed
for graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s will form an important part of the
workshop. The first mini-course will be taught by Mei-Chi Shaw who will lecture
on Cauchy-Riemann equations in complex manifolds. The second mini-course will be
on semi global solvability of complex vector fields and it will be taught by
Abdelhamid Meziani. The workshop will provide opportunities for graduate
students and recent Ph.D.'s to present and discuss their research results.
