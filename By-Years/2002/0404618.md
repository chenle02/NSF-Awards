This plan is centered on industrial decision-making, natural resource
development, and environmental protection. The research component will compare
four case studies of land-use/land-cover change within mineral exraction regions
of the Americas. (Arizona US, Sonora Mexico, Orinoco Belt Venezuela, and
southern Andes Peru) An analysis of the impact of mineral investment on land
values, land-use, and land-cover over time will use data derived from interviews
with local land users combined with information from local archival sources.
This information will be used to construct a model of the socioeconomic
mechnisms through which direct investment drives land-use/land-cover change.
Both direct land-cover change (at the site of the extraction activity) and
indirect land-cover change (land values change and supporting infrastructural
development) will be researched.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational component
will result in the development of two interdisciplinary courses to be team-
taught with colleagues from Business, Economics, and the Institute for Energy
Economics and Policy, and a program of K-12 outreach in partnership with the
Oklahoma Alliance for Geographic Education to develop curriculum materials which
assist teachers in meeting the National Geography Standards.
