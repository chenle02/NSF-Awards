The award supports research in the field of algebraic geometry, the discipline
devoted to the study of polynomial or algebraic equations. Algebraic equations
are both beautiful and ubiquitous, as they describe many natural phenomena, from
the motion of planets to the shape of leaves and flowers, to the behavior of
microscopic particles. The goal of this research project is to study the deeper
properties of the solutions to more complicated algebraic equations (called
algebraic maps). The investigator plans to continue long-term investigation of
the topology, Hodge theory, and cycle theory of algebraic maps. The close
connection between the two main threads of the research, namely the discovery of
new and deep aspects of the general theory and the study of fundamental
examples, are the motivating principle behind the work. It is anticipated that
the results will be of use to mathematicians (in algebraic geometry,
combinatorics, and representation theory) and to mathematical physicists (in
string theory). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will explore the
fundamental aspects of the general theory as well as important examples through
three projects: to determine the supports of Hitchin fibrations and to establish
and explain certain remarkable hidden symmetries on the cohomology of the moduli
spaces of Higgs bundles; to identify and study classes of maps for which the
decomposition theorem holds over a finite field; and to establish a relation
between birational maps and arc spaces by linking the supports in the
decomposition theorem with special subvarieties of arcs.
