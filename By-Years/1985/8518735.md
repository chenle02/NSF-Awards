This research explores the possibilities of automation of error-handling for
robot assembly tasks. The ability to cope with uncertainties due to errors,
failures, or other unplanned situations is critical to the effectiveness of
machines and robots. That capability depends on the machines having access to
information about tasks, objects, tools, and the work environment. This project
centers on the question of what information needs to be available to a machine
to detect and handle unexpected situations. This involves issues of
characterizing the required information, automating its acquisition, deciding on
appropriate representations of the information for real-time use, distinguishing
an error condition from normal events, tracing causes of errors, and generating
recovery procedures.
