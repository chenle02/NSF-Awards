This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to develop
high-power mid-IR CW semiconductor laser diodes. The mid-IR laser diode will be
grown via MOCVD on an InP substrate using a novel technique that overcomes the
strain limitation on wavelength in the InP system. By making use of the well-
developed technology for the growth and fabrication of InP-based lasers, high
power, low-threshold and efficient lasers will be obtained in this previously
inaccessible wavelength range. The development of mid-IR lasers will have
important applications for gas monitoring, LIDAR systems, and Infra-red
countermeasures. Growth of these long wavelength lasers by MOCVD will enable
large scale production and hence reduce the cost of these devices.
