9350995 Baum The project will enhance the physical chemistry experience of
undergraduates by exposing them to state-of-the art techniques involving laser-
based spectroscopy and molecular modeling. The major focus of this project will
be to show students how experiment and theory complement one another in
determining the properties of molecules. The requested low-cost instrumentation
will allow implementation of a variety of projects including laser Raman
spectroscopy, laser induced fluorescence, kinetics of fast excited- state
reactions (down to 5 ns) and bimolecular processes, and the study of charge
transfer complexes. In each case, the student will utilize SPARTAN to calculate
and visualize the molecular properties appropriate to the experiment such as
geometry, bond strength, vibrational modes, molecular orbitals, electron
density, excited-- state properties, ionization energies, and intermolecular
interactions. These activities will illustrate many of the important concepts
and applications of physical chemistry.
