During their late stages of evolution, stars of roughly 1 solar mass eject their
outer, hydrogen-rich envelopes and thereby produce so-called planetary nebulae
(i.e., expanding gaseous shells that, despite the nomenclature, have nothing to
do with planets). The remaining stellar cores (i.e., the central stars of the
planetary nebulae) consist predominantly of helium, though heavier elements may
be present as well. The Principal Investigator proposes to study the formation
of planetary nebulae and the evolution of their central stars, with particular
attention paid to determining the elemental abundances present in the precursor
stars, the nebulae, and the central stars of planetary nebulae. The work will
include the compiling of a "Catalogue of Spectrum Line Intensities" of planetary
nebulae.
