The current dominant paradigm in cosmic ray (CR) research says that the bulk of
Galactic CRs with energies below a peta-electron volt are created in supernova
remnants (SNRs) via diffusive shock acceleration. This is now at a turning
point: soon, the comparison between theoretical calculations and observations
from the radio band to gamma rays to high energy neutrinos is expected to either
confirm the paradigm or call for a paradigm shift. This project will develop
novel theoretical and observational techniques to test the SNR paradigm. The
theoretical studies are based around a common theme: how do cosmic rays modify
the structure of the shock? The work will investigate magnetic field
amplification, injection and acceleration of CRs, and the role of dust
sputtering and the large neutral component in the upstream plasma. Analysis of
neutral hydrogen in the so-called Balmer-dominated shocks should lead to a novel
way to measure the shock acceleration efficiency. The research will include
consideration of how cosmic rays escape their acceleration sites and propagate
towards the Earth and of the kinetic diffusion of CRs. Modeling of time- and
spatially-dependent particle dynamics will be compared with observed non-thermal
filaments and tied to the results of high energy particle observations.

This is a multidisciplinary project involving data analysis and theoretical and
computational work in astrophysics and plasma physics. Work with students in the
Purdue Computer Graphics Technology Department will lead to an interactive
kiosk, in partnership with Purdue's Discovery Learning Center, to explain about
CRs to all visiting groups, including K-12 students, teachers, and the general
public.
