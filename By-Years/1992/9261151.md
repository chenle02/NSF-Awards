A new type of infrared multipixel staring array is proposed based upon the
recently observed phenomenon of photofluxonics. The sensor is based on a simple
Josephson junction and is the magnetic analogue of a CCD photosensor; a novel
device geometry allows the direct conversion of photons to fluxons. The
quantized nature of the photon to fluxon conversion process affords a very low
NDP. Experiments indicate that single quantum sensitivity in the infrared and
far infrared range of the spectrum is possible. An array of such detectors would
be an all thin film, monolithic, focal plane device with inherently low power
consumption. It will be possible to implement the associated read out
electronics on the same substrate. Phase I will demonstrate the photofluxonic
effect in a Nb-Al203- Nb Josephson junction and, according to the results,
optimize the preliminary design for an array of superconducting photosensitive
pixels. Although well characterized low Tc superconductors will be used in Phase
I, the photofluxonic effect has also been observed in high Tc superconductors
and there seems to be no major impediment to implementing the technology with
high Tc materials in Phase II.
