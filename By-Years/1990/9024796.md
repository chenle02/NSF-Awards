This project is concerned with problems in 3-dimensional manifold theory
through the application and extension of differential geometric methods. It aims
to explore the classification of non-Haken 3-manifolds and their
diffeomorphisms, Heegaard splittings of 3-manifolds and universal coverings of
3- manifolds. The plan is to use the theory of minimal surfaces and of flows and
evolution equations to study these problems. Three- dimensional manifolds are
very natural objects of study, inasmuch as the space we live in (ignoring time)
has three dimensions, but a surprising amount remains to be learned about them.
