DePauw University with the collaboration of the Anita Borg Institute (ABI) and
the University of Virginia, and in partnership with the ACM Women's Council
(ACM-W) and the National Center for Women and IT (NCWIT), proposes to create
self-sustaining, regional communities of women in computing. National-level
activities, such as the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, have
positively impacted thousands of women. They cannot, however, reach all women.
In particular, national meetings have limited ability to recruit women from
isolated areas of the country, to include women at institutions that cannot
afford expensive and time-consuming travel to national meetings, to provide
leadership roles, to encourage participation by high school students, and to
support interactions that are frequent enough to spark and sustain
collaborations among budding students and professionals. This project -- called
WWW.2 for Wide Web of Women -- aims to overcome these impediments. The project
will create twelve new and upgraded Regional Celebrations of Women in Computing
that will bring students, faculty and indistry representatives together for
biennial conferences. The conferences will increase women?s participation in
computing through intentional role modeling, networking, group and indivudal
career mentoring, providing career information, and oportunities for experiences
in presenting their work. The attendees will be encouraged to continue their
interactions between Celebrations, for example, by forming ACM-W student
chapters, hosting multi-institutional get togethers, and maintaining connections
through a wiki. Focusing on women (as well as regions) serves a population
powerfully united by gender, yet diverse in experience, with personal stories
varying by race, ethnicity, disability, and sexual orientation. This "Web of
Women" will build momentum toward a tipping point of cultural change in
stereotypes about gender and computing.
