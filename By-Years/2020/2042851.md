The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a non-invasive screening tool that will allow physicians to
accurately and objectively screen for cardiovascular diseases, regardless of
symptom presence. Cardiovascular diseases are often only diagnosed in late
stages after heart function is severely diminished. Early detection of
asymptomatic patients could lead to less invasive or earlier treatment to
prevent disease progression and identify new late-stage patients in need of
life-saving procedures. The proposed technology discriminates between abnormal
and normal sounds, using artificial intelligence for improved efficiency and
accuracy in cardiovascular screening. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project
is based on the development of an artificial intelligence-based diagnostic
algorithm that uses heart sounds recorded from a digital stethoscope, similar to
the devices currently used by doctors during routine physical exams, to classify
cardiovascular disease stage. The proposed technology uses a database that
correlates heart sounds to disease stage and cardiac function. In addition, the
proposed technology standardizes and analyzes descriptors of sound to reduce
user-dependent disease classification error.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
