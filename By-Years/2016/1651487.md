This research will systematically investigate how to make information technology
more accessible to users from varied cultural backgrounds. Research shows that
user interfaces designed for undifferentiated markets are less usable, less
intuitive, and less appealing than are locally designed interfaces, making users
less efficient and less satisfied. The results will inform novel user interface
design guidelines and help build both models and tools for interface designers
and end users that support the automated adaption of web interfaces to specific
cultural groups. Guidelines and tools to be produced in this project will assist
businesses in making decisions about, reducing costs associated with, and
increasing total revenue and net income derived from preparing products for
international markets. Educational goals of this project are to (1) involve high
school and undergraduate students from varied cultural and demographic
backgrounds in this research, (2) create and disseminate open-source educational
materials that immediately affect designers' understanding and creation of
inclusive website designs, and (3) use citizen scientists to participate in and
promote research results to the public.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;To foster
information inclusiveness, this research aims to translate seminal lab-based
studies on visual perception into large-scale online experiments that will be
administered globally on our experiment platform, LabintheWild. The research
will systematically investigate the influence of human diversity on visual
perception and on user interface design. Traditional academic studies conducted
with small, locally recruited convenience samples are not always generalizable
given their skew toward unrepresentative test subjects. This research will
vastly extend conventional study populations using a proven crowdsourced
experiment platform and thereby more generalizably contribute to the knowledge
domains of visual perception, cultural psychology, human-computer interaction,
and adaptive user interfaces by providing: (1) scientific findings on human
perception that compare people from at least 30 countries and varied demographic
backgrounds (2) best practice, data-driven user interface design guidelines for
these groups, (3) predictive models and tools that support the automated
adaption of web interfaces to varied user backgrounds, and (4) evaluations of
whether these tools successfully improve work efficiency and user satisfaction.
