Oceanic mixing is largely due to turbulence arising from instabilities. This
proposal will address the effects of velocity fluctuations of inertial
oscillations in producing a shear field which will cause the breaking of
internal waves. The study combines analytical and numerical modeling. PI's have
recently collected oceanographic data which has guided them in the construction
of the model to be used.
