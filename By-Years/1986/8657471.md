Narrative: This award supports a Presidential Young Investigator (PYI) to study
a variety of Biochemical Engineering problems. A major thrust will be made to
develop genetically engineered proteins with improved physical and catalytic
characteristics. Enhanced thermostability of industrially important enzymes will
be generated using in vitro techniques, such as site specific mutagenesis and by
chemical mutagenesis followed by cloning into thermophilic bacterium and
selection of mutants that synthesize temperature tolerant derivatives of the
original protein. Also, economical protein recovery schemes will be sought
through the construction of gene fusions of the target gene to synthetic
oligonucleotides coding for sequences that confer properties which can be
exploited for efficient recovery of bioproducts. Studies will also be performed
in optimizing the production of recombinant proteins. This effort should result
in new applications and greater impact of recombinant DNA in chemical
processing.
