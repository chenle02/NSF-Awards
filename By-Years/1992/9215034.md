This proposal requests funds to support two workshops to define the second
Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM) campaign. This campaign will focus on the
physics of the geotail and substorms. The goals of the workshops are to identify
those outstanding problems in geotail and substorm physics that stand in the way
of the development of a magnetospheric global circulation model and that have a
reasonable chance of being solved in a concerted community wide research
campaign lasting three to five years, and to outline possible ways of addressing
those problems. The first workshop will be held in Snowmass, Colorado on July
1-2, 1992. The second workshop will be held in the spring or summedr of 1993 at
a yet-to- be-determine location. Funds are also requested to support the
production and distribution of workshop reports.
