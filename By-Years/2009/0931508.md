CPS: Small: Image Guided Autonomous Optical Manipulation of Cell
Groups&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to create
computational foundation, methods, and tools for efficient and autonomous
optical micromanipulation using microsphere ensembles as grippers. The
envisioned system will utilize a holographic optical tweezer, which uses
multiple focused optical traps to position microspheres in three-dimensional
space. The proposed approach will focus on the following areas. First, it will
provide an experimentally validated optical-tweezers based workstation for
concurrent manipulation of multiple cells. Second, it will provide algorithms
for on-line monitoring of workspace to support autonomous manipulation. Finally,
it will provide real-time image-guided motion planning strategies for
transporting microspheres ensembles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work
will lead to a new way of autonomously manipulating difficult-to-trap or
sensitive objects using microspheres ensembles as reconfigurable grippers. The
proposed work will also lead to fundamental advances in several cyber physical
systems areas by providing new approaches to micromanipulations, fast and
accurate algorithms with known uncertainty bounds for on-line monitoring of
moving microscale objects, and real-time motion planning algorithms to transport
particle ensembles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to quickly and accurately
manipulate individual cells with minimal training will enable researchers to
conduct basic research at the cellular scale. Control over cell-cell
interactions will enable unprecedented insights into cell signaling pathways and
open up new avenues for medical diagnosis and treatment. The proposed
integration of research with education will train students with a strong
background in emerging robotics technologies and the inner workings of cells.
These students will be in a unique position to rapidly develop and deploy
specialized robotics technologies.&lt;br/&gt;
