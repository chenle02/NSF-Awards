&lt;br/&gt;North Dakota State University has been awarded funds for the Virtual
Conferences on Genomics and Bioinformatics. The objectives of these conferences
are to advance genomic and bioinformatic science, by increasing the
understanding and integration of post-genomic data, by illuminating the
functional roles of genes through sequence homology and DNA microarray data
analysis, and by facilitating discussion of the limitations of current genomic
and bioinformatic tools and potential solutions to these limitations. Because
they are free and broadcast around the world, the conferences transcend
geographic and economic factors limiting researchers across the globe. The
audio-video streaming versions of the conferences are retained on a server for
replay by anyone from anywhere at anytime. In addition the conferences have a
peer reviewed paper session and a Proceedings of the Virtual Conference on
Genomics and Bioinformatics series.
