REJMANEK DEB-9623505 Whether or not humans indirectly affect forest regeneration
by changing natural mammal densities is an unresolved problem. Neotropical
mammals may exert a significant impact on tree regeneration in rainforests
because they are key dispersers and predators of seeds. In many parts of the
Neotropics, local hunters supplement their diet by killing medium-sized and
large mammals, dramatically lowering their densities. Since different mammalian
herbivores have different effects on the fates of seeds and seedlings, we expect
that the rates of seed dispersal and predation and seedling recruitment of trees
in hunted sites will be different from those in unhunted sites. Using exclosure
experiments to separate the effects of different size classes of mammals, this
project will address (1) whether or not different types of herbivorous mammals
differentially affect tree seed fates and seedling survival and (2) whether or
not the effects of these mammals differ between unhunted and hunted portions of
a wet tropical forest. Addressing these issues will provide information about
the efficacy of employing subsistence hunting as a long-term conservation tool
in attempting to limit destruction of Neotropical forests.
