The islands of Bermuda are ideally located for the assessment of marine
biodiversity because the isolated archipelago is at the interface of tropical
and warm temperate zones, which harbor different floras and faunas. Bermuda's
small size supports approximately 450 species of seaweeds; this number allows
complete assessment of the archipelago's algal diversity over the period of the
project. Using DNA sequence data, Bermudan species will be compared with
specimens collected in Caribbean and North American habitats. The outcome will
be the most comprehensive floristic survey for any island
grouping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The seaweeds that inhabit Bermuda are important
as sentinels to changing water temperatures. Many tropical species that might
otherwise thrive in Bermuda's waters cannot survive at the water temperatures
reached during the winter. However, minor increases in minimum water
temperatures around Bermuda may eliminate this obstacle. Warmer annual
temperatures might also cause the disappearance of cold-water winter species.
This study will result in an exhaustive baseline dataset of Bermuda's seaweeds
that will allow detection of potential addition of tropical and loss of
coldwater species from the flora. In partnership with local authorities, this
project thus provides a critical resource for advance warning of ocean
temperature changes near Bermuda. In addition, this project provides research
experiences for undergraduate and graduate students and outreach to K-12
teachers and students and the general public through activities organized with
the Bermuda Aquarium.
