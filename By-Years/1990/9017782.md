Adhesion of cells within tissues is a basic cellular process that is common to
all multicellular organisms. Dr. Loomis is focusing his attention on the
mechanisms of cell-cell adhesion in Dictyostelium that function during
aggregation and subsequent morphogenesis. He has shown that a surface
glycoprotein, gp24, is synthesized during the first few hours of development.
Antibodies specific to gp24 block adhesion during this period and this activity
can be neutralized by highly purified gp24. A cloned protein of the gene coding
for gp24 was ligated downstream to an actin promoter such that antisense RNA
would be generated. Both synthesis of gp24 and the acquisition of cell-cell
adhesion is delayed about four hours in cell transformed with this vector. Dr.
Loomis proposes to delete the pair of genes coding for gp24 by gene replacement
in both wild type strains and in strains specifically lacking the second
adhesion mechanism (contact sites A). The consequences of a complete lack of
gp24 throughout development will be fully determined with respect to
morphogenesis and subsequent developmental gene expression. Following
aggregation another adhesion mechanism appears in prespore cells that can be
distinguished from the first two mechanisms by the adhesion blocking activity of
specific antisera. Dr. Loomis proposes to fully characterize the essential
component(s) of the third adhesion mechanism.
