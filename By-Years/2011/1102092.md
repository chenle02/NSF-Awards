Objective: Development of the theoretical framework for semiconductor spin-
lasers, injected with spin-polarized carriers, and evaluation of how they can
outperform their conventional (spin-unpolarized) counterparts.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Practical spintronic devices have
shown a remarkable success for magnetic storage and sensing, but remain of
limited use for advanced signal processing and digital logic. This proposal will
explore alternative realizations of spin-based applications, stimulated by the
experimental breakthroughs in spin-lasers: lasing threshold reduction and strong
modulation of the emitted light, even at fixed injection intensity. The proposal
will study how these principles can be utilized to: enable superior dynamical
performance including enhanced bandwidth, chirp reduction, ultrafast switching,
and provide guidance for future experimental efforts by exploring novel device
concepts and geometries. By developing theoretical and modeling techniques, from
rate and drift-diffusion equations to rigorous microscopic description, it will
also be possible to advance the understanding of conventional lasers. This
proposal can have a transformative effect, spin-lasers would enable secure
communications, high-bandwidth interconnects, and reduced power-dissipation.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The majority of public school students
from Buffalo have no exposure to physical sciences that subsequently deters them
from considering careers in science and engineering. To address this concern,
the PI will organize summer workshops (Lasers: Theory and Experiment) focusing
on the participation of underrepresented groups. A textbook on spintronics will
be completed, facilitated by the continued collaboration with J. Fabian (U.
Regensburg), to address the lack of suitable resources in spintronics and offer
a structured material that can be tailored in many different course offerings.
