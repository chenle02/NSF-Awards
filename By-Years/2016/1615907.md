Plants adjust their growth plan to maximize exposure to resources. A central
tool in this adaptive program is the rapid extension of stems and roots. Plants
grow toward the sun or toward richer soils through careful re-orientation of
their apical meristems, the stem-cell generating portions of the plant. This
project focuses on the fundamental properties of cellular growth processes
critical to morphogenesis. Using genetic analysis, computational models, and
leading-edge microscopy techniques, this work will reveal how the internal
polymer systems in the cell spatially organize in response to plant hormones to
direct axial cell growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The microtubule cytoskeleton has
a fundamental role in orchestrating the axial morphogenesis of plants through
its ability to influence the mechanical properties of the cell wall.
Microtubules organize into patterns just beneath the cell membrane that
determine where cellulose microfibrils are deposited into the cell wall. By
creating co-oriented cellulose patterns, the microtubules bias cells toward
axial extension. The goal of the project is to discover the genes and molecular
mechanism that lead to specific microtubule patterns and the transfer of that
information to the cell wall. To accomplish that goal, genetic screening and
cell biological tools will be combined to determine how plant hormone receptors
trigger microtubule array patterning and how the patterning of the microtubules
is integrated with cell expansion.
