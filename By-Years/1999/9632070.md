*** 9632070 Hutcheson This STTR Phase I project will investigate the possibility
of developing a sub-micron characterization system using NMR, EPR, or ODNMR
imaging. Optoelectronic devices require materials with controlled environments
surrounding individual active ions. The inability to achieve precise control
lowers efficiency, creates damage sites, and reduces the overall reliability of
the system. Inhomogeneities which cause the environmental changes result from
two sources; impurities and self contamination. In many crystals this second
factor is more significant than impurities. The work proposed in this project
attempts to measure self contamination on a sub-micron basis. Crystals will also
be grown to demonstrate control of this defect at the minimum levels possible.
Scientific Materials Corporation has the ability to generate process control to
the near millisecond level which relates to crystal growth on the atomic level.
The techniques for evaluation of crystals are currently limited to the one
micron scale. The work proposed investigates the possibility of developing a
sub-micron characterization system using NMR, EPR, or ODNMR imaging which in
turn can be used for solid-state lasers, optical memories, holography,
telecommunications, semiconductors, and nonlinear materials. ***
