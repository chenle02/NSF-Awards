This project will develop a comprehensive program for preparing middle school
mathematics teachers in an urban setting. Instructional materials for nine
courses (8 content and 1 method) specifically designed for a middle school
mathematics program will be developed. These will be presented in an
instructional mode that stresses active exploration, concept development, visual
reasoning, and the integrated use of calculators and computers as the dominant
computational tools. The materials to be developed for each course include a
Course Guide with topical commentary, student assignments, reading lists, and a
bibliography and Class Activities. The activities will be used in field
experiences and in student teaching. The materials will be produced with the
desktop publishing facilities of Portland State's Math Learning Center and will
be suitable for widespread distribution or commercial publication. The materials
will be evaluated carefully during development and implementation. The project
staff includes mathematics educators, research mathematicians, and classroom
teachers.
