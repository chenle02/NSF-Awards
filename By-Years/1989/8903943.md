This project is directed at polymer chain transport at interfaces and toward
interfaces. By combining with surface light scattering studies we have been
pursuing in recent years in parallel with the chain diffusion studies, we will
examine (1) polymer lateral diffusion on the interface of air/water(A/W); (2)
adsorption kinetics of polymer chains onto the interfaces of air/water and
oil/water(O/W); and to extend (3) chain diffusion studies to porous media such
as thermoreversible and crosslinked gels. The first project is derived from our
studies for the surface viscoelastic parameters of stable spread films of
various polymers on A/W, and thus we will probe into microscopic behaviors of
chain transport, i.e., lateral diffusion of polymer chains in monolayers and
thin films, and relate them to a parameter such as the longitudinal
compressional viscosity. The second problem is derived from the fact that one
gains access to the adsorption kinetics of polymer chains onto A/W amd O/W by
non-invasive optical methods of surface light scattering and interface
evanescent wave fluorescence whereby different adsorption mechanisms can be
probed directly. The last item aims to systematize the chain diffusion behaviors
in various gels of different pore sizes and network junctions.
