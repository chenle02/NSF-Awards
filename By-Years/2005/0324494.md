Chloroplasts are the subcellular compartment responsible for photosynthesis, the
process that uses the energy of sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water to
sugar and oxygen. Photosynthesis is accomplished by complexes of proteins within
the chloroplast, which are encoded by both nuclear genes and chloroplast genes.
Approximately 90% of the chloroplast proteins are actually synthesized outside
the chloroplast and must be imported from the cytoplasm prior to their assembly
into the photosynthetic apparatus. Most of these proteins enter the chloroplast
through a general translocation machinery located in the chloroplast envelope.
While the identities of some of these translocation proteins are known, their
specific roles are only now being elucidated. This application proposes to
examine the function of two proteins thought to play a role in envelope protein
translocation, Toc64 and stromal Hsp70. The experiments will be performed in the
moss Physcomitrella patens, a model plant in which introduced foreign genes
readily recombine in the nucleus with the homologous endogenous genes, allowing
for targeted gene knockout and replacement. This process of homologous
recombination will be used to the eliminate Toc64 and Hsp70 genes, and the
mutant plants will be examined for defects chloroplast maturation and
development. Chloroplasts will also be isolated from the mutant plants and used
in biochemical experiments designed to identify defects in the chloroplast
import machinery. Efforts to selectively improve crop traits will necessarily
include targeting proteins to the chloroplasts, where much of the metabolic
activity of a plant cell occurs. Thus a full understanding of the mechanisms
through which chloroplasts import proteins, the subject of the proposed
research, is crucial for realizing the full potential of plant genetic
engineering on improving human health and nutrition. In addition, this research
will result in the training of numerous graduate and undergraduate students, and
postdoctoral scientists.
