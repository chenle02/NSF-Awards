WGBH is conducting research and testing an innovative science magazine
television series dedicated to the public understanding of research. The show
will present both breaking research news and reports on underlying trends and
issues in science. It will also feature stories that follow experiments or lab
work over extended periods, profiles of scientists, stories of invention and
discovery, and more purely entertaining items. The project places strong
emphasis on a collaborative approach with other media developers, notably web
and museum exhibit designers, to deepen the impact of the show beyond its
immediate broadcast. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the research phase, WGBH will
convene a group of scientists, informal educators and other potential
collaborators to investigate the parameters involved in a collaborative
approach. They also will produce and test sample program segments to determine
what formats may be most effective. In addition, WGBH will begin looking for on-
camera talent who has the knowledge and presentation ability to carry such a
program. The questions that will be examined in the research phase
include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; how research and production efforts can be
coordinated across different media,&lt;br/&gt; how facilities and infrastructure
might be shared among different organizations providing public information about
research,&lt;br/&gt; how the new television format might be customized to allow
local television stations and science centers to link it with local events, and
&lt;br/&gt; what formats may be most effective in engaging the public, holding
their interest over multiple programs, and conveying substantive information
about research.&lt;br/&gt;
