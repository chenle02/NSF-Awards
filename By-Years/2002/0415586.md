This research program focuses on the design and synthesis of molecules which
will allow analysis of the interactions between cationic ammonium ions and arene
rings. A combination of gas-phase (mass spectrometric), solution-phase (NMR),
and solid-phase (x-ray crystallographic) analyses will be carried out on
synthetic compounds placing ammonium ions in close proximity to arene rings in
order to define the parameters involved in this cation-pi type interaction.

This award from the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the
research of Professor George W. Gokel, of the Department of Molecular Biology
and Pharmacology at Washington University. Through the design, synthesis, and
study of model compounds, Professor Gokel is exploring the potential
interactions between the positively-charged groups found in some amino acids and
the benzene-type rings found in other amino acids. Such interactions, while
individually subtle in nature, may collectively play a significant role in
determining the structure, properties, and function of polypeptides.
