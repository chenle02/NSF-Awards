Industry Workshop&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our Nation?s computers and
networks control many critical infrastructures. Because these infrastructures
depend on systems that were not defined to be secure, determined adversaries can
easily attack with impunity these infrastructures through vulnerabilities in the
underlying networks and computers. For years, the approach to achieving security
has been to patch systems to remove vulnerabilities as they are discovered,
often by adversaries, or to detect attacks as they are launched or, hopefully,
shortly thereafter. This approach will not work against determined
adversaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF and other research funding agencies has
been pursing new research ideas towards security and privacy, but usually such
research does not lead to products and services that are fit into industry?s
business models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will attempt to accelerate
the collaboration of the security research community and industry towards sound
ideas for the attainment of security and privacy but which industry sees as the
basis for future products and services. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will
produce a detailed report to be posted on the NSF web site &lt;br/&gt;
