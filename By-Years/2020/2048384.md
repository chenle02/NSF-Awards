This project supports an oceanographic field campaign in the tropical Pacific to
make high temporal and spatial resolution measurements from moorings and ship of
the oceanic velocity, density, and microstructure. Observations will be made of
westward propagating oceanic fronts in the presence of Tropical Instability
Waves (TIW) to better understand their influence on mixing and modulation of
oceanic internal waves. The proposed work has important implications for
understanding the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the role of the
tropical oceans in climate. Education and outreach for this project will include
mentoring a graduate student and postdoc, science presentations at local high
schools, mentorship for Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) interns,
and participation in the Ocean Discovery Institute homework assistance
program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the dynamic processes that
govern the observed modulation of internal waves, and turbulent mixing, by TIWs
in the equatorial Pacific and the potential effects on heat regulation and ENSO
predictability. Mechanisms to be studied include radiation of downward
propagating internal waves from TIWs, modulation of the internal wave field by
TIWs, and the fate of the internal waves in the presence of critical layers. The
observational campaign will employ moorings, ship-mounted acoustics, ship-based
profiling systems including a rapid profiling CTD (fastCTD) and a turbulence
profiler (Epsilometer), and three autonomous drifting wave-powered profilers
(WireWalkers). Three moorings will be deployed for a year north of the
operational 140Â°W Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) mooring to target the seasonal
cycle in the TIW modulation of internal waves and
mixing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
