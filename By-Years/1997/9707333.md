In this exploratory research, an incremental-learning rule- based neural
network is developed using bounded weight modification and structural
adaptation. Data information stored as clusters can be incrementally updated by
adding cluster-based processing units to the neural network. Learning theory
suggests that rule-based neural networks employing the CF-based activation
function require smaller sample sizes for correct generalization than standard
multilayer perceptrons. Experiments for evaluating the learning capacity and
sample complexity of such systems are to be conducted. This research is intended
for building expert systems with the capabilities of automatic inference and
life-long learning in a wide range of domains.
