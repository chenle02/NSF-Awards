This RUI project will test the hypothesis that different oligomers of multi-
subunit enzymes with identical subunits may have different specific activities.
Glutamate decarboxylase and arginine decarboxylase will be used. The
sedimentation rate of the oligomers in the centrifugal field will be measured by
active species followed by a spectrophotometric assay. The mass distribution of
the enzyme will be followed in parallel band centrifugation experiments by
absorption at 280 nm. The monomoer will be maintained in that form at the same
total concentration as that of the largest oligomer by the nondenaturing by
dissociating detergent, CHAPS. The sedimentation coefficient will permit
identification of the oligomeric species present, with appropriate correction
for the amount of bound detergent. The project should enhance our understanding
of one aspect of the fundamental property of enzymes and at the same time offer
excellent training to undergraduates on the theory and practice of
ultracentrifugation.
