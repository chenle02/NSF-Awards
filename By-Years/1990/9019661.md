To elucidate the nature of the heavy-fermion superconductor U1- xThxBe13,
measurements are made of the superconducting and magnetic phase boundaries, and
of the dc magnetization as a function of magnetic field and temperature. Heavy-
fermion systems are of particular interest as they differ from normal metals in
having relatively enormous values of low-temperature specific heat and magnetic
susceptibility. The appearance of superconductivity in such media is further
surprising and intriguing.
