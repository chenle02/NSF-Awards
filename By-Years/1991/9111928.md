This research, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the
Chemistry Division, will study the rate of association between chiral molecules
and both chiral and achiral hosts using "lifetime-resolved fluorescence-
detected circular dichroism" (LRFDCD), a method which can monitor the change in
light polarization during a reaction. Light polarization and fluorescence
lifetime can both be related to the speed and extent of reaction. Among the
systems to be characterized are antibody-antigen interactions in immunochemical
methods of analysis, solubilization of molecules in organized media, and
interactions between chiral solutes and chromatographic phases in enantiomeric
separations. %%% This research is concerned with the interactions of guest
molecules with the molecular components of host cavities. Of particular interest
are the effects of the shapes of the guests and of the host cavities on these
interactions. Chiral and achiral hosts and chiral and achiral guests will be
studied using a new technique called "time-resolved fluorescence-detected
circular dichroism." The results will be applicable to chromatomatographic
separations of chiral molecules and to a better understanding of the kinetics of
biochemical reactions and of antibody-antigen interactions.
