Geospatial Teaching Across the Curriculum (Geo-STAC) developed by Lane Community
College, is providing a mentored professional development opportunity for high
school teachers and hands-on lessons in geospatial thinking and technology for
high school students. The need for students to think spatially and use
geospatial technologies is becoming more critical as these tools and concepts
are increasingly incorporated into a broad range of occupations and academic
disciplines. Geo-STAC addresses important needs to improve geospatial education
and community college program recruitment by creating a pathway between the
community college and high school teachers and their students. Geo-STAC is
providing professional development workshops for high school teachers
representing STEM and non-STEM disciplines to help teachers: (1) understand the
importance of geospatial thinking; (2) learn how to use geospatial thinking in
their particular discipline; (3) learn about geospatial technologies; (4)
develop a Web-based GIS lesson; and (5) implement a Web-based GIS lesson. Geo-
STAC also is working directly with high school students so that they: (1)
understand the importance of geospatial technologies and careers in future job
markets; (2) learn how to use Web-based GIS to solve problems; and (3) visit the
community college GIS lab and experience using desktop GIS. The Geo-STAC project
is strongly supported by the new National Geospatial Technology Center of
Excellence (GeoTech Center), the Lane County Education Service District (Lane
ESD), high school teachers, and several community colleges across the country.
Geo-STAC is actively disseminating this collaborative model to community
colleges across the country.
