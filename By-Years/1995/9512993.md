Three ABI 377 automated DNA sequencers are requested to fulfill the needs for
DNA sequencing and genescan analyses at the basic sciences of the Johns Hopkins
School of Medicine. The approximately 100 basic science laboratories at this
institution are pursuing a wide range of research topics which depend heavily on
these techniques. The range of ongoing projects span from developmental, cell
and molecular biology, biochemistry and neurobiology. The proposed instruments
would be managed by our non-profit DNA core facility, experienced in a variety
of DNA analysis services, and would be available to the entire basic science
community at cost. The Dean of the School of Medicine has committed co-funding
for this project.
