Individuals with autism and other developmental disabilities show marked
difficulty establishing and maintaining social peer engagements. These
difficulties result in limited friendships, high rates of social rejection and
isolation, and increased risk of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation.
Individuals with autism and developmental disabilities also experience lower
rates of employment, post-secondary participation, and independent living in
comparison to their peers. Despite their social challenges, children with autism
and developmental disabilities desire to engage socially but require support.
Early social skills interventions such as proximity training can help such
children improve social engagement and mental health. This project develops an
assistive technology for aiding such corrective social skills interventions by
teachers in classroom settings.

This project develops human sensing and AI-enabled processing infrastructure for
childrenâ€™s peer-engagement behavior monitoring. Teachers use the sensed behavior
and AI-inferred mood information to administer targeted behavioral interventions
to children diagnosed with autism and other related behavioral disorders. A key
technology enabler in this project is a Wearable Human Interaction Tracker
(WHET) tag, which measures pair-wise human interaction between individuals. When
two people, each wearing the nametag-sized tag, interact, their
interaction/engagement dynamics are tracked and quantitatively captured by the
WHET sensors for subsequent wireless upload to an access point connected to
cloud storage. This assistive technology for teachers helps improve the quality
of intervention, as well as the number of children that a teacher can
simultaneously and effectively provide interventions to. The newly-developed
technology and algorithms will also improve support for children with many other
disorders including depression, anxiety, and ADHD.
