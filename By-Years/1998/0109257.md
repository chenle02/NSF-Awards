This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project has as its goal
the demonstration of the feasibility of an optical alloy analysis instrument
based on a microchip laser excitation source. This instrument will determine
elemental composition using laser-induced plasma spectroscopy (LIPS). It will
have the advantage over existing portable instruments of being able to determine
concentrations of light elements such as carbon, aluminum and silicon. The key
to this innovation is the microchip laser, which has been shown to have several
advantages in LIPS applications, while being remarkably small, lightweight and
robust. In Phase I observations will be made using a laboratory LIPS apparatus,
and a set of specifications will be derived for an instrument capable of
determining carbon in steel at levels of interest to potential customers in
industries where alloy identification is critical. This proposal involves
collaboration with a manufacturer with a dominant position in the market. With
their input, the optimum instrument configuration which can offer both useful
capabilities and easy, portable operation will be
determined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There currently exists a strong market for
alloy identification instruments, even though existing devices are either
limited by inability to determine some of the most important elements, or by
significant drawbacks in portability and ease of use. An optical device with
important advantages could lead to a much expanded
market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
