The Pyrenees are an intracratonic mrogen which formed between late Cretaceous
and Early Miocenes as a result of convergent motions between the Afro-Iberian
and European plates. No large-scale subduction of ocean crust preceded the
formations of the Pyrenees and no magma formed, yet recent work indicates 150 km
of massive crustal shortening. The recent ECORS seismic section has allowed a
detailed sequence of events to be developed to explain these data. If correct,
the proposed sequence of events has importance for the tectonics of the western
Mediterraneans. The purpose of this project is to test these ideas by using
Fission Track geochronometry to help discriminate between the different uplift
patterns predicted. Results should help in understanding compressional
collisions where the amount of seafloor subduction has been minor.
