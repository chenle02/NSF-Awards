The two senior investigators will study the relationship between Lp bounds on
curvature and the geometry and topology of a Riemannian manifold. They will work
towards a proof that a new topological invariant, if zero, implies an
F-structure in the sense of Cheeger-Gromov. The relationship between the
isoperimetric constant and the curvature of a manifold will be investigated. The
investigators will generalize the Heintze- Karcher estimate on the volume of a
geodesic neighborhood. A lower bound on the shortest closed geodesic would be
very useful. A computer will be used to compute some nontrivial examples of
convergent Riemannian manifolds. The standard sphere has positive Gaussian
curvature everywhere. Even when deformed, the average curvature remains
positive. Such is not the case for the two-holed torus. Regardless of how one of
these is deformed, the average curvature must be negative. In higher dimensions
the picture is much more complicated. Other sorts of curvature, such as Ricci
curvature, play the central roles. A central problem in differential geometry,
which the two investigators will address, is how the averages of these
curvatures relates to topological properties such as numbers of holes.
