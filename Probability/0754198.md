Travel support is requested for 20 U.S. participants (young researchers, women,
and members of underrepresented minority groups) to attend the World Congress in
Probability and Statistics, an international meeting to be held July 14-19,
2008, in Singapore. The conferences on Stochastic Processes and their
Applications have become the principal annual international forum for
researchers studying applied and theoretical problems in stochastic processes.
Every four years that sequence of meetings is interrupted by a World Congress in
Probability and Statistics, a much larger conference that bring together
distinguished scholars from all over the world and provides a broad overview of
current research in probability and statistics, and their applications.

An important part of the intellectual development of young researchers is to
attend international conferences where they have an opportunity to listen to
stimulating lectures and interact with probabilists and statisticians who work
on a wide variety of topics. The World Congress in Probability and Statistics,
which meets every four years, and will be held in Singapore in 2008 will feature
one hour talks by about a dozen internationally known researchers and special
sessions on 33 topics. Travel support is requested for 20 U.S. participants
(young researchers, women, and members of underrepresented minority groups) to
attend this important meeting.
