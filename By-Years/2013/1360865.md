The proposed conference titled "Flint: One City - One Hundred Years Under
Variability" is scheduled to be held at Kettering University, Flint, Michigan,
June 24-28, 2014. One of the main goals of the project is to bring together
experts in the fields of predictive statistics with expertise in statistical
modeling, education, and applications. A specific emphasis is on statistics of
historical data. Through this event, the organizers intend to celebrate the
International Year of Statistics and the 175th anniversary of the American
Statistical Association. The practitioners in engineering and applied sciences
are now extensively using statistical methods to solve problems arising in real-
life situations dealing with local and federal governments, medical services,
insurance, actuaries and public media. While most theoretical aspects and the
range of applications of statistical methods have been well established, the
organizers of this conference plan to bring together the most active and best
researchers, educators, and practitioners to a common setting. The organizers
hope that the participants such as students, teachers, and practicing
statisticians will take back their experience to enhance their careers as well
as to promote the use of statistics in day-to-day activities to benefit society.
