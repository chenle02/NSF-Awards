The project proposes to coordinate continuing U.S. activities that have
resulted in improved access to polar bibliographic information resources.
Publication of research results by the polar scientific community continues to
increase rapidly with 15,000 to 20,000 new papers being indexed annually. It is
essential to deliver access to these research results to the desktop of every
potential user of polar regions information in the most ,user-friendly manner
possible. This project provides funding for three annual meetings of a polar
information working group, in 1994, 1995 and 1996, to be held in Cambridge, UK,
Washington, DC, and Anchorage, Alaska. Individuals representing U.S. bodies that
provide polar information and/or information services will participate in each
meeting. Effective dissemination of polar regions information is necessary for
the United States to carry out research and management activities provided for
in the Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984 (amended 1990), the U.S. Arctic
Research Plan and its revisions, and the U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP).
