This award supports US participation in the EU-US Workshop on Networked
Information and Control Systems, June 16th, 2008, at KTH, Stockholm, Sweden. The
purpose of the meeting is to bring together European and US researchers from
academia and industry to discuss research challenges and emerging industrial
trends for next generation networked embedded systems. The workshop considers
three themes: mobility and autonomy in cyber-physical systems; robustness and
security of large-scale infrastructures; and wireless sensing and control for
embedded networks
