This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research on genetic
recombination involves Stephen Kowalczykowski of the University of California at
Davis, Alain Nicolas, Marie Dutreix, and Francis Fabre of the Institut Curie in
Paris, France. The award provides travel support and living expenses to Dr.
Kowalczykowski and a graduate student. The objective of their research is to
investigate homologous pairing and subsequent exchange of DNA strands. This
process is mediated by a unique class of proteins represented by the prototypic
RecA protein from Escherichia coli and by the new Rad51 protein from
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration
expertise in the physical and biochemical aspects of recombination. This is
complemented by French expertise in molecular genetics. The project will advance
fundamental understanding of the biological processes involved in genetic
recombination, including aberrant processes that lead to deleterious genomic
rearrangements.
