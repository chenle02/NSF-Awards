In attempts to understand evolution, the study of genetic variation within and
among species has been a major research focus. In some species, genetic
variability at biochemical loci is so great the one must ask whether it exists
as a result of natural selection or represents random "genetic noise." This
research will examine this question by studying: (1) the model organism,
Fundulus heteroclitus, (2) representative enzyme systems, and (3) mitochondrial
DNA patterns. These studies include: the mechanisms responsible for different
enzyme concentrations among populations, the specific genetic changes
responsible for known functional alterations in the enzyme lactate
dehydrogenase, the study of functional differences in several other enzyme
systems, metabolic studies to determine how enzyme variation affects physiology,
developmental rate studies to reveal how cellular differences manifest
themselves as phenotypic characters, experiments that will assess the magnitude
of selection, and mtDNA pattern studies that will provide information on the
previous genetic history and population dynamics of the model species. The
results of this multidisciplinary approach, which begins at the molecular level
and progresses to the ecological level, will lead to a broader understanding of
evolution and help answer the hotly debated question: "Does the majority of
genetic variation at the molecular level provide the biochemical rootstock of
evolutionary change?"
