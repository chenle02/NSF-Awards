The principal investigator will study a class of reaction- diffusion systems
which arise in modeling various reaction transport processes across
compartmental domains divided by semi- permeable membranes with special emphasis
on multi-species models with complex kinetics. Such models arise in a variety of
physical settings, with the most obvious example being the reaction-diffusion
process within a finite chain of cells. The investigation of the formation of
stable spatial patterns through boundary feeds is physically realistic and will
lead to increased understanding to the development of spatial patterns in
chemical models.
