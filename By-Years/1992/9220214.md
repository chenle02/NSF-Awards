This award provides one-half the funds required to upgrade a seismic reflection
system (seismograph, geophones, sensor cables, GPS receiver, computing
hardware/software) that will be operated by the PI, colleagues, and students in
the Department of Geology at the University of Georgia. The University is
committed to providing the remaining necessary funds. The seismic measuring
system will be used primarily for refraction and wide-angle reflection profiling
of structures in the crust and shallow mantle in the Appalachian region of the
U.S. in support of research projects and teaching exercises.
