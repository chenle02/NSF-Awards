Professor Justin DuBois in the Department of Chemistry at Stanford University is
supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program for his studies on
catalytic insertation reactions for the animation of C-H bonds. Mechanistic
studies will be carried out with the aim of developing a model of the C-H
insertation reaction. The new methodology will be applied towards the synthesis
of polyfunctionalized amine-based targets, such as amino alcohols, amino acids,
and diamines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor DuBois is developing new catalytic
methods to form bonds between carbon and nitrogen atoms. This will potentially
yield a process to convert low cost, broadly available organic compounds
consisting of only carbon and hydrogen into more highly functionalized, value-
added organic materials.
