This research will focus on acceleration methods for fixed-point iteration that
are based on a method introduced by D. G. Anderson in 1965. This method has been
used widely and with considerable success within the computational physics,
chemistry, and materials communities as a means of accelerating the self-
consistent field iteration used in electronic structure computations. However,
it has been untried or underexploited in many other important applications in
which it seems likely to be equally successful. Moreover, it has received
relatively little attention from mathematicians and numerical analysts, despite
there being many significant unanswered mathematical questions. The goals of
this research are to analyze the convergence of the method, to explore its
effectiveness across a broad range of important applications, and ultimately to
develop extensions with improved global convergence and stability properties.

The method to be investigated is at present an important method for accelerating
computations used in materials science, for example, to determine properties of
"designer" materials in nanotechnology applications. In practice, the method is
usually very effective but occasionally fails. The first goal of this research
is to develop a theoretical understanding of the method that explains this
behavior and points the way to methods that are more consistently successful.
The method is general in nature and can potentially be much more broadly
applied. The second goal of this research is to determine the effectiveness of
the method in a variety of important applications, ranging from statistical
estimation to computational modeling of complex physical phenomena. If
successful, this research can result in much faster computational methods for
challenging tasks such as extracting information from extremely large data sets
and simulating fluid flow coupled with chemical reactions.
