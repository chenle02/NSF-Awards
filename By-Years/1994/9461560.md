This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will utilize surface
micromachining techniques to fabricate a low-cost Deformable Mirror (DM).
Despite steady improvements in performance, current DMs remain prohibitively
expensive. Present devices continue to cost upwards of one thousand dollars per
actuator. This is due primarily to manufacturing schemes which rely on precision
machining or precision assembly of large numbers of components. Etalon, Inc.
proposes a fabrication process which has already proven the potential of
reducing costs by at least an order of magnitude. The process relies on a novel
microfabrication process to fabricate large area deformable structures
monolithically, i.e., as a single component. Using deposited and grown
dielectric films, an electrostatically driven membrane mirror can be fabricated
with great precision and reliability on an optically finished substrate. No
conventional machining is required, and batch production is facilitated. This
effort will investigate some of the issues posed by this process, perform an
elaborate computer simulation using specialized finite element analysis
software, and evaluate the performance of the proposed devices.
