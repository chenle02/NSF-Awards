There has been much debate in recent years over whether countries will tend in
the long run to converge to the same level of productivity which can be measured
in terms of per capita income. In practice, the debate concerns the question of
whether poor countries tend to have higher per capita income growth rates than
rich ones, or put another way: is there a tendency for poor countries to "catch
up"? The purpose of this research is to integrate data and growth theory to
focus on the question of economic convergence. This project will involve an
empirical and theoretical investigation of the causes of convergence or lack
thereof. The approach taken to the question of catching up begins by restating
the question as one concerning the effects of initial conditions on subsequent
growth. It is the contention in this study that initial per capita income is too
aggregate a measure of initial conditions on which to base our expectations of a
country's subsequent growth. By disaggregating initial conditions in a growth-
theoretic context it is possible to greatly improve our understanding of why
some poor countries have grown much faster than rich countries while others have
note. This project is important because it will provide new insights about the
prospects for economic growth in the less developed countries.
