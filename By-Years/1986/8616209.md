The National Congress on Engineering Education will be held in November 1986.
The purpose is to obtain a consensus for actions that must be taken in
engineering programs to maintain US technological leadership and a literacy and
knowlege level compatible with a college education in engineering. Three major
issues committees have met to analyze current studies and reports that impact on
engineering education to obtain recommendations for action items to present to
the congress in November. The three major issues are: (1) faculty; (2)
curriculum; and (3) laboratories, computers, and educational technology. The
actions items determined by the three committees, together with those of the
congress, are incorporated into accreditation criteria wherever appropriate.
Other items are referred to the appropriate implementing authorities for
consideration. The objective is to bring engineering education to a level which
not only serves the needs of the profession, but also provides the necessary
overall education desired for college graduates.
