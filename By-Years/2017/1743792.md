This award is to support a one-day mini-symposium on November 1, 2017, which
will be held in conjunction with the AIChE Annual Meeting in Minneapolis, MN.
The objective of this mini-symposium is to create a unique environment to allow
the interactions of prominent researchers who work in the field of thermal
deconstruction of biomass materials for producing novel biorenewable fuels. This
mini-symposium will feature three sessions of invited speakers and a poster
reception, featuring relevant research of graduate students. The three oral
sessions, each consisting of talks by five invited speakers are: 1) Pathways to
thermal deconstruction, 2) Fundamentals of thermal deconstruction, and 3)
Upgrading products from thermal deconstruction. The funding will partially
support the participation of the fifteen invited speakers and the young
scientists presenting at the poster reception.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thermal
deconstruction is an intriguing new approach to fractionating lignocellulose
biomass into components suitable for upgrading into biobased products. The use
of heat to fractionate and depolymerize plant biopolymers into solubilized
carbohydrate and lignin-derived phenolic monomers has often been overlooked or
even dismissed in the field of biofuels and biobased products. Its practitioners
often self-segregate because they fail to recognize commonalities among the
phenomena they study. Even less common are interactions and collaborations among
those who thermally deconstruct biomass and those who depend upon deconstructed
biomass as substrates for bioprocessing. To date, there has been no forum to
bring together researchers who are pioneering thermal deconstruction as well as
those who seek new sources of bioprocessing substrates. This mini-symposium will
provide an excellent opportunity to bring experts together to address this
important research field, which will have a significant impact on the
development of the renewable energy technology.
