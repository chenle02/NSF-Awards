This project involves quantification of trace gases and aerosols with the goal
to better define sources of these species contained in air masses transported to
the western continental boundary of North America. The study will develop and
make use of a new atmospheric measurement site on the summit of Mt. Bachelor in
central Oregon. The 2.7 km altitude will likely enable regular sampling of free
tropospheric air masses much as other mountain sites (for example, Mauna Loa
Observatory, Hawaii, and Izana Atmospheric Observatory, Canary Islands). This
will allow assessment of the contributions of long range transport of emissions
to the regional budgets of ozone and fine particles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During
the study period, continuous measurements of ozone, carbon monoxide, and
condensation nuclei concentrations, as well as aerosol light scattering
efficiencies, will be made. During specific campaign periods, the measurement
suite will be enhanced to include reactive nitrogen compounds (nitric oxide,
nitrogen dioxide), peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), and the tracers of air mass
origin, beryllium-7 and lead-210. Aircraft based concentration profiles of
selected species and satellite based observations will be used to set the
surface based measurements in horizontal and vertical context. A global chemical
transport model will be used to help establish budgets and quantify the
contributions from remote sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
establish a new atmospheric observing site at an altitude useful for atmospheric
studies with a variety of goals. In this project, the data derived from the site
will be useful for quantifying the role of long range transport on budgets of
important tropospheric species such as ozone and fine particles. The project
will also involve training of a post-doctoral research fellow and an
undergraduate student. A community college faculty member will also be involved
in the project.
