The rate at which solid particles sediment under the action of gravity can be
greatly enhanced if the walls of the settling vessel are inclined rather than
vertical. This phenomenon, often referred to as "The Boycott Effect", plays an
increasingly important role in a variety of separation processes because, in
principle, the sedimentation rate can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude
if the vessel is properly designed. Recently, a theory has been developed for
modeling such systems; a key restriction of that theory which required that the
particle Reynolds number be vanishingly small will now be relaxed in an
approximate manner and the resulting theoretical predictions will be tested
experimentally. The overall objective of this research is to develop a reliable
theoretical framework for modeling the operation of supersettlers under
conditions encountered in practice.
