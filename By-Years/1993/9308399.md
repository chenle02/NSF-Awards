The goal of this research is to carry out the analysis of structured
(e.g.Toeplitz) matrix pairs and to analyze the convergence behavior of the
numerical algorithm connection with constructing efficient preconditioners.
Numerical algorithms are developed for updating and downdating problems
associated with canonical correlations when data points are added or deleted.
Theories and algorithms are developed for the following extensions of canonical
correlations: canonical correlations with a general bilinear form, canonical
correlations with linear equality constraints, canonical correlations of several
data sets. This research is expected to yield new concepts in matrix
decompositions and numerical linear algebra and statistical computation, and
facilitate and further spread the use of canonical correlation analysis in the
general scientific community.
