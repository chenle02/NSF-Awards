ABSTRACT The basic aim of the project is to develop a computerized database of
linguistic errors (slips of the tongue) produced by normal and aphasic (post
brain damaged) individuals. Once established, the database will be made
available to other investigators. The interest in speech errors has grown
enormously among linguists, psychologists, neuropsychologists, and neurologists
in their attempts to understand how linguistic knowledge is represented in the
mind, how it is accessed in behavior, and the neurological basis for such
representation and processing. Many individual collections are now in existence
consisting of over 25,000 errors. Except for published examples, there has been
no away of sharing these data; this project hopes to correct this problem by
starting a database with the UCLA Speech Error Corpus of over 15,000 items and
the corpora collected by Merrill Garrett (University of Arizona) and Stefanie
Shattuck-Hufnagel (MIT), as well as a large corpus of aphasia errors collected
by the Principal Investigator and/or published in the literature.
