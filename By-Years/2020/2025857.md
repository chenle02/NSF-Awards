The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide domestic production of renewable,
biomass-based alternatives to products currently made from oil. This SBIR Phase
II project will demonstrate the commercial potential of producing
1,5-pentanediol (1,5-PDO), a key chemical used to manufacture coatings,
adhesives, and plastics, from agricultural wastes like corn cobs. Biomass-based
chemicals can decrease the nation's dependence on oil and reduce greenhouse gas
emissions, while providing cost-competitive high-performance chemical products.
Creating high-value commodity chemicals using nonfood agricultural materials as
feedstock promises to create new markets for bio-based waste
products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase II project will generate the necessary experimental data to design
commercial reactors for producing renewable bio-based 1,5-pentanediol. A
chemical pathway to produce bio-based 1,5-pentanediol has been demonstrated in
laboratory reactors using commercially relevant reactors and catalysts. In this
work a wide range of reactor operating conditions will be explored in the
laboratory for scale-up of the process. These operating conditions will be
further demonstrated in larger pilot-scale equipment to inform design at
commercial scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
