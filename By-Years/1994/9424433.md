9424433 Garstang This award will continue the "Characterization of Aerosols over
Southern Africa (C-CASA)" which is directed solely at the analysis of the field
generated data gathered under CASA and the larger umbrella experiments of
SAFARI-TRACE-A conducted in southern Africa, the southern tropical Atlantic and
Brazil in September- October 1992. The objective of C-CASA is to determine the
characteristics of aerosols originating over the savannas of southern Africa.
The overall objectives are now refined and expended on given the knowledge of
what was achieved in the field. Chemical and isotopic composition of surface and
airborne samples will be completed. Aerosol mass as well as elemental
concentrations over continental source regions and in downstream regions of
transports will be determined. Isotopes of nitrogen and oxygen together with
changes in concentrations of elements in the aerosol samples will be combined
with kinematic (trajectory) and thermodynamic (atmospheric conservative
properties and stability) to determine 4-D (x,y,z,t) transports. Transports will
be traced to the source locations in a horizontal framework ranging from
regional to continental scales and in a lagrangian coordinate system following
the trajectory as a function of height.
