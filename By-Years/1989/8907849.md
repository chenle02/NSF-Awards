Work on this project extends earlier contributions to the theory of semilinear
elliptic partial differential equations. Recent research has established that
multiple solutions can exist when the equations are defined on unbounded
domains. One of the issues to be considered in this project is to clarify the
conditions one must impose on the equations to guarantee the existence of any
solutions. Simple examples illustrate how an equation may have only trivial
solutions. A second line of investigation will focus on second order fully
nonlinear elliptic equations. This is an area of considerable activity where
existence and uniqueness results have been established for equations on compact
Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative sectional curvature. It is not clear
whether the nonnegativity is necessary. Work will be done in an effort to
explain the role of the sectional curvature and to consider the related complex
equations as a longer-range goal.
