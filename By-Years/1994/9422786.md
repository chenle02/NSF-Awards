Michael Herman, Tulane University, is supported by a grant from the Theoretical
and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his theoretical work on the
development of semiclassical methods for the evaluation of vibrational
relaxation rates in condensed media. The goal of this work is the development of
well tested, accurate methods that are sufficiently flexible so as to allow for
the evaluation of the vibrational energy relaxation in a broad range of physical
systems. The strategies for the development of these methods employ a quantum
mechanical description of the vibrational motion of the molecules. Semiclassical
techniques are employed to describe the time evolution of the nonvibrational
degrees of freedom in the system. These methods allow for the coupling of the
evolution of the nonvibrational degrees of freedom to the quantum vibrational
transitions, while retaining much of the computational advantage of a classical
mechanical description. The rate at which molecules gain and lose vibrational
energy influences reaction kinetics, energy transport, the interpretation of
spectroscopic experiments and many other processes occurring in liquids, dense
gases and solids. The theoretical description of this problem, in a manner that
leads to quantitative predictions, requires that the vibrations be treated
quantum mechanically. The evaluation of transition rates between quantum states
of the molecule in a condensed phase system is an important and challenging
theoretical problem, requiring the coupling of quantum techniques with
procedures for averaging over the multitude of configurations available to the
condensed phase system.
