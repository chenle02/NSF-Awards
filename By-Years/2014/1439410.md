Typhoon Haiyan made landfall in the Philippines with sustained winds of 195 mph.
The storm surge was several meters high and came and dissipated quickly. The
inundation reached 1 km inland in some places. Thus, there is potential for
extensive seawater contamination of coastal groundwater. Countless rural coastal
villages are dependent on coastal aquifers; these villages might have to contend
with the long-lasting effects of seawater contamination of groundwater. The PI
team established a 150 m long shore-perpendicular transect to investigate the
physical and chemical dynamics associated with infiltration of the seawater
through the vadose zone and its fate in the aquifer. Using electrical
resistivity (ER) tomography, they will track the saline seawater that has now
sunk a little bit below the water table and appears to be following postulated
groundwater flow paths towards the sea. The scientific objective is to improve
our understanding of the physical and chemical processes occurring in coastal
aquifers after inundation by seawater due to storm
surges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by EAR/HS and ISE/GVF
