This three-year project focuses on scaling up the SimCalc project and emphasizes
bridging mathematical knowledge for teaching (MKT) on proportional reasoning and
argumentation as part of teachers' classroom practices. The preliminary findings
from the SimCalc project suggest that the increase in teachers' content
knowledge without explicit instruction in teaching strategies did not lead
teachers to change their approach to supporting student reasoning. The current
study is exploratory and will test the hypothesis that Bridging Professional
Development (BPD), professional development that helps to bridge content
knowledge and classroom practice, can effect positive teacher change and to
understand how BPD can accomplish this. This exploratory study is the first of a
larger research agenda; future studies will include a large-scale randomization
and another that explores the impact of BPD on student achievement.
