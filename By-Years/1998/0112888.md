The modeling of complex systems using the concept of constrained objects is
investigated. A constrained object is one whose internal state is regulated by a
set of invariants, or constraints. When several constrained objects are
aggregated to form a complex object, their internal states might further have to
satisfy interface constraints. The resultant behavior of the complex object is
determined using logical inference and constraint satisfaction. Thus,
constrained objects are a declarative counterpart of traditional objects (found
in object-oriented languages). The proposed modeling paradigm has diverse uses,
including engineering and organizational modeling, and supports constraints as
well as preferences. The computational model for constrained objects provides
constraint satisfaction, optimization, and relaxation techniques. A visual
representation for constrained objects is also provided in such a way that the
components of the visual form have logical counterparts in the underlying model.
Research areas of interest include language design, execution, and applicatons.
In particular, issues arising in model revision (i.e., incremental constraint
satisfaction) and model inconsistency (i.e., fault diagnosis) will be
investigated. The results from this research will be incorporated in the
modeling environment, which is expected to make a significant advance over
current modeling tools for engineering design.
