As increasingly much background information becomes available to scientists
undertaking an investigation, it is important to utilize previous knowledge
effectively in designing studies and analyzing data. Bayesian statistical
methods are tailored to this computation, but scientific meetings rarely spend
substantial time discussing applications of Bayesian statistics. The goal is to
elucidate the interplay between theory and practice and thereby identify
successful methods and indicate important directions for future research.
