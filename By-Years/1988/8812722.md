Relativity theory (both special and general) and quantum theory represent the
two great scientific revolutions of the 20th century which not only have changed
physics itself but also our general world view. The repercussions of these
theories are still being worked out in physics, history, and philosophy of
science. In order to understand fully the meanings and impacts of quantum
theory, an enormous range of studies remain to be carried out. Dr. Miller, under
this research grant, is examining one of the most important areas of this range
of projects. He is investigating the introduction, interpretation, and
development of intrinsic (or internal) symmetries into quantum mechanics,
starting with Werner Heisenberg's formulation of the concept in 1926 through
Wolfgang Pauli's classic paper of 1940 on the connection among spin, statistics
and Lorentz invariance. Other key figures in this area of research are Niels
Bohr, P. A. M. Dirac, Lev Landau, Rudolf Peierls, Victor Weisskopf, and Eugene
Wigner. The development of the concept of intrinsic symmetries in quantum
mechanics brought about wide-ranging transformations in the notions of space,
time, causality, and substance -- central concepts for our view of the world. An
understanding of these developments thus promises to contribute to both the
history and the philosophy of science as well as to cultural history as society
has come to understand the radical shifts that this theory has forced on the
meaning of causality and certainty in the world.
