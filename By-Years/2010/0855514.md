This grant will provide funds to carry out a program of experiments to study
beta decay processes in nuclei. The goal of the experiments is, first, to test
one particular aspect of the "Standard Model" of the weak and electromagnetic
interactions, and second, to provide additional data on the decay of boron-8
which is an important source of high energy neutrinos from the sun. The project
involves design, construction and calibration of a spectrometer for the
electrons emitted in beta decay, and the development of computer programs to
simulate the behavior of the spectrometer and analyze the data.

The experiments will advance science, but have the additional goal of training
talented physics students. The students learn to work and think independently
and gain a wide variety of practical problem solving skills. These students
eventually enter the workforce, frequently in areas of applied science, and this
clearly has a broad and beneficial impact on society. There are presently 5
students, one graduate student and 4 undergrads, associated with the project.
