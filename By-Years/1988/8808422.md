The relationship of science with the philosophy of science has had a long
history, going back at least to Aristotle. For much of this history, the
philosophy of science attempted to determine how science should be done. Thus,
for the ancient and medieval world, the search for the four causes listed by
Aristotle became a major function of "science"; in the 17th century, a
mechanical explanation became the norm. Even in the 20th century, the logical
positivists argued that science had to be in a "nomological-deductive"
framework. By the mid-20th century, however, the normative force of philosophy
of science had lost much of whatever power it ever had to determine how science
should be carried out. Today, philosophers of science tend more to study how
science actually works, not how it should perform. Yet it remains important to
know and understand the changing relationship of science and philosophy of
science. Professor Williams, under this research grant, is investigating a
critical period in this changing relationship: the role of philosophy of science
in the work of Andre-Marie Ampere, one of the foremost scientists of the first
half of the 19th century. At the end of the 18th century, there occurred a
revolution in philosophy that altered the philosophical landscape for the 19th
century. Two elements in this revolution are central to Professor Williams'
project: the new epistemology and the philosophy of science that could be drawn
from this epistemology. In both areas, the original impetus for philosophical
revision came from Immanuel Kant. Kant had a fundamental influence on the
thought of Ampere. Professor Williams will study in detail the origins,
evolution and results of Ampere's philosophy of science. The project has three
parts. In the first, Professor Williams will examine the introduction of Kantian
philosophy into France by way of a channel hitherto ignored, namely from Geneva
to Lyon. It was at Lyon that Ampere first encountered Kant and plunged into the
study of his thought. In the second, he will examine a whole mass of
manuscripts, hitherto unstudied, containing Ampere's ideas on epistemology and
the nature of science. This section will include a study of Ampere's theoretical
chemistry in which his philosophy of science was most clearly expressed. In the
third, he will examine Ampere's attempts to map the mind and to fit a
taxonomical system to this may. This work culminated in his Essai sur la
philosophie des sciences.
