Whenever a scientist measures human behavior there are always two levels of
structure in the measurements. The first is generally referred to as the signal
or the aspect of human behavior that is of interest. Measurement of the signal
is generally the point of conducting an experiment. The second level of
structure is the noise or error and it is usually not something that is
purposefully sought and its analysis tends to be cursory. In standard
statistical analysis, say for example in the general linear model, this aspect
of the data is referred to as unexplained measurement variability. With NSF
support Dr. David Gilden will pursue a fundamental and controversial
understanding of this so-called noise or unexplained variability. &lt;br/&gt;Dr.
Gilden begins with the hypothesis that the noise attending measurement may be of
considerable interest in its own right and may contain important clues about
what kind of thing human activity is. Previous work has shown that errors in
production and fluctuations in reaction time may exhibit a particular kind of
fractal structure known as 1/f noise. This particular noise is of intense
interest in physics, biology, economics, and medicine for it is both generic and
unexpected. In fact, at this time there is no agreement on how natural systems
produce 1/f noise. The purpose of this proposal is to clarify the nature of this
1/f noise in measurements of human behavior. This will be done by a careful
dissection of the components of psychological measurement into its perceptual
demands, task demands, response mappings, and overt response. The second step is
to characterize how the dynamic moves forward, whether it is tied to ongoing
physiological fluctuations or whether it is uniquely activated on a measurement
by measurement basis.&lt;br/&gt;
