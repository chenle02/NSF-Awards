With National Science Foundation support Dr. Anne Pyburn and her collaborators
will conduct one season of archaeological research at the site of Chau Hiix.
This site, located in the lowlands of Belize, was only brought to archaeological
attention in 1990 and is extremely unusual because villagers who live in the
region have protected it from looting. Preliminary research suggests that Chau
Hiix served as a major regional center because it contains a number of mounds
and associated courtyards. In this first season of work Dr. Pyburn and her
colleagues will map and survey the site. They will conduct limited excavations
on visible structures and also carry out a program of coring to determine
whether less obvious archaeological features are also present. On this basis
they should be able to provide more exact dates for the span of occupation and
obtain a better idea of its internal organization. These data will provide the
basis to design a second, more extensive project. The Maya constitute a central
focus of archaeological interest because they developed a civilization with
monumental architecture, writing and large population concentrations in a
difficult lowland tropical environment. Just as mysteriously as it arose, the
Maya civilization then declined as large centers were abandoned and large scale
construction ceased. Dr. Pyburn wishes to gain insight into this process. In the
last decade Belize has been the scene of much archaeological research and a
number of Mayan sites have been studied. It is unclear to what extent each
functioned as an independent center and it is not known whether sites were
grouped into larger functional units. Through excavation of Chau Hiix and
comparison with other sites known from the area Dr. Pyburn wishes to examine
this question. This research is important for several reasons. It will provide
insight into how complex societies arise, are maintained and decline. It will
provide data of interest to many archaeologists and assist in the training of
undergraduate students.
