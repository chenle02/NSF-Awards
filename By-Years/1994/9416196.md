9416196 Stallings This project is being funded as part of the National
Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program's investigation into the causes and effects
of the January 17, 1994 earthquake. The project will identify a purposive sample
of neighborhoods which experienced concentrated damage from the earthquake and
explore the process of recovery by examining existing data on damaged structures
and conducting personal interviews with both probability and nonprobability
samples of key participants in the recovery process including tenants, apartment
and commercial building owners, housing officials, and officials from relevant
federal agencies. The study will contribute to a better understanding of the
revival of urban neighborhoods following a major urban disaster and suggest how
federal and other government disaster recovery and mitigation policies might be
rewritten to facilitate the retention of extensively damaged neighborhoods by
removing the unintended consequences accompanying policy implementation. ***
