The focus of this research is refinement of the Kulinkovich reaction which
involves the titanium-mediated cyclopropanation of esters and the use of the
resulting heteroatom-substituted cyclopropanes as synthetic intermediates for
medium size ring formation. Methods for asymmetric cyclopropanation,
cyclopropanol and cyclopropylamine-mediated syntheses, and the elaboration of
vinylcyclobutanols will be pursued and a total synthesis of the natural product
suberosenone will be used to highlight the
methodology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this renewal award, the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Jin K. Cha of
the Department of Chemistry at the University of Alabama. Professor Cha will
focus his work on the development of methods for the stereoselective
construction of carbocycles by taking advantage of the release of ring strain
present in readily available heteroatom-substituted cyclopropanes. The research
has potential broader impact in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries
and presents an excellent vehicle for the training of students.
