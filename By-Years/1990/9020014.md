This project is designed to examine the degree to which the expression of
several alternative maternal behaviors exhibited by Gargaphia solani, is under
genetic control. It is founded upon the fact that within the same animal
population, behaviors with similar functions are often so different that one
response can be considered a distinct alternative to other responses. The
factors determining whether behavioral alternatives stem from genetic or
environmental differences among individuals are understood in only a few cases.
Gargaphia provides a model system with which to examine behavioral alternatives
because of the unusual maternal behaviors exhibited by these organisms: within a
single populaton females either guard their offspring from predators, abandon
their eggs after laying, or leave their eggs to the care and protection of
another female. Furthermore, egg recipients either aggressively repel egg donors
or passively accept their eggs. The existence of these and other maternal
options in G. solani provides an opportunity to characterize the extent to which
the expression of each alternative is regulated by genes, by environmental
conditions, or by some interaction between the two. This project will examine
the genetic component of behavioral alternatives associated with egg dumping and
antipredator aggression by means of half-sib analyses, intra-and interpopulation
comparisons, and artificial selection. Integration of this information will
provide a valuable expansion of the experimental base upon which theories
concerning the evolution, mechanisms, and ecology of alternative behavioral
tactics can be tested.
