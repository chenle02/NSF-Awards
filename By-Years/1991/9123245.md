The oceanographic instrumentation program supports requests to acquire
instrumentation for the collection, processing and analysis of oceanographic
data. This proposal from the University of Alaska requests funding for equipment
that will be used to support NSF- funded research cruises aboard the R/V ALPHA
HELIX, a 133 foot vessel that is owned and operated by the University.
