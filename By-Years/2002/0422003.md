This project creates a merit-based scholarship program for talented but
financially needy students in computer science and mathematics. These
scholarships will be known as the NSF - John von Neumann Scholarships. Each year
the project awards twenty scholarships to beginning students, fifteen
scholarships to advanced students, and one scholarship to a graduate student.
These scholarships increase the numbers of students who excel in beginning
courses, increase the amount of time students can spend each week on their
study, reduce the number of students who suspend their education for financial
reasons, and retain more students to graduation. Ultimately the project
increases the number of students graduating in four years in computer science
and mathematics. The project includes a learning community for incoming
freshmen, faculty mentors for scholarship recipients, tutors in computer science
and mathematics, and career placement services on graduation. The intellectual
merit of the project lies in giving students more time for academics, improving
mentoring and support services, and encouraging creative work. The broader
impacts of the project lies in project broadening the participation of
underrepresented groups in computer science and mathematics by improving their
access to higher education.
