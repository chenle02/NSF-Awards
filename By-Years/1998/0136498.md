&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0136498&lt;br/&gt;Verosub&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In environmental
magnetic studies, the magnetic properties of sediments and soils are used as
tracers of paleoclimatic and other environmental processes. The automated long-
core cryogenic magnetometer in the Paleomagnetism Laboratory at UC-Davis has
been designated by NSF as a national facility for environmental magnetic
research. This grant will provide support for a laboratory manager whose primary
responsibilities will be to oversee the operations of this facility, to develop
new applications for the long-core magnetometer and new methods of analyzing the
data generated by it, and to facilitate the use of the instrument by outside
users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
