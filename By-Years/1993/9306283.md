9306283 Gallistel Understanding the processes that mediate choice in the face of
uncertainty is fundamental to understanding foraging behavior in animals and
economic behavior in humans. It has long been known that rats and humans tend to
allot time or invest in a given course of action in proportion to the relative
amount of reward they experience from it--the matching law. If one alternative
yields twice as much reward as another, they spend twice as much time with that
alternative. Dr. Gallistel has discovered that rats can assess the relative
rates of reward based on the most recent one or two intervals between rewards.
He now will explore how both the most recent and more long-range experience
determines their choice statistics, primarily the statistics describing how long
they stay with an alternative once they've chosen it. The rats are rewarded by
direct electrical stimulation of a pathway in the brain. This artificial reward
does not produce satiation (loss of motivation to respond), so animals may be
given many rewards for long periods every day, generating the voluminous data
required for analyzing the statistical laws that govern their choice behavior.
Understanding the preverbal (animal) process for coping with choice in the face
of uncertainty is relevant to estimating the role of language in mediating these
same choices in humans. Because these experiments provide reward by direct
electrical stimulation of neural tissue, they also open up the prospect of
investigating the neurophysiological basis of this ubiquitous and important
behavioral process. Thus, the study of matching behavior in self- stimulating
rats may enrich our understanding of human-decision making on the one hand and
open an avenue to the experimental study of the neurobiology of elementary
decision-making on the other.
