The "International Conference on Groups and Semigroups" will take place June
11-14, 2013 at Bar Ilan University in Israel. The aim of this conference is to
stimulate cooperative research among group theorists and semigroup theorists who
are using related techniques in the geometric, combinatorial, and dynamical
aspects of the theories. Research in both group theory and semigroup theory has
burgeoned in recent years, with many new tools and ideas connecting these fields
to topology, geometry, dynamical systems, symbolic computation, and
combinatorics. The conference will feature invited talks by several of the
leading researchers in these fields, highlighting new developments using
geometric, combinatorial and dynamical methods to study algorithmic and
asymptotic problems in groups and semigroups. The proceedings of the conference
will be published in a special issue of the International Journal of Algebra and
Computation.

Group theory and semigroup theory are central areas of modern algebra that have
close connections with diverse areas of mathematics including topology, geometry
and formal language theory, as well as many applications in the physical and
computational sciences. Recent developments in group theory and semigroup theory
have made use of a wide variety of mathematical tools from geometry,
combinatorics and symbolic dynamics. The aim of this conference is to bring
together several of the world's leading experts in the use of these techniques
to stimulate cooperative research in these fields. Invited talks will be given
by senior researchers from the US, Canada, Israel, Russia, and several European
countries, and there will be open problem and discussion sessions involving
interaction between senior researchers and junior mathematicians and graduate
students. Details of the conference may be found on the conference website at
