This project is addressing student learning in the natural sciences through
integrated science literacy instruction in an introductory, prerequisite biology
course. The materials being developed address the student needs of learning a
new language that includes the use of symbols, learning to think more abstractly
and make associations between concepts, and learning how to read a scientific
textbook to build on prior knowledge, read and interpret charts and graphs, and
make sense of static drawings of active processes. These materials are
increasing the retention and graduation rates and better preparing students for
certification testing and/or transfer to a four-year institution. The project
also focuses on instruction for faculty on how to best use these materials in
the classroom.

Underrepresented students, students from rural areas, and women are gaining the
science literacy skills necessary to successfully complete the first two years
of the science curriculum and either transfer to a four-year institution or pass
certification exams for career pathways.
