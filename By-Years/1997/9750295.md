Abstract DBI 9750295 Carol Goodwillie This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral
Research Fellowship in Biosciences Related to the Environment for 1997. This
fellowship provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain additional scientific
training beyond the doctoral degree and to pursue innovative and imaginative
into the fundamental mechanisms underlying the interactions between organisms
and their environment at the molecular, cellular, organismal, population,
community and/or ecosystem level in any area of biology supported by the
Directorate for Biological Sciences of the National Science Foundation. Each
fellowship supports a research and training plan to be carried out in a
sponsoring laboratory. The research and training plan for this fellowship is
entitled "Genetic basis of floral traits associated with mating system
divergence." Knowledge of the genetic basis of adaptation is central to
understanding evolutionary processes. Floral traits associated with mating
systems are prominent adaptations of higher plants. DNA marker-based genome
mapping techniques are being used to investigate the number and magnitude of
loci controlling floral traits distinguishing 2 species of Linanthus that have
diverged in mating systems.
