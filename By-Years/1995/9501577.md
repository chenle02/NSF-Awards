CAREER: A Systematic Approach to Reasoning about Actions and Change This is the
first year funding of a three-year CAREER grant. The proposed research is a step
toward the systematic construction of intelligent agents that can reason and act
in a changing world. These "cognitive robots" should be able, among other
things, to (1) observe other objects changing their attributes and performing
actions, and (2) use their observations and their knowledge to reason about the
future and the past, to make or revise plans to achieve goals and execute the
generated plans. The approach here is to develop (1) an action specification
language that can express actual and hypothetical situations, concurrent
actions, actions with complex effects, constraints, triggers, mapping between
actual situation line and actual time line; (2) executable logic programs that
embody the specifications; (3) interpreters for extension of the logic programs;
and (4) the cognitive robots themselves. During the period of the grant, an
educational plan will be developed that exposes students to the insights,
perspectives, and tools of AI by (1) educating undergraduates about AI's basic
methods and concepts and about AI's philosophical, social, and cognitive
consequences, and (2) educating graduate students in other fields about the AI
techniques and tools applicable to their fields. Intelligent robots, which have
a great attraction to students and enable them to focus on some of the important
topics of AI, will be used in some of the courses to be developed.
