Although the structure of sunspots has been studied in considerable detail in
and above the photosphere, it has only recently been possible to probe the
structure beneath the visible surface of the Sun. Recent work shows that this
can be done using the scattering of p-mode acoustic waves by spots. This work
will be expanded to include the scattering of p-modes from a variety of active
regions, the temporal evolution of the scattering properties of emerging and
decaying active regions and the reconstruction of the subsurface morphology.
