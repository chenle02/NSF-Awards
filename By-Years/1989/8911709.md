This award is for partial support for the Fourth National Conference on
Earthquake Engineering. The conference is the fourth in a series of national
conferences on earthquake engineering. Previous conferences have been held in
Ann Arbor, Michigan, Stanford, California, and Charleston, South Carolina. They
are held at about four-year intervals, about half-way in time between the World
Conferences on Earthquake Engineering. All of the conferences have been
sponsored by EERI, the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute, a non-profit
professional society devoted to earthquake engineering and earthquake hazard
reduction. The conference provides a valuable means for research workers and
practitioners in the several technical disciplines involved to come together and
exchange results and ideas. The Proceedings of the conference provide a valuable
depository of information useful for future research and advances in this field.
