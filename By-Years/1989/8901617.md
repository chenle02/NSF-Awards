The primary objective of this research is to find the dimension and bases for
certain classes of splines. the principal investigator will use methods of
algebra, combinatorics, homology and computer algebra. In particular, the spline
spaces can be described as vector spaces and modules. Techniques from homology
theory and combinatorics will be used to discern properties of these spaces.
Generating sets for modules of splines will be computed using recent techniques
in computer algebra.//
