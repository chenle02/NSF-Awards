This project provides partial support for the 1988 Gordon Conference on Organic
Thin Films to be held February 15-19, 1988 at the Casa Serina Hotel in Oxnard,
California. The Conference covers a broad range of research interests: Langmuir-
Blodgett films; conducting polymers; sensor technology, and optical device. This
is a cross-disciplinary activity that has major ramifications to a number of
emerging technologies. The project provides exchange of knowledge important to
the chemical processing of advanced materials for information storage and
handling. Support from NSF provides funds for the expenses of foreign scientists
and young engineers and scientists who are invited participants.
