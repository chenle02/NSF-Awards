Both the miniaturization and the increase of power of UV light sources are
currently seriously limited by the capability of cooling such devices. Such
light sources are presently used in drying industrial inks, coatings and
adhesives on papers, metals, glasses and other substrates. Furthermore, similar
equipment is employed in the manufacture of semiconductor devices. Higher power
sources will allow for greater collimation of the light output, which would be
highly advantageous for optical lithography. In Phase I of this SBIR Award, the
basic nature of the physical mechanisms involved in the jet cooling of spheres
will be examined, with a view to obtaining improved cooling capability of
spherical light sources. Experiments are to be conducted to evaluate the
effectiveness of techniques such as acoustic excitation, pulsing of the jet
lips, pulsing of the oncoming flow, and shaping of the jet nozzle. These
techniques are expected to markedly increase the entrainment rate and, thereby,
the degree of mixing--with a consequent net increase of the heat transfer
capability of the jet cooling. ____________________________ ____________ Program
