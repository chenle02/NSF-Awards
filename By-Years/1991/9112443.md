This is an award to provide support for purchase of engineering research
equipment to permit study of solid- fluid separation operations relating to
potential applicability of cross-flow filtration to oxidation of organic
material in aqueous suspension or solution using a supercritical water oxidation
process. Research to be conducted includes determination of the solid separation
efficiency of the cross-flow process, behavior of the catalyst, fouling and heat
transfer characteristics, and corrosion issues. The proposal leading to this
award was submitted in response to the Program Announcement and Guidelines NSF
90-146, Research Equipment Grant Program. Results are expected to provide
guidance for engineering design of processes and systems to reduce or eliminate
the pollutional impact of wastewater and sludges on environmental quality.
