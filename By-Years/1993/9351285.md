This new introductory biology laboratory course includes extensive hands-on
experience and introduces freshmen students to research. Students use some of
the same equipment used in upper division laboratory courses. Phenomena studied
include cellular and subcellular structure, gene transformation, transduction
and protein action, light absorption by chlorophyll, and animal behavior.
