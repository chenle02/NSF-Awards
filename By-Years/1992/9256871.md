Professor Samuel P. Kounaves is supported by a grant from the Chemistry Division
and the Graduatae Education and Research Division of NSF for a Graduate Research
Traineeship Program which will involve four graduate students who will receive
training in environmental chemistry. This traineeship program includes
participation by ten chemistry faculty at Tufts University who have brought
together their expertise from traditional sub-disciplines of analytical,
inorganic, physical and organic chemistry to produce a focussed research and
teaching effort in environmental chemistry. A special emphasis will be placed on
identifying, recruiting and encouraging women and minority students to apply,
and to actively support and encourage them throughout their graduate training.
%%% Our country's ability to produce trained scientists in the critical areas
encompassed by environmental chemistry is not only vital to the health of our
environment, but also to our scientific and economic leadership. In order to
effectively manage the environment we need trained chemists who can apply their
expertise in solving environmental problems in such diverse areas as: control of
manufacturing processes; advanced environmental sensor and monitoring
technologies; waste management; biodegradation; atmospheric and water modeling
of chemical reactions; and better energy production and storage. The aim of this
Graduate Research Traineeship Program is to provide a group of Ph.D. chemists
who are trained to address these challenging problems.
