Heating of the solar corona will be studied by observing the coronal
oscillation spectrum at the total eclipse of 11 July 1991. This will be an
extremely favorable eclipse in terms of duration and probable viewing
conditions. The observations provide a test of a mechanism to explain the
heating of the solar corona via Alfven waves. The heating takes place in the
region of formation of the solar wind. The proposed new experiment improves on
prior observations during eclipses of 1980 and 1983 by improved image
acquisition during totality, a major expansion of the frequency range under
observation through greatly improved tracking, and through improved techniques
of digitization and data recording. Undergraduate students will be actively
involved in both the instrument development, testing, and observation activities
of this research. ***//
