Native Waters is a comprehensive four-year tribal science education program
focused on water. Working closely with leaders from 28 Missouri River Basin
Tribes, the project will explore the Missouri River Flood Basin from a
scientific and cultural standpoint. Partners are The Watercourse and
International Project WET (Water Education for Teachers). Activities include
Leadership Institutes for community educators and Native Waters Future Leaders
Camps for secondary school and college students. Products to be developed
include an interactive traveling exhibit, which will focus on the Missouri River
watershed and the physical properties of water, as well as its uses from a
cultural and scientific standpoint. The exhibit will travel to cultural centers,
tribal colleges and school libraries throughout the ten Missouri River Basin
states. A 250-page Native Water's Educators Guide will be disseminated
nationally and impact over 500,000 individuals, both youth and adults. Finally,
a 16-page student activity book and a Native Waters film will be produced to
introduce youth and community members to water resource issues. The training
materials will be used in cultural centers, museums, area water councils and
schools.
