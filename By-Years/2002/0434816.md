NeTS-ProWIN: Viral Radio

Award 0434816

Abstract

This project is the initial stage of research intended to explore the
feasibility of an approach to wireless networking called Viral Radio by
assembling and evaluating a research prototype system with a small number of
software-controlled radio nodes. The premise of Viral Radio is that it is
possible to make energy- and spectrum-efficient radio communications networks
that scale (almost) without bound. An adaptive distributed set of nodes treats
RF signal relaying in a given space as a distributed optimization process
whereby each radio uses the presence of other radios to assist and cooperate in
messages delivery. Relaying is done without demodulation or buffering; thus
eliminating delays normally associated with multi-hop ad hoc networks. A
distributed routing algorithm controls the relays, and the ultimate destination
nodes use the combination of original signal and relayed signals, plus the
variability of propagation between source and destination to allocate signal
energy in space to maximize throughput while minimizing interference between
concurrent messages. This research path eventually leads to highly scalable and
highly efficient real-time telecommunications and broadcast systems that rely on
no central radiator or suite of cell towers. By showing how spectrum capacity
can be increased by the presence of other, cooperating elements, Viral Radio
suggests a new paradigm for spectrum management that allows the most
communicating elements in a region without mutual interference rather than the
least. This research can add additional practical weight to this argument, and
can be used by those who are weighing new policy alternatives.
