Very little attention has been paid in industrial organization to the timing of
firms' quantity decisions, in particular when firms have private information.
When a firm is privately informed, e.g, about the state of demand, any action
taken by that firm can convey information. This includes the decision on when to
make (or announce) a quantity (capacity) choice. While making a decision early
enables a firm to commit to an advantageous quantity level, other firms gain
information about the state of demand. Furthermore, the possibility of
misleading the other firms by choosing a small quantity (which leads the other
firms to conclude that the state of demand is worse than it actually is) results
in equilibrium in small quantity choices. This effect can be so marked that, ex
ante, no firm wants to choose before the other firms have chosen. The
investigator has already proven in a simple model that the most informed firm
will choose before other firms. This project will extend the analysis to more
complicated dynamic and informational environments. The project also studies
general equilibrium models of firm formation. Earlier work has viewed ownership
of a firm as either equivalent to ownership of an asset or production process or
the ability to exercise residual rights. While these aspects are certainly
important, this project shows that production externalities and the transmission
of resources over time are also important aspects of entrepreneurial activity.
Private information also plays an important role. This is exciting research
because it promises new insights into the timing of firm's investment decisions
and into the creation of new jobs by the formation of firms. Methodologically,
this project also improves the widely used leader-follower(s) game- theoretic
model.
