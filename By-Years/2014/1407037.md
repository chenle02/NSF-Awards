This project studies novel inference procedures and models for seasonal time
series. The results of this research will have direct impact on the diagnostics
of seasonal adjustment procedures that are currently implemented at the U.S.
Census Bureau and other domestic or foreign agencies where seasonal adjustments
are routinely published. The "Visual Significance" method used at the Census
Bureau lacks a rigorous statistical justification and the new spectral peak
detection methods will help to quantify type I and II errors in a disciplined
fashion for a wide class of processes. Although motivated by research problems
at Census, the new methodology and models are expected to be useful in the
analysis of time series from various disciplines, including economics,
astronomy, environmental science, and atmospheric sciences, among others.

Specifically, the project consists of three interrelated parts. In the first
part, the PI will develop two new methods of spectral peak detection, which are
intended to provide more principled approaches to the "Visual Significance"
method used at the U.S. Census Bureau. In the second part, the PI will address
the band-limited goodness-of-fit testing using the integral of the square of the
normalized periodogram. Instead of assuming the strong Gaussian-like assumption
as done in the literature, the PI will use a new Studentizer, so that the
limiting distribution of the self-normalization-based test statistic is pivotal
under less stringent assumptions. In the third part, the PI will study a new
parametric class of spectral density, which can be used in model-based seasonal
adjustment to improve the quality of model fitting and seasonal adjustment. The
new parametric models and related model-based seasonal adjustment, if
successfully developed, may offer a more effective means of modeling and
adjusting time series. The research will promote teaching and training through
mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students and through the development of
related lecture notes.
