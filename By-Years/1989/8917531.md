The PIs will investigate the elastic wave velocity, Vp, and attenuation, Qp-1,
in pure melts of Fe and Fe-Ni-S alloys which are relevant to the outer core of
the earth. By using the ultrasonic interferometric technique, the temperature,
compositional and frequency dependences of Vp-1 will be determined in the
frequency range from 3 to 20 MHz and in the temperature range from 988oC to
1650oC. Bulk modulus and viscosity will also be calculated. By characterizing
any relaxation mechanisms, the results should prove very valuable criteria with
which to interpret existing shock-wave elasticity data on pure Fe. In addition,
these results will be analysed from the point of view of liquid structure. The
static structure factor will be calculated and compared to previous experimental
and theoretical values. The influence of parent solid structure on liquid
structure will be investigated and interpreted in terms of its geophysical
significance.
