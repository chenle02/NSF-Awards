9416904 Katz The objective of this project is to understand better the physical
processes which produce gamma-ray bursts. Models have been developed in which a
debris shell from a relativistic fireball collides with interstellar gas.
Analytic estimates have shown that this model may lead to gamma-ray bursts
consistent with those actually observed. Dr. Katz will test these models by
replacing the estimates previously made with quantitative calculations. The
method to be employed is that of numerical hydrodynamics, which permits the
quantitative calculation of the flow of fireball debris and interstellar matter
in almost arbitrarily complicated flows.
