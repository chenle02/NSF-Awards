This is an interdisciplinary study to identify the range in vent fluid
chemistry, vent deposit compositions, and biota at major vent fields along the
Eastern Lau Spreading Center, and the key processes and variables that influence
fluid chemistry, sulfide deposit formation and the range in habitats available
for biological communities. The molecular and physiological diversity of
associated microbes, the distribution and reproductive status of dominant
megafaunal organisms present in the vicinity of hot-springs, and the
distribution of plankton and larvae in the overlying water column will be
related to the environmental conditions present at each vent site. The
variations in spreading rate, axial depth and morphology, magma source and lave
chemistry, melt lens characteristics, crustal structure, and proximity to arc
magma sources and the subducting slab provide an excellent opportunity for
examining the influence of key variables on hydrothermal venting and associated
megafauna and microfauna.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
