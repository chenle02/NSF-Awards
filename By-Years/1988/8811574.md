this research project is devised to produce a convenient and reliable tool for
estimating the behavior of organic pollutants in the environment. The objectives
of the research are: (1) to develop state-of-the-art knowledge of quantitative
structure activity relationship (QSAR) research, (2) to construct a QSAR which
predicts soil sorption of organic compounds for various soil types, and (3) to
design an expert system which can be used by environment engineers to predict
the behavior of organic pollutants in the environment. After completion of the
literature search, a QSAR soil sorption relationship for organic compounds which
also includes soil descriptors such as porosity, permeability, gradation
analysis and organic content will be determined. Connectivity indices will be
calculated for the compounds and any relationship between the indices, soil
parameters, and soil sorption will be investigated. All pertinent QSAR
relationships will be organized in a computerized expert system so that the
information already accumulated will be easily accessed. The expert system will
provide information using chemical structure and/or chemical name as the only
input.
