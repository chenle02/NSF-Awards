This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the
feasibility of the use of a debris cartridge in an implant to prevent
obstruction in debris-releasing glaucomas, such as uveitic, pigment-dispersion,
and pseudoexfoliation glaucomas. Glaucoma is a group of chronic eye diseases
that result in permanent vision loss for millions of suffers in the US alone.
The innovation of this device lies in its potential ability to provide
predictable, adjustable and personalize care to minimize disease progression.
However, the device requires a filter to prevent infection that may clog
overtime, especially with debris-releasing glaucomas. This Phase I research
project will test the feasibility of a novel filter to prevent clogging and its
safety in an animal model for debris-releasing glaucoma. The validation of the
cartridge will provide the option for glaucoma suffers that may have been
otherwise excluded from the advantage that this implant would provide.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be, if successful,
a more effective treatment for patients with an advanced, cumbersome and
difficult to treat type of glaucomas. In 2015, the US glaucoma market is
estimated to be over $2 billion and our addressable market, glaucoma surgical
therapies, is estimated to be $534M. The incidence for glaucoma increases with
age, and as the baby boomer population gets older, there will be a growing need
for glaucoma treatments. Debris-releasing glaucomas are especially difficult to
treat and can affect children. These patients often are required to endure
invasive surgeries throughout their lives that are difficult to manage with
current therapies. If successful, our novel device and cartridge would radically
change the treatment paradigm of glaucoma, providing the first personalized,
long lasting, and adjustable therapy that can treat the most advanced cases of
glaucoma. Ultimately, the advancements with the filter will minimize the risk of
blindness and improve the quality of life for glaucoma patients.
