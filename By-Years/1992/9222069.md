ABSTRACT Although responsive parenting is critical to child development, why it
occurs and the processes that comprise it are poorly understood. This research
will test a model of responsive parenting that emphasizes the emotions and
emotional communication occurring during parent-child communication. The model
details how maternal responsiveness is influenced by mothers' experience of
particular emotions and their ability to understand the emotional communications
of children. Mothers will play, feed and wait with their young children. From
videotapes of these interactions, mothers' behavior will be coded for three
aspects of responsiveness: sensitivity, intrusiveness and contingency. The data
will be used to understand how responsive behavior is influenced by mothers'
immediate emotions, the child behavior that elicits them, and the emotions
mothers think their children are experiencing. The data will also be used to
understand whether emotions are a principal reason why responsiveness is
influenced by other, non-immediate variables, specifically by mothers'
personalities, mothers' social relationships, and the temperaments of children.
Do mothers' levels of empathy, depression, or marital conflict, for example,
undermine mothers' responsiveness because these influence the emotions mothers
feel when interacting with their children? This research will enable us to
understand how emotions control the responsiveness of mothers' behavior, and how
emotions determine the impact that life experiences and personality dispositions
have on parenting behavior. This knowledge is critical to understanding human
development in the first years of life and, in fact, to understanding ways that
emotions promote and undermine interpersonal behavior generally.
