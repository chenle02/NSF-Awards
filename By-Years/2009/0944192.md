Objective: The objective of this effort is to provide partial support to the
Micro and Nano Systems Horizon 2040 Workshop, which will be held in conjunction
with the IEEE International Conference on Solid State Sensors, Actuators, and
Microsystems (Transducers 2009), in Denver, Colorado. The workshop will bring
together researchers, scientists, and engineers who are interested in micro and
nano systems for panel discussions on how to prioritize research in this area.

Intellectual Merit: This workshop will cover emerging research themes relevant
to micro and nano systems interests in the ECCS division, including four topics
to be addressed in break-out sessions: environmental monitoring; infrastructure
monitoring and homeland security; health care; and energy/power. The Transducers
2009 Conference also covers these topics, and includes many papers supported by
ENG and ECCS awards.

Broader Impact: The workshop and conference will involve a range of participants
from industrial representatives to academic researchers and students.
Representatives of other government agencies have also been invited as
observers.
