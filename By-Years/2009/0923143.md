This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major unsolved problem in science is
how the brain stores and recalls information. While significant progress has
been made in recent decades, much work remains to be done in order to achieve a
complete understanding the neural basis of learning and memory. A significant
impediment toward such an understanding is the vast complexity of the mammalian
brain. For this reason it would be useful to develop a simpler model system in
which to study fundamental biological mechanisms of learning and memory. During
the project behavioral and electrophysiological investigations of simple forms
of learning in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) will be carried out. The zebrafish,
although a vertebrate organism, exhibits several reflexive behaviors that are
mediated by relatively simple neuronal circuits in its hindbrain and spinal
cord. The project will focus on the startle reflex in the larval zebrafish.
Attempts will be made to identify specific changes in the central nervous system
of the zebrafish, particularly changes in the strength of synaptic connections
between neurons that mediate three basic forms of learning: habituation,
sensitization and classical conditioning. The underlying motivation of these
investigations is that an understanding of the neural basis of learning in the
larval zebrafish will provide important insights into learning and memory in
more complex organisms, including humans. The project will provide unique
training opportunities for a postdoctoral investigator, as well as for
undergraduate students working in the laboratory.
