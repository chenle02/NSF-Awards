The consortium between Michigan State University and Florida
State&lt;br/&gt;University proposes the construction of a highly
efficient,&lt;br/&gt;large-area neutron detector for the detection of high-
energy&lt;br/&gt;neutrons to be used in experiments with fast rare isotopes at
the&lt;br/&gt;National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL).
This&lt;br/&gt;consortium is joined by Ball State University, Central
Michigan&lt;br/&gt;University, Concordia College in Moorhead, Minn., Hope
College,&lt;br/&gt;Indiana University at South Bend, Millikin University,
Western&lt;br/&gt;Michigan University, and Westmont College, each of which
will&lt;br/&gt;assemble and test one complete layer of the
detector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed detector consists of 144 horizontal
blocks of plastic&lt;br/&gt;scintillator arranged in 9 layers of 16 detectors
each, covering an&lt;br/&gt;area of 2.0 m wide by 1.6 m high. The detector is
position&lt;br/&gt;sensitive and features multi-hit capability. The addition
of&lt;br/&gt;passive iron converters enhances the detection efficiency
for&lt;br/&gt;neutrons with energies above 100 MeV for an average efficiency of
up&lt;br/&gt;to 70%. The high detection efficiency will allow the
investigation&lt;br/&gt;of very neutron-rich nuclei that can only be produced
with small&lt;br/&gt;intensities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The detector will be used
in connection with the new sweeper magnet&lt;br/&gt;with its focal plane
detectors in stand-alone mode as well as with&lt;br/&gt;the combination of
sweeper magnet and the S800 magnetic&lt;br/&gt;spectrograph. It will therefore
be essential for the experimental&lt;br/&gt;program at the coupled cyclotron
facility. The detector can be&lt;br/&gt;optimized for even higher beam energies
with only minor&lt;br/&gt;modifications due to its modular design. It could be
the first&lt;br/&gt;detector to be used for fast fragmentation beams at the Rare
Isotope.
