9626111 Hatcher The two investigators will continue their research into
homological properties of automorphism groups of free groups, in particular, to
determine whether there is nontrivial rational homology in the stable dimension
range and whether these automorphism groups are virtual duality groups. The
homotopy type of related complexes on which the automorphism groups act, for
example the complex of free factors of a free group, will also be investigated.
Another problem which will be studied is to determine the homotopy type of the
space of all embeddings of a link in 3-space, extending known results for knots.
In particular, it should be possible to answer Kontsevich's question whether
this space has finite homotopy type. In more general terms, this involves
determining all the essentially different ways of removing unnecessary tangles
from a knotted piece of string or from several pieces which are knotted and
linked together. With regard to the other part of the project, automorphisms of
free groups play a fundamental role in group theory (the general study of
symmetry) somewhat analogous to matrices in linear algebra, and the goal is to
understand just how close this parallel is: When one takes a geometric view of
both sorts of algebraic objects, is the picture qualitatively the same, or
qualitatively different? ***
