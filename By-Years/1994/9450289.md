SSC-9450289 Cal State U Hayward Fnd Hayward, CA Harper, Charlie "Summer Physics
Enrichment Camps (SPECS)" Summer Physics Enrichment Camps (SPECS) is an SEM
enrichment program designed to serve 40 minority seventh graders and four junior
high school science teachers per year. Twenty students and two teachers from
each of two school districts (Oakland and New Haven) will participate in the
4-week residential summer camp and academic-year follow-up activities. The goals
of SPECS are to provide a foundation for a lifelong interest in SEM for
participants and to encourage the consideration of SEM as a possible career.
Some specific objectives of SPECS are to (a) strengthen students' commitment to
remain in school and complete their university entrance course requirements, (b)
illustrate the importance of SEM skills in our daily lives, and (c) offer
students information and guidance in the career exploration process. SPECS seeks
to reverse the pattern of minority students being under-motivated and unprepared
to consider science-based careers or to enter higher education. SPECS will
provide students with (a) residential experience on a university campus, (b) an
opportunity to explore science by use of hands-on and visual activities, (c)
mentors and role models who will encourage the students to pursue higher
education, (d) enhanced parental support for students' pursuit of higher
education, and (e) academic year activities and guidance. The success of the
program will be evaluated by tracking participants' scholastic achievements in
high school and beyond and by comparing this cohort to a non-participant group.
