Several projects, including numerical studies in heat transfer phenomena,
bifurcating flows, novel breathing cooling devices, and coupled radiative
transfer and combustion in compartment fires, will be aided through the
acquisition of computer graphics equipment. The equipment, including a high-end
workstation to process high resolution imagery and a laser printer for high
resolution graphics, will help researchers to understand, process and make
efficient use of the voluminous digital data associated with computational and
experimental studies.
