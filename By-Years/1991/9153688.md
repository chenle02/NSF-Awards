The University of Texas at Austin proposes to establish an Alliance for Minority
Participation in Mathematics (AMPM) with the goal of eliminating the
underrepresentation of African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans in
mathematics and related disciplines. As part of the Alliance, AMPM will
establish (1) an alliance of twenty-five mathematics departments each working to
achieve the above aim, (2) expand the capacity of fifty mathematics departments
that already have Emerging Scholars Programs. The Emerging Scholars programs are
designed to help both freshmen excel mathematics and science. These programs
will serve at least 1,500 minority students during the course of the award. AMPM
builds on more than ten years of work at Berkeley in creating programs that
increase participation in mathematical and physical sciences. These programs
have been widely copied and now exist in various forms on more than 50 college
and university campuses. AMPM will work with the major professional
organizations of mathematicians to make the operations of these and similar
programs a legitimate and mainstream activity of mathematics departments. It is
the aim of this proposal to assure that the next generation of mathematicians
represents the full diversity of American life.
