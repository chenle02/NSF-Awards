Assistive robotics are increasingly an area of societal interest as the
population ages and individuals with disabilities seek to maintain as much
independence as possible. However, robotic systems were initially designed to
replace humans in hazardous situations, not interact with them. Assistive
robotics, by design, will interact with humans, and this poses new challenges
that must be addressed related to the user interface and safety. In order to
insure the safety of users and encourage average citizens to use of assistive
robots, research is needed into how to develop, manufacture, and control robots
that are designed to interact with individuals on a daily basis and in a home
environment. This conference award will provide support for the 2018 Workshop on
Human-Friendly Robotics at the University of Texas, San Antonio in September
2018. This is the first time that this workshop, held annually in Europe since
2008, will be held in the United States. The focus of the workshop is on
identifying the scientific and technological challenges that exist related to
safely and effectively integrating robots into our daily lives, particularly in
the area of rehabilitation and assistive technology.

This award will provide financial support for nine invited speakers,
internationally renowned, to attend the workshop and lead the discussions. The
discussions will be focused on identifying the current state of the art and the
key unresolved problems and challenges that need to be addressed through
research. The presentations and follow-on discussions will be archived and made
available to the public. A second goal of the workshop is to catalyze
collaborations among researchers, both within the US and with international
partners, to further advance this area of engineering. Finally, by hosting the
workshop on the campus of a minority-serving institution, the organizers hope to
include many underrepresented students in the workshop and use the results of
the workshop to excite K12 students regarding opportunities in STEM.
