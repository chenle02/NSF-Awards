9504158 Lubin Research supported by this grant is under the auspices of the
Arctic Systems Science (ARCSS) Global Change Research Program and is jointly
sponsored by the Division of Ocean Sciences and the Office of Polar Programs.
Work to be performed represents preliminary steps towards a major 5-year
research project named SHEBA, which is envisioned to study the heat budget of
the Arctic Ocean and its impact on global change. The primary goals of SHEBA
are: (1) to develop, test and implement models of arctic ocean- atmosphere-ice
processes that demonstrably improve simulations of the present day arctic
climate, including its variability, using General Circulation Models (GCMs), and
(2) to improve the interpretation of satellite remote sensing data in the Arctic
for analysis of the arctic climate system and provide reliable data for model
input, model validation and climate monitoring. This work involves development
of new technology for solar infrared flux measurements at the Arctic Ocean
surface. Efforts will also be made to develop an all season algorithm to
retrieve total and multi-year sea ice concentrations from SSM/I 85.5 Ghz imagery
from satellites and conduct a validation of polar cloud detection principles,
using AVHRR data matched with surface all-sky photography and sea ice coverage
logs. This proposal focuses on SHEBA PHASE I technological development and
analysis of existing data sets.
