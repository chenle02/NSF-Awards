In order to better prepare the engineers for modern day technology, several
enhancements are planned for the Mechanics of Deformable Bodies Laboratory. The
project has three goals: (a) to introduce the students to tests for dynamic
loading, e.g. reversed cycle fatigue tests, (b) to simulate a real-life
situation in the laboratory by tasking the students with the design and
performance of their own tests that will characterize a new material or a
product, and (c) to train the students in the use of industry standard testing
equipment, and automatic data acquisition system. In order to successfully meet
these goals, the lab will be augmented with a versatile material testing machine
that is equipped with automatic control features, and a PC based data
acquisition system for real-time data recording and analysis. The Mechanics of
Deformable Bodies Lab is a requirement for both Mechanical and Civil Engineering
majors. Mechanical Engineering is the largest department in the college, and the
combined student population of mechanical and Civil Engineering departments is
more than 50 percent of all the engineering students enrolled. Given the large
number of students that are required to take this course and the fraction of
them who are women (25 %) and minorities (15 %), the enhancement of the lab is
imperative and its impact will be truly significant
