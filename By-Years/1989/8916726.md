This project involves a continental scientific drilling program to obtain a
complete, detailed record of the evolution of a classical and logistically
accessible continental rift, the early Mesozoic Newark basin. A wealth of
geological information available from over a century of study of the surface
geology strongly indicates that a complete rift-related sequence is present.
However, intrinsic limitations in the data set, posed by very discontinuous
exposure combined with lateral facies variations, hampers the development of
comprehensive and testable models of rift-related processes. The proposed
drilling consists of 5 shallow (about 1 km each) drill holes designed to recover
approximately 5,000 m section of Late Triassic age sediments and minor igneous
rocks. Combined with recently available cores from the younger (Jurassic) part
of the section, these represent about 30 M. yr. of the history of the rift from
its inception. The physical stratigraphy of the sediments and especially the
documented sedimentary cycles of climatic origin, combined with
biostratigraphic, magnetostratigraphic, and chemostratigraphic control, are
expected to yield a very high resolution chronostratigraphy that will serve as a
standard reference section for the Early Mesozoic Newark Supergroup and thus a
framework for regional (and global) correlations essential to the development of
realistic models of continental rifting.
