The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award
consists of answering an important, fundamental question: how does mechanical
connectivity between the nucleus and the cytoskeleton control key cell functions
like cell mechanosensing, cell motility and cell adhesion? Mechanical forces
control the in vivo development of tissues and are crucial for the in vitro
development of tissue substitutes like artificial arteries and tissue-engineered
heart valves. The molecular mechanisms by which cells sense mechanical stimuli
and transduce them into signaling responses are not well-understood. The
research approach combines engineering techniques to apply controlled mechanical
stimuli to cells, with molecular biology techniques to interfere with the
function of nesprin proteins that physically link the nucleus and the
cytoskeleton. The following objectives are proposed: 1) Determine the mechanism
by which nesprin family proteins control cell sensing of applied forces. 2) Test
the hypothesis that nuclear-cytoskeletal linkages regulate cell sensing of
substrate rigidity. 3) Determine the extent to which nesprins transfer
mechanical force between the nucleus and the cytoskeleton.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will lead to improved understanding of tissue
development where mechanical forces control developmental gene expression,
embryogenesis and tissue patterning. The proposed research will develop
molecular-level understanding of cell mechanosensing. Consequently, it will aid
the success of engineering strategies which use mechanical forces for developing
tissue substitutes with improved performance. Given the ever-growing need for
tissue substitutes, this research has strong potential for benefitting society.
The educational program will impact students at different levels over the award
period including middle and high school students, and undergraduate students
from under-represented groups.
