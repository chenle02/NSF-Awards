This project is concerned with extending projection operator formalism and
combining it with a density matrix approach in order to describe
photorecombination processes. The theoretical work is laid out so that some of
it may be performed by undergraduate research assistants. The work is a
continuation of previous work done by the principal investigator in
collaboration with Dr. John Cooper of the University of Colorado and Dr. Verne
Jacobs of the Naval Research Laboratory, and the proposed work relies on a
continuation of this collaboration.
