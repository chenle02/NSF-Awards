This award provides support in part for the international workshop "At the
Frontiers of Condensed Matter IV: Current Trends and Novel Materials". The
workshop will be held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, December 9-12, 2008. The
workshop is centered on theoretical developments in condensed matter with a
focus that includes: high temperature superconductors, low dimensional systems,
dilute magnetic semiconductors, spintronics and nanomagnetism, multiferroics and
multifunctional materials, graphene and other monolayer materials. This workshop
contributes to scientific exchange in growing scientific areas across the
Americas. Europeans will also participate. It also enhances NSF supported
international activities involving the Americas and provides an opportunity to
stimulate collaborations involving various countries in the Americas. NSF
support enhances participation of early-career scientists and members of
underrepresented groups.
