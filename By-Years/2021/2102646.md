With the support of the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) program in the Division of
Chemistry, Oleg V. Larionov of the University of Texas at San Antonio is
developing new catalysts that use the energy of the visible light to enable
previously unknown chemical reactions. The new catalysts enable the chemical
reactions by selectively breaking chemical bonds that connect specific atoms
within large molecules and replacing them with other groups of atoms, producing
new and more complex molecules, while generating less waste and expending less
non-renewable resources. The new reactions will simplify production of
agrochemicals, medicines, and plastics. Additional societal benefits will
include training of underrepresented groups in various aspects of chemical
research and improvements in the chemical education through the development of
an innovative workshop on sustainable
technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Progress in the development of new catalytic
transformations requires deeper understanding of mechanistic details of diverse
catalytic systems. In this project, Oleg Larionov is advancing the discovery of
new catalytic manifolds, enabling efficient and selective functionalizations of
strong bonds by radical and radical-ionic pathways that become accessible upon
photo-activation with visible light. He and his students are developing new
photocatalysts, engaging substrates by means of directional catalystâ€“substrate
interactions that provide the necessary selectivity in a departure from typical
non-directional catalytic systems. The research is expected to streamline
synthetic access to valuable functionalized materials and will add to the
understanding of complex catalytic manifolds including those that will likely
underpin future synthetic methodologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
