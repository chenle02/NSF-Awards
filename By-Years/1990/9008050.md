The objective of this project is to quantify the dynamic reliability performance
of an electric power system by designing a methodology, developing a power
system dynamic simulation program with capability in static adequacy evaluation
and by applying the technique to test systems. The methodologies are expected to
be microcomputer based. The work includes formulation of indices which will help
to characterize the severity of disturbances in power system performance. Also
the indices might be used to compare system adequacy. The project is expected to
lead to the integration of system security and system adequacy evaluation. The
project is a Research Initiation Award (RIA).
