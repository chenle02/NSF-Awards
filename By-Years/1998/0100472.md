The planned research involves several interrelated areas in spectral graph
theory, extremal graph theory and random graphs. A main goal is to deduce the
fundamental properties and structures of a graph from its graph spectrum (or
from a short list of easily computable invariants). Various combinatorial,
geometric and probabilistic techniques are being developed for examining the
relations and behaviors of various graph invariants and properties. Although the
primary objective is to advance our understanding of the intrinsic
characteristics and underlying principles that govern discrete structures, such
principles are quite effective and essential in dealing with problems involving
massive graphs that arise in Internet computing and massive data
sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A number of combinatorial problems on Internet
infrastructures are examined, including the modeling and scaling of massive
graphs using probabilistic analysis. Of particular interest is the study of
graphs with power law distributions that offer good approximations for realistic
networks. The evolution process of large dynamic graphs with only partial
information is being analyzed and this has led to challenging problems and new
research directions.&lt;br/&gt;
