9303865 Gasparik The principal objective of the proposed research is to
determine the high pressure stability of majorite garnet in volatile bearing
systems and on the enstatite-diopside and diopside-jadeite joins. The
experiments will utilize mixes of oxides or synthetic compounds and will be
conducted in a split-sphere anvil apparatus at pressures up to 230 kbar. The
results will find application in understanding the composition, the role of
volatiles, and the high-velocity gradients in the Earth's transition zone.
