A collaborative effort on the part of the Boston Public Schools and Boston
University, this 39.month project will enable elementary schoolteachers
throughout the school system to integrate computer-based materials into the
teaching of mathematics. Several innovative curriculum projects that develop
problem.solving skills will be reviewedin order to define their place in the
elementary mathematics curriculum. Through instruction in mathematics content
and interaction with mentor teachers, a total of seventy-five well-prepared K-5
teachers will be readied to use these materials, and to provide inservice
instruction to their colleagues. Participants will include bilingual teachers,
special education teachers, and teachers of gifted and talented students. The
evaluation will assess the project's effect on teaching strategies and on
student learning, and dissemination activities will include the production of a
videotape. The Boston Public Schools is contributing an amount equal to 58% of
the NSF award.
