This project relieves the shortage of qualified information assurance personnel
by providing&lt;br/&gt;generous financial support for graduate/undergraduate
students as participants in a rigorous academic program. The highlights of the
program include: faculty committed to working with undergraduates in a research
environment, immediate integration of students in existing research programs in
information assurance, and a cyber research seminar emphasizing critical
thinking, leadership, and communication skills. The program includes expanding
horizons seminars presented by experts in the field of information assurance and
an ethics component, in the form of an integrated sequence of lectures and
discussion. The goal is to develop professional skills through mentoring,
training, and experience.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
