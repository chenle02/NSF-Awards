This grant is made to Dr. Virginia B. Carter under the Research Planning
Initiative of the Research Opportunities for Women Program. She is attempting to
reenter the scientific workplace after an 11 year interruption followed by 4
years of teaching high school chemistry and physics. This modest program will
refresh her knowledge of her chosen area, single crystal vibrational
spectroscopy, regenerate old equipment at her institution, determine the
applicability of this type of research in undergraduate research programs, and
determine a direction for future research.
