Robert Oppenheimer stands as the mid-twentieth century's example of the iconic
American scientist. His career can mark the intersection of some of the most
dynamic research agendas in STS. Oppenheimer's self-positioning as a theorist
and his activity as a teacher illuminate the study of theory as scientific
practice, just as his trajectory through the mid-century era frames the place of
science in U.S. political and intellectual history. To provoke exchanges among
scholars from different fields, Professors David A. Hollinger, a U.S.
intellectual historian, and Cathryn Carson, a historian of physics, are
convening a workshop on Oppenheimer's role as a scientific intellectual. The
workshop will be held at the University of California, Berkeley, in April 2004
to coincide with Oppenheimer's centennial. The twenty participants will include
younger scholars offering new approaches along with established Oppenheimer
scholars. Their contributions will be published in 2005 in a volume of the
series Berkeley papers in history of science.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual harvest
of the workshop will be an innovative research program constructed by
participants with different disciplinary tools. The rewards for Oppenheimer
scholarship will be matched by the fruitful questions opened up by his case as
an example. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are equally significant. The workshop
will be embedded in a centennial program coordinated with other Berkeley
departments. These events, public like the workshop itself, will engage the
wider community interested in scientists' public functions. The inexpensive
Berkeley papers volume, readily purchasable online, will disseminate the
results. It will be useful in undergraduate courses that deal with this pivotal
figure, as well as teacher preparation for high school history
classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
