The project will study the geometry of knots which are critical configurations
for "ropelength", which is defined to be the quotient of their length over the
radius of their largest embedded tubular neighborhood. Since the ropelength
functional is not smooth, there is no classical Euler-Lagrange equation
describing the minimizers. The primary aim of the projec666t is to provide an
analogy to the Euler-Lagrange equation: a "balance criterion", which shows that
a curve is ropelength critical if and only if the first variation of the length
of the core curve can be balanced by a system of self-contact forces acting on
the surrounding tube. The methods used to prove the balance criterion (a
generalization of certain aspects of tensegrity theory to a class of "continuous
tensegrities", using a version of the Farkas alternative theorem for linear
operators on Banach spaces) promise rich applications in other areas of
mathematics, such as the study of convex curves, and of "knot energies".

A natural model for a rope with a circular cross-section is a space curve
surrounded by a non-self-intersecting tube of fixed radius. If such a rope is
tied in a knot, and the knot is pulled tight, the resulting curve is a critical
configuration for the "ropelength" of the curve, which is defined to be the
quotient of the length of the curve over the radius of the tube. The project
studies the geometry of ropelength-critical curves using ideas from the theory
of frameworks. This theory studies simple engineering models of structures, and
gives a precise description of how external loads on a structure are resolved
into tensions and compressions of different structural elements. The project
views the tension in a tight knot as exerting a force directed towards the
inside of each curve of the rope, and aims to show that such a curve is tight if
this force can be resolved into a system of self-contact forces acting on the
surface of the tube. This "balance criterion" has surprising consequences.
Imagine a rope stretched horizontally, like a clothesline. If another rope is
passed over the line, and pulled down until the pair is tight, the ropes form
four straight segments joined to a central region where the strands curve around
one another. One would expect the ropes to maintain contact throughout this
curved clasp, with the two points on the inside of each bend touching one
another. However, according to the balance criterion, this cannot happen: there
is always a small gap between the two strands at the center of the turn. This
model has already been used in molecular biology to describe the behavior of DNA
strands; the new geometric information provided by the project will help to
refine and extend many other appications of this model in physics, biology, and
engineering.
