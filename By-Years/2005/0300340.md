This project will investigate a novel approach to model and design learning
algorithms in the small sample case using entropy. It will seek a deeper
mathematical understanding of the new method and its relations to the mean
square error, still today the workhorse of learning. The PI will investigate the
properties of the information field created by the information particles, and
how to use it to improve generalization and construct bounds on system errors.
He will depart from the static fields provided by statistics and incorporate
time in the information forces to mimic the interactions in diffusion fields and
oscillating fields. This will open the door to adapt systems in space-time. He
will also study the robustness of entropy for parameter estimation and compare
performance with SVMs. But the large appeal of the novel pair wise interaction
model for learning is that it opens drastically new opportunities to understand,
apply and implement adaptive systems. He will be studying the following
applications of the pair wise interaction model:

1- Model the information processing in the dendritic tree as an spatio-temporal
interaction field that estimates entropy. Seek on-line algorithms and hopefully
show their relation to Hebbian. Our preliminary results are very encouraging.
Dr. Henry Markram, a world expert in dynamic synapses will help establish the
biological plausibility of the model.

2- Formulate state space models of linear and nonlinear systems with our entropy
estimator. This work will extend the field of minimum entropy control for non-
Gaussian processes and will pro-vide a new approach to implement robust control.

3- Apply the entropy estimator to blind deconvolution of wireless channels as
well as multiuser detection. The PI will extend his current work on blind source
separation for convolutive mixtures, the more realistic (but also harder) case.
In particular he will target the cocktail party effect in teleconferencing.
