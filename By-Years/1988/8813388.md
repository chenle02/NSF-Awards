This research will demonstrate the capability of a stereoscopic, two- camera
system for tracking laser-illuminated particles to produce unsteady, three-
dimensional vorticity maps in complex flows. The technique depends on
utilization of a finite thickness two- dimensional sheet of laser illumination.
If successful, this non- intrusive, three-dimensional diagnostic technique would
be widely applicable in experimentally determining complex velocity and
vorticity fields. Among other uses, this information is crucial in evaluating
current numerical computation schemes.
