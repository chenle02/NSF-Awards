This proposal requests support for the operation of the Svalbard Auroral Station
to make optical measurements of the dayside aurora in December 1992 and January
1993. This site lies in the Eastern Arctic where the sky is dark enough to allow
optical observations of the dayside auroral oval from late November to late
January. The station is instrumented with a TV all-sky camera, a 5 channel
meridian scanning photometer, a riometer, and also induction and fluxgate
magnetometers. Previous work established the spectural character and morphology
of both the magnetic pulsations and the auroral forms in the dayside aurora.
That the strength and direction of the interplanetary magnetic field is directly
related to the form and motion of the dayside aurora implying that the latter is
an ionospheric signature of plasma entry at the magnetopause. Correlation of the
optical observations with simultaneous measurements of geomagnetic pulsations
has resulted in a model of the magnetospheric structure associated with this
correlation. This proposal is to support further the optical measurements
required to test this model of the relationship of the dayside ionosphere to
magnetospheric boundary layer phenomena. New data will be obtained in a
coordinated campaign with the GEM-funded project led by J.V. Olson. Olson's
magnetometers will identify current systems and the optical instruments will
record the auroral features.
