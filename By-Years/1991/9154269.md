Two workshops for 55 participants during the summer of 1992 will introduce
undergraduate mathematics faculty to interesting new topics in calculus and
precalculus designed to enhance the core curriculum, rejuvenate teachers, and
interest students. Although many of the examples will use the microcomputer as a
tool, the emphasis will be on mathematics. Also included will be lectures by a
plant pathologist on applications of chaos in biology and by an astronomer on
calculus and planetary motion. An important feature of the project will be the
publication of materials for national dissemination. These will supplement the
principal investigators' NSF sponsored book 'Uses of Technology in the
Mathematics Curriculum': A Manual of Laboratory Exercises and Resources for
College Teachers.
