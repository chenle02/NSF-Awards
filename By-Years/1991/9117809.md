This project is for a geologic and petrologic investigation of the Yunaska
Volcanic Center. Yunaska has been chosen because it: 1) sits on unextended crust
of the arc massif; 2) has numerous unusual geomorphic characteristics; 3)
displays evidence for both young and old vent areas; 4) is spatially removed
from the Amlia Fracture Zone; and 5) occurs in a geologically unknown part of
the ALeutian arc. The PIs plan to map and sample extensively the island during
three field seasons. Using this information as well as K-Ar dating, they will
reconstruct the geologic history of the island. Analytical work will
characterize the volcanic rocks petrographically as well as geochemically. This
detailed characterization of Yunaska should improve materially our knowledge of
the Aleutian arc as well as the petrologic processes responsible for its
volcanic products. Ultimately, such information should enhance our understanding
of subduction magmatism in general.
