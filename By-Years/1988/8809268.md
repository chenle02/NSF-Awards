New and innovative hardware mechanisms for efficient message passing and object
invocation in a distributed computing system are being designed and developed.
Operating systems structures for a distributed environment follow one of two
paradigms: message passing or object invocation. For such a system to perform
efficiently basic messages must be passed with short delays. The limiting
factor, especially for short messages, is typically not network bandwidth but
processing overhead. Resources in an operating system can also be viewed as a
collection of objects. Previous research of the principal investigator has shown
that object invocation is dependent on the efficiency of memory management. The
principal investigator is currently extending his previous performance studies
on message-based systems, verifying these studies through experimentation,
investigating hardware support for networked shared-memory multiprocessors;
developing new hardware mechanisms for efficient object invocation, and
evaluating these mechanisms through simulation and experimentation.
