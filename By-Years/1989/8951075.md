One of the deficiencies of the undergraduate chemical education is a lack of
emphasis on current laboratory experiments that directly relate to frontier
chemical research. This project implements several surface chemistry experiments
to study gas adsorption on oxide-supported metal catalysts, a student research
project to study the mechanism involved in the hydroformylation of olefins and
two new experiments in organic chemistry phenomena, surface science and ultra
vacuum techniques as well as insights into several fundamental chemical
concepts. This instrumentation, which includes a FTIR, a vacuum-gas line
specially designed for surface chemistry studies and a temperature controller
for temperature-dependant studies, provides undergraduate the much needed
exposure to some current major direction is chemical research and some hands-on
experience in state-of-the-art instrumentation. The institution is matching the
NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
