The technique of X-ray crystallography will be used to study the three
dimensional structure of hemocyanin, the oxygen transport protein found in
arthropods and molluscs. The invertebrate hemocyanins are particularly
interesting because the oxygen binding site consists of two copper ions ligated
directly by protein side chains. The exact nature and geometry of these metal
sites are still in question. The major goal of the proposed research is to
obtain diffraction data, determine and refine the oxygenated structure of a
subunit of hemocyanin in order to understand how the oxygen molecule binds to
the binuclear cooper site.
