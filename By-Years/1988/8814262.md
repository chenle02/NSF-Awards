This grant, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, is for the
partial support of the XVIII Informal Photochemistry Conference to be held in
Santa Monica, CA Jan 9-12, 1989. This conference will concentrate on the
photophysics and photochemistry of clusters and weakly bound complexes, high
levels of vibration-rotation excitation and radiationless transfer, vector and
tensor properties of photodissociation, and transition states and short lived
resonances. The funds supplied by NSF will be used to partially support the
travel and living expenses of the graduate students and postdoctorals attending
the conference.
