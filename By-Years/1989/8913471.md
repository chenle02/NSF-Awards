A wave-particle duality processor is a distinctly non-Turing type of computer in
two regards. First, its energy and speed requirements are unrelated to the
computational complexity of the task. This results in huge, e.g. a factor of
108, energy savings over conventional computers. Second, the outputs can be
rigorously stochastic and thus not Turing computable. The investigators propose
to demonstrate such a processor and its properties in the laboratory as well as
to study relevant phenomena such as coherence requirements, the connection with
conservative logic gates, and the utility of rigorously stochastic calculations.
