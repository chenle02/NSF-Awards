Opportunities for enhancing undergraduate education in geosciences through a
range of computer-based technologies are growing rapidly. These opportunities
include models and visualizations of processes that take place at large space or
time scales, maps and satellite imagery, digitizers, large databases, and
software for data analysis. The objective of this project is to significantly
improve the education provided by increasing capabilities to incorporate these
opportunities in courses for general education students and undergraduate majors
in geology, hydrology, earth sciences, earth sciences teaching, and ultimately
an emerging marine sciences curriculum. To accomplish this, the project will
provide funds for the purchase of 16 personal computers that are being installed
in a computer classroom and linked into the department and university networks
and the Internet, along with basic software to run the applications identified.
