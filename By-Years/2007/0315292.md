Danny Neuhauser of UCLA is supported by the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to explore and computationally test the concepts of quantum
mechanical interference and resonance for possible use in single molecule
conductance. He will search for new classes of molecules in which resonances and
interference can be used to control conductivity, such as polycyclic
hydrocarbons and crown ethers. He will also explore the response of the
conductance to potential gradients, the presence of specific molecules, and the
effects of two voltage gates. He will develop time-dependent density functional
theory with absorbing boundaries to model local response, time-dependent
polarization, dissipation, and the interplay between motion and conductance.

Single-molecule properties and conductivity in particular are potentially very
important in characterizing and detecting nano-level properties and in using
molecules as logic gates. The methodologies under development here will aid in
understanding and applying chemistry on nano-scales, developing logic circuits,
and devising improved sensors and approaches for coupling motion and
conductivity on a single-molecule level.
