Simon&lt;br/&gt;0303632&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Government of China has
introduced significant reforms into the country's scientific system during the
past decade and has increased financial investments into the system
substantially. The objectives of these actions are to support the country's
drive towards modernization. This award will support a major international
conference to assess the actual and potential contributions that science and
technology are making, and are likely to make, to China's modernization and
globalization aspirations, as well as to global scientific progress.
Participants will include established scholars working in the area of Chinese
science and technology, younger scholars, individuals with working knowledge of
multinational firms in China, as well as government officials. The conference
will result in a publication containing edited versions of the scholarly
presentations from the conference. This publication will be the first major
assessment of China's actual and potential scientific and technological
trajectory in over a
decade&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
