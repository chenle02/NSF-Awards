Nontechnical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the second report-out
meeting of current recipients of the EAGER awards focusing on topological
quantum computing. The funding opportunity, announced in February 2017 with NSF
17-053 Dear Colleague Letter: Funding Opportunity - A "Quantum Leap"
Demonstration of Topological Quantum Computing" generated 15 funded EAGER
proposals focusing on research in the area of braiding. The first meeting was
organized in the Spring of 2018, and involved participants of the first "class"
of EAGER awards made in 2017. This award supports the second meeting, scheduled
for the second week of July 2019. The workshop enables a full report-out and
overview of accomplishments so far based on results of work done within the
first 2 years of funding existence, which marks the final report for the first
class of awards, and 1-year report for the second class of the 2-year EAGER
awards. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Providing
experimental evidence for braiding is a needed transformative step towards
topological quantum computing. Ability to generate, control and braid Majorana
zero modes is central to this effort. Theoretical support is required to design
braiding schemes, ways to design and execute algorithms, and enable topological
quantum computation protected from local disturbances by non-local character of
the shared quantum state. The meeting of Principal Investigators funded through
the NSF 17-053 Dear Colleague Letter: Funding Opportunity - A "Quantum Leap"
Demonstration of Topological Quantum Computing", will serve as report-out
session and review of accomplishments, while also providing an opportunity for
the award recipients to exchange and discuss details of their findings and plan
next steps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
