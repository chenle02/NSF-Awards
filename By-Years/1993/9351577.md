Many women are attracted to psychology as a college major; however, the majority
of women nationally choose careers and graduate work in applied and clinical
settings, rather than in research. At our institution, psychology attracts the
third largest group of majors, with approximately one in four of these women
(28%) obtaining teacher certification as preparation for a career in education.
This project, therefore, has created an integrated classroom laboratory for
experimental psychology. Students use computers regularly to study research
methods and experimental psychology in an integrated fashion. Also, these hands-
on applications allow students to gain experience and heighten confidence in
their ability to conduct research as professional scientists, in applied field
settings, or as classroom teachers.
