9305850 Gidaspow It is proposed to calibrate and extend the area of application
of a numerical approach for three-dimensional, transient, fluidized bed
simulation. Comparisons to experimental results in bubbly, gas-solid
circulating, and three-phase fluidized beds will be performed. Validation tests
for grid generation, constitutive relationships and limit flow patterns are
planned. Reference experiments will performed in collaboration with another
group at IIT to determine phase distributions and velocities by using a gamma-
ray densitometer, a X-ray densitometer, and radioactive particle tracking. It is
expected that more reliable, accurate, simulations for both gas-solid and three-
phase fluidized systems will be available at the end of the project. Close
collaborations with industry and national laboratories are also planned. The
proposed computational approach will permit better design and scale-up of gas-
solid and gas-solid-liquid fluidized beds used in chemical manufacturing, oil
industry, and biotechnology.
