This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award will facilitate novel,
operationally aware design of matching markets, such as online marketplaces for
transportation and accommodations, collaborative consumption, labor, and school
admissions. Matching markets allow compatible agents to match with each other
for mutual benefit. Facilitating efficient marketplaces for matching requires a
design approach that carefully manages the costs and benefits to participants of
searching for and forming a match, as well as balancing supply and demand. This
grant will contribute to the U. S. and global economy and society by enabling
design of improved, "smart" marketplaces that better enable participants in the
sharing economy to find what they want. The research conducted will be
interdisciplinary, involving key ideas from operations, engineering, economics
and business practice. This interdisciplinary approach will lead to new
intellectual developments and facilitate training of a new breed of market
engineers who will design the sharing economy of the future. The educational
plan involves integration of research and practical developments from new
marketplaces into online and widely disseminated course
materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research plan has three main objectives.
First, it will develop a general framework for understanding how a matching
platform should best enable search for partners, as a function of market
characteristics, motivated by the widespread difficulty faced by users in
finding a suitable partner in many markets. Second, it will address the problem
of matching when supply and demand are geographically and temporally distributed
and the cost of a match increases with geographical separation between the
agents, as is the case, for instance, in transportation markets. The research
will leverage tools from optimal transport and queuing networks to support
platform decisions on how to match agents and optimally deploy levers like
pricing and recommendations to participants, to balance supply and demand and to
keep costs of matching low. Third, it will extend existing mechanisms for
centralized school choice and college admissions programs to effectively
reassign seats when an assigned seat is vacated at a late stage in the process.
Such reassignments must manage the tradeoff between the economic properties of
the process design and the operational costs associated with churn resulting
from reassignment.
