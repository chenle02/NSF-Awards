The 2012 Broadening Participation in Data Mining Workshop (BPDM 2012) will be
the first workshop of its kind in data mining designed specifically to foster
mentorship, guidance, and connections of underrepresented groups in data mining,
while also enriching technical aptitude and exposure. The workshop will be co-
hosted with the 2012 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM 2012),
one of the premier conferences in the field of Data Mining. This proposal
discusses the attendance and financial support of students from underrepresented
groups to the workshop, as well as, to the conference. The conference provides a
venue for students and researchers who are addressing data mining problems in
areas such as science, engineering, industrial processes, healthcare, business,
and medicine, to present their work in a peer-reviewed forum. It also provides
an ideal setting for students and others new to the field to learn about
cutting-edge research by hearing outstanding invited speakers and attending
presentations, tutorials, and focused workshops. The funds will enable the
students to attend both the workshop and the remainder of the meeting.
