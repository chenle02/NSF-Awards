The investigators will operate a Second-generation Optimized Fabry-Perot Doppler
Imager (SOFDI) at the Huancayo Geophysical Observatory in Peru to measure
mesospheric and thermospheric winds. The main objective is to determine the way
in which zonal wind direction is linked to the occurrence of equatorial spread-F
and scintillations at the magnetic equator. A problem in understanding the
complex electrodynamics of the equatorial region has been to explain the day-to-
day variability of the effects of the disturbed ionosphere, represented by the
phenomena of bubbles, scintillations, bottomside spread F, and equatorial spread
F. While other factors play a role in these phenomena, the change in the semi-
diurnal thermospheric tidal activity that modulates the speed of the zonal wind
across the evening twilight terminator may be a key factor. Such variations of
the zonal wind speed may affect the timing for the development of the F-region
dynamo and modify the likelihood of the development of plasma instabilities. The
SOFDI instrument is designed for both nighttime and dayglow measurements of
airglow intensities and atmospheric winds and temperatures at remote locations.
The observations will be made in coordination with an all-sky imager and the
Jicamarca incoherent scatter radar. The investigators will also investigate the
possible effects of atmospheric gravity waves on irregularity growth.
Irregularities in the equatorial ionosphere produce scintillations that affect
the operation of navigation and communications systems. This study will help
develop models that can forecast the occurrence of scintillations to protect
these systems from deleterious space weather effects.
