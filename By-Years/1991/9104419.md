A detailed experimental study of electron collisions with barium in excited
states prepared by laser excitation will be carried out. The studies will
include: (a) Measurement of differential cross sections for excitation and
deexcitation. (b) Measurement of cross sections for ionization from excited
states. (c) Measurements of superelastic cross sections from which impact
coherence parameters will be derived.
