Dr. David Colwyn has been granted an NSF EAR Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry
out research and education plans at the University of Colorado - Boulder. The
investigation will focus on warming in high latitudes increasing three times the
magnitude as observed in lower latitudes. This idea will be tested with new
Cenozoic (the last 66 million years) terrestrial paleoclimate records from
south-central Alaska. These records will be used to assess how temperature and
hydrology have changed in south-central Alaska during the Cenozoic, and will be
compared with more abundant lower-latitude data to better understand the
magnitude and mechanism(s) of amplification of terrestrial warming at high
latitudes. Understanding the processes that control high-latitude climate
variability enables scientists to more accurately forecast high-latitude climate
variability and allows Alaska and its communities to more effectively plan for
the climate of the future. The proposed research will be integrated with
teaching in secondary school science classrooms in Alaska (the field area) and
Colorado (the location of the host institution) and undergraduate students will
be involved in the field research activities. The hypothesis will be tested with
new multi-proxy Paleocene-Pliocene terrestrial paleoclimate time slices from
south-central Alaska. These records will be used to assess how temperature and
isotope hydrology have changed in south-central Alaska during the Cenozoic, and
will be compared with more abundant lower-latitude data to better understand the
magnitude and mechanism(s) of amplification of terrestrial climate change at
high latitudes. Specifically, this phenomenon of polar amplification has been
traditionally linked to ice-albedo feedback; if true, this idea requires that
polar amplification would be limited to icehouse climate states.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
