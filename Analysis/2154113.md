This research project concerns bilinear Fourier analysis. Broadly speaking,
Fourier analysis is a mathematical discipline for the study of signals, such as
sound and images. The study of signals by way of Fourier analysis involves
breaking them down into fundamental pieces that are less complex and, therefore,
easier to examine. Information obtained from the individual pieces is then
synthesized to obtain information about the original signal. Fourier analysis
has had far-reaching applications in other areas of mathematics, physics,
engineering, medicine, industry, and the applied sciences. This project will
investigate central questions in the field of bilinear Fourier analysis, where a
pair of signals are analyzed simultaneously. The outcomes are anticipated to
have applications in the theory of partial differential equations, to topics as
diverse as fluid dynamics, quantum mechanics, and optics. The project will also
contribute to the integration of research and education at the graduate and
undergraduate levels.

The project aims to contribute to new developments in bilinear Fourier analysis
through the investigation of a suite of interrelated questions motivated by
applications to analysis and partial differential equations. The project will
investigate several approaches, based on tools including representations of
functions, Littlewood-Paley techniques, and symbolic calculus, to generate a
host of new bilinear estimates and boundedness properties of bilinear
pseudodifferential operators. The results are expected to apply to the pointwise
multiplication properties of function spaces, local well-posedness results for
the Euler equations and the ideal magnetohydrodynamic equations, and scattering
properties of solutions of systems of partial differential equations associated
to local and nonlocal operators.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
