We do not clearly understand what the benefits and costs of group living are
for primates generally. Sex differences may play a role. In most primate
species, females remain in their natal groups for life, whereas males disperse
prior to maturity. Given the prevalence of this female-bonded system, what are
the benefits and costs of male group members for females? The number of males
per group varies between and within primate species, but we do not know why.
This dissertation project will examine some short-term benefits and costs of
sociality in such a female-bonded primate social system in Costa Rica. The main
benefits proposed for group living are predator protection and improved access
to resources, while tha main cost is presumed to be within-group competition.
The study will compare specific behaviors associated with predator defense,
resource defense, and resource competition in males and females. Findings will
be related to evolutionary explanations of primate sociality. Information from
the project will enhance our understanding of sociality and its adaptive
significance in primates. The project will also train a very promising young
scientist.
