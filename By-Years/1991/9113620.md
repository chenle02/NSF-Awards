This award supports the construction of a powder X-ray diffraction system. The
completed system will provide high sample throughput and allow for control of
the sample environment such as temperature. The instrument is essential for use
in materials studies of thin carbon films grown on silicon and calcium fluoride
substrates, characterization of reaction products in solid state synthesis,
studies of polymeric sponges (solvation and desolvation of lattice calathrates).
The instrument will be housed in the department's crystallography laboratory,
and available to all qualified users. It will also be designed to be used as a
training instrument for an undergraduate chemistry instructional course given by
the department.
