This project seeks to achieve a fundamental understanding of diffusion
mechanisms in gallium arsenide. Specific goals are to determine: 1)the dominant
point defects controlling diffusion on each sublattice, 2)the corresponding
charge states, and 3)the causes of anomalous enhancements in diffusion at high
dopant concentrations. Controlled Fermi level and arsenic overpressure will be
used to obtain diffusion coefficients, and to identify the dominant point
defects associated with diffusion. In n-type Gallium Arsenide, the results are
expected to link the coincident observations of electron concentration
saturation, group III diffusivity saturation, and changes in the group VI
solubility. In p-type Gallium Arsenide, the results are expected to link the
mechanisms controlling group II and III diffusion, particularly at high acceptor
concentrations. New qualitative and quantitative understanding of fundamental
processes important to diffusion mechanisms in compound semiconductors is
anticipated from this project; the results also have technological relevance to
the microelectronics industry.
