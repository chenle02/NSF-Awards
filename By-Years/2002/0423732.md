0423732&lt;br/&gt;Solgaard&lt;br/&gt;This proposal describes a research program
that will explore the frontiers of novel photonics and nanotechnology methods to
develop a new class of miniaturized probes for biomedical imaging and
microsurgery in-vivo. The objectives of this proposal are (1) to study the
fundamentals of femtosecond laser microsurgery performed deep in tissue, (2) to
explore the delivery of femtosecond laser pulses with pulse energies up to 1-uJ
using a new class of airguiding photonic band-gap fibers, (3) to develop
miniature scanners based on Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology,
(4) to develop MEMS based spectral phase modulator in combination with a passive
thin film coating technique to compensate for pulse broadening, and (5) to
integrate these components into a macroscopic microsurgery system and evaluate
their performance in-vitro. &lt;br/&gt;
