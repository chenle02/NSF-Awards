This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will establish
the feasibility of developing a genetically-encoded biosensor to monitor levels
of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), an important second messenger
component of drug signaling pathways. Unlike existing FRET-based biosensors that
depend upon energy transfer between two fluorescent molecules, this sensor will
employ a single, circularly permuted fluorescent green protein. This green
sensor can be coupled with differently colored biosensors for other second
messengers to produce simultaneous readouts for multiple components of a
signaling pathway that change when activated by a drug.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that multiplex,
genetically-encoded assays reporting multiple cell signaling events would expand
the depth of knowledge about signal transduction by improving information on the
timing, location and pathway cross-talk in physiologically relevant tissues.
These assays are homogenous, do not require multiple steps, or cell lysis. A
growing trend in the pharmaceutical industry is screening in primary cell
cultures, and genetically encoded assays are ideally suited for this. The
technology to be developed in this proposal represents a new innovation in
fluorescent live-cell assay and has strong potential to reduce the cost and
improve the reliability of drug discovery to find safe and effective drugs that
provide better treatment outcomes and improved human health.
