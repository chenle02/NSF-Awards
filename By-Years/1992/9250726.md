A computer laboratory environment is being developed which will encourage
active, exploratory student involvement in course content and the learning
process. The laboratory enhances existing courses for first- and second-year
students in Biology, Mathematics and Computer Sciences, thus addressing
recommended curricular changes in these disciplines. Closed Computer Sciences
labs for programming design and analysis are being developed Mathematics
students have investigatory capabilities for constructive problem solving,
visualization of functions and the study of patterns. Still and motion imagery
recorded in Biology labs, as well as images from other media (videodiscs, CD-
ROM, print), are compressed and stored in a library on the network's server to
be used in student exercises for comparison and analysis during closed
laboratory sessions.
