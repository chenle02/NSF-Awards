Extremal combinatorics is an area of mathematics that investigates how large or
small configurations of mathematical objects can be under certain constraints.
This area is rapidly developing and has close connections to many other areas of
mathematics, as well as to theoretical computer science. This research project
aims to make progress on questions in extremal combinatorics using methods from
algebra and probability theory. The research focuses on some longstanding open
questions and conjectures, as well as several related problems. The work will
lead to the development of new mathematical tools and techniques and push the
limits of known methods. Moreover, through her teaching and mentoring, the
investigator strives to encourage students to learn about mathematics and to
pursue careers in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The questions studied in
this project fall into two rough topic areas. The first of these areas is
centered around the slice rank polynomial method that was introduced in 2016.
This method has led to several spectacular results in additive combinatorics,
but many related questions remain open. The investigator intends to study
specific problems exemplifying the current limitations of the slice rank
polynomial method. One aim of this project is to find ways to make the method
more flexible and more widely applicable. The second topic area of the project
concerns the inducibility problem, which was posed over forty years ago and is
still wide open. Given a fixed graph H, and a large integer n, this problem asks
about the maximum number of induced copies of H that an n-vertex graph can
contain. A major open question in this area is the case where the graph H is a
path or a cycle. Using probabilistic techniques, the PI plans to investigate
this question as well as other inducibility-type
problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
