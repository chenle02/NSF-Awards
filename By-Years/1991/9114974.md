In this project of the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Lin will use density matrix techniques in a theoretical
investigation of ultrafast photochemical and photophysical processes. The work
will be coordinated with that of experimental groups working on time-resolved
femtosecond infrared spectroscopy and Raman scattering. Studies will deal with
the spectroscopy and dynamics of F-aggregate centers and ultrafast biological
electron transfer. %%% Modern laser technology has made it possible to
investigate the rates and mechanisms of chemical reactions at the level of
individual electron transfer steps. In this project, Lin seeks to provide the
theoretical analysis needed to quantify such experiments including the primary
electron transfer step in photosynthetic reaction centers.
