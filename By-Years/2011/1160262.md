The Intellectual Merit The goal of this proposal is to develop biosensors based
on nucleic acids called aptamers. Aptamer based biosensors are emerging as
viable alternative to traditional sensors that employ antibodies for recognition
of target molecules. Aptamer based biosensors are more chemically and thermally
stable and may be reagentless - that is no additional processing steps are
needed to generate a signal in response to target molecules. Our proposal seeks
to addresses a distinct challenge in regenerating these biosensors in order to
make the same sensor available for continuous in-line monitoring. We propose to
use applied voltage to tune and control affinity of sensing electrodes in
temporal and/or spatial manner to ensure that some electrodes are detecting
association while others are monitoring dissociation events. This way up and
down changes in the level of target molecules may be monitored.

Broader Impact The goal of our proposal will be to develop novel, aptamer-based
microsystems for analysis and sorting of cells. It is our belief that such
aptasensors are particularly advantageous for monitoring dynamic changes in the
levels of proteins secreted by living cells and have numerous applications in
biotechnology, cell/tissue engineering and infectious disease detection. In
addition to biosensing, aptamer-modified surfaces may be used for affinity
separation of cells from heterogeneous samples such as blood. This proposal will
combine aspects of basic science with bioengineering to further enhance state of
the art in cell analysis and manipulation by developing tunable aptamer-coated
devices. We will actively recruit graduate, undergraduate and high school
students to participate in the proposed experiments.
