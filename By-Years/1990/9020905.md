This action funds a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) in plant-
pathogen interactions. The mechanism by which breakdown products of the plant
cell wall are transported or taken up into phytopathogenic Xanthomonas, Erwinia
and Fusarium species is the major focus of this research. The uptake of
radiolabeled galacturonic acid into plant pathogens is being measured to
determine the kinetics of transport, the number of transport systems, and the
inducibility of cell wall degrading enzymes. The SGER mechanism was selected for
this project because of the high cost of custom synthesis for the requisite
radiolabeled compound. The element of risk involved is more than would normally
be assumed in a fully funded, multi-year project. Some preliminary observations
make a strong case for the project and it is highly likely that new information
will be gained of a basic nature as well as on the processes of soft-rot
diseases of many agriculturally important plants.***
