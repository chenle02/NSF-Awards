The principal investigator continues his research on the design and evaluation
of the memory hierarchy of high-performance systems. Uniprocessors as well as
shared-memory multiprocessors will be studied. The studies will cover innovative
architectural features, compiler support, and protocols and hardware
synchronization primitives for several parallel programming models. In case of
uniprocessors, a hardware-based preloading scheme that should reduce the number
of misses in data caches, will be investigated. Compiler support for this
hardware function will also be investigated. In the case of multiprocessors,
various protocols and possibly enhanced synchronization primitives to cater to
several consistency models will be investigated. The goal is to reduce the
impact of the performance degradation components (large memory latency,
processor stalling, network traffic) arising from the access to shared
variables. Other topics include architectural features such as the use of the
interconnection network, or one of its levels, as a component of the memory
hierarchy. Trace-driven simulation will be the choice performance evaluation
tool. Computer-intensive programs with large data sets drawn from scientific and
CAD tool application will be instrumented.
