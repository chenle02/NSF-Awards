Popular applications such as email, image/video galleries, and file storage are
increasingly being supported by ?cloud? platforms in residential, academia and
industry communities. The next frontier for these user communities will be to
transition ?traditional desktops? that have dedicated hardware and software
configurations into ?virtual desktop clouds? that are accessible via thin
clients. This project aims to develop optimal resource allocation frameworks and
performance benchmarking tools that can enable building and managing thin-client
based virtual desktop clouds at Internet-scale. Virtual desktop cloud
experiments under realistic user and system loads will be conducted by
leveraging multiple kinds of GENI resources such as aggregates, user opt-in
mechanisms, measurement services and experimenter workflow tools. Project
outcomes will help in minimizing costly cloud resource over-commitment, and in
avoiding thin client protocol configuration guesswork, while delivering optimum
user experience. Further, they will positively impact computer desktop user
communities, GENI-like testbeds, and equipment vendors.
