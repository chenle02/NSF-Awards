Under the direction of Dr. Eugene Giles, Ms. Jolee West, a graduate student at
the University of Illinois at Urbana, will conduct research for her doctoral
dissertation. She will combine field and laboratory work to study the
distribution of reptilian remains - crocodile and turtle - on the East African
landscape and determine the causal factors of the patterns observed. In
particular, she wishes to learn how humanly derived assemblages may be
identified. To accomplish this, she will first focus her attention on areas
located on the Eastern shore of Lake Turkana, Kenya which are not inhabited by
people. She will establish transects which extend away from water sources and
collect reptilian remains along them. This will provide data on "natural" or
non-human patterning. She will then work with traditional peoples who live near
the lake margin and hunt and butcher these same species. A comparison of these
samples should permit identification of uniquely human signatures. Ms. West will
also examine reptile remains from hyena lairs, study bone weathering, and
conduct flume experiments to show the differential effects of water movement.
This basic research will provide archaeologists with extremely valuable data.
Crocodile and turtle remains are often recovered during the excavation of early
hominid sites in East Africa. However, it is extremely difficult to determine
the derivation of these remains which also occur naturally as a scatter across
African landscapes. It is not possible therefore to tell whether such species
formed part of early hominid diet or whether the association of these bones
occurs by chance. Ms. West's project will provide the key for such
interpretation. This project is important for several reasons. First, it will
provide a tool of use in a wide range of archaeological situations. Secondly, it
will assist in the training of an extremely promising young scientist.
