An acoustics laboratory is being developed for inclusion in a five-week
intensive course on musical acoustics. Non-science majors are the primary target
audiences. Twenty-four students are meeting five days a week for a two-hour
session of lecture, demonstration and discussion. Students working in pairs
complete a two-hour laboratory experiment each day, in two shifts of 12 students
each. In the first two weeks of the course, experiments are being developed to
introduce concepts of mechanics, including vibrations and waves, necessary to
understand acoustic phenomena. Resonances in mechanical and acoustic systems are
a primary focus, using instruments such as photogate timers, oscilloscopes,
microphones, function generators and sound level meters. Spectral analysis of a
variety of instruments and sound generators is the topic of the second group of
experiments. Each of six lab stations includes a Fast Fourier Transform spectrum
analyzer for real-time analysis, a high-quality microphone with preamplifier,
and a plotter. These stations allow students to explore a wide range of acoustic
phenomena in quantitative detail. Acquired techniques are being used in
independent student projects. The equipment is also providing senior thesis
opportunities.
