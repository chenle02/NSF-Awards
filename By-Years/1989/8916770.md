In order to promote international communication on tephrochronology, the Inter-
Congress Commission on Tephrochronology of the International Quaternary
Association (INQUA) will hold a field conference and workshop on
tephrochronology in Yellowstone National Park from June 17, 1990 to June 26,
1990. The purpose of the conference, the first on its kind since 1980, is to
determine the current status of tephra studies worldwide, to assess the impact
that new developments in other fields will have on tephrochronology, and to
underscore the role which tephra studies can play in solving problems in
Quaternary stratigraphy. Funds are requested for support of promising graduate
students, for transportation expenses associated with field trips and for travel
costs of keynote speakers.
