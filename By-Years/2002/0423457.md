The objective of this research is to advance a wafer-bonding technique, called
the transmission laser bonding, to be reliable and applicable for packaging of
microelectromechanical devices. The approach is to use both experimental and
numerical schemes to study the physical and chemical phenomena in the bonding
region during and after bonding at micro- and nano-scale levels. Using
characteristics of laser and the associated optical properties, the technique
can efficiently bond a transparent wafer, such as glass, to an opaque substrate,
such as silicon, by laser melting of a thin layer near the
interface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the successful accomplishment of the
proposed research, the potential cost saving and quality enhancement on
microdevice packaging will be significant. Since packaging cost represents more
than fifty percent of the total device cost, the proposed research should be
extremely important to the associated industry. Currently, the applications of
these microdevice products have been extended from the traditional automotive
and aerospace sectors to many emerging markets, including consumer electronics,
biomedical, and information; the products should have major impact directly or
indirectly on people's daily life. Furthermore, the knowledge base gained from
the proposed investigation can greatly improve the fundamental understanding of
many areas involved, including the surface and materials sciences, mechanics,
heat transfer, and fluid flow, as well as the bonding technology as a whole. The
proposed approach should educate students to have sound basic knowledge with
good balance between fundamental research and application in studying packaging.
