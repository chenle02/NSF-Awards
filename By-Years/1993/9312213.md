Mexico TechNet over a 56 kbps line. Faculty and students at the west campus will
benefit from access to the resources of the Internet, including libraries and
supercomputers. In addition, they will be able to communicate and collaborate
with colleagues at other institutions in pursuit of research and educational
projects. The award provides partial support of the project for two years. ***
