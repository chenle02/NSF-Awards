This award is for a planning workshop that will address important issues in
integrating ethics and value studies more fully into the business, science, and
engineering curriculum at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez. Special
attention will be given to the cross-cultural variables affecting professional
ethics. Much has already been done to promote integration of ethical studies
there, but specific areas still demand more attention. Offering courses in
ethics is not enough; ethics classes added on to the existing curriculum give
the impression that ethics is merely an afterthought. Rather ways must be found
to integrate ethics into the business, science, and engineering curriculum. This
involves a different set of challenges that this award will address. For
example, it involves not only ethicists teaching ethics to science and
engineers, but more importantly involves also science and engineering faculty
incorporating ethical case studies into their courses. It also involves
consideration of the wider institutional and political culture as well as the
differences in cultures within diverse Hispanic populations. The planning
workshop will last three days and will involve the participation of science and
engineering faculty from the University of Puerto Rico and as well as prominent
ethicists. Topics covered in the workshop will be preparing faculty to teach
ethics across the curriculum; case selection and cultural implications of
teaching ethics; and ethics and research. Areas of emphasis in this planning
workshop will be: discussing the feasibility of selecting cases of relevance to
other Hispanic groups than just Puerto Ricans; generating measurable outcomes
and instruments of evaluation; and involving science and engineering faculty up
front in the curriculum design issues, along with applied ethicists and others
from the university community.
