The project uses the nonlinear programming formulation to define a generalized
reliability index as the difference between external work and internal strain
energy. The nonlinear strain energy formulations are investigated in order to
introduce both linear and nonlinear material behavior. Expanded constraint sets
are developed to be consistent with the more generalized mechanisms of failure
associated with the nonlinear optimization objective. An alternative approach
based on the static formulation is also followed, obviating the need for modal
definitions. Finally, the combination of failure probabilities into system
reliability is pursued in terms of the union of failure events in a stepwise
search.
