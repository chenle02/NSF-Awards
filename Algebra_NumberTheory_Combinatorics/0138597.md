The investigator is studying the statistical properties of zeros and values of
L-functions in the context of random matrix theory. Random matrix models are
being used to conjecture the full asymptotic expansion and analytic continuation
for the moments of L-functions, and to make predictions for the statistical
behavior of ranks of elliptic curves. A C++ L-function class library along with
a front end application is also being developed for computing zeros and values
of L-functions. This software is being used by the investigator to numerically
confirm the predictions being made, and will be released freely to the public as
a much needed tool for studying L-functions. Many problems in number theory can
be described in terms of the properties of so-called L-functions. These
functions, which encode profound information about various number theoretic
problems, have remained largely unyielding to mathematical analysis. Many deep
problems in number theory would be solved if one could understand these
functions in detail. Surprisingly, a seemingly unrelated field known as random
matrix theory, a subject that originally arose in connection to experimental
physics, has recently been found by number theorists and physicists alike to
provide a framework in which to model the behavior of L-functions. This
mysterious connection has been used successfully to make hitherto unimaginable
predictions for the behavior of L-functions. The work in this proposal is
concerned with exploring the connections between these two fields, number theory
and random matrix theory. To assist in this project, the investigator is also
preparing a software package, to be made freely available to the public, for
numerically studying L-functions. This award is being cofunded by the Algebra,
Number Theory, and Combinatorics Program, the Numeric, Symbolic, and Geometric
Computation Program, and the Computational Mathematics Program.
