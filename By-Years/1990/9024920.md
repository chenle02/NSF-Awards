Research in theoretical astronomy and physics will focus on the nature of the
dark (i.e., non-luminous) matter in the universe, and on the large-scale
structure of the universe. The dark matter is known to exist, and its nature is
an important puzzle. The large-scale structure is known to be lumpy, and the
question of how this lumpy structure grew out of the very homogeneous early
universe is another important puzzle.
