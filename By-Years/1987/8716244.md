In this proposal, Prahl advances the hypothesis that the organic carbon
accumulating in the slope region is highly degraded and derives from the erosion
of soils. Further organic geochemical study of sediments collected along an
offshore transect extending from the midshelf and down the slope to the opening
of Cascadia Basin are proposed to test this hypothesis. Results from these
analyses will provide answers to two fundamental questions: 1) Do sediments from
the slope region, in general, contain a 20-30% terrestrial component of total
organic carbon or does the terrestrial component continuously decrease with
further distance down the slope? 2) Is there geochemical evidence preserved in
sediment cores from this coastal region that the composition of bulk organic
carbon discharged by the Columbia River has changed qualitatively over the past
50-100 years.
