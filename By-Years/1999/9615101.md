Abstract 9615101

Gaisser The South Pole Air Shower Experiment (SPASE) consists of a sparsely
filled array of scintillation detectors covering several thousand square meters
at South Pole. It detects energetic charged particles (mostly electrons) which
are produced in the upper atmosphere by cosmic rays. The experiment has several
goals, the most important of which is to determine the elemental composition of
the primary cosmic rays at energies above approximately 100 TeV. In order to do
this SPASE works in coincidence with the Antarctic Muon and Neutrino Detector
Array (AMANDA), which has several hundred optical detectors so deep in the ice
sheet that the only products of the cosmic ray interactions which can be seen by
AMANDA are muons. The ratio of muons to electrons produced in a cosmic ray
shower is a sensitive function of the mass of the original primary cosmic ray.
Since SPASE can measure the number of electrons produced by a cosmic ray as well
as its total energy, and AMANDA can determine the number of muons, the mass of
an incident primary cosmic ray can be determined. The determination of the
elemental composition of cosmic rays is one of the most important outstanding
questions in cosmic ray physics and such information will shed light on the
origin of energetic cosmic rays. This project is cooperative with the University
of Leeds in the United Kingdom. ***
