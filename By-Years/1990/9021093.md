This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program supports a
project to synthesize and characterize new transition metal complexes containing
cyclic trialkyne (cyclotriyne) ligands. The work will be carried out in the
Chemistry Department of the University of Akron by Dr. Wiley J. Youngs and Dr.
Claire A. Tessier. Previous work by these investigators has demonstrated the
feasibility of preparing these compounds and semiconducting properties have been
noted in some cases. Production of thermally stable conducting and
semiconducting materials is a potential outcome of the expanded research project
planned. First, cyclotriyne derivatives which can "tune" the electronic
properties of the metal-ligand complexes or permit binding of larger metals in
the ligand cavity will be prepared. It is anticipated that metals will bind to
these ligands in a variety of modes. The structural and electronic properties of
the compounds will be determined and their interaction with small molecules
investigated.
