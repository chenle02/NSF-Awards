A variety of projects will use the requested gas chromatograph. First, a project
to determine fundamental mass transport parameters under very high heat flux
rates will use the equipment. This project is designed to provide fundamental
insight into the problem of puff formation in batch-fed rotary kiln
incinerators. The second project involves the development of a flow-through
bioreactor for degrading short chain chlorinated hydrocarbon pollutants. A third
project involves soil gas surveys of contaminated regions to assess their
suitability for in situ biodegration. Fundamental field work in this critical
environmental area is extremely limited at present. Two minor projects will also
utilize the equipment. The first will attempt the prediction of upsets in
anaerobic digesters well in advance of conventional techniques. The second
project will involve the isolation of bacterial strains capable of degrading
compounds currently regarded as non-biodegradable, specifically several short
chain chlorinated hydrocarbons. This equipment will significantly improve the
research group's ability to make a variety of basic measurements, and it is
expected to make a strong positive impact on the university's contributions to
environmental research.
