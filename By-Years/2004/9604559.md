9604559 Kairiss This project examines the connections between two brain regions
that are known to be involved in memory functions, the amygdala and perirhinal
cortex. It is not known how these areas interact during the storage and recall
of memories. The project addresses this question by examining the details of how
these areas are connected, how they communicate with each other, and how one
might modulate the ability of the other to store information. It is believed
that memories are formed in the brain when the connections between nerve cells
change their effectiveness, thereby increasing or decreasing the communication
between them. This project examines whether signals from the amygdala control
how memories are formed in the cortex by influencing this process in the
cortical nerve cells. Insights gained from these studies advance the
understanding of the mechanisms by which different parts of the brain interact
during information processing and storage. Such insights are fundamental to
advancing our knowledge of how humans and artificial intelligence systems learn
new information, store it, and recall it when needed.
