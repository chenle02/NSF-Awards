The phenomena embodied in the interaction of hydrogen with the surface of a
simple metal encompasses most of the basic concepts in surface science, and
these systems are tractable theoretically. A plethora of theoretical predictions
based on a wide range of calculational procedures have gone unchallenged or
unsubstantiated due to the almost complete absence of experimental data.
Experimental techniques have now advanced to the stage where it is possible to
probe both the dynamics and the statics of the interaction of hydrogen with
simple metal surfaces. Activated adsorption and State Selective Detection of H2
will be used to measure the shape of the potential energy surface which makes
the dissociation of H2 an activated process. Angle Resolved Inelastic Electron
Scattering will be utilized to measure the modification of the surface phonon
spectra and the surface plasmon dispersion which is induced by various phases of
adsorbed H. Changes (induced by H) in the surface electronic distribution will
be probed by Angle Resolved Photoemission and Second Harmonic Generation. The
surface geometrical structure will be determined using Low Energy Electron
Diffraction. Finally, the effect of metallic particle size will be studied using
clusters formed in a beam apparatus.
