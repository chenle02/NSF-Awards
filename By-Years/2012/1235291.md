This grant provides funding to develop an innovative 3-D additive manufacturing
process capable of producing uniform metal and polymer features with nanometer
resolution for applications in optics, photonics, biomaterials and other areas.
The project will combine the patterning resolution and scaling benefits provided
by the recently developed optical trap assisted nanopatterning method with the
3-D additive capabilities of ultrafast multiphoton polymerization processing. In
order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to attain a deeper fundamental
understanding of these processes, which will be gained through controlled
experiments that are aimed at determining the relationship between the
experimental parameters and the resulting properties of the deposited materials.
Armed with this detailed knowledge, the project will then proceed to develop a
working model that predicts how to control feature size and material
properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will have a
profound impact on a number of diverse application areas where multiscale and
multifunctional 3-D architectures are needed to advance functionality, such as
in photonic materials, optoelectronics, microfluidics, tissue engineering, etc.
Broad dissemination in these areas through publications and international
presentations will ensure researchers gain widespread benefit from our studies.
It is envisioned that this research is a seed for a novel international
collaboration between researchers at Princeton and University of Erlangen-
Nurenberg, School of Advanced Optical Technologies (UEN-SAOT) in Germany for 3-D
laser based manufacturing. To this end, funds have been allocated to support the
travel to UEN-SAOT where other researchers and students will be trained in this
developing technology.
