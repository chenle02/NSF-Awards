CTS - 9629458 Eli Ruckenstein SUNY Buffalo Abstract The project will focus on
using chitosan to develop microporous membranes for affinity separations.
Compared to currently available membranes based on nylon or cellulose, the
proposed membranes have the advantage of containing numerous hydrophilic sites
(OH, NH2). Preliminary experiments show high adsorption capacities for human
serum albumin but poor mechanical properties. The objectives of the project are
to improve the mechanical properties by preparing composite membranes based on
chitosan, to increase the adsorption capacity by introducing metal-chelating
groups via molecular imprinting, and to improve the permeability by controlling
pore size The project may lead to the development of superactive membranes
useful for protein separations in biotechnology.
