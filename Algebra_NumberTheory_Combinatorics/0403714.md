The Red Raider Symposium at Texas Tech University consists of a series of
lectures by outstanding scholars in selected areas of mathematics and
statistics. These lectures provide an opportunity to learn about new research
venues for the members of the mathematical community, especially early career
researchers and graduate students including women and underrepresented
minorities. This symposium provides a perfect medium for interaction and new
collaboration between the conference participants and the distinguished
speakers. In 2002 the Red Raider Mini-Symposium was devoted to Contemporary
Algebra and Algebraic Geometry. The distinguished speakers were R. Griess, W.
Fulton, J. Lepowsky, G. Margulis, and E. Zelmanov. In 2003 the symposium focuses
on Mathematical and Computational Modeling of Biological Systems with the
speakers J.D. Humphreys, J. Keener, M. Reed, A. Sherman, and C. Taylor. For 2004
the theme of the proposed series will be Invariant Theory in Perspective. Its
goal is to bring together researchers from a broad spectrum of mathematics all
of which are strongly intertwined with invariant theory. The distinguished
lectures will be delivered by Roger Howe, Peter Olver, Karen Parshall, Vladimir
Popov, David Wehlau, and Clarence Wilkerson. The symposium will focus on the
universality of invariant theory. It will show that invariant theoretic
questions occur in a wide range of mathematics, e.g., in commutative and
homological algebra, Lie theory, algebraic topology, combinatorics, geometry,
coding theory, and mathematical physics. These fields pose often challenging
problems to invariant theory, and vice versa: results in invariant theory
nurture its neighboring fields. The Red Raider Symposium 2004 provides a forum
to shed light on these interactions. The Red Raider Symposia are highly
multidisciplinary. This concept will initiate new collaborations, and will
greatly contribute to the scientific development of graduate students and early
career mathematicians who will have the opportunity to interact with some of the
most outstanding leaders in their field and to learn about research problems
that represent the frontiers of the field. We also hope that it will greatly
encourage women and underrepresented minorities to pursue careers in
mathematics.
