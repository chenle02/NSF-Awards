The PI proposes to adopt artificial intelligence computer programming for
identification of microfossils. The program will consist of "expert" input of
microfossil identification criteria which will be used by the computer software
to ask questions of the user to aid in taxonomic identification. The software
will then search a data base for the fossil assemblage identified and assign an
age to the sample under study based on previous expert input and previous
results obtained by the computer. The data base and the artificial intelligence
software will continually be updated by subsequent uses of the software. This is
an initial effort by this PI to apply the advances of artificial intelligence
programming to the study of microfossils. The results would allow consistent
identification of microfossils by different users (some of which could be non-
experts).
