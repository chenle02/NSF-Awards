This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the
general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfields of
electrochemistry and materials chemistry. The goal of this activity is to
develop electrically conducting polymers synthesized from substituted pyrroles
as materials for rechargeable battery electrodes and other applications. In the
preceding Phase I research, EIC Laboratories, Inc. demonstrated that a
polypyrrole (PP) copolymer could be synthesized that contained quinone pendant
groups which are electrochemically accessible via the PP backbone. The company
further demonstrated that in aqueous electrolytes, the presence of these quinone
moieties enhanced the electrochemical capacity of the conducting polymer. In the
present Phase II activity, the previous Phase I work is being extended and
broadened in scope. Research tasks for the current effort include: (1) the
development and optimization of new synthetic routes to substituted pyrrole
monomers; (2) the synthesis and evaluation of new PP copolymers including
optimization of the doping potential and doping level, characterization of the
electronic conductivity of substituted PP films, investigation of the pH
dependence of the pendant quinone moieties, and examination of the kinetics of
electrocatalysis by these quinones; and (3) investigation of applications of
derivatized polypyrroles in battery technology, sensor electrodes, catalysis,
and conductivity redox polymers. The new materials derived from this research
could enjoy broad, technologically important applications.
