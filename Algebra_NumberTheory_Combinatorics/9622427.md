This award supports an investigation on number-theoretical problems on zeta
functions and automorphic forms. The Euler products associated to automorphic
forms, Eisenstein series, and the special values of certain zeta functions are
the main objects of study. The theory of such Euler products (or zeta functions)
is one of the central themes of modern number theory, and Eisenstein series are
analytic functions inseparably connected to them. The investigation of special
values of zeta functions is relatively new, but has become the subject of
increasing interest. This research falls into the general mathematical field of
Number Theory. Number theory has its historical roots in the study of the whole
numbers, addressing such questions as those dealing with the divisibility of one
whole number by another. It is among the oldest branches of mathematics and was
pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within the
last half century it has become an indispensable tool in diverse applications in
areas such as data transmission and processing, and communication systems.
