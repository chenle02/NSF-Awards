9319896 Bauer The effects of temperature, internal strain, current density, and
applied stress on the stability of fine microstructures in thin films are
investigated using a combination of theoretical, computational, and experimental
methods. The theoretical and computational methods involve evaluation of
transport processes induced by capillarity, mechanical stress, and/or electric
field in polycrystalline thin films. The experimental methods involve
application of continuous, alternating, or pulsed electric and/or mechanical
fields to mono, bi, tri, or polycrystalline thin films of either aluminum or
gold, and dilute alloys thereof, measurement of electrical resistance, and
characterization of corresponding microstructure by optical, scanning electron,
transmission electron, scanning force, and scanning auger microscopy. These
methods are combined to investigate the degradation and eventual breakup of
polycrystalline thin films by capillarity, mechanical stress, electric field,
and combinations thereof. %%% This study is expected to clarify the origin and
behavior of many microstructural features associated with degradation and
eventual failure of thin films. Improved fundamental understanding of the
stability of fine microstructures in thin films is essential for effective
production of sub-micrometer devices required for advanced technological
applications. ***
