This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
(CRIF) will assist the junior faculty in Department of Chemistry at the
University of Missouri at Columbia to acquire a femtosecond laser system. This
equipment will enhance research into solvation and reactivity in supercritical
fluid solutions. A femtosecond laser provides ultrafast pulses of coherent
visible or infrared light which allows researchers to obtain important
information about fast occurring chemical reactions. Its use may enable
breakthroughs in our understanding of the properties of reactive and nonreactive
molecules
