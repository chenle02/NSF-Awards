Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope compositions of bulk organic matter, lipids
and selected pigments (chlorophylls a, b and c; B-cartene; and phaeopigments)
will be measured to investigate the sources and cycling of organic matter in
slected marine environments. Preparative-scale high-performance liquid
chromatographic methods will be used to isolate sufficient quantities of pure
parent pigments for precise and accurate stable isotope analysis. Carbon and
nitrogen uptake and biosynthetic utilization cause characteristic kinetic
fractionations that can be used to define the "life histories" of of specific
organic pools. While determinations of bulk organic matter properties are
useful, the stable isotopic analysis of specific marker compounds holds great
promise for deconvoluting organic matrices produced by multiple sources and
complex processes. Field studies will include the characterization of three
well- defined oceanographic settings to evaluate the variability, utility and
limitations of pigment-specific stable isotope distributions for (1) resolving
terrestrial and marine biomass; (2) differentiating organic matter sources in
sediments; and (3) determining the relative importance of "new" vs. "recycled"
production in the upper water column. //
