This project is a community-based program that will offer workshops which will
connect professional mathematicians and pre-service mathematics teachers from
Diné College, with middle and high school teachers and students across the
nation's largest Native American reservation. The project will create a program
in this community, with the long-term goal that these extra-curricular
mathematical activities will help future and present Native American teachers
draw more Native Americans into mathematics and math-intensive STEM fields.

Data confirm that Native Americans are under-represented in Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) careers and in higher education programs
that would prepare students for work in STEM areas. These students have few
opportunities to see mathematics beyond "school math" and therefore have limited
exposure to non-routine problems, investigations, and the mathematical practices
used by mathematicians and others in math-intense disciplines. This program has
a multi-faceted approach, but is rooted in the "math circles" professional
development and mathematical growth model. The project will recruit and support
mathematics professionals to offer workshops at Navajo Nation schools, with the
help of pre-service Mathematics teachers from Diné College and lead teachers and
students in activities centered around math circle problems. Simultaneously, the
pre-service teachers and mathematicians, with the help of workshop attendees,
will work to produce activities which are culturally relevant to students from
the Navajo Nation in grades 6-12. These scripts will be used for after-school
enrichment in the style of math circles. The project leads will also facilitate
a large annual math festival and workshop for students and teachers at Diné
College and across the Navajo nation. Evaluation of the outcomes of the project
will be tri-fold, with observations by an external team of faculty, presently
involved with developing culturally relevant mathematics activities, an advisory
board and an internal evaluation by the pre-service teacher educator from Diné
College.
