Funds are provided for support of a Workshop on the Application of Fluid
Mechanics to Material Processing. The workshop will include: industry
practitioners engaged in fluid mechanics R&D to provide information about the
problems of their industry; academics who are fluid mechanists whose interest in
industrial- oriented problems is already known or can be stimulated; managers
receptive to new approaches; and government representatives from national
laboratories. The workshop will primarily address technical issues, but will
also discuss institutional problems, the leadership role and support role of
government, and the education of management in the materials processing
community as to the contributions that can be made via fluid mechanics research.
