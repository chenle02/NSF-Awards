This award enables Boston College to connect to NSFNET through a 56,000 bit per
second connection to the mid-level network NEARnet, the New England Academic and
Research Network. Access to NSFNET provides Boston College faculty and students
with increased opportunity for collaboration and use of a wide range of research
tools such as supercomputing and shared databases. Boston College is the last
major New England university (ranked fourth in size of undergraduates and
graduate students in all of New England private schools) requiring NSFNET
access. The campus has developed an extensive internal network with short term
goals of extending Ethernet fiber to all departments within the College by 1992.
