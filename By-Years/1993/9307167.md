During the past year, a number of sources have independently reported and
documented a multi-year history of dumping of nuclear and other toxic waste
materials by the Former Soviet Union (FSU) into the Arctic Ocean, its marginal
seas, and its larger tributaries. Materials dumped or lost in the marine
environment are purported to include: sealed barrels of radioactive waste, other
hazardous and toxic waste, fueled nuclear submarines, and intact nuclear
reactors. The magnitude of the damage and risk resulting from these historical
activities of the FSU to aquatic ecosystems, terrestrial ecosystems, and human
inhabitants of the Arctic and beyond is unknown. However, the Arctic nations and
many other non-governmental entities are voicing concerns about both short- and
long-term consequences. The purpose of the IARPC workshop is to assess the
extent of marine, terrestrial, and atmospheric contamination in the Arctic
resulting from the historical practices of the Former Soviet Union. The primary
product of the workshop will be a document, An IARPC Action Plan for Assessing
Arctic Contamination Resulting From Disposal Practices of the Former Soviet
Union. The principal tasks of the workshop will be to: A) characterize the
extent of Arctic contamination by evaluation of existing data and information
about sources and types of FSU contaminant releases. B) evaluate and define
known and probable transport pathways, sinks, and likely effects of Arctic
contaminants. C) prepare a plan with recommendations for an integrated
assessment of FSU Arctic contamination. D) plan for future systematic monitoring
efforts, and formulate a strategy to utilize ships and aircraft of opportunity
that will be journeying to the Arctic. E) prepare for Federal policy and
decision makers recommendations and a summary of existing information on how to
best deal with the issue of Arctic contamination. This workshop is being
sponsored by several of the IARPC agencies.
