Dr. Evan R. Williams has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Williams' doctoral degree was from Cornell University under the
supervision of Professor Fred McLafferty. Dr. Williams intends to continue
research at Stanford University under the sponsorship of Professor Richard Zare.
Dr. Williams' area of postdoctoral research will be the analysis of large
biological molecules using the high separation efficiency of capillary zone
electrophoresis with the high sensitivity of time of flight mass spectrometry.
The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an
important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and
experience of new Ph.D's and attract them into meaningful careers in
contemporary chemical research and teaching.
