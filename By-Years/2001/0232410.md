This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will culminate
in the design of a system that integrates assessment of complex, standards-based
instructional objectives within interactive simulations and makes the resultant
data available in a timely and efficient manner to teachers and administrators.
Standards-based educational reform efforts are currently impoverished by a lack
of assessment instruments that measure complex instructional objectives.
Although complex objectives can be addressed through interactive simulations,
these simulations neither explicitly assess students' competencies against these
objectives nor make this information available to teachers. As a result,
students' activity within simulations is largely invisible to teachers,
relegating simulations either to an extremely limited role or to one that
involves displacing the teacher. The proposed project will analyze the practices
of master teachers using simulations while tutoring students and index these
practices against hierarchies of instructional objectives derived from state
standards. New simulations designed expressly for assessing complex
instructional objectives will be designed, along with reporting mechanisms for
communicating assessment results to teachers. This innovation will foster
alignment with standards-based curricula, support teachers in integrating
technology effectively and efficiently into their classrooms, and provide a new
approach for measuring the impact of educational technology on student learning.
The proffered innovation in assessment capability addresses an important nation
problem, the "assessment gap." It can potentially be applied to any system
involving interactive content that is used in the cont
