This project is a Special Year in Several Complex Variables at Purdue
University in the 1988-89 academic year. The purpose is to stimulate interaction
between basic areas of research in Several Complex Variables including CR
geometry, the d-bar Neumann problem, the Monge-Ampere equation, boundary
behavior of holomorphic mappings, and complex differential geometry. Besides the
faculty regularly at Purdue who specialize in several complex variables, Laszlo
Lempert and Eric Bedford will spend the year there, and Linda Rothschild and
Sidney Webster will visit for a month or so. During the 1988-89 academic year,
about 25 other specialists will come to Purdue for visits of from one week to
two months. The Midwest Several Complex Variables Conference will be held at
Purdue September 14-15 in conjunction with this special year, and will feature
L. Lempert, F. Forstneric, E. Ligocka, M. Christ, M. Machedon and others as main
speakers.
