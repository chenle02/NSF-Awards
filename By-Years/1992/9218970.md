The objectives are to experimentally determine flow laws for dislocation and
diffusion creep of mono-and polyphase aggregates of quartz and feldspar which
can be reliably extrapolated to crustal conditions. A key element of the study
will be use of molten salt sample assemblies, which provide nearly the stress
sensitivity of gas apparatus together with the high pressure capability required
to induce dislocation creep in quartz and feldspar. The results of this study
should provide greatly improved mechanical data for interpreting crustal
deformation, plus fundamental understanding of diffusion and dislocation creep
applicable to other silicates.
