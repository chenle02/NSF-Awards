The problem of under-representation of women in engineering and sciences is
critical.&lt;br/&gt;This is particularly true of senior women in engineering. To
address this urgent problem&lt;br/&gt;of under-representation and to meet the
marketplace demand for the technological&lt;br/&gt;workforce in the 21 st
century, a program is proposed that provides for mentoring
and&lt;br/&gt;leadership development.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The aim of the
Mentoring and Leadership Program is to sustain and broaden the
existing&lt;br/&gt;initiatives at Syracuse University to promote the advancement
of women faculty in&lt;br/&gt;engineering and sciences. Some of the existing
initiatives are the brainchild of WISE,&lt;br/&gt;which the PI co-directs with
the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, and others&lt;br/&gt;are the
direct results of the PI's Meredith Professorship initiatives. The
proposed&lt;br/&gt;Mentoring and Leadership Program will capitalize on the
existing initiatives and will &lt;br/&gt;introduce new features that reflect
current knowledge of leadership development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ADVANCE
Leadership Award will also enable the PI to maintain an
active&lt;br/&gt;research program while she develops and implements initiatives
aimed at the&lt;br/&gt;advancement of women students and faculty at Syracuse
University.&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the NSF ADVANCE Program. The
overall mission of the ADVANCE Program is to increase the participation of women
in the scientific and engineering workforce through the increased representation
and advancement of women in academic science and engineering careers.
