This is a Career Advancement Award to support Dr. Gantt's visit to Dr. Tandeau
de Marsac's laboratory at the Pasteur Institute. Dr. Gantt will initiate a
collaboration with Dr. Tandeau de Marsac, in which molecular recombinant DNA
techniques will be applied to the study of phycobilisomes in the photosynthetic
apparatus of red algae and cyanobacteria. This collaboration will bring together
Dr. Gantt's long-term experience and expertise with phycobilisomes (which she
discovered) with the molecular recombinant DNA techniques which are available to
be learned and used in Dr. Tandeau de Marsac's laboratory. Given the depth of
experience that Dr. Gantt already has in her field, the acquisition of these new
techniques and development of this new collaboration are anticipated to lead to
substantial new breakthroughs and thereby enhance Dr. Gantt's career.
