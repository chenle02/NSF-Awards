9704853 Hale The proposed research is concerned with the generation of stable
patterns and synchronization in dynamical systems defined by ordinary
differential equations on lattices, partial differential equations and delay
differential equations. The primary interest is in the manner in which diffusive
coupling, domain shape or boundary layer affect the dynamics and especially the
stability of solutions. The mathematical tools involve singular perturbation
theory, invariant manifolds and bifurcation. It is of paramount importance to
understand the processor responsible for self organization, pattern formation
and synchronization in various fields such as chemical kinetics, physics,
biology, biochemistry and ecology. It has been known for some time that the
nature of diffusive interaction of individual particles (or subsystems) plays a
fundamental role. The main thrust of this project is to attempt to understand
these phenomena and their dependence upon the coupling, domain shape and
boundary conditions.
