The principal investigator will study problems in billiards which model
important questions from Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theory, as well as quadratic
differentials and Teichmuller theory. He will investigate whether convergence of
ergodic averages for measured foliations can be estimated if one knows the orbit
of the Teichmuller geodesic it determines. Another important question addressed
in this project concerns the extremal length geometry of Teichmuller space.
Specifically, are there a finite number of curves whose extremal lengths
determine the Riemann surface? Invariant annular bands arise in the Kolmogorov-
Arnold-Moser theory of turbulence. Iterations of functions on these bands can be
modeled by angles and locations of bounces of a billiard ball on a circular
table. For these reasons, the principal investigator might shed light on
relevant questions of turbulence (and the shape of ships' hulls) by answering
questions described by the game of billiards. For example, how many of the
possible directions that one might hit a billiard ball carry the ball in a
periodic trajectory, so that the ball eventually returns to the exact same spot
travelling in the exact same direction? Does the location of the ball or shape
of the table make a difference?
