The sophomore level course in Cellular and Molecular Biology focuses on the
elucidation of biological concepts, the practise of general investigative
skills, and the development of technical skills specific to this area. These
objectives are enhanced by exposing the students to a greater variety of
investigative techniques through hands-on experience emphasizing inquiry and
experimentation. Through the purchase of centrfuges, liquid chromatography and
gel electrophoresis systems, spectrophotometers, and fluorescence/phase
microscopes with video components, students can isolate, purify, and
characterize cellular organelles and their constituent proteins and nucleic
acids. This should greatly enhance the interest of the students in further study
in this curricular area. The college will contribute an amount equal to the
award.
