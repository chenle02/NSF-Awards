Civil Engineeing (54)

An integrated undergraduate structural engineering laboratory, adapted from the
Stahl and DeViries model, is being used as the basis for revision of all
structural engineering design courses. The structural testing frame fabricated
as part of this project is providing the means to conduct experiments on steel,
concrete and timber structural elements. These experiments and the associated
educational activities are significantly improving the undergraduate civil
engineering curriculum, encouraging student interaction, cultivating student
creativity, and bridging student connectivity between theoretical concepts and
hands-on experience. The project is improving student retention rates,
particularly among students from underrepresented groups. The equipment and
associated experiments are bringing students from different concentration areas,
mainly structural engineering, construction management, and geo-technical
engineering together, and providing interdisciplinary interaction and
engagement. This interdisciplinary learning environment is encouraging students
to explore projects within various concentration areas.
