The general objective of the proposed research is to gain an improved
understanding of high-dimensional convex bodies, with special emphasis on
algorithmic aspects of the convex bodies that arise in applications such as
mathematical programming and computer science. For years the close collaboration
between the PI and Peter Gritzman of the University of Trier, Germany has
produced results in the areas of mathematical optimization, discrete
mathematics, and computer science, among others. This proposal seeks to include
students on both sides of the Atlantic in this collaboration to establish new
contacts and open up new areas of investigation.
