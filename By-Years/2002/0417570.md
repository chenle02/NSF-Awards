James T. Hynes of the University of Colorado is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program for research which is extending and improving
his prior work on the theory of chemical reactions in solution and at surfaces.
Three projects are being carried out: (1) a theoretical description of dynamics
involving conical intersections; (2) a study of the vibrational dynamics of
water molecules in the solvation shell of ions; and (3) three topics in
atmospheric chemistry including the mechanism of nitric acid uptake on ice
surfaces, the role of nitrate aerosols in the stratosphere and a proposed
mechanism of prebiotic peptide bond formation involving aersol surfaces. The
work is having a broad impact in atmospheric chemistry and
biochemistry.&lt;br/&gt;
