The importance of biogels in the function of biological systems is increasingly
recognized, yet little theoretical work has been done to understand their
behavior. Mathematics is well-suited to sorting out the interplay among the many
forces (mechanical, electrochemical, and biochemical) that determine biogel
structure and function. The investigators use mathematical tools to explore four
closely related problems of biogel growth and dynamics, with an emphasis on
pattern-forming mechanisms and the relationship between pattern and function.
The four problems are biofilm and blood clot formation and function, gastric
protection of the stomach, and the behavior of biogels in contact with a moving
fluid. Models are developed to understand how physical properties such as the
viscoelastic constitutive properties and the gel morphology are determined and
controlled, and how these properties affect the biological function of the
biogel. The investigators use analytical and computational tools to examine gel
growth and dynamics on different scales using various models (continuum,
discrete, isotropic, anisotropic), while attempting to incorporate what is known
experimentally, and to expand the experimental database about specific biogel
systems. Biogels are composites of water, filamentous protein networks, and
other chemicals, and are increasingly recognized as having profound influence on
the function of many biological systems. Important biological settings in which
these biogels play a major role include blood clot formation, difficult-to-treat
bacterial infections, and the proper protective functioning of the stomach
lining. Improved understanding of how biogels are formed and how their
properties are regulated is critical to understanding these important processes
and how they can be manipulated to improve human health. Because the formation
and regulation of biogels is governed by physical and chemical properties and
because these properties can be expressed mathematically, mathematical tools can
be brought to bear on these problems. Through mathematical analysis and
computational simulations of biogels, a wealth of detailed data can be obtained
that complements the data obtainable from traditional laboratory experiments.
Hence the combination of mathematical and experimental investigators brought
together in this project is expected to lead to important new insights about
biogel behavior. The project includes mathematicians, a bioengineer, and a
biologist, and provides interdisciplinary research and training opportunities
for students and postdocs.
