This project will address topics which offer promise for unifying fundamental
interactions, in particular, string theory. It will focus on: (1) The appearance
of a low energy scale, supersymmetry breaking and the vanishing of the
cosmological constant; (2) How does nature choose between the myriad possible
vacua of string theory? This work is at the frontiers of the most abstract parts
of modern elementary particle theory, so-called "string theory." It is not yet
possible to predict the success this approach will have in explaining the
fundamental interactions of elementary particles, or, if it is successful, what
theoretical and/or practical applications will follow.
