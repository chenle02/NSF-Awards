This research, jointly supported by the Physical Chemistry Program and the
Biophysics Program, develops the theory and application of X-ray absorption
spectroscopy directed to the structural characterization of selected
metalloproteins. These studies will contribute to the elucidation of the general
principles underlying the structure-function relationships of metal centers with
the associated protein. The coordination and the electronic environment of the
metal atoms in metalloproteins will be probed as a function of redox state and
of substrate and inhibitor binding. In addition, a number of high-valent heme-
iron protein systems will be characterized in order to define the range of
structures that occur in states that have iron-oxo units and related
compositions. Theoretical and experimental work will be performed to enhance the
ability to extract structural information from X-ray absorption edge
spectroscopic studies.
