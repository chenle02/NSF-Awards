This dissertation research project supports a socio-linguistic anthropologist
in Bethel, Alaska. The research will study how Yupik Eskimo and non-native men
in this small rural community establish their identities through conversation
and discourse related to subsistence. In Alaska, Native American subsistence
patterns of hunting and fishing are critical definers of an appropriate
lifestyle. Methods include participant observation during subsistence hunting
and fishing, recording and analysis of conversations during daily life, and
extended life history elicitation during formal interviews. This research is
important because Native Americans are one of the fastest growing census
categories in U.S. society. Increased understanding of how Native Americans
understand themselves in relation to non-Native others will help society
decision makers to design programs that deal with issues of importance to Native
Americans.
