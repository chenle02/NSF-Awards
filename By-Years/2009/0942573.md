Multidisciplinary (99)&lt;br/&gt;To be effectively prepared for the workforce,
students need to learn not only science content (facts) but also advanced
transferable reasoning skills. Through development and practice of these skills
students will be better prepared to successfully handle real-world tasks in
future careers. Not only does inquiry-based instruction promote scientific
reasoning (SR) abilities, but also the SR skills of teachers significantly
impact their ability to effectively use inquiry methods. Effective STEM teachers
need to be competent in both their own content knowledge as well as advanced
reasoning skills. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many teacher preparation programs
include inquiry-based courses in order to develop both content knowledge and
general abilities, such as scientific reasoning, while modeling best teaching
practices. Innovative teacher education programs at many institutions now have
many inquiry-based courses designed specifically for pre-service teachers.
However, there is evidence (derived through pre- and post-tests of students' SR
abilities and their understanding of the nature of science) that many pre-
service teachers are not developing these critical skills. In response to this
need, this project is developing SR-oriented training modules that can be
readily transferred to teacher preparation programs at other institutions
