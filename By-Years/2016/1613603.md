This project carries out mathematical studies of physical systems in
heterogeneous environments. Such systems are ubiquitous in nature, and include
examples as diverse as light propagation through the atmosphere, seismic waves
in the Earth following an earthquake, stock market fluctuations, and medical
imaging problems. The mathematical modeling of such problems involves partial
differential equations with highly oscillatory coefficients. Typically, such
problems involve a multitude of temporal and spatial scales: a typical
propagation distance may be of the order of hundreds or thousands of wavelengths
and as many correlation lengths of random fluctuations. Numerical simulation of
the microscopic details of the solutions is beyond the reach even for the most
powerful modern computers. For the prediction and understanding of behavior of
these multi-scale system, it is imperative to use various approximate
macroscopic effective models that preserve the salient features of the processes
without keeping track of all microscopic details. The overarching goal of the
project is to develop a better understanding of the validity of such macroscopic
models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the first part of the project is to
develop new tools and better understanding of the effective limits in wave
propagation, with the focus on random media with long-range correlations that
lead to multiple temporal and spatial scales for various physical phenomena. The
second part of the proposal investigates the qualitative behavior of the
solutions of reaction-diffusion equations with stochastic perturbations.
Stochastic fluctuations and heterogeneities play a significant effect on front
propagation properties, leading to new types of solutions and asymptotic
behavior. One goal of the project will be to understand the connection between
the stochastic reaction-diffusion problems and the recent theory of the
regularity structures.
