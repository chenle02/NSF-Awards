Barbara&lt;br/&gt;Title: SGER: Grand Challenges in Cyber
Security&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Summary:&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this
exploratory project is to design and run the first Grand Challenge Competition
in Cyber Security. Among four possible candidate domains, (the development of a
secure voting system, the identification of sophisticated vulnerabilities, the
elimination of SPAM, and the design of a ?hackproof? server), one will be
selected for the initial competition. The lessons learned from the design and
execution of this initial challenge will be used for the design and
implementation of subsequent contests.&lt;br/&gt;The idea for a security grand
challenge competition is inspired by the very successful DARPA Grand Challenges
&lt;br/&gt;The design of the rules of engagement and criteria for selecting a
?winner? of a computer security grand challenge is an extremely difficult
endeavor, and is the part of the focus of this research. &lt;br/&gt;It is
expected that the first carry competition will be held at a major computer
security conference in 2009. There is a pressing need for a challenging contest
that will attract the public interest and galvanize the research community.
