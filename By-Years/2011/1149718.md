Humans and animals alike need to connect where they are in the world to the best
choice of action to take. Much is known about brain mechanisms by which control
of the musculature is accomplished as well as brain mechanisms by which an
organism's position in an environment is encoded. How these control systems
interact, however, is unknown. Recent findings suggest that the posterior
parietal cortex is a brain structure that, by virtue of both its anatomy and
physiology, can coordinate control of the musculature according to the spatial
position that an organism occupies. This project will combine novel behavioral
tasks, multiple single-neuron recording techniques, and temporary (focal) brain-
inactivation techniques to determine if this is, indeed, the case. Furthermore,
the project will determine the coding mechanism whereby perception of position
in the world is transformed into a plan of action. The experiments are expected
to show that the parietal cortex is responsible for the generation of "action-
planning" signals that are found within the premotor cortex and that parietal
cortex activity pulls sensory and motor systems into a common network such that
sensory inputs can guide motor control in a fluid, efficient fashion. The work's
importance lies in identifying the neural machinery responsible for utilizing
complex cognitive abilities (mapping one's position in the world) to control the
senses and musculature, thereby allowing for intelligent behavior. The results
will be of importance to the further development of autonomous robots that
utilize simulated neural networks and to the study of neurological disorders,
such as autism, where efficient sequencing of actions based on environmental
stimuli appears to be deficient. Results of the work will be disseminated
through scientific publication and will form the basis for outreach projects
wherein high school students are given the chance to practice neuroscience in a
real-world setting.
