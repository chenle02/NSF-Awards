Feature based computer aided design systems are now becoming commercially
available for mechanical design. Features are recurring stereotypical patterns
with which knowledge related to various aspects of the product is associated.
Feature modelers make it easy to modify the geometry as associations between
entities of the part are encoded in the feature definition. Since features are
viewpoint dependent, it is necessary to map/transform them from one viewpoint to
another for concurrent engineering. However, feature mapping presents some
difficult problems, particularly with modelers that do not restrict one to a
limited set of predefined features, and when there are interactions between
features that change their generic meaning. This research develops techniques
which will enable manufacturing application programs to understand design
features from a manufacturing viewpoint and automonously generate feasible
machining process sequences for undocumented features. In effect, the system
will be a self learning system that will automatically update its own knowledge
about machining options for a feature it has never seen before. Techniques
developed will include: constructive solid geometry tree reconstruction to
localize interactions, intelligent representation of manufacturing features, and
a meta knowledge base for encoding capabilities of machining processes from
which feasible machining alternatives can be generated.
