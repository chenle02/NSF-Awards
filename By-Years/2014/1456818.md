Neurons in the brain communicate with each other through proteins that are
present on specialized structures called spines that extend out from the neuron
cell membrane. During neuron activity, the number and shape of spines change.
Understanding how these changes occur is important because the changes are
associated with learning and memory. The PI will study one particular protein
that is highly abundant in spines and known to be critical for learning. The
goal of the project is to determine how this protein and the proteins that it
interacts with control spine shape and number. Undergraduate and graduate
students, including underrepresented minorities, will participate in the
research. The PI will present seminars on this area of research to the Health
Science-Multicultural and Community Affairs (HS-MACA) Postbaccalaureate Program
that is offered at his institution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Glutamate delta-1
receptors are orphan receptors that, unlike other members of the ionotropic
glutamate receptor family, do not function as typical ligand-gated ion channels.
Understanding their mechanism of action is important because the receptors are
crucial for normal dendritic spine pruning, associative and reversal learning,
and execution of complex behaviors. This project will investigate the potential
interaction of glutamate delta-1 receptor with metabotropic glutamate receptors,
which are also enriched at glutamatergic synapses. The working hypothesis for
the proposed studies is that the glutamate delta-1 receptor regulates downstream
metabotropic glutamate receptor signaling, including the mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which regulates spine morphology. A multidisciplinary
approach will be carried out that will make use of genetic and pharmacological
tools, functional assays, diolistic labeling, and three dimensional
reconstruction techniques. Outcomes are directed at developing a mechanistic
understanding of glutamatergic synapse structure and function in the central
nervous system.
