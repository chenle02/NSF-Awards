For many sessile marine invertebrates, the larval stage is the most important
mode of dispersal, and larval recruitment can directly affect the growth,
survival and structure of populations. However, the nature and dynamics of
larval dispersal, and thus gene flow, have been difficult to characterize. The
recent development of new and rapidly applied molecular techniques may make it
possible to assess dispersal by examining the genetic "relatedness" of
populations. The PI proposes to learn and adapt molecular genetic techniques for
the study of coral population genetics. The phylogenetic diversity and
population structure, over large and small geographic scales, of the widely
distributed brooding coral Acropora palifera will determined. Phylogeographic
genotypes, along the length of the Great Barrier Reef, will be characterized by
contrasting restriction endonuclease patterns of small and large subunit
ribosomal DNAs in this coral with closely and distantly related corals. The
relatedness of colonies from reefs in the same geographic area will also be
evaluated to assess the nature of local gene flow by restriction fragment length
polymorphism analysis of mitochondrial DNA and DNA fingerprinting.
