McCallum 9624219 The method of Coleman and Chabauty is a method for bounding
rational points on curves. Over the last few years, the investigator has
developed a refinement of this method by bringing in descent in a precise way.
Until now, his work on this method has been restricted to Fermat curves. He will
now consider more general applications of this method, and will develop results
of independent interest in multivariable Iwasawa theory and in the Iwasawa
theory of p-adic representations. Broadly, the refinement of the method of
Coleman and Chabauty consists of two parts. The first is the construction of an
element of a certain Selmer group attached to the Jacobian of the curve, and the
second is the transformation of this element via a sort of explicit reciprocity
law into a p-adic analytic function that vanishes on the rational points of the
curve. The second part has, in the case of Fermat curves, yielded a new and
beautifully geometric argument for Fermat's Last Theorem (not just the second
case) for those primes p for which the necessary Selmer group element exists.
The investigator has already proved that the necessary element exists when p is
regular. The effort to construct it more generally has led to some interesting
results in multi-variable Iwasawa theory. The investigator will continue to work
on this line of inquiry, both for its independent interest and for its potential
application to the general method. This project falls into the general area of
Arithmetic Algebraic Geometry-a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of
mathematics: Number Theory and Geometry. This combination has proved
extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that withstood
generations. Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes. Such
codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
