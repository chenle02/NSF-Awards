P.I.. Kamykowski, Daniel Proposal #: 9503253 PROJECT ABSTRACT Research will
examine how various internal cellular characteristics (e.g., chloroplast
position, DNA synthesis, lipid storage) correlate with marine dinoflagellate
orientation during diel vertical migration in several environmental contexts. An
understanding of these relationships will lead to the development of models that
predict how growth and survival of photosynthetic populations vary in space and
time. This variability will relate directly to the competitive capability of a
species in a given water mass, to the development of patches at water
convergences, and to the formation of dense layers within the water column.
