Meiosis is a complex cellular process that occurs during the sexual reproduction
of all eukayotic organisms including man. The reproduction of meiosis involves
the assembly of complex cellular structures, including the synaptonemal complex,
and the spindle. We are studying two genes required for normal meiosis in
Drosophila: (1) c(3)G, which is required for the assembly of the synaptonemal
complex, and (2) cand, which encodes a kinesin-like mechanochemical protein that
is required for the assembly of the spindle. We have refined the cytogenetic
localization of c(3)G in order to facilitate the isolation of the gene by
molecular cloning. We now propose to isolate the c(3)G locus by chromosome
walking, and use the cloned gene to determine the nature and subcellular
localization of the gene product by DNA sequencing and antibody staining. We
also propose to identify additional genes required for synaptonemal complex and
spindle assembly by screening for mutations that display second-site
noncomplementation of c(3)G or cand. %%% Gametes are formed in sexually
reproducing organisms by an intricate sequence of two cell division known as
meiosis. During meiosis special structures are formed in the dividing
reproductive cells which ensure that a precise and compete set of chromosome is
distributed into each gamete. The cellular structures and mechanisms of meiosis
are essential for normal reproduction, since gametes carrying too many or too
few chromosomes give rise to grossly abnormal or inviable offspring. The
detailed mechanisms of meiosis are yet poorly understood. This is a proposal to
study genes of the fruit fly Drosophila whose products play an essential role in
meiosis.
