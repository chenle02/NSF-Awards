The development of a unique facility for the study of the magnetic and
tribological properties of thin films will be accomplished with funds from the
Academic Research Infrastructure Program. An existing apparatus donated by the
IBM Corporation to Rice University already includes scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), and electron dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDS) in a large ultra-high-vacumn chamber. Magnetic studies will
be performed with the addition of electron spin polarimeters to perform scanning
electron microscopy with polarization analysis (SEMPA) and a magneto-optic Kerr
effect apparatus (MOKE). The completed system will be uniquely equipped to
answer scientific and technological questions because of its ability to: 1)
image written magnetic domain structures in magnetic data storage materials, 2)
investigate the interaction of written domain walls with microstructural
features, 3) image domain walls at surfaces of epitaxial evaporated films, 4)
permit fundamental studies of spin polarization at surfaces of epitaxial thin
films, 5) characterize the surface chemistry and morphology of tribological
surfaces for magnetic disk storage, 6) chemically and physically characterize
new tribological materials, 7) sputter deposit and characterize magnetic thin
films and multilayers relevant to magnetic storage applications. Starting with
an existing ultra-high-vacumn chamber with existing various electron
spectroscopies instrumentation will be added to permit magnetic measurements of
magnetic thin films and magnetic multilayer systems. The new facility, with a
unique combination of experimental capabilities, will be used to study directly
the magnetic and tribological properties of magnetic data storage materials and
epitaxial magnetic multilayer materials.
