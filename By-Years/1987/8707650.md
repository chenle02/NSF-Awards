This Engineering Initiation Award research project will develop an improved
methodology for determining allowed time in human visual inspection operations
to provide industry with a tool for making more accurate assessments of product
costs. Rather than rely on extensive worker observation, empirically-derived
visual search models will serve as a basis for predicting inspection time,
taking into account task characteristics such as item complexity, density,
contrast, and area. After an initial review of visual search models and
predetermined time systems, the models will be combined with new models obtained
from experimentation, to serve as a basis for defining time standards. Resultant
models will be validated with a circuit board inspection task, under a wide
variety of task conditions. The proposed research should have a significant
impact on both the modeling of human visual detection and on industrial job
design and evaluation methodology. Despite the ongoing development of automated
inspection systems, much industrial visual inspection is expected to be carried
out by humans in the foreseeable future due to performance and cost limitations;
therefore, this research should contribute to industrial improvements in this
regard.
