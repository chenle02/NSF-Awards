This award will help support the Big Sky Conference on Discrete
&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics which is held in Missoula, Montana. There are two
&lt;br/&gt;main objectives of the conference. First, the conference is
&lt;br/&gt;designed to bring together researchers and educators from the
&lt;br/&gt;geographical area with interests in discrete mathematics in order
&lt;br/&gt;for them to share ideas, present their work, and collaborate.
&lt;br/&gt;Topics for the conference cover areas of discrete
mathematics&lt;br/&gt;including combinatorics, graph theory, discrete geometry,
design &lt;br/&gt;theory and theoretical computer science. The conference
attracts &lt;br/&gt;mathematicians and computer scientists from western US and
Canada &lt;br/&gt;and in doing so has strengthened the discrete mathematics
&lt;br/&gt;community in the region. The conference also includes two
&lt;br/&gt;research-level invited addresses. One is given by a senior-level
&lt;br/&gt;experienced mathematician and the other by a younger researcher
&lt;br/&gt;who has made significant contributions to the field. The presence
&lt;br/&gt;of these internationally-known researchers greatly enhances the
&lt;br/&gt;conference. Secondly, the conference seeks to provide an
&lt;br/&gt;opportunity for students, teachers, and others in the region to
&lt;br/&gt;learn more about contemporary mathematics. This award provides
&lt;br/&gt;support for undergraduate and graduate students to attend the
&lt;br/&gt;conference and present their work. In addition, a public lecture
&lt;br/&gt;(given by one of the invited speakers) is an integral part of the
&lt;br/&gt;Big Sky Conference. The audience, comprised of people of all ages
&lt;br/&gt;and many different walks of life, is treated to a dynamic lecture
&lt;br/&gt;on the beauty and relevance of mathematics. The conference will
&lt;br/&gt;be hosted by The University of
Montana.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Big Sky Conference on Discrete Math
is held in the early fall &lt;br/&gt;at The University of Montana. The primary
focus of the conference &lt;br/&gt;is stimulation and dissemination of research
and creative ideas in &lt;br/&gt;discrete mathematics. This includes promoting
collaboration among &lt;br/&gt;regional colleagues, supporting student research,
and &lt;br/&gt;demonstrating to the general populace that mathematics is a
&lt;br/&gt;dynamic evolving field with applications in modern society. The
&lt;br/&gt;events of the conference include contributed talks by faculty and
&lt;br/&gt;students and three invited addresses. One of the principle
&lt;br/&gt;speakers is an internationally acclaimed specialist and
&lt;br/&gt;outstanding expositor. This speaker gives a research level
&lt;br/&gt;seminar and a public lecture. With attendance at the public
&lt;br/&gt;lecture between 300 and 500 people, public awareness of
&lt;br/&gt;mathematics has flourished during the years of the Big Sky
&lt;br/&gt;Conference. The other speaker is a younger researcher who has made
&lt;br/&gt;a significant contribution to an area of discrete mathematics.
&lt;br/&gt;This person typically gives a specialized talk about a recent
&lt;br/&gt;advancement in the field. The conference attracts
researchers,&lt;br/&gt;educators, and students from the US and Canada,
especially those &lt;br/&gt;in the northwest region.&lt;br/&gt;
