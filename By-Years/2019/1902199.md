The project concerns various problems tied to number theory and algebraic
geometry. Specifically, finding rational solutions to a system of polynomial
equations has been the subject of active research since the ancient times. These
rational points are quite sparse; Faltings (1983) proved that there are only
finitely many rational points on curves of genus at least 2, and the minimalist
conjecture asserts that most elliptic curves have low ranks as well. The
sparsity of rational points have an application in the field of cryptography, as
the explicit computation of various invariants of elliptic curves is often
difficult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to further this point of view
using various techniques coming from number theory, algebraic geometry, and
logic. On one hand, the PI wishes to develop explicit p-adic methods that help
find these rational points. On the other hand, heuristic arguments that
approximate the difficulty of these methods can be helpful. These heuristics can
range from finding a simple model for certain arithmetic invariants tied to the
distribution of rational points, to arguments based in logic, to the estimate of
computational complexity in the explicit computation of these invariants. These
heuristics could have real-life consequences in, for example, approximating the
hardness of isogeny-based cryptography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
