This award will provide support for a workshop on Identifying Features in
Biological Sequences. The workshop will take place at Aspen Center for Physics
from May 24, 1993 to June 13, 1993. The participants of the workshop will come
from fields of mathematics and statistics, computer science, and molecular
biology. The workshop will focus on the problems of extracting biological
information from sequences, but with diverse enough approaches that many of the
participants would not have otherwise interact with each other. This workshop is
being jointly supported by the Theory of Computing and the Computational Biology
Activities programs.
