Boynton 9617977 A World in Motion II: The Design Experience engages students in
authentic engineering design challenges that are the context for learning
mathematics, science, technology, education, social science, and language arts
concepts and skills appropriate to middle school students. This project is based
on the engineering design experiences for seventh and eighth grades. It provides
support for teachers in their understanding of the design experience and of
learning goals for students. The materials include short papers, how-to
instructions, assessment items, and videos demonstrating classroom experiences,
technical instructions and assembly of materials. In addition a sixth grade
challenge that can be used in stand alone classrooms or in team situations
provides a bridge from World in Motion I to the engineering design experience.
The evaluation provides data demonstrating the effectiveness of the materials.
