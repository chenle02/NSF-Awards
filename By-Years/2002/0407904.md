DISSERTATION RESEARCH: Components of parent and offspring fitness and their
influence on parental care evolution Colette St. Mary and Rebecca Hale

LAY ABSTRACT

Organisms are faced with a tradeoff when investing energy and resources into
the fitness of their young. If resource acquisition is limited, then increasing
investment into offspring reduces investment into parental survival, thus
reducing the parent's future reproductive success. Life history theory argues
that resources can be optimally invested into current and future offspring such
that the parent's lifetime reproductive success is maximized. This optimum is
expected to vary with factors including the parental costs to future
reproduction and the reproductive value of offspring before and after receiving
care. This study makes clear predictions for how parental care should vary as a
function offspring reproductive value and predictions are then tested in the
flagfish(Jordanella floridae), a species in which males are the sole care
providers. Specifically, the model is evaluated in a series of experiments that
employ novel approaches to the study of parental care evolution, including
examining care across environments in which both costs and benefits of care
vary.

Broader impacts: This works will tie together an array of ideas and empirical
results by providing a unifying framework that incorporates the components of
parental and especially offspring fitness that influence the evolution of
parental care. Support of this proposal will also enrich the training and
research experiences of Rebecca Hale and undergraduates that work with her to
complete the proposed work.
