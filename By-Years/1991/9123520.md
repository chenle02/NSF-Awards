Issues in the efficient implementation of concurrent constraint programming
languages are considered in this project. In particular, program analysis,
transformation, and optimization are emphasized. Four stages comprise this
investigation. First, abstract interpretation frameworks for concurrent
constraint programming languages are examined emphasizing the development of
efficient dataflow algorithms. Next, assertion language and tools for
manipulating user annotations are studied. Then, runtime data representation
issues and interactions with concurrency are considered. Finally, compile-time
analysis and control of task granularity for the effective utilization of
parallel hardware are examined.
