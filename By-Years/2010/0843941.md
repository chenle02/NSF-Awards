Zinc Oxide (ZnO) is a wide-bandgap semiconductor that has recently seen a
resurgence of popularity as a choice material for optoelectronic devices in the
blue-to-near-ultraviolet region of the spectrum. Its properties and non-toxicity
make it an ideal material for photonic applications. For semiconductors to be
useful in most applications it is necessary to add an additional element to the
main material, i.e. to dope the semiconductor. This has kept ZnO from being
widely used in devices, despite all of its advantages, because there is no
reliable and reproducible way to obtain highly p-doped ZnO. This Small Grant for
Exploratory Research aims to reveal the dynamics of the electrons and lattice
involved in producing p-doped ZnO. Simultaneously with investigating the physics
behind ultrafast doping, this project will explore the use of ultrashort laser
pulses to produce a highly doped wide-bandgap semiconductor such as p-doped ZnO.
The project will provide a graduate student with multidisciplinary
skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will
investigate the fundamental electronic and lattice properties of a semiconductor
as the material interacts with dopants under ultrafast laser irradiation. The
measurements will reveal information about the numbers of carriers excited, the
relaxation mechanisms by which the material absorbs excess energy, and the
timescales in which the lattice incorporates and accommodates dopants. A
fundamental understanding of the electronic and lattice dynamics during
ultrafast laser doping is critical for further research on highly doped
semiconductors. Simultaneously with investigating the physics behind ultrafast
doping, this project will explore the use of ultrashort laser pulses to produce
a highly doped wide-bandgap semiconductor such as p-doped ZnO. The project will
provide a graduate student with multidisciplinary skills.
