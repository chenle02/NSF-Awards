Recent measurements in various laboratories have established the presence of
cosmogenic 3He in terrestrial samples. In order to document the production rate
and production mechanism of cosmogenic 3He in surface rocks,the PI has engaged
in a program of measurements in geologically well-documented samples. Recent
measurements in radiocarbon dated lava flows show that the 3He production rate
has varied by up to the factor of three within the last 10,000 years. The
variations may be related to changes in the earth's dipole moment, which
modulates the cosmic ray flux. In order to test this hypothesis, new
measurements will be carried out on radiocarbon dated flows from various
latitudes. The available data suggest the cosmogenic 3He will become a powerful
tool for measuring exposure ages, which will have important applications to
glacial geology and possibly paleomagnetism. Calibration of the technique will
also include new measurements on previously dated glacial morraines from
Antarctica collected specifically for this purpose.
