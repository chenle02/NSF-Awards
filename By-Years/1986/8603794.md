Support will be provided for the conduct of field testing experiments in Japan.
The investigator has developed instrumentation to measure in-situ soil
properties. The Formation Factor Probe is used to characterize the grain and
aggregate properties, including a measure of mechanical anisotropy. The
Dielectric-Conductivity Probe provides a means to continuously monitor the soil
type and porosity. This data, in conjunction with a liquefaction analysis
developed by the PI, is used to make a priori predictions of pore pressure
generation and dissipation at a site.
