The goal of this research is to gain an understanding of the surface molecular
characteristics of selected copolymer systems based on poly(dimethylsiloxane).
Composition profiles away from the surface and molecular orientation of the
individual components will be studied as a function of the bulk chemical
composition, molecular architecture, and molecular weight. Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy, employing attenuated total reflectance with barrier-
layers, will be used as the primary method. The data will be compared with
recent theoretical predictions on the surface ordering of diblock copolymers and
established theories dealing with the ordering of copolymers in the bulk. The
result of this research may lead to better theories in this field and have
important implications in many practical aspects dealing with surface-related
properties, such as adhesion and lubrication.
