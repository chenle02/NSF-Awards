This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Biology for FY 2008. The
fellowship supports a research and training plan entitled ?The evolutionary
consequences of pectoral fin functional diversity in darter fishes? for Rose L.
Carlson who will be hosted by Prof. George Lauder at Harvard University.

Understanding the factors that cause changes in both the number of species as
well as the morphological diversity of a lineage will likely aid in the
preservation of existing biodiversity. The factors that contribute to changes in
morphological diversity are most efficiently identified though phylogenetic
comparative analysis of characters with known function, performance
consequences, and ecological relevance in the lineage of interest. To this end,
this research project first uses experimental fluid dynamics and specifically,
digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV), to determine both the basic function
of a fish?s pectoral fins during station-holding in flow, a previously unstudied
behavior in ray-finned fishes, as well as the functional consequences of
variation in pectoral fin shape among species. These data in combination with
applied phylogenetic methods are then being used to quantitatively test the
hypothesis that pectoral fin shape diversity evolves in concert with habitat
diversity in the species rich radiation of North American freshwater fishes
called darters (Percidae: Etheostomatinae), a group that includes more than
fifteen endangered or threatened species. The results of the research are
broadly applicable to a wide variety of fields including bioinformatics and
fluid dynamics as well as evolutionary and conservation biology. In Dr. Lauder?s
lab, the Fellow will receive training in biomechanics and fluid dynamics that
will supplement her graduate training in applied phylogenetics and evolutionary
biology.
