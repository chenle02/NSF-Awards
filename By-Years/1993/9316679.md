9316679 Sablik This award will support the travel of Dr. Martin J. Sablik of the
Instrumentation and Space Research Division of the Southwest Research Institute
in San Antonio, Texas, for a one month visit to Australia in order to conduct
collaborative research with Dr. Richard Langman at the University of Tasmania.
The focus of the research is to develop a new model for stress measurement. Dr.
Sablik will use his experience with magnetomechanical hysteresis modeling to
account for results obtained with the rotation method, a magnetic technique
originated by Dr. Langman for measuring stress in magnetic materials, in
particular in cases of biaxial stress. The project results are expected to be
useful for measuring stresses in railroad wheels and for measuring stresses in
gas and oil pipelines. Such stress measurements would be most beneficial to
railroad and pipeline operators in helping to detect high stress situations
which might lead to rupture, and thereby enable timely remedial action to be
taken.
