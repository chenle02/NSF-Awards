To set up a group of related laboratories designed to demonstrate basic
physical principles and to show it is currently used in materials
characterization. The experiments are (1) Rutherford backscattering, (2) nuclear
reaction analysis and neutron activation analysis, (3) particle induces x-ray
emission and x-ray fluorescence, and (4) particle channeling. These funds will
allow students to enter a variety of fields of graduate study (including nuclear
physics, atomic physics, condensed matter physics) and to enter directly into
industrial or governmental laboratories where these techniques are rapidly being
adopted for materials characterization. Computerized data taking and analysis
will be emphasized.
