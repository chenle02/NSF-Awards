HBCU-UPâ€™s Research Initiation Awards provide support for STEM faculty to pursue
research activities to further their research capabilities and effectiveness and
help enhance research and teaching at HBCUs. This award to Clark Atlanta
University has the potential to advance topological data analysis that
significantly improve health outcomes, train undergraduate students in computer
programming and data science, and produce advanced technology education modules
for courses. This project is significant in that the results may have broad
applications to a number of fields and the work is necessary to advance the
potential of topological data analysis, which focuses on how spaces are
organized, structured, and connected. The project will train undergraduate HBCU
students in data science at the intersection of geometry and topology.

The project aims to produce results that will lead to the development of
practical mathematical tools to advance our understanding of persistent homology
by bolstering its connection to statistics and machine learning. Once these
tools exist, they may be applied to a diverse set of applications, including
economics, biology, medicine, politics, chemistry, and image analysis; thereby
increasing public engagement with mathematics. The research and educational
activities proposed in this project aim to provide opportunities for students
from minoritized groups to engage in multidisciplinary research and become
competitive, well-suited candidates for graduate school and ultimately, the
workforce. This project will positively contribute to and encourage the
retention of students from historically underrepresented groups in mathematical
sciences.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
