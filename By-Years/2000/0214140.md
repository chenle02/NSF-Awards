This project investigates the sources of the different experiences with regard
to unemployment rates of the various countries of Western Europe over the past
three decades. Its goal is to extend previous work in three directions: The
first is to extend previous reduced form estimation of the relation between
unemployment shocks, and institutions, across European countries by looking
separately at the effects on flows and on duration and unemployment and on
vacancies. The second is to look at the role of collective bargaining and union
attitudes in explaining both the general rise and later decline in unemployment
as well as differences across European countries. The third is to explore
further the role of labor market institutions by looking at the links between
institutions, average unemployment duration and the dynamic effects of shocks on
unemployment and to characterize the optimal set of labor market institutions in
the presence of incomplete insurance and ex-post wage bargaining.
