The objective of this project is to improve the undergraduate chemistry
laboratory program by incorporating new electrochemical experiences within the
existing framework of the laboratory courses. The project operation requires the
purchase of an electrochemical analyzer suitable for teaching, routine analysis,
and senior research applications. Increasingly complex laboratory utilization of
the instruments is planned as the students progress from organic chemistry to
instrumental analysis and physical chemistry and finally to senior research
applications. These laboratory experiences complement and supplement the
student's present laboratory experiences, which are centered around an array of
basic instrumentation and a few more sophisticated items.
