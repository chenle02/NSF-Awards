Assuring deadlines of embedded tasks for contemporary multicore architectures is
becoming increasingly difficult. Real-time scheduling relies on task migration
to exploit multicores, yet migration actually reduces timing predictability due
to cache warm-up overheads and increased interconnect traffic.

This work promotes a fundamentally new approach to increase the timing
predictability of multicore architectures aimed at task migration in embedded
environments making three major contributions:

1. The development of novel strategies to guide migration based on cost/benefit
tradeoffs exploiting both static and dynamic analyses.

2. The devising of mechanisms to increase timing predictability under task
migration providing explicit support for proactive and reactive real-time data
movement across cores and their caches.

3. The promotion of rate- and bandwidth-adaptive mechanisms as well as
monitoring capabilities to increase predictability under task migration.

The work aims at initiating a novel research direction investigating the
benefits of interactions between hardware and software for embedded multicores
with respect to timing predictability. This project fundamentally contributes to
the research and educational infrastructure for the design and development of
safety- and mission-critical embedded systems.
