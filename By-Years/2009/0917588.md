This project is designed to develop a 3D planetarium show and a TV documentary
to describe our Universe, Galaxy and Solar system. This is a significant project
for public and youth as they do not comprehend this aspect of their world with
clarity. New technology using a 3D film is anticipated to be attractive and
capture the audience's attention better than previous exhibits methodology. The
Detroit region has been selected for testing various aspects of the planning
project. The partners include the Detroit Science Center, the Detroit Public
School system, Dr. Mark Morris (Astronomer) at UCLA, the Cranbrook Institute of
Science, Detroit Public Television, and the Carnegie Science Center. Subsequent
dissemination of the results and techniques increases the potential for Nation-
wide impact.
