A Workshop on new developments and techniques in polarized gas targets and
polarized electron and ion sources will be held. Such devices are central to new
thrusts in nuclear and elementary particle physics, worldwide. This workshop is
part of a long series of meetings held roughly every 3-4 years, has been
sanctioned by IUPAP and will have strong international participation.
