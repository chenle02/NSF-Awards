This U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science award will support the collaboration of
Yaacov Shapira of Tufts University and N.F. Oliveira, Jr. and V. Bindilatti of
the University of Sao Paulo (USP), Brazil. The project aims to focus on magnetic
interactions in dilute magnetic semiconductors. These materials are ideal for
exploring the fundamental properties of these interactions. The researchers'
joint experiments will take advantage of the very low temperatures which are
being produced at USP using a new class of plastic dilution refrigerators. The
experiments at very high magnetic fields will be conducted in U.S. high-
magnetic-field facilities with which the Tufts group is affiliated. The goal of
these experiments will be to answer various basic questions, including how the
magnetic interactions fall off with distance. The U.S. side will benefit from
access to USP's new plastic dilution refrigerators and superconducting magnets.
The Brazilian side will acquire expertise in the use of magnetization steps to
determine exchange constants, as well as sources for the single crystals to be
used in these experiments.
