This award will provide partial support for a conference on the evolution of
massive stars. The conference will concentrate on the problem of eruptive events
in these stars, which often appear in surveys for supernovae even though they do
not represent the explosive end phase of a massive star.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will bring together astronomers, theorists
and observers, studying the final stages of massive star evolution, their
instabilities, supernovae and their progenitors, and the outcomes of the final
eruptions. The meeting will be structured to encourage discussion and
communication among the participants and to stimulate theoretical work and new
observations that will address many of these questions. For broader
dissemination, the organizers will post the review talks, posters and a
transcription of the discussion on the workshop web pages.
