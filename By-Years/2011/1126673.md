This award uses funds to acquire a MAT253 high-sensitivity stable isotope ratio
mass spectrometer, with a Kiel IV Carbonate Device, in order to analyze the
isotopic composition of carbonates. This award also supports the acquisition of
a Gas Bench II device to analyze carbonate, water, and gas
samples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The analytical instruments will be used for a
broad range of scientific research involving climate, coupled natural and human
systems, and water resources. Near-term research projects include climatology
from cave and lake deposits, studies of hurricanes, sea-level transgressions,
and isotope hydrology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts involve
establishing a state-of-the-art analytical facility at a primarily undergraduate
teaching institution where students may experience scientific research up close.
The acquisition also helps underwrite the research of two female early career
scientists.
