The objective of this Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industries
(GOALI) project is to advance the precision and functionality of computer
numerical control machining centers by developing a sensor fusion methodology
that integrates pre-process, on-machine, and post-process measurement and
analysis technologies. The developed sensor fusion methodology will be used to
measure part quality variations. Appropriate sampling techniques will be used in
data acquisition to reduce measurement uncertainties. Inspection analysis
techniques will be used to identify part quality degradation factors. Finally,
an adaptive technique will be developed to monitor and control the process of
precision machining. The research efforts will be performed in collaboration
with a national laboratory. The research can contribute toward the development
of smart machine technology. It synergizes the research efforts of the
institution and its collaborative partner.
