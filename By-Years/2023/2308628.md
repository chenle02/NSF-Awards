Certain vascularized tissues such as the outer blood retinal barrier are
difficult to study using animal models due to major physiological and anatomical
differences. Microphysiological systems (MPS), also known as tissue chips, are
an alternative to animal models that enable the study of complex tissue systems.
MPS can incorporate patient specific stem cells for personalized medicine and
are easily scalable for larger scale investigations. This project will support
the development of a new MPS that controls physical, biochemical, and cell
signaling cues to guide the development of microvascular tissues, including the
cues needed for forming perfusable blood vessels. It is expected that successful
completion of this work will provide a greater understanding of how physical,
biochemical, and cell signaling cues guide microvessel development and establish
an alternative to animal models for pre-clinical drug testing. This work will
support the training of junior scientists from diverse backgrounds and prepare
them for careers in research and education. The Investigators are proactive in
working to increase diversity and expose high school students to possible STEM
career opportunities. Further, findings that are made from this research will be
shared through numerous outreach activities and programs including: Teach the
Teachers, undergraduate and high school student mentorship, and speaking at
public engagements such as the Annual Benoit Laboratory Alex’s Lemonade Stand.

Advances in tissue engineering and tissue chip technology have catalyzed the
rise of microphysiological systems (MPS) as an alternative to animal models for
preclinical testing. MPS for vascularized tissues either forego perfused
microvasculature or rely on oversimplified endothelial cell-lined fluidic
channels. Microvascular tissues are 3D and have tissue specific molecular
transport, angioarchitectural, and paracrine-tissue crosstalk properties.
Engineered extracellular matrices (eECM) comprised of poly(ethylene glycol)
(PEG) hydrogels crosslinked with matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-degradable
peptides and functionalized with cell adhesive ligands have been shown to
support vasculogenesis. In this project, vasculogenic eECM will be introduced
into a novel MPS designed for microvascular network development. Specifically,
pressure/flow and eECM biophysical and biochemical cues will be explored to
guide the development of in vivo-like perfusable microvasculature specific to
bone, salivary gland, and the retina. Successful completion of the proposed aims
will elucidate the role of flow in microvascular development, advance the
development of MPSs, and augment our understanding of the eECM biochemical cues
that mediate endothelial cell vasculogenesis.
