This award to an organization called Women in Endocrinology provides funds to
help support travel to beginning women endocrinologists who are presenting their
work at the annual meetings of the Endocrine Society. By having a small but
stable base helping to defray travel costs for these young investigators, the
organization will increase the participation of women in the main annual event
in this field. It provides an excellent opportunity to enhance the human
resource infrastructure by increasing accessibility to a major scientific
meeting by young women, particularly from under-represented groups, to establish
important professional contacts, and the emphasis is on supporting young
researchers, rather than clinicians, in line with NSF's mission of supporting
basic research. The organizers have planned to use the NSF contribution to
leverage increasing matching funds from other sources for future years. This
award will have a substantial impact on the career development of the many young
women who receive the assistance, to become known as active basic researchers in
this important and growing field.
