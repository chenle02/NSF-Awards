The goal of this research is to continue the development of a mathematical
theory for the analysis and control of discrete event systems (DESs). DESs arise
in a variety of areas of practical application, including, for example, multi-
robot systems, manufacturing systems, data bases, distributed computing,
distributed and hierarchical optimization, queuing systems, mixed variable
control systems, and the higher level intelligent control of complex processes.
A number of proposals have been made for modeling and studying the various
aspects of DESs of interest. The recent work on the control of logical DESs has
contributed to our understanding of some of the fundamental issues involved in
the analysis of DESs. Other approaches, particularly perturbation methods and
likelihood ratio methods have had considerable impact on the analysis,
simulation and optimization of stochastic DES models. The main thrust of the
proposed research is to extend these two approaches by addressing issues such as
real-time constraints, algorithmic complexity, aggregated models, mixed variable
systems, and stochastic optimization using perturbation analysis and likelihood
ratio derivative estimates. The relationship between current models will also be
investigated with the aim of unifying the tools available for the study of
discrete- event systems.
