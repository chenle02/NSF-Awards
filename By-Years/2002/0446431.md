Globins, the well characterized family of oxygen-binding proteins from animals
and plants, were discovered also to be in bacteria by Warburg in the 1930s.
Recent findings from the PI's lab now extend the distribution of these proteins
to include the third domain of life, the Archaea. This project will focus on the
function of two globin-like proteins, one from a bacterium and another from an
archaeon. The work will analyze how these proteins sense and relay signals about
oxygen levels in the environment in a manner such that cells can move towards
oxygen concentrations ideal for their metabolism. The aim is to determine how
the interaction of these proteins with oxygen transmits a signal to the
intracellular machinery responsible for positioning the cell in environments
with appropriate oxygen concentrations. Two hypotheses will be tested. One
proposes that binding of oxygen to the protein induces conformational changes
that are important in transmitting signals relating to oxygen concentrations in
the environment. The second follows up the observation that, in the case of the
archaeal globin, oxygen binding leads to the addition of methyl groups to the
protein. A potential role for the methylated protein in adaptation to new
ambient oxygen concentrations will be investigated. The project will adapt
aspects of the research for use as a microbial signal transduction laboratory
module for undergraduates: "Globin-Coupled Sensors as probes for understanding
relationships between structure, function, and evolution for oxygen-sensing in
Bacteria and Archaea." Overall, this project pulls together resources and
methods from bioinformatics, genetics, biophysics, biochemistry, and physiology
to answer key questions about signal transduction of the globin-coupled sensors.
An improved understanding of the globin-coupled sensors promises advances not
only in controlling the interactions of oxygen with sensing and signaling
domains, but also may serve as models for biological functions, including
protection from nitrosative and oxidative stress.
