How spatially-mapped information (in the brain) can be transformed into
temporally ordered patterns of movement is the long term objective of the
research program headed up by Dr. David Ingle. To achieve this end he is
currently using amphibians and doing detailed kinematic analysis of components
of feeding and avoidance behaviors. He will undertake new anatomical studies of
the presumed neural substrate of these behaviors. Through an analysis of
behavioral deficits produced by lesions of certain brain structures he can test
current hypotheses as to how particular components of prey-catching and
avoidance behaviors are related to components of specific brain neural
projections. This work is important because Dr. Ingle is working on the lower
brainstem of vertebrates and little analysis is available regarding these neural
circuits and their relationship to directed movements. The analysis of sensory
control of orienting behaviors in vertebrates is the expertise of Dr. Ingle and
the work to be performed should greatly increase our knowledge in this field.
