The Department of Physics at Miami University, in cooperation with Central
States Universities, Inc. and Argonne National Laboratory, is conducting one-
week and two-day workshops for 20 physics teachers from two- and four-year
institutions. Aimed at sharing ideas on how to teach undergraduate laboratories,
the workshops focus on the Contemporary Physics Laboratory and the Electronic
Instrumentation Laboratory at Miami University, which emphasize revolutions in
physics and electronics in the lifetime of today's undergraduate students.
