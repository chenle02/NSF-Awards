The oceanographic instrumentation program supports requests to acquire
instrumentation for the collection, processing and analysis of oceanographic
data. This proposal from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution requests funding
for acquisition of a hybrid QQ quadrupole tail that will convert an existing
High Resolution Mass Spectrometer into a state-of-the-art Magnetic Sector Mass
Spectrometer (MS-MS). The entire facility will be available for shared-use by
the oceanographic research community and will support the research efforts of
many NSF-funded scientists. The quadrupole extension adds the capability of
obtaining structural elucidation of high molecular weight macromolecules. The
PIs are particularly interested in analyzing high-molecular- weight, marine
organic materials, such as the products of chlorophyll decomposition and
structural variations of kerogens and polysaccarides.
