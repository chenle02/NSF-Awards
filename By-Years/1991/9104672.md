This research addresses the mobility of closed loop planar and spherical
linkages. Its intent is to establish a basic theory and foundation to identify
and classify link mobility and joint rotatability of single closed loop N-bar
planar and spherical linkages, and therefore provide a better understanding of
the potential uses and limitations of a linkage or manipulator. The results are
applicable to some spatial linkages directly and to multiple loop linkages. They
may also provide a geometric tool or model to understand the dexterity and
geometric constraints placed on a manipulator when a temporary closed loop chain
is formed.***
