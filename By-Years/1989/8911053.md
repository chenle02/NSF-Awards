It is hypothesized that the low vorticity environment of a warm core ring can
trap inertial wave energy, providing locally increased finescale shear. This is
supported by recent observations of enhanced inertial wave energy and elevated
levels of mixing in warm rings. In this project, the P.I.'s will deploy several
different types of fine and microstructure instruments is a warm core ring, in
order to test these hypothesis, and to measure the mixing properties in regions
of high geostrophic shear.
