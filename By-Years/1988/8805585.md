This project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program concerns the
development and application of methods for approximate computation of coupled
vibrational motions of nuclei in molecules. Applications will include studies of
van der Waals molecule dissociation, intramolecular vibrational relaxation,
isomerization reactions, and vibrational eigenvalue studies. Particular emphasis
will be placed on development of mean-field techniques expressed in optimized
general coordinates. Such a treatment will allow for consideration of more
complex chemical systems than are currently accessible by exact quantum
techniques.
