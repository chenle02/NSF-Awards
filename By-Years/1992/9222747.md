&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Michael Kucher, under the direction of Drs. David
Hounshell and Lawrence Duggan, is examining an engineering community and its
work in one city -- Siena, Italy. He is using an ecological and hydrological
perspective to frame a multi-faceted discussion of urban uses of water and their
impact upon the "built" and natural environments. He is further attempting to
assess the formation of an engineering community responsible for building this
infrastructure, the sources of its technical knowledge, and the training of its
members. This requires focussing upon the engineering community's role in design
and construction of a state-of-the-art system for the supply and distribution of
water during a period of rapid demographic and economic expansion. He is also
examining how the technological innovations developed in this context were
diffused to other cities in the region and across Europe. This study promises
significant contributions to our understanding of the development of cities,
large-scale technological systems, and the diffusion of technical knowledge
across cultural frontiers.
