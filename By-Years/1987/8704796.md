Narrative: Physical and chemical aerosol characterization equipment is being
purchased to conduct research in the following five areas: A) detection of
temperature and composition of micron-size droplets B) chemical identification
of aerosol droplets by Raman scattering C) heterogeneous nucleation and
adsorption on spherical particles D) aerosol dynamics E) new particle formation
via gas-phase reaction The principal investigators are qualified to use this
characterization equipment for the stated purpose.
