As computing devices continue to be embedded in more and more physical devices,
they are now privy to the most confidential information about our lives. The
ability to safely keep a secret in memory is central to the vast majority of
security systems, but storing and erasing these secrets is a difficult problem
in the face of an attacker who can obtain unrestricted physical access to these
devices and the underlying hardware. Depending on the memory technology, the
very act of storing a 1 instead of a 0 can have physical side effects measurable
even after the power has been cut. Through the development of a new class of
architectures that measurably increase the difficulty of physical analysis this
project is enabling systems that can be trusted even when physical control of
the system is ceded to an adversary. Initial results indicate that the creation
of an efficient scheme for memory protection is possible under which, even if an
adversary is able to inspect the value of a stored bit with a probabilistic
error of only 5%, the system will be able to prevent that adversary from
learning any information about the original un-coded bits with 99.9999999999%
probability. Over the long term this research will help to create the skills and
tools that cyber-physical system engineers will need to develop pervasive
trustworthy systems, and to ease the development of those mission critical
systems that we all depend on for our safety and livelihood.
