This Science in Developing Countries Award will support participation in the
International College in Biophysics to be held in the International Center for
Theoretical Physics, September 1992 in Trieste, Italy. The meeting will cover
methods and experimental techniques in molecular biophysics, spectroscopy, x-ray
crystallography and theoretical and computational methods in selected
biophysical problems. The U.S. organizer for this meeting is Dr. Horacio Farach
of the University of South Carolina. Participation will be extended to 6 U.S.
lecturers and 8 researchers from Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, and
Venezuela. The International Center for Theoretical Physics in Trieste was
established to advance research in developing countries. It supports research
activities in high energy and solid state physics, it provides a range of
advanced courses and conferences, and offers a full program of visits in all
branches of physics and applied mathematics. By getting together scientists from
developing countries to exchange information on current research in biophysics,
this award will serve to advance the goals of the Science in Developing
Countries program.
