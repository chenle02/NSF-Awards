Railroad cars are large, heavy structures which are generally designed with very
large safety factors. It is difficult, using classical analysis techniques, to
obtain accurate estimates of the loads experienced by the car and of the stress
levels and fatigue life of the various components of the car. However, it is now
possible to overcome these difficulties with the use of modern computer-aided
engineering techniques such as finite element analysis and rigid body-based
vehicle dynamic response analysis. If the loads and stress levels are more
accurately known, it would be possible to design railroad cars with lower safety
factors. This would result in lighter weight cars which are more economical to
build and operate. This research addresses the issues of (1) obtaining the loads
on the railcar body from the dynamic response of the vehicle assembly to the
random irregularities in the track, (2) developing finite element analysis
techniques to accurately model and analyze the railroad car, incorporating the
dynamic loads on the car, and (3) developing methods to utilize the results of
the finite element analysis to more accurately estimate the fatigue life of the
railroad car.
