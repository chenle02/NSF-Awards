Histones, abundant DNA packaging molecules, have recently been shown to possess
antimicrobial activity in numerous vertebrates including humans. This activity
has not been demonstrated in invertebrates where innate immunity is the sole
system for antimicrobial defense. This project focuses on the fundamental
mechanisms, at the cellular and molecular levels, of the innate immune system of
the Pacific white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei. More specifically, the role of
histones as potential antimicrobial defense molecules in shrimp will be
investigated. The goals of the project are to determine the distribution and
molecular structures of histone proteins in shrimp tissues and to measure their
spectrum of activity against a variety of microbes. In addition, the
distribution and expression levels of histones will be examined in response to
bacterial and viral infection. State-of-the-art technology in protein structure
determination and tissue imaging will be used. It is expected that important new
information will be obtained on the regulation and mechanisms of innate defense
systems of shrimp. The broader scientific implications of the work include a
greater understanding of the innate defense systems in other species, including
vertebrate species, as well as an increased understanding of the multiple roles
of histones in animal physiology. This project will significantly contribute to
the NSF-supported Marine Genomics Initiative in South Carolina and to the
education of graduate and undergraduate students in the Marine Biomedicine
Program.
