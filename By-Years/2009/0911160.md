The Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program supports Professor Hao Chen of Ohio
University in studies targeting improved insight into the mechanisms of ion/ion
reactions important for characterizing a wide range of molecules, including
proteins. The approach entails structural analysis of neutral and ionic products
of gaseous ion/ion reactions at atmospheric pressure. Ionic products are
directly analyzed by mass spectrometry; neutral products are re-ionized using
on-line extractive electrospray ionization (EESI) prior to mass analysis.
Additionally, "soft landing" is used to collect both neutral and ionic reaction
products for further structural elucidation. Derived insights may potentially
impact disciplines such as proteomics and synthetic organic chemistry.

The work provides research opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate
students, including members of underrepresented and disadvantaged groups. Dr.
Chen is also actively involved in educational outreach activities, including
workshops/seminars for pre-college students to learn about modern instrumental
analysis and to develop enthusiasm for scientific research.
