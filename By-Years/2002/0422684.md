DaSilva&lt;br/&gt;0422684&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to
metabolically engineer yeast cells for the adsorption of heavy metal arsenic.
The idea is to manipulate the transporter genes for both import and export of
the ionic form of the heavy metal, as well as manipulating the reduction system
inside the cell. The proposed work will also utilize an integration system that
the co-principal investigator has developed in her laboratory. This integration
method allows the sequential integration of multiple cloned genes. Advantages of
this system include the ability to insert precise numbers of the same or
different genes (important for metabolic engineering) and integration at
dispersed chromosomal locations, improving the stability of the insertions. The
initial cloning effort will allow for some characterization for subsequent
development of optimal strains for hyper accumulation of arsenic. &lt;br/&gt;
