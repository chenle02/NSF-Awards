Using the Cornell University Portable Radar Interferometer (CUPRI), the
investigator studies plasma instabilities in the equatorial electrojet,
equatorial spread-F, mid-latitude sporadic-E, and mid-latitude spread-F areas.
Having acquired data from recent campaigns for the first three regions, the
investigator will continue to examine their features. For instance, the Doppler
shift of type-I waves observed at vertical incidence decreases with height...if
the shift were only dependent on the acoustic speed, we'd expect an increase
with height. The investigator questions the regularity of these features, and
will examine other days for these effects and relevant theories. Students also
continue to benefit from experimenting with CUPRI operations, data analysis, and
data interpretation, making this program both effective and attractive to
international participation.
