The study will attempt to apply a new analytical technique, laser ablation of
solids coupled with mass spectroscopy to obtain high- resolution chemical
profiles of clam shells ans carbonate minerals associated with venting to
establish chemical composition changes with time. This should improve our
knowledge of the temporal changes in flow characteristics and will eventually
help evaluate the effect of fluid venting at convergent plate boundaries on the
general geochemical budget of the oceans.
