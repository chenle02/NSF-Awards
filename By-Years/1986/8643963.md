National Public Radio (NPR) has been provided with a supplementary award of
$10,000 to cover the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)
annual meeting. The funds cover travel, housing and meals for staff and free-
lance science reporters for a week of reporting. And also includes meeting with
NPR's advisory panel. An additional $3,000 has been raised from private sources
to cover total costs. The AAAS meeting is the largest interdisciplinary science
meeting in the world. Support of this project will result in more extensive and
thorough coverage of the meetings by NPR for inclusion on prime-time slots of
"ALL THINGS CONSIDERED" and "MORNING EDITION." It will also allow the science
reporting team to evaluate coverage to date and explore additional methods and
reporting techniques to enhance and expand the science programming on NPR.
