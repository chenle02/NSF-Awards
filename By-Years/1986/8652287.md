Based on accumulating evidence of instructional effectiveness from research in
small individual studies and the clear potential of new technological
developments, many national boards and commissions have recently recommended
exploring the use of technology to improve American education. This proposal
aims to assist state and federal agencies concerned with educational
improvements to evaluate the potential of technology to influence directly the
solution of problems of American education, using large scale demonstration in
typical educational settings. A planning framework will be developed to assist
in the selection of suitable demonstrations. Some model demonstrations that meet
the criteria of the planning framework will be roughed out. These rough designs
will be reviewed by educational policy makers, experts, and industry and
foundation officials at an invited conference. This activity aims at identifying
applications of technology that can make a prima facie difference in American
education. A report of the conference will include a discussion of the planning
framework, and a description and critique of the model demonstrations.
