9317414 Herrick This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and
Facilities Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of
Oregon-Eugene in the purchase of an upgrade of its existing x-ray
diffractometer. This equipment upgrade will enhance research in a number of
areas. Among these projects are those which describe structural studies of
organic molecules of biological relevance, inorganic complexes pertinent as
models for magnetic materials and catalysts, and solid state inorganic materials
of technological interest. In addition to serving researchers within the
Chemistry Department, an upgraded instrument will enjoy increased use by the
entire regional science community. %%% The x-ray diffractometer is used to make
accurate and precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a
molecule. The information obtained gives the precise values of all the bond
distances and bond angles of a given molecule and it gives accurate information
about the spatial arrangement of that molecule relative to the neighboring
molecules. ***
