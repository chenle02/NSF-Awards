This research is focussed on the development of a reactor system with semi-
permeable walls that will permit both reaction and selective separation to occur
simultaneously. The advantage of such a system for equilibrium-bound chemistries
is obvious. The research plan involves the development of a technique for
coating the porous ceramic walls of a reactor with a suitable diffusion
promoter, palladium, measurement of transport properties, and modelling studies
of the unique reactor combined with a demonstration reaction of significance.
Specifically, project is aimed at developing palladium/porous ceramic oxide
composites for the economical separation of hydrogen from high temperature gas
mixtures. Particular applications envisioned include in situ removal of hydrogen
from reactive mixtures in which there is normally an equilibrium limitation on
conversion. This will be demonstrated in experiments in which catalytic steam
reforming of methane will be undertaken in a tubular reactor with a Pd/ceramic
composite wall. In addition to the development of a practical means of
supporting thin Pd films on porous substrate, and demonstrating their
applications to reaction- separation coupling, the study will examine rigorously
the mechanism of hydrogen transport across such films, and determine at what
temperatures, pressures, and film thicknesses the process is controlled by
hydrogen dissociation/re-association, versus interstitial diffusion of hydrogen
atoms.
