The aim of this research is to determine the three-dimensional structure of the
native intact eukaryotic flagellum and of the major components participating in
its motion. This will be done by reconstruction from low dose electron
micrographs of hydrated, unfixed, unstained, unshadowed, intact flagella,
trapped in their native state by ultra-rapid freezing in thin layers of
amorphous ice. Many of the movements and rearrangements that occur within cells
utlize microtubule-based motors. Imprtant examples include the movement of
chromosomes during cell division, and the transport of materials from the cell
body of neurons to their distant termini. Little is known of the mechanism of
any microtubule-based motile process, even in the case of its most highly
organized manifestation, eukaryotic flagella. At present, the structure of these
microtubule based motors is not known well enough to suport hypotheses about
possible mechanisms. This research will greatly extend our knowledge of ciliary
and flagellar structure and provide an insight into the mechanisms of their
movement, as well as the structural basis for other microtubule dependent
movement such as chromosome separation and vesicle transport in nerve.
