This award will provide two-thirds of the funding needed to acquire a high-
speed graphics workstation to be installed in the Department of Geological
Sciences at the State University of New York at Binghamton. SUNY-Binghamton is
committed to providing the remaining funds necessary to acquire the equipment.
The graphics workstation is needed to provide graphics capability and data
storage capacity for a number of seismological studies involving seismogram
synthesis and inverse theory in waveform modeling of body and surface waves for
earthquake and explosion sources and crustal structure determinations.
