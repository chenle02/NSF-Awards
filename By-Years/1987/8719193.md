Description: This project supports the travel of four senior U.S. scientists in
a workshop and symposium on aspects of many-body effects in molecules and
extending systems, to be held in Calcutta, India, February 10, 1988. The number
of scientists who specialize in many-body theory are few, and they are dependent
on Conferences, workshops and symposia to communicate with each other. This
meeting is the first in India where some of the best theoretical work in these
fields is currently being done. Topics to be covered will include molecular
electronic structure, formal aspects of many-body theory, many-body approach to
extended systems and to electro-kinetic phenomena. Scope: The meeting is hosted
by the Indian Association for the cultivation of Science, and will include
scientists from Japan and from Europe in addition to the U.S. and from India and
could lead to future scientific collaboration in this important field which has
applications in chemistry, molecular physics, solid-state and nuclear physics.
