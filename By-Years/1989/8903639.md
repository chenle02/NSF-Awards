Eukaryotic ribosome formation entails coordinate synthesis of a least 80
different macromolecules, all of which assemble into ribonucleoprotein complexes
by a process that begins in the nucleus and concludes in the cytoplasm.
Heretofore, cis and trans-acting promoter elements common to most yeast
ribosomal protein (rp) genes appeared responsible for coordinate synthesis of
yeast ribosomal protein. Dr. Fried and co-workers discovered that rp-gene TCM1
is transcribed by promoter elements unlike those of other rp- genes. An
additional trans-acting factor, p82, interacted with TCM1 and a rp-gene of the
other type. The function of TCM1-specific factors in transcriptional regulation
of TCM1 and the participation of those in expression of other (rp-) genes will
be determined. Likewise the role of p82 in mediating coordinate regulation
between the two types of rp- genes will be studied. These objectives will be
accomplished by purifying the various transcription factors and cloning their
respective genes. Currently it is unknown what causes ribosomal proteins to
enter the nucleus or how ribosomal subunits are subsequently exported out of the
nucleus. The PI has deduced segments of yeast ribosomal protein L29 that promote
nuclear accumulation. Using in vitro biochemical assays, he will determine
whether nuclear entry of L29 is a receptor mediated process, if the L29 nuclear
accumulation segments are ligands for the receptor, and if these segments are
distinct from domains of L29 that bind ribosomal RNA. Also, comparative studies
will be conducted with mouse rp L27', which function in place of L29 in yeast,
albeit less efficiently. Finally, biochemical requirements for export of
ribosomal subunits will be determined in an in vivo microinjection assay.
