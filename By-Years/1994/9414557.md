9414557 Lu This proposal addresses the design and fabrication of polarization
and phase sensitive normal incidence multiple quantum well light modulator
array. The device is based on the anisotropic excitonic and concomitant light
polarization rotation to achieve high contrast ratios. The anisotropic excitonic
absorption and birefringence are created by the in-plane anisotropic strain in
multiple quantum well structures. The modulator utilizes the quantum confined
stark effect (QCSE) to electrically tune the phase retardation and polarization
rotation. This proposal represents a two-year collaboration project between the
Microelectronics Research Laboratory (MERL) at Rutgers University and the
Electronics and Power Sources Directorate (EPSD) of the Army Research
Laboratory. We Have been working closely at the preliminary stage of the
project, and have demonstrated the single modulator device based on electrically
tunable polarization rotation and phase retardation in uniaxially strained (100)
MQW, which exhibits an exceedingly high contrast ratio of 5000:1. The proposed
work will further develop the modulator array (at least 4x4) to demonstrate its
capability as a spatial light modulator. The work at Rutgers will focus on
processing development, structural characterization, and theoretical modeling.
In addition, a graduate student from Rutgers will spend a majority of his time
at EPSD, performing the optical studies for this project. The National Science
Foundation's support will greatly enhance our joint efforts in this area. ***
