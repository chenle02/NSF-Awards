This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on
commercializing dip-stick tests for detection of heavy metals (lead, uranium,
copper, mercury) in water, where the appearance of a red line on the test strip
will indicate the presence of a contaminant. Heavy metal contamination in water
poses a serious health concern and their easy detection is essential for fast
and effective removal. Currently established detection methods use
sophisticated, expensive instrumentation and skilled operators. There exists the
need for spot test kits for low cost, real time and on-site detection for wide
range of contaminants. ANDalyze proposes to make highly sensitive and specific
dip-stick tests using recent advances in biotechnology and nanotechnology. A
special class of metal-specific DNA sequences, called DNAzymes will be
functionalized with gold nanoparticles and dried on lateral flow devices (test
strips) to make dip-stick sensors for heavy metals, similar in format to the
home pregnancy test kits. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this
research is that these dip-stick tests are an ideal solution for easy, on-site
water quality testing in homes, schools, hospitals and industries, instead of
sending water samples to analytical labs where it can often take more than 2
weeks to get back results. This provides a significant advantage to a user who
can start any remediation process sooner upon detection of contaminants, thereby
reducing their adverse impacts. These tests are particularly valuable in
developing countries where access to instrumentation or money for sophisticated
analytical tests may be limited.
