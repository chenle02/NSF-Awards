"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor David Statman of Allegheny
College is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the
Division of Chemistry to study the interactions between azo dyes, nematic liquid
crystals, and polymer surfaces that lead to surface director gliding, and affect
bulk reorientation. Photoinduced reorientation and surface gliding will be
measured using various pump-probe techniques. The goal is to enhance our
understanding of how photoexcitation of the dye facilitates reorientation of the
easy axis at polymer surfaces. It is anticipated that this research may lead to
new technologies based on liquid crystal materials. The educational activities
include training of undergraduate students at Allegheny College, and exposing
them to an international research experience at the Research Institute for Solid
State Physics and Optics of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.
