Society&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Biological Materials Science
Symposium&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT: This is the eighth in an
ongoing annual series focused on providing a forum for sharing and discussing
the latest advances in biological materials science and engineering. Topics of
interest for the series of symposia include the primacy of biological materials
to the development of biomaterials and biomimetic materials, novel applications,
and understanding the complex structure-property relationships of these
materials. This year the symposium will encompass the following themes:
biological materials (tissues, cells, etc.), biomaterials (implants), biomimetic
materials, bio-enabled materials and systems, and bio-based applications.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS: The symposium provides a forum in which
materials scientists working in the areas biological materials, biomaterials,
and biomimetic materials can report on recent advances in the field. The funds
requested from NSF will support the attendance of students and young faculty who
will make presentations at the Symposium. Travel awards will be made to
attendees from this group on the basis of abstracts submitted prior to the
symposium.
