This project consists of a combined laboratory-modeling approach to identifying
missing biogenic volatile compounds (BVOC) emitted into the atmosphere by plant
and biological material. Research into the influence of microbes on BVOC
emissions is a particularly innovative aspect of this project. Information on
missing BVOC emissions will be integrated into a new version of the Model of
Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN3)
Model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four scientific questions are addressed by this
study: (1) Can BVOC emissions induced by extreme weather and pollution stress
influence atmospheric distributions of aerosol and oxidants? (2) Do microbes
living on leaf surfaces regulate BVOC emissions into the atmosphere and modify
their impact on ozone and aerosol? (3) Do missing BVOC compounds contribute to
the total production of aerosol and ozone? (4) How sensitive are model
predictions of air quality and climate to feedbacks associated with missing BVOC
and unrepresented emission processes? The expected outcomes of this research
include a quantitative understanding of the role of BVOC in atmospheric
chemistry, improved air quality and climate predictions, and more effective
strategies to optimize land-use, air quality, and climate management.
