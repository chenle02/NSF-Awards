Diamond films and diamond-like films have in recent years been processed in a
variety of ways, from complex low pressure chemical vapor deposition chambers to
rather more direct thermal plasma techniques. The latter, while apparently
simpler in principle, is, in fact, not readily understood nor optimized. It is
important to note that the diamond films in question have attributes which make
them exceptionally attractive for applications ranging from hard tool surfaces
to microelectronics. The University and an industrial partner will cooperate to
develop processing programs using advanced thermal plasma spray technology to
form such diamond films having industrial utility. The project will produce a
unique thermal plasma system, operating at a relatively low power level (20 KW
and below) and processing methane and hydrogen gases.
