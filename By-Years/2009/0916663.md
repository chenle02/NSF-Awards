As the computing capacity increases rapidly in large-scale cluster computing
platforms, power management becomes an increasingly important concern. This
project focuses on the research of reducing disk and memory power consumption
through energy-aware cooperative caching in cluster-based storage systems. The
project leverages I/O characteristics of scientific applications and dynamic
power management features of disk drives and memory chips to reduce I/O energy
consumption. This project involves three components: (1) investigate program
context based pattern detection to predict I/O activities in the operating
systems, (2) investigate disk energy aware cooperative cache management schemes,
and (3) prototype the management schemes and incorporate into cluster-based file
systems. This project has broader impact through its contributions to the
energy-aware computing, graduate education, and undergraduate education via an
existing NSF-REU site award.
