The neostriatum is a brain region integrally involved in body movement.
Advances in neostriatal research have revealed much about its complex neural
inputs and intrinsic organization, including the identification and localization
of chemical messengers that activate or inhibit other neurons. The molecular
events in neostriatal cells which process the effects of the chemical messengers
are poorly understood, but are important to understand how these cells convey
information. One of these fundamental cellular processes--called signal
transduction of chemical messengers--uses a class of proteins, GTP-binding
proteins, to mediate and direct the flow of information by chemical messengers.
The overall objective of this study is to examine the cellular localization,
regulation and action of specific GTP-binding, transducing proteins in the rat
neostriatum. Investigating where signal transducing proteins are localized
subcellulary in neostriatal neurons, how these proteins are activated, and what
intraneuronal processes they affect should advance the knowledge of cellular
mechanisms involved in neuronal targeting of information in the neostriatum.
