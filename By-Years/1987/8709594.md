The aim of the proposed work is to determine the optimum conditions required to
maintain and grow adult cardiac muscle cells in serum-free long term culture.
This study will formulate an effective, serum-free, chemically defined growth
medium, using different growth factors, hormones, and chemicals for vigorous
cell proliferation and continued survival. The effects of growth conditions on
DNA synthesis, DNA polymerase and thymidine kinase activities will be evaluated
in these myocyte cultures. Biochemical and immunological studies will be done in
order to identify and characterize myosin isoforms in these cells, and electron
microscopy will be carried out to monitor cell fine structure during long term
cell culture. Studies of adult cardiac cell biology have been hampered by the
absence of a long term cell culture system, so that one immediate benefit of the
work proposed will be the establishment of such a system. The long term
significance will be an increased knowledge of the cell biology, physiology, and
pharmacology of cardiac myocytes.
