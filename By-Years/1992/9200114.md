A REU site for the Chemical Engineering Department of the University of
Pittsburgh is planned with considerable interchange between participants,
faculty and graduate students both on a formal and informal basis. To provide a
driving force for continued contact between students and faculty each student
will submit their work for oral presentation at the following spring chemical
engineering regional student paper contest. The goal of this REU program is to
provide information, education, enthusiasm and encouragement to a group of the
next generation's leaders in science.
