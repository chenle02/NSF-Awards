This project has developed the concept of using a supported liquid membrane
(SLM) in an electrochemical cell. A supported liquid membrane consists of an
organic ion complexing agent and a suitable modifier, forming a solution
substantially insoluble in aqueous electrolyte, infused into a hydrophobic
microporous polymer support and held in by strong surface tension forces. The
ability to provide specific ion transport and low resistivity at high current
densities makes the SLM a candidate for a new generation of superior
electrochemical separators with a wide variety of industrial applications in
electrowinning of metals, electrosynthesis, and the generation and storage of
electrochemcial energy. This effort combines further development of SLMs as
separators with a strong research effort directed at better understanding the
mechanism of electrotransport in SLMs and the factors necessary to provide high
specific ionic conductivity to liquid organic phase. This new understanding will
aid in choosing SLM compositions suitable for direct electrowinning of pure
nickel and cobalt from solutions containing both ions.
