The Combustion Institute holds biennial international meetings to present the
latest experimental and theoretical research results across the spectrum of
combustion science and engineering. The 1990 meeting is to be held in Orleans,
France, and is expected to attract around 1000 participants and produce 200
carefully screened original and invited review papers. Funds are being provided
to help offset the costs of publishing the bound proceedings.
