9603118 Knapp Attempts to restore ecosystems to a more or less "natural state"
following agricultural use have usually fallen short of their goals. Although
some attributes of natural ecosystems can be restored quickly, often times
critical differences in the structure or function of natural and restored
ecosystems persist for long periods. For example, native plant species richness
and diversity in restored ecosystems is usually much lower than in comparable
undisturbed ecosystems, and may take decades or longer to approach undisturbed
ecosystem levels. This is particularly true for tallgrass prairie ecosystem.
Although establishment of the dominant grasses in tallgrass prairie restoration
efforts usually has been successful, it has been more difficult to restore the
less common grasses and forbs that provide much of the species richness and
diversity in these grasslands. Our research focuses on the role that
heterogeneity of soil resources may play in grassland restoration efforts. Most
grassland restoration efforts occur on former agricultural fields, where soil
resources have been homogenized. In contrast, most natural communities are
characterized by a high degree of spatial heterogeneity in resources, which is
assumed to enhance plant species diversity. We contend that the problem of low
plant species diversity that plagues most restoration effort is due to the slow
conversion of an ecosystem from a state of relatively uniform resource
availability to one with a more spatially heterogeneous pattern of resource
availability. Our research will test the hypotheses that recovery of plant
species richness, diversity and community heterogeneity will occur more rapidly
during the restoration process if greater resource heterogeneity is impose on
the system from the beginning.
