Watkins The investigator studies improved algorithms that are suitable for high-
performance parallel computing for solving eigenvalue and invariant subspace
problems. New parallelizable formulations of the QR algorithm are investigated
through both numerical experiments and theoretical analysis. New shift
strategies that allow many iterations to proceed at once are implemented, and
the process of propagation of shifts in iterations of the QR algorithm is
studied in detail. An additional aim is to study the relationships between
various eigensystem algorithms, the related areas of classical real analysis and
approximation theory, and applications in signal processing and control. The
point of this activity is to clarify and unify the theory. Eigensystem
computations --- the calculation of eigenvalues and invariant subspaces of
matrices --- lie at the heart of numerous problems in diverse areas, including
vibrations and stability of structures (buildings, bridges, aircraft, etc.),
control systems of all types (robots, factories, automobiles, aircraft), and
signal processing (communications, seismic oil exploration). It is therefore
vital to have at hand a variety of reliable, efficient methods for computing
eigensystems. The aim of this project is to study and develop new computational
methods for analyzing eigensystems. The high-performance computers of today and
the near future are organized very differently from older computers and require
that new methods be devised and old methods be reorganized to make efficient use
of the processing power of the new machines. The investigator studies and
develops suitable methods. An additional aim is to organize and unify the theory
behind eigensystem computations for the benefit of the computational scientists
and engineers of tomorrow.
