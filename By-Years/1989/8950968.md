The purchase of a 60 MHz NMR allowed the implementation of the development plan
which introduces the routine use of NMR spectroscopy over a broad combination;
of courses. The development plan has two objectives. First, the instrument gives
students a practical familiarity of NMR in its traditional analytical
applications. Second, the instrument is used to teach fundamental concepts of
spectroscopy, strucutre determination, thermodynamics, kinetics, structural
isomerism, magnetic properties and exchange mechanisms in experiments where NMR
spectroscopy provides the best means of obtaining experimental data. These
objectives are implemented by a program of experiments introduced into courses
of organic chemistry, physical chemistry, chemical instrumentation, advanced
organic chemistry and advanced inorganic chemistry as well as use in
undergraduate research projects. The project is designed to provide students
with a solid understanding of NMR theory and practice, while providing improved
ability to investigate many important chemical phenomena. The institution is
matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
