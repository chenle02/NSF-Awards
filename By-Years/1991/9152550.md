A 60 MHz FT-NMR spectrometer will be used in laboratory courses and for
undergraduate student research, including the summer research program. The
organic chemistry laboratories will see four new experiments and three revised
ones that deal with regiochemistry and stereochemistry of reactions and with the
identification of unknowns. New experiments in physical chemistry will deal with
the effect of solvent on equilibrium constants and the effects of
electronegativity on chemical shift. The instrumental methods experiment will
use NMR to determine the molecular weight of samples. Instruction in FT
methodology will occur in several classes. Undergraduate research students will
pursue projects in organic synthesis and catalytic chemistry that were not
available before. The grantee will match the NSF award from non-Federal sources.
