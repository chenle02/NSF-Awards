In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Subprogram of the
Physical Chemistry Program, Yip will investigate the molecular structure and
dynamics of liquids and solids in various stages of vitrification and
amorphization. Time correlation functions of local density, momentum, energy,
and stress will be studied and combined with thermodynamic, structural,
transport, and viscoelastic properties to provide a unified molecular
description of glassy states of matter. Molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo
simulations will be carried out to study model systems of liquids and crystals
composed of one and two atomic species which have been perturbed under well-
characterized thermal, stress, or irradiation environments. The simulation
results will be used to test current theories, elucidate and correlate different
types of experimental data, and motivate new theoretical descriptions of
supercooled liquids and amorphized solids. Of particular interest is a
temperature region in supercooling which is distinctly above the conventional
glass transition point and where a dynamical crossover apparently occurs.
