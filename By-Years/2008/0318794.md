0318794&lt;br/&gt;Gardner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a U.S.-China cooperative
project between Dr. Wayne Gardner, the University of Texas at Austin, and
Professor Yang Longyuan, Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology, Chinese
Academy of Sciences, proposing to study the impact of water column and sediment-
water interface nitrogen dynamics on water quality in Taihu Lake, China. This is
important aquatic environmental research and can have a major impact on the
control of eutrophication in China and water pollution elsewhere. It provides a
U.S. student with international experience in working with counterpart
scientists and students and with this unique lake system in China. The project
is jointly supported by the National Science Foundation and the Chinese Academy
of Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;
