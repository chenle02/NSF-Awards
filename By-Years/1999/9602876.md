9602876 Tolbert This award supports the participation of 10 U.S. academic
participants in a U.S.-Japan seminar on New Aspects of Photoresponsive
Materials, to be held at the Catalina Island Conference Center, California, from
November 4-8, 1996. The co-organizers are Professors Laren Tolbert and Gary
Schuster of Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta and Professor Masahiro
Irie of Kyushu University. The theme of the proposed seminar was chosen in order
to highlight recent advances in the use of light to bring about changes in the
properties of materials. Such materials may be used in optoelectronic devices,
such as imaging, memory, and display devices, as well as so-called "smart"
materials which mimic the light-driven responses of living systems. These
include changes in color ("photochromics") as well as changes leading to actual
motion ("optomechanics"). Of course, the ultimate light-driven biological
response is photosynthesis, and this represents a continuing focus of activity
in both countries. Fundamental discoveries in each of these areas are being made
both in U.S. and in Japan, and increased exchange of ideas and information
between these two groups is clearly essential to maintaining a high level of
intellectual output. The U.S. participants provide a broad cross section of
expertise and geographical representation in the area of photochemistry,
photophysics, and materials science, and were selected on the basis of being the
most active researchers in the U. S. while providing a diverse range of
interests. Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives of the Program in
its exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge through international
collaboration. ***
