This project sponsors a workshop to advance a research agenda in engineering
epistemologies, one of the five areas identified in a 2005 NSF sponsored
workshop on engineering education research that has received relatively little
attention. The interdisciplinary conference will draw together thinkers from a
variety of disciplines and educational systems to identify directions for future
study.

The broader significance and importance of this project lies in creating a
robust research network that crosses disciplinary boundaries and connects
members of historically different communities. The long-term results of the
workshop and the research arising from it can have a potentially broad impact on
how engineering is taught.
