This award is for support for a research program involving the use of passive
microwave data to validate key paleoclimate indicators used in glaciologic
research. The specific contributions of this research are: 1) to define the
timing and spatial extent of hoar complexes, which may serve as visible, annual
stratigraphic markers in ice cores, through a combination of satellite passive
microwave data and field observations; and 2) to monitor temperature trends at
the site with calibrated passive microwave brightness temperatures and to
correlate these trends to proxy temperatures provided by oxygen and hydrogen
stable isotope ratio profiles from snow pits and/or ice cores. The work will
take place at Siple Dome, Antarctica as part of the field activities associated
with the ice core drilling program there.
