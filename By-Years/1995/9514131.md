9514131 Carlson The Particles and Nuclei International Conference (PANIC 96)
will be held in Williamsburg, VA, 22-28 May 1996 and will be co-hosted by the
Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) and the College of William
and Mary. This is a major conference and will be the fourteenth in a series
begun a CERN in 1962. Its purpose is to bring together researchers in particle
and nuclear physics to discuss recent advances and foster cross-fertilization of
both fields. The average attendance at recent conferences in this series has
been about 700 persons. We are requesting funds to defray expenses, particularly
expenses relating to support for unfunded or underfunded active researchers
whose participation we would value. ***
