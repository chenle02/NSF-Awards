This research is concerned with conformal field theory and specifically with
the study of vertex operator algebras. The principal investigator will study the
following topics: vertex category theory; reconstruction of vertex operator
algebras from vertex tensor categories; modular vertex tensor categories; vertex
groups and vertex operator algebras; vertex groups and integrable systems;
geometric construction of the Monster; cohomology theory for vertex operator
algebras; and vertex manifolds. Conformal field theory is an important physical
theory describing both two-dimensional critical phenomena in condensed matter
physics and classical motions of strings in string theory. Besides its
importance in physics, the beautiful and rich mathematical structure of
conformal field theory also has interested many mathematicians. New relations
between different branches of mathematics, such as representations of infinite-
dimensional Lie algebras and groups, Riemann surfaces and algebraic curves, the
Monster sporadic group, modular functions and modular forms, elliptic genera,
and knot theory, is revealed in the study of conformal field theory. It is
believed that the study of the mathematics involved in conformal field theory
will lead to new mathematical structures which will be important both in
mathematics and theoretical physics.
