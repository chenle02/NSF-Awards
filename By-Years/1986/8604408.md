The objective of this research is to understand the response of whole-cell
catalysts to immobilization and to subsequent operating environments. In this
study, relationships between the immobilization method used and the catalyst
properties which result will be established. Techniques to be used include
fluorometry to monitor intracellular reduced pyridine nucleotide levels, NMR to
investigate metabolism and bioenergetics, and flow cytometry to monitor
population dynamics. Application of these techniques to immobilized cells is
novel.
