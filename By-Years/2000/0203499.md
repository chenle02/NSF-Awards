Arlington&lt;br/&gt;"An Active, Collaborative Learning Program in Smart Home
Technologies"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides opportunities for
students, through the transfer of knowledge advances from research in Smart Home
technologies, to engage in educational experiences that prepare them for the
workforce in the expanding area of embedded, smart systems. The project focuses
on the upper-level undergraduate and beginning graduate curricula at the
University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) and Texas Christian University (TCU). The
curriculum developments enabled by this project draw from expertise in the
computer science and the engineering departments of both institutions and are
also used to augment courses within various engineering disciplines. New course
elements developed in this project incorporate state-of-the-art advances in
fields such as Machine Learning, Requirements Modeling, Product Development
Processes, Mobile robotics, and Multi-agent systems. Smart Home technology
provides a vehicle to investigate and integrate these diverse topics and thus
represents an environment suitable for cross-disciplinary team projects in which
students with different expertise learn to cooperate to address a task. A Smart
Home lab at UTA and a similar lab (Smart Frog Condo) at TCU are equipped with a
variety of sensors and devices to provide hands-on experiences for students.
These two similar labs permit experiments to be largely interchangeable to
ensure the most efficient use of resources and available expertise at the two
universities.&lt;br/&gt;
