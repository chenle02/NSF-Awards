In many organisms, growth occurs primarily during early juvenile phases. When a
specific body size is reached, the organism stops growing and transitions to a
sexually mature adult (at puberty in mammals and at metamorphosis in insects).
Nevertheless, it is unclear how organisms sense when they are large enough for
this transition. In the fruitfly, Drosophila, metamorphosis is triggered by the
steroid hormone ecdysone, synthesized in an endocrine tissue called the
prothoracic gland (PG). One key activator of ecdysone synthesis is the protein
hormone, PTTH. Elimination of PTTH delays ecdysone synthesis and causes large
and developmentally delayed adults to form. The cellular "machinery" within the
PG by which PTTH triggers ecdysone synthesis has not been identified, and yet
this identification is critical to understanding how the timing of
metamorphosis, and hence final body size, is regulated. This research project
will test the hypothesis that PTTH activates ecdysone synthesis via a regulatory
pathway (MAP kinase pathway) in the PG. Transgenes inhibiting or activating the
MAP kinase pathway will be expressed specifically in the PG to determine if
these transgenes either block the ability of PTTH to induce ecdysone synthesis,
or activate ecdysone synthesis in the absence of PTTH. In addition, transgenes
will be used to increase or decrease PTTH synthesis, and the effects of changes
in PTTH levels on MAP kinase activity will be determined. Successful completion
of these experiments will provide essential information on the machinery used by
organisms to control the timing of developmental transitions and hence final
body size. In addition, this project will support the development of the next
generation of scientists by training undergraduate and graduate researchers in
genetic and molecular techniques.
