In this project, the P.I.'s will use modeling techniques to investigate the
dynamics of tropical western-boundary currents. In the Indian Ocean, they will
complete their study of Arabian Sea cooling, investigate more closely the
generation of stationary eddies on slanted western boundaries, and explore
various mechanisms for forcing an undercurrent along the northern Somali coast.
In the Atlantic, they will focus on isolating the effects of remote and local
forcing of the North Brazil Current, and in the Pacific, they will study the
causes of a sub-surface boundary current recently discovered north of Papua New
Guinea.
