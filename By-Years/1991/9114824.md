We purpose an NJIT-ETDL joint research project to study the design, fabrication,
and characterization of monolithic GaAs 8-12 u direct multiple quantum well
(MQW) injection image sensor ?1!. We purpose the GaAs/A1GaAs MQW infrared hot
electron transistor (IHET, invented at ETDL) as the photodetector, and direct
injection through an undoped GaAs layer as the mechanism for interfacing between
8-12 u IR photodetectors and current readout devices. The proposed image sensor
or focal plane array (FPA) structure is optimized for 300 K thermal imaging
performance, as well as for fabrication simplicity. Special attention is paid to
readout charge handling and detector array fill factor, as well as the
minimization of noise and cross talk.
