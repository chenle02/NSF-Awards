This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program
entitled "NUE: Connecting Nanotechnology and Alternative Energy Approaches
through Undergraduate Education in Engineering", at the University of Delaware
(UD), under the direction of Dr. S. Ismat Shah, will establish a formal and
comprehensive program that will become instrumental in the preparation of
undergraduate students for nanotechnology at the UD.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several engineering departments at the UD are
participating in the program which provides students with both the knowledge and
background in areas relevant to nanotechnology to allow them to become part of
the fast-growing community of researchers at the local, national, and global
levels. The focus of the program will be on coursework and training related to
the application of nanomaterials for alternative energy research. It will also
include education of the future work force in the areas of ethics in
nanotechnology.
