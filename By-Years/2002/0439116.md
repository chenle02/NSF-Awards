9912078&lt;br/&gt;SAUL&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Exploring the Role of Science in
K-8 Literacy Education" is a five-year project that will produce a series of
conferences, books, a CD-ROM and a web site that will address the issue of
reading and writing within the context of science instruction for young
students. The project is designed to highlight meaningful, salient and useful
connections between inquiry-based science teaching and literacy instruction. The
project will develop, organize and share information from both the science and
literacy communities on connections between and among hands-on activity, text-
based information resources, student cognition and teacher practices. The
project will also provide science educators with resources they can use to
increase attention to science at both the local and national level. It will
disseminate information about when, how and under what circumstances science and
literacy connections should be fostered. Activities will include a series of
conferences that address the concerns of various stakeholders in both the
science and language arts communities. By promoting those inquiry strategies
advocated by science educators that can improve children's reading, writing,
speaking, listening and thinking skills, the role of science instruction at the
elementary school level will be reinforced and enhanced.&lt;br/&gt;
