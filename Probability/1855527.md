This project will apply modern methods in probability theory to a range of
problems arising in combinatorics, theoretical computer science, mathematical
physics, statistics and other fields. A central focus will be understanding the
problem of simultaneously satisfying many constraints each chosen randomly. We
will determine when there are solutions, how many solutions and when it is
possible to efficiently find them. A second direction involves models of
shortest paths with random costs where we will study the geometry and chaotic
nature of these paths. Finally we will consider a range of questions involving
the statistical inference of combinatorial objects such as networks, trees and
partitions which will be applicable to problems such as finding communities in
networks and uncovering the genetic relationships between different species.

Throughout this project we will work to make mathematically rigorous ideas and
heuristics originating in statistical physics. In the case of random constraint
satisfaction problems, we will establish a range of one-step replica symmetry
breaking predictions for models such as colorings, satisfiability and large
independent sets in random networks. In first and last passage percolation we
will combine more classical methods of percolation with results from exactly
solvable models to answer questions about the slow bond model, coalescence of
geodesics and rotationally invariant first passage percolation. Many problems in
statistical inference involve recovering combinatorial structures. For models of
group synchronization and phylogenetic reconstruction we will give rigorous
bounds on the sampling complexity and computational efficiency.
