This project acquires measurements of the topside ionosphere using an incoherent
scatter radar at Kharkov, Ukraine. This data, with simultaneous measurements
from the Millstone Hill and Arecibo Observatories, contributes to the
CEDAR/POLITE research program, which studies concentrations of atomic oxygen and
hydrogen ions at altitudes above 400 km. Previous collaborative efforts between
scientists at MIT and the Institute of the Ionosphere in Kharkov have
incorporated the capabilities of the Ukrainian research facility into US
research programs to study coupling between atmospheric layers. The Ukrainian
facility provides high-quality data that suggests a significant longitude effect
in the topside ion distribution. The POLITE campaigns aim to study the altitude
at which hydrogen ions become more abundant than oxygen ions. Kharkov data from
a POLITE campaign in February, 1996 shows this transition height to be less than
450 km altitude. In this project, MIT scientists work with the Kharkov staff to
interpret these measurements and participate in future POLITE campaigns.
