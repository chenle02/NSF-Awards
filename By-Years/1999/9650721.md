This project includes a computer-based laboratory designed to give students more
control over experiments and research in physiology. The laboratory uses
computers and analog-to-digital converters to record data. Using current
software, instructors also create custom, user-friendly interfaces for
controlling data acquisition and analysis. This frees them from the
inflexibility of "canned" programs while still providing the simplicity to make
experimentation accessible to students. Using these interfaces, students have
more control over the methods of data collection and analysis. The first half of
the semester involves guided experimentation. Students are introduced to the
techniques used in physiological investigation and given practice making
decisions about data acquisition and analysis. The second half of the semester
involves two independent projects. Small groups of students develop their own
hypotheses, devise controlled experiments, and analyze the results. They then
present their results to the class in the form of a short seminar and a written
scientific report.
