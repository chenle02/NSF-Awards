This award supports student travel to the 7th International Conference on
Multiscale Materials Modeling, October 6 - 10, 2014 in Berkeley, California.
Multiscale modeling of materials has emerged as a central theme to address the
complexities in the prediction of material behavior. This conference will bring
together a range of scientists from around the world and from different sub
disciplines to exchange ideas on this topic. The development of multi scale
materials for materials is of significance for the goals of the Materials Genome
Initiative. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides financial assistance for
graduate students and post doctoral researchers to attend the conference by
partially supporting their attendance cost. It is expected that about half of
such attendees from US institutions will be supported. By providing such
financial assistance this award contributes to the goal of broadening the
participation in the discipline.
