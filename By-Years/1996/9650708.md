This project is helping expand molecular biology at the Institution. Molecular
biology techniques are currently introduced in several freshman and sophomore
courses for biology majors. In addition, an advanced course in molecular biology
is being expanded and the new basic equipment is being used to perform a wider
array of molecular biology techniques. Three major goals are addressed. The
first is an expansion of the number of molecular approaches available in the
Molecular Biology course. This allows the laboratory to be organized as a
cohesive package wherein students use molecular biology techniques to address a
single biological question during the semester, rather than simply learning how
to perform isolated techniques. Second, the equipment provides additional
research opportunities and tools for the independent research projects that are
required of all undergraduate majors in the Biology program. Third, a DNA
fingerprinting laboratory is being added to the nonmajors Introductory Biology
course to introduce these students to recent popular molecular biology
techniques. A new laboratory manual for Molecular Biology is also being
developed, will be disseminated at professional meetings, and will be made
available on the Internet.
