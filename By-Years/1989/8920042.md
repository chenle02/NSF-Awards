ABSTRACT This award is to establish unattached, automatic, magnetic data
collection platforms in the Greenland ice caps and the analysis of the data
acquired from the stations. This grant is part of the GEM (Geospace Environment
Modelling) program. The scientific objective is to investigate small-scale
propagating magnetic disturbances which appear to result from moving filamentary
field-aligned currents interacting with the ionosphere. These structures have
been classified and the origin of the field-aligned currents appear to be near
the dayside magnetopause boundary layer. The proposed stations in combination
with the existing west and east coast Greenland magnetometer station will help
to identify the generation region for these currents, and investigate the motion
and spatial evolution as they propagate anti-sunward onto field lines which
stretch deep into the Earth's magnetotail. ***//
