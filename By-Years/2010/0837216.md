Physics (13) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project continues the Spelman College
Physics Department's revision of the structure and pedagogy of the laboratory
sessions associated with its second-semester, calculus-based introductory
electricity and magnetism course. The new laboratories are based on student-
centered exploration of complex real-world phenomena (design of the wiring for a
house and the use of electric fields by fish to sense nearby objects) and
include students planning and performing experiments, small-group and class
discussions, and metacognitive activities such as reflection. Within constraints
set by the instructor, the detailed flow of laboratory activities depend, to a
large extent, on choices made by the students. In addition to using existing
tests for assessment of content knowledge, newly designed instruments, including
a rubric for coding and evaluating video of student work to assess their process
skills, are being developed.
