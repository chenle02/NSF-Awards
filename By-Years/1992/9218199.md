This Science in Developing Countries award will support the travel of 14 U.S.
participants in the Seventh Latin American Symposium on Surface Physics
(SLAFS-7), to be held in Bariloche, Argentina, November 15-20, 1992. The
Symposium aims to serve as a forum for an exchange of information on current
developments within the Americas in solid surfaces and related fields; stimulate
collaborative research among researchers from Latin America, the United States,
Canada, and Europe; and strengthen the scientific base of Latin America. Because
research on both pure and applied aspects of surface science is being conducted
in Latin America, and because surface physics overlaps with associated
technology areas, the Symposium will be held in conjunction with the First
Ibero-American Congress on Surface Science and Applications. Benefits to both
U.S. and Latin American participants include the development of future North-
South research ties.
