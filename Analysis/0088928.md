Abstract Junge

The aim of this research is the investigation of the following different aspects
of non-commutative spaces of p-integrable functions. If p is 1 such a space is
the predual of von Neumann algebra and reflects important properties of the
underlying operator algebra. We recall, that it is still open whether preduals
of von Neumann are finitely represented in the space of trace class operators.
Here, we focus on isometric characterization of finite dimensional spaces
embedding into the predual of a von Neumann algebra and its connection to the
theory of Lie-algebras and (non-commutative) stochastical processes. The
investigation of the latter uses martingale inequalities based on recent
progress by Pisier and Xu. We are interested in the non-commutative version of
the Rosenthal/Burkholder inequality and Doob's maximal inequality. Maximal
inequalities are also known as a useful tool in (stochastical) analysis. The
more recent theory of operator spaces delivers the right framework for these
investigations and reveals surprising properties of the non-commutative space of
p-integrable functions associated to free groups.





Non-commutative probability provides one possible framework for the
probabilistic viewpoint in quantum mechanics. This theory combines fundamental
concepts of algebraic nature with analytic insight and methods with roots in
calculus. The non-commutative analogue for the spaces of p-integrable functions
has a long tradition in the theory of operator algebras and provides a fruitful
framework for understanding classical tools in probability. It is most
challenging to reveal or overcome substantial differences between the
commutative and non- commutative theory. This area enables the interaction
between different streams inside the mathematical community and mathematical
physics. This kind of interaction is one of the most important resources for new
development in mathematics
