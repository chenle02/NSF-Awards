Proposal Number: DMS-0200756&lt;br/&gt;PI: Eric
Weber&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the past twenty
years, wavelet theory has developed&lt;br/&gt;into a fundamental area of
mathematics and applied science.&lt;br/&gt;Intimately related are frame theory
and sampling theory, all&lt;br/&gt;with a connection to harmonic analysis. The
proposed&lt;br/&gt;research will investigate group representations as a
&lt;br/&gt;unifying theme since they appear in the settings of
wavelet,&lt;br/&gt;frame, and sampling theory. The research of Weber will
use&lt;br/&gt;existing tools from functional and harmonic analysis,
while&lt;br/&gt;also developing tools related to group cocycles and
maximal&lt;br/&gt;abelian self adjoint algebras as models of these
objects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is theoretical in nature,
though much&lt;br/&gt;of it is motivated by problems in applied mathematics.
The&lt;br/&gt;goal of the research of Weber is to establish a
solid&lt;br/&gt;mathematical foundation of wavelet and frame theory.
However,&lt;br/&gt;the research will potentially impact problems in
applied&lt;br/&gt;mathematics and signal processing, such as digital signal
&lt;br/&gt;multiplexing, redundant communications and
secure&lt;br/&gt;communications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
