Some of the most significant breakthroughs in applied science and engineering
have resulted from spontaneous thoughts which have welled up from a deep
knowledge base. This very modest grant is intended to support a researcher who
has already made a mark in the promulgation of original concepts and new ideas
about basic and applied transport processes in heat transfer and fluid flow.
What is being supported is free and unstructured research which, if past
indicators are correct, will lead to new knowledge and healthy controversy at
the core of the field of heat transfer.
