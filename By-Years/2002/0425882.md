Kaznessis&lt;br/&gt;0425882&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on the
integration of a number of simulation algorithms into a seamless multiscale
algorithm for modeling biological regulatory processes, which extend from a
stochastic low-copy number regime to a high-concentration 'continuous' regime.
This work builds on important earlier work, particularly that of Gillespie. The
simulation algorithms which will be integrated are: a stochastic simulation
algorithm; a chemical Langevin algorithm, to deal with conditions resulting in
Gaussian fluctuations about a mean; and a multiscale deterministic simulation
algorithm, to manage the continuous 'high concentration' range. An important
goal of these studies is the creation of a 'platform' from which to approach in
silico design of biologically interesting gene expression systems. These systems
are described in some detail in the proposal, and include: bistable switching;
simulation of oscillatory and biochemical systems; and multiscale deterministic
modeling of metabolism.&lt;br/&gt;
