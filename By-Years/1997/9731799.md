This project investigates efficient manipulation of finite groups and estimation
of their parameters. Potential application areas include computational group
theory, graph isomorphism testing (of relevance to chemical documentation),
efficient interconnection networks based on groups, and possibly, group-based
cryptography. The main focus is on the design and analysis of efficient
algorithms for large group theoretic problems. These algorithms combine profound
recent results of group theory with new elementary combinatorial structure
theory and estimates, from which an entirely new algorithmic methodology
emerged. Some of the algorithms work in the generality of black box groups,
hence they can be applied both in the matrix group and the permutation group
setting. The project will refine and extend the construction of natural
representation of classical matrix groups from arbitrary representations.
Several "pure" algebraic and combinatorial problems are also being studied. In
particular, the interest is in base size problems for permutation groups,
problems concerning the action of groups on the power set of the permutation
domain, and problems related to Cayley graphs: the diameter of Cayley graphs and
the investigation of non-Cayley graphs with vertex-transitive automorphism
group. Small bases are important for fast implementations and for improving the
running time estimates of algorithms. Estimates of diameters of Cayley graphs
are closely related to the expansion rate and through this to a host of basic
questions of the theory of computing and probability theory.
