The Department of Nutrition and Food Science at Utah State University is
proposing to conduct a three week residential Young Scholars program during the
Summer of 1989 and 1990. Participants will be 16-20 high school students who
will either Year 11 or 12 the following Fall. This program will take advantage
of the multidisciplinary nature of this department to enhance the knowledge of
participants in the science career and in understanding the philosophy and
ethics of science. It includes a mix of activities (lectures, workshops,
demonstrations, laboratory project work, field trips) that will allow close
interactions between participants and scientists. Both general science topics
and topics specific to food and nutrition will be discussed. As part of the
their project work, each participant will have the opportunity to work with a
faculty scientist on a individual and small group basis. They will learn
specific research techniques as well as general methodology. Participants will
be selected from the western region of the United States and an effort will be
made to recruit students of high potential who may not have had the opportunity
to participate in such a program in the past.
