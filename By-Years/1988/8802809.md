This research, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, utilizes
laser techniques to understand the detailed processes in chemical reactions. The
data obtained in these studies will elucidate the mechanisms of elementary
chemical reactions, the vibrational and rotational excitation of the chemical
products, and the barriers to chemical elementary chemical reactions. Supersonic
beams will collide with atoms causing chemical reactions. Laser techniques will
be used to prepared the reactants with varying amounts of internal (vibrational
and rotational) and translational energies. The nascent vibrational and
rotational energy distribution of the products of these reactions will be
studied as a function of initial energy distributions of the reactant molecules,
using laser techniques. These data will be collected at energies up to the
dissociation energy of the reactants. Reactions involving the species NCNO, CN,
ketene, ICN, 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane and nitrogen dioxide are included in the
systems to be studied.
