9423244 Glazman The goal of this project is to develop a theory of charge
transport in an interacting electron system which is confined to a wide channel.
The PI will investigate the effect of a magnetic field on transport, and the
structure of the tunneling density of states on a two-dimensional electron
liquid in a weak magnetic field. The study includes finding the evolution of
this structure with field strength, disorder, and geometrical confinement and
relating it to the properties of the collective excitations of the electron
liquid. The PI will use two approaches based upon perturbation theory in the
interaction strength and upon the continuous medium description of the electron
system. The project involves making specific predictions for the observable
characteristicq and comparisons with existing experiments. %%% This theoretical
project involves understanding the flow of electrons, i.e., the current in a
wide channel. The PI is known for using simple and intuitive physical pictures
rather than relying on more formal mathematical developments. He is considered
one of the brightest theorists in this area of physics in his age group. The PI
will make specific predictions for the observable characteristics and
comparisons with existing experiments. This work has applications to thin films
and semiconducting devices. It is likely to lead to an improved understanding of
a number of experiments and is likely to have an impact on future experiments.
