This research is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of atomic spectroscopy. The goal of this research is to elucidate
the processes which lead to emission of light from inductively coupled plasmas
(ICPs). The fundamental hypothesis of this research is that the ICP is a dynamic
system which appears to be kinetically controlled. This research is designed to
study the time-dependent processes of ICP including ionization, recombination,
and excitation. This will be accomplished by modulating the power delivered to
the plasma. Such an approach will allow studies of the spatial and temporal
response of excited and ionic species in the plasma. This research is designed
to better understand the processes which lead to emission of light in special
high temperature sources called plasmas. The overall goal is to provide better
elemental analysis using this special source.
