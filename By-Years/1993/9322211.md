9322211 Wallace This award provides to establish a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates Site at Bucknell University. Ten undergraduate students, five
from Bucknell and five recruited from schools around the country will spend ten
weeks doing research in cell and molecular biology with various faculty at
Bucknell. Research projects include topics in cancer research, plant molecular
biology, Drosophila molecular genetics, immunology, and cell biology of the
testis. In addition to the work on their individual projects, the students will
(1) participate in a regular journal club, (2) attend two
demonstrations/workshops (put on by participating faculty) devoted to modern
molecular techniques, (3) attend the Summer Symposium in Molecular Biology at
Penn State University, and (4) participate in a minisymposium at the end of the
summer where they will present and discuss their work. It is hoped that the
combination of the detailed individual research work with the broader
perspectives given by the journal club, workshops, and Penn State Symposium,
will give the students a thorough exposure to a research environment. ***
