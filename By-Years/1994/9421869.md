9421869 Lewis-Beck Comparison of voting models across advanced democracies is
hampered by a number of things, among them difference in method, measurement,
and theory. Franco-American election studies share in common a survey research
methodology, but tend to be separated by differences of measurement and theory.
The respective national election surveys do not pose many of the same questions
and the dominant research paradigms in each country offer opposing explanatory
models of vote choice. This project, a joint effort of US and French
researchers, includes, for the first time, key American National Election Study
(ANES) items in the French National Election Study (for 1995). Following on an
analysis of new French pre-test data, these ANES items will be included: feeling
thermometers, approval ratings, economic evaluations, seven-point proximity
measures on social issues, party identification, candidate traits. Similarly,
this project will include, again for the first time, key French National
Election Study (FNES) items into ANES (for 1996). These items will be subject to
American pre-test, thus paralleling the above French pre-test. The items are:
left- right ideological measures, nonstandard social class measures (in
particular, a social status "staircase" indicator, and indicators of property
ownership). The end result will be unique: two presidential election surveys - -
1995 for France, 1996 for the US - - that contain comparable measures on key
independent variables. These data sets, which will be made available to the
scholarly community through the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and
Social Research, will enable unprecedented cross-cultural testing of rival
theories of vote choice. ***
