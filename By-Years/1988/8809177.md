The objective of this research is to study theoretically stable crack growth in
thin structures. Such structures have been observed experimentally to tolerate
large increments of load after the onset of crack growth. The final results will
be presented in the form of material resistance curves, which will eventually
provide the design basis for more efficient and yet safe thin structures.
