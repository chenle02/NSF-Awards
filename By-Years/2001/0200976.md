0200976&lt;br/&gt;Deering&lt;br/&gt;This award to University of Delaware
provides instrumentation to update and expand the oceanographic research
capabilities of the research vessel Cape Henlopen, a ship operated by the
University's College of Marine Studies as part of the University-National
Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. New water sampling
bottles, Carousel sampler and serial data uplink systems will be used to enhance
existing CTD (conductivity-temperature-depth) instrumentation. The new acoustic
current profiler will provide optimum resolution for shallow operations,
especially work in and around Chesapeake Bay. The new acoustic transponder
system will provide improved capabilities for locating instruments on the
bottom, either for detailed navigation or recovery if lost. These shared-use
systems will be of substantial advantage to marine scientists using the ship in
their research during 2002 and future years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
