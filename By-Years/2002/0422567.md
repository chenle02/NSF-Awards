The goals of this research are two-fold:&lt;br/&gt;(i) a previously unanalyzed
research aircraft (C-130) data set consisting of upwelling radiances in the
spectral ranges 8-12 and 4-40 micrometers will be analyzed and distributed to
the community and, &lt;br/&gt;(ii) a water vapor retrieval algorithm will be
developed for the microwave radiometer aboard the C-130, in conjunction with the
Airborne Imaging Microwave Radiometer (AIMR) instrument group at the National
Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). This algorithm will be highly useful,
not only for this research but for other numerous projects as well.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. A valuable data set will be developed and
distributed for the general use of the climate sciences community studying
climate change.
