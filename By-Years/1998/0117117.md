This proposal is for the continuation of the development, calibration, testing,
and deployment of in situ chemical sensors to make measurements at hydrothermal
vents, especially instruments that can be left in place for long periods of
monitoring, consistent with the evolving strategies involving long time series
measurements. To now, successfully developed instruments measure H2, H2S, and
pH. In this proposal the PIs propose to make these existing instruments smaller,
more robust, and better suited for long deployments. In addition they propose to
develop, calibrate and test new sensors to measure pH based on Ir/IrO2 and
Ti/TiO2 materials, a new Na ion sensor made of NASICON ceramic (which can also
serve as a reference electrode for pH measurements), and an electrochemical CO2
sensor. Developing successful instruments will require longer term testing and
calibration and in situ testing at actual hydrothermal vents.
