Complex phenomena occur at chemically modified electrode surfaces. Mass changes
occur due to ion flow and/or reorganization of the surface. Optical spectra
commonly vary with oxidation/reduction. A combined spectroelectrochemical/quartz
crystal micro-balance technique will be developed which will enable simultaneous
measurement of applied potential, charge, the technique will be employed to
investigate electrode surface reactivities of conducting polymers.
