The amount of data available to inform medicine and biology is growing at an
incredible rate and new technologies and methods are needed to integrate and
effectively utilize the data. Bioengineering needs to produce well-trained
graduates to meet future demand for experts in the field. To meet this growing
need, this research program: 1) improves undergraduate Bioengineering education
by changing how we teach data analysis and mathematical modeling, 2) maps the
growth of students' understanding of computational concepts over time, and 3)
will identify factors that lead to lower participation among women and other
underrepresented minorities in these types of data and computer-focused
problems. The program is designed to identify the best way to teach all aspiring
bioengineers to excel at computational tasks such as how to build diagrams that
connect data together or how to use a computer to make meaningful predictions
based on data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project team will use an existing
curricular structure to initiate an engineering education research project that
investigates the professional formation of engineers. Specifically, we have
three objectives: (1) to characterize the progression of computational thinking
in undergraduate biomedical engineering students from novice to expert over 3
courses; (2) to examine the intersection between gender, engineering identity,
and computational thinking; and (3) to iteratively improve the undergraduate
curricula to promote growth in computational thinking for all Bioengineers. The
interdisciplinary research team brings together expertise in computational
modeling, and deep methodological and pedagogical methods. To ensure long-
lasting impact, this work will also train faculty in the scholarship of
Engineering Education at Purdue. Additionally, the PI will act as a connector
between the engineering education community and the computational tool-building
life sciences research community to promote mutually beneficial exchange of
ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
