A perhaps over-simplified view of a "scientific revolution" would have it that a
great scientist develops a new theory to resolve a perceived problem in science.
Once the theory is developed, it inexorably overcomes other, opposing theories
to become the accepted "paradigm" of that scientific discipline. This view has
typically been applied to the "Newtonian" revolution of the 17th and 18th
centuries. In his Principia, Newton resolved the problem of gravitation by
unifying terrestrial gravity with the force controlling celestial motions of the
planets. 18th century science is then simply the history the advance of
Newtonian science as it rolled over the remains of the French Cartesian theory.
As simplistic as this theory might seem, stated in its baldest terms, it has
been the accepted historiography of the rise of modern mathematical physics
centering in France in the 18th century. One should have been suspicious of this
too pat a theory, yet, until the work of John Greenberg, no one challenged it.
Under an earlier NSF grant, Dr. Greenberg began the work of dismantling this
received view. With this grant, he will complete that work and replace it with a
new, more sophisticated and realistic understanding of the rise of modern
mathematical physics. His study points up the critical function of international
scientific communication in advancing science, the influence of Leibniz, the
contributions of mathematical-physical traditions (i.e. the work of the
Bernoulli's) dealing with the mechanics of rigid and elastic bodies and fluids
completely distinct from the Newtonian tradition, and the strikingly
mathematical achievements of forgotten French mathematicians of the 1730's and
40's. In other words, the completion of the "Newtonian" Revolution in 18th
century mathematical physics was not so much the inexorable conquest of
Newtonian physics as much as the synthesis of Newtonianism with continental
physics and mathematics. This synthesis calls into question the tradition of
"normal" science following a revolution and provides new grounds for work by
historians, philosophers, and social scientists into the processes of scientific
development.
