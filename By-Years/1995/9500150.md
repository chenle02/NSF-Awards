9500150 Sack The objective of the research that will be performed under this
proposal is to experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of a highway bridge
vibration control system. A designated bridge will first be tested initially to
establish a valid structural model (FEM). The identified model will then be
employed to develop an optimized design for the retrofit of the bridge with the
hydraulic semiactive control system. Once the new control system has been
installed, then the performance of the bridge will then be monitored to
determine the effectiveness of the design. If successful, the design should
extend the useful service life of the bridge by several years at a small
fraction of the cost that would have been realized to refurbish or replace the
bridge. In order to accomplish the project, the proposal requests funds to
purchase a structural modal testing system (SMTS). The SMTS will be used to
acquire and analyze vibration data, and to identify the structural model of the
bridge.
