The primary objective of this research is to understand the reasons for sexual
dimorphism of canine teeth in the catarrhine primates. The goal will be
approached by collecting tooth size measurements for a large body of primates.
Large samples of males and females for each species will be obtained to allow a
thorough documentation of variation of sexual dimorphism, allowing comparisons
of sexual dimorphism at all taxonomic levels within the anthropoid primates. The
effects of body size, body size dimorphism and phylogeny on the expression of
sexual dimorphism will be carefully studied. Scientists disagree as to the cause
of canine reduction and the associated reduction sexual dimorphism in the canine
teeth of the human lineage. This research will test several hypotheses, such as
whether patterns of sexual dimorphism result from unequal division of labor
between male and female primate, or whether small object feeding has caused
canine reduction in association with incisal reduction to allow more efficient
jaw movements.
