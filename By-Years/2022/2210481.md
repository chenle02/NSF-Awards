Nonfatal disease-related hardship diminish quality of life. For example, cancer
survivors often experience adverse health outcomes resulting from treatment or
disease progression. Understanding the dependence among times to such events is
crucial for designing effective care. This project will develop new statistical
methods to model such dependencies and how the occurrence of these nonfatal
events affects overall survival. The results of this research can inform new
treatment strategies and improve the quality of life for many patients. This
project will integrate the research with curriculum development and the training
of graduate students and provide research opportunities for undergraduate and
high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project leverages copulas,
popular statistical tools for modeling the dependence among event times, to
address three major aims. The first aim is to develop a likelihood-based
goodness-of-fit test for detecting copula misspecification, which would lead to
invalid estimation. The second aim focuses on missing event times caused by
censoring, such as the termination of follow-up. New procedures will be designed
to impute the missing event times via inter-event dependence. The third aim is
to establish a vine copula framework to model the dependence among times to
multiple nonfatal events and their relationship with time to death. The
theoretical aspects of this research effort will be complemented by developing
open-source software packages in R for use by the research community. This
project is jointly funded by the Statistics Program and the Established Program
to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
