This is a SGER proposal on laser atomization from a liquid surface, with
potential medical applications. The P.I. will investigate the feasibility of
generating aerosols with controlled size distribution (between 1 and 5 microns)
from drug solutions used in aerosol therapy, without compromising the chemical
integrity of the solution. Preliminary studies indicate that the particles
should be in the 1 to 2 micron size range to maximize the effectiveness of
aerosol therapy. If the aerosol is administered through a ventilation circuit,
only 1 to 3% of the original volume of medication actually reaches the target
site. The long term objective is atomization of drugs directly within the large
airways of lungs through the use of a fiber optic delivery system. The proposed
technique is the object of a U.S. patent claim "Forming Fine Particles". The
project will establish the validity of the proposed concept, which may have
long-reaching implications in medical field and may lead to fundamental findings
in the area of generating ultrafine aerosols.
