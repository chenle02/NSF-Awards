This dissertation study will examine how Cree hunters perceive and respond to
environmental changes associated with resource development in the James Bay
region of Quebec Province, Canada. The proposed study will focus on commercial
forestry and sport hunting, factors identified by Cree hunters as directly
affecting their continued harvest of wildlife, especially moose, a primary
source of meat in many Cree communities. Analysis of these factors using
anthropological and social impact assessment approaches will provide detailed
information on how local systems are affected by and respond to large-scale
regional environmental changes. Results will contribute to our understanding of
the nature and scope of environmental changes in northern regions and the
effects of such impacts on economic, social and cultural patterns of northern
residents, particularly aboriginal peoples.
