The primary purpose of this proposal is to design and implement a Geographic
Studies Center as a model geography laboratory for Wyoming and northern
Colorado. The Center will engender student and teacher interest in geography by
demonstrating ways in which technological advances (computer graphics, high-
quality videodiscs) are creating new learning opportunities in this field.
Students at Laramie County Community College will be the most immediate
beneficiaries of this laboratory facility, but it also will serve as an
innovative model and inservice venue for educators and students throughout this
region. Geography teachers from Laramie County, professors from the University
of Wyoming, and community college instructors will be involved in the design and
implementation of the Geographic Studies Center.
