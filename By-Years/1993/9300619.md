9300619 Tepper Support for three undergraduate researchers will be provided by
this award. The students will work with the principal investigator on selected
questions in applied mathematics taken from industry-related problems. Typical
of these questions are studies of light loss in space telescope metering,
modeling clocks in space and analyzing relativistic effects of lights paths.
Some of the work will involve numerical approximations. Visits to industrial
research facilities are also planned. Research experiences for undergraduates
provides first-hand applications of mathematical theory developed during
students' classroom experience. The work often leads to publishable results
which are presented at professional meetings. Students are also better prepared
to make important career choices when they return to the final years of
undergraduate study. ***
