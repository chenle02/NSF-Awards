Improvement of the current universal testing machine with a new microprocessor
console provides digital load readout with peak hold indicator, computer input
of a specified stress, strain, deflection or load rate, and computer output of
loadings, stresses and deflections during the test. This improved basic
laboratory equipment will enhance undergraduate education in civil engineering
by exposing students to a state-of-the-art indicating and control system. This
system will approximate industrial practice. The enhanced material will
particularly benefit students in the understanding of: fundamental of
engineering materials and engineering soil tests where students perform numerous
tests on steel concrete and rock like materials using the universal testing
machine.
