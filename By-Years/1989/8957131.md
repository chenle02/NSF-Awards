The PI is particularly interested in the development of practical diagnostic
techniques for structures because this work draws upon her expertise in
nondestructive testing, stress wave propagation, fracture mechanics, dynamic
finite element analysis and structural engineering. To date, the impact-echo
method to locate flaws in platelike, reinforced concrete structures, such as
pavements, walls, and slabs, have been used. The PI will determine the
feasibility of using the impact-echo idea for evaluating the quality of and
detecting cracking in reinforced concrete structures, such as locks and dams,
large foundations and bridge piers, and offshore structures. Initial research
will involve using an existing three-dimensional, transient finite element code
to develop an understanding of how stress waves propagate in these types of
structures and how the response of the structures changes when defects are
present. Currently, no solutions exist for any of these problems. Once this
under- standing has been developed, experimental studies of small models of
larger structures with and without flaws will be carried out. Finally, the
results of the field studies will be checked by coring or other techniques to
verify the results.
