The department of Chemistry is equipping a laboratory for the synthesis,
characterization, processing and property determination of chain and step-growth
polymers. Students in the course convert a monomer to polymer to product with
intermediate laboratory work in molecular and mechanical characterization. Upon
completion of the two semester integrated laboratory, many students undertake
individual research projects on the synthesis and characterization of polymeric
materials.
