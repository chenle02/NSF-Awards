Maria Coleman University of Arkansas 9553267 ABSTRACT Research topics include
the transport of small molecules through glassy polymer matrices and membrane-
based separations for secondary metabolite recovery. The transport studies will
focus on modifying the polymer free volume distribution through a combination of
synthesis of new polymers and post-synthesis treatments (for example, ion beam
irradiation and thermal quenching). This research may lead to improved polymers
that act as permselective layers in protective coatings for chemical sensors and
membranes for gas separations. Gel forming polymers will be modified with
functional groups that exploit protein-metal interactions to obtain membranes
which continuously recover secondary metabolites from solution. Membrane-based
recovery schemes provide an attractive alternative to commercial chromatography
techniques through a reduction in process times and increase in volumetric
productivity. Greater student participation and practical applications will be
incorporated into the curriculum by modifying the undergraduate laboratories,
developing interactive software, and developing an undergraduate research in
materials characterization.
