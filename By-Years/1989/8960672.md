X-ray imaging and inspection play an important role in the development and
implementation of modern manufacturing techniques. The increasing demand for
high-resolution inspection and inspection as adjuncts to critical manufacturing
steps has generated a need for new, flexible, compact, high-resolution
illumination sources. The use of thin-film convertors mounted on cooled diamond
transmission substrates promises to open a broad range of new design techniques.
This program will evaluate the feasibility of implementing these techniques and
develop design parameters. A combination of modeling and experimental evaluation
will be used to attack the critical problem of thin- film adhesion.
