This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Filipp Furche of the University of
California, Irvine is supported by an award from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry program to carry out research on the development of
electron correlation methods based on the random phase approximation (RPA). This
method uses highly efficient wave function techniques to implement RPA while
correcting the remaining error with density functional style approximations. The
PI and his group are targeting very large systems of over 100
atoms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because electronic structure calculations are an
indispensable tool for chemistry research and development, the impact of this
work extends far beyond the theoretical chemistry community. The methods
deveoped in this project are being incorporated into the Turbomole computational
chemistry code which has a growing and diverse user community in both academia
and industry. The PI is also involved in educational and outreach activities to
bring computational chemistry to a broader group of scientists, including
students as small colleges with large minority populations.
