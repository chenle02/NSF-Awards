DMS-0102791 Victor Guillemin, Andras Vasy

This award provides partial support for participants to attend the meeting
`Geometric Microlocal Analysis: a conference in honor of Richard Melrose' to be
held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, March 29-31, 2002.

The speakers at the conference will be distinguished mathematicians working in
Melrose's wide-ranging fields of interest. The primary need for the conference
is the otherwise unavailable opportunity to gather together specialists from
many different areas who would normally have little contact, but who all have
ties to Professor Melrose. In particular, inviting experts with connections to
Melrose's fields of interest, but whose work often has a different emphasis and
uses different methods, provides an unprecedented opportunity for the synthesis
of these ideas. The tentative list of the main speakers, who will deliver one-
hour lectures, consist of Michael Atiyah, Nicolas Burq, Charlie Epstein, Charles
Fefferman, Lars Hormander, Victor Ivrii, Gilles Lebeau, John Lott, Peter Sarnak,
Johannes Sjostrand, Terence Tao, Daniel Tataru, Michael Taylor, Gunther Uhlmann,
Steve Zelditch. The schedule is not expected to be crowded so that there will be
plenty of time for discussions between all the participants.

Further information will be soon available at http://www-math.mit.edu/seminars.
