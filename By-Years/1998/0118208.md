The objective of this project is to investigate the problem of protein
folding/unfolding, and in particular, the mediation of this process by the
chaperone DnaK. This project involves both modeling and experimental studies.
First, folding-aggregation competition will be studied. Measurements of
interprotein interactions at varied external conditions, e.g. temperature, pH,
and ionic strength, will help identify separate contributions to the overall
interprotein potentials and their role in molecular association. The Principal
Investigators (PIs) have developed a three dimensional periodic Monte Carlo
simulator for capturing the competition between refolding and aggregation of
initially unfolded protein-like chains. In this system various interactions on
short length scales will be considered. Also, the PIs have predicted that the
presence of pre-folded proteins improves the folding rate of unfolded proteins
because of enhanced surface interactions. This provides a basis for modeling the
chaperone-unfolded protein interaction so crucial in vivo. Other computational
tasks include an understanding of the kinetics of the refolding process, since
both folded and unfolded forms are thermodynamically feasible so that the
kinetics may define the overall extent of folding.
