> In this project, I shall consider problems in harmonic analysis arising in
geometric analysis and geometric measure theory, and in the theory of elliptic
and parabolic partial differential equations and operators. These questions are
interesting because of their applicability to real world phenomena (see below),
but also because of the deep connections among them. The main directions of the
proposed research include the following: 1. To develop and apply ``T1/Tb" (i.e.,
Carleson measure) criteria for the solvability of boundary problems for
divergence form elliptic equations and systems. 2. To treat various problems in
the theory of uniformly rectifiable sets, in the applications of this theory to
elliptic and parabolic PDE, and in the theory of quasiconformal mappings. 3. To
obtain sharp average decay estimates for Fourier transforms, and to apply these
to concrete problems including lattice point problems and the Falconer distance
problem. As mentioned above, I propose to work on problems in the area of
harmonic analysis and its application to, and interaction with, geometric
measure theory and the theory of elliptic and parabolic partial differential
equations. Roughly speaking, in harmonic analysis one investigates properties of
functions and ``operators" (i.e., mappings which transform one function into
another) by decomposing them into smaller, constituent pieces, which are easier
to understand, and then reassembling the pieces. The name itself arose by
analogy to the decomposition of a musical sound into its various frequency
components, or ``harmonics". geometric measure theory involves the study of the
relationship between geometric properties of sets, and their ``measures" (the
latter are generalizations of the notions of length, area, and volume). Partial
differential equations of elliptic and of parabolic type describe a wide variety
of phenoma in the real world, including electrostatics, certain fluid flows and
elastic deformations, and various diffusion processes such as the conduction of
heat, the flow of ground water, certain phenomena arising in the mathematical
theory of population biology, and the pricing of options in financial markets.
In the last decade the interplay between these different subfields of
mathematics has turned out to be a fertile ground for investigation, with much
exciting work remaining to be done.
