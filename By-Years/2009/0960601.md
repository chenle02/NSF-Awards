The Third Annual IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine
provides an open, interactive forum to promote multi- and interdisciplinary
research and education in bioinformatics, computing science and biomedicine,
facilitating development of new ideas for bridging gaps. In addition to
contributed talks and special publication in top scientific journals, the
meeting provides focused workshops, tutorials and posters. BIBM has made a
significant effort to engage your researchers in the meeting organization and
also provides mentoring activities in the program. There is particular support
for both early career researchers and graduate students, providing both training
and broadening the overall scientific impact of the conference.
