This collaborative study will analyze the antarctic oceanographic dataset
obtained during the three-year Antarctic Slope Front Project ("AnSlope"), whose
objective was to identify and quantify the principal physical processes
governing the transfer of dense antarctic shelf waters into intermediate and
deep layers of the adjacent deep ocean, and the compensatory poleward flow of
open ocean waters across the shelf break. Research activities will be organized
around: (i) a full description of the northwestern Ross Sea slope front region
including the structure of the slope front and the energetic outflows of dense
shelf water; and (ii) detailed study of the dynamics of cross-frontal exchange
and their relationship to environmental forcing (ocean, sea ice, atmosphere).
The work will evaluate the spatial and temporal scales of the descending dense
outflows that originate in different shelf troughs; the roles of entrainment,
thermobaricity, and benthic stress on the dilution, descent and spreading of the
outflows; and the primary mechanisms driving on-shelf intrusions and cross-
isobath motions. Ultimately, modeling studies guided by the data interpretation
will facilitate the development of parameterizations of cross-slope exchanges in
global ocean models.&lt;br/&gt;While the importance of cold water masses
originating in the Antarctic to the global ocean circulation and climate is
unquestioned, the processes by which these water masses enter the deep ocean
circulation are not. The upper continental slope around Antarctica has been
identified as the primary gateway for the exchange of shelf and deep ocean
waters. Here the topography, velocity and density fields associated with the
nearly ubiquitous front must strongly influence the advective and turbulent
transfer of water properties between the shelf and oceanic regimes. The strength
and variability of this gateway is critical in maintaining the structure of the
world ocean. &lt;br/&gt;
