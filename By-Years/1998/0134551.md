0134551&lt;br/&gt;Swartz&lt;br/&gt;Under this CAREER Award, macroscale tissue
mechanics will be bridged to cellular- and molecular-level control elements to
examine how cells act in concert to manage mechanical stresses in their shared
environment. The focus is on issues of tissue fluid balance, in particular on
the effects of interstitial flow on matrix remodeling in a dynamic living
environment. To characterize the system, an in vivo model of lymphangiogenesis
into an implanted collagen gel (in situ model in the rat tail) will be observed
over time. Based on the qualitative data obtained, a 3D in vitro model in which
the physical environment can be tightly controlled and cell response readily
ascertained will be developed. The two models will then be used symbiotically to
examine the relationship between extracellular matrix architecture and
interstitial flow, with particular focus on the organization and development of
interstitial water channels. The notion of interstitial-flow induced matrix
remodeling and vessel formation can be used to address a number of related
research questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational component focuses on
integrating traditional biomedical engineering topics with contemporary problems
in the biological sciences and biotechnology. Specific areas to be addressed
are: reconstructing the biomechanics and biotransport curriculum within the
department (new courses in Advanced Tissue Mechanics and Transport in Living
Systems and increased involvement in the NSF Engineering Research Center on
Engineering Education), enhancing the bioengineering community within the
engineering school (establish a focus in biomechanics) and introducing non-
traditional, interdisciplinary components to the engineering curriculum (new
course in societal implications of technology). &lt;br/&gt;
