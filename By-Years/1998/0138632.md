With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division,
Professor Robert D. Bach, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of
Delaware, will continue theoretical studies of oxygen transfer processes in both
small molecules and in biomolecules. These are systems that are difficult to
characterize and among the most challenging both theoretically and
computationally. While the mechanism of oxygen transfer from such classical
oxygen donors as peracids, dioxiranes and oxaziridines to a variety of
nucleophiles such as alkenes, amines, sulfides and phosphines in two-electron
processes are now reasonably well understood, much is yet to be learned about
the oxidation of saturated hydrocarbons by one-electron oxidative reactions.
Aided by a highly accurate systematic study of O-O bond dissociation energies,
Professor Bach has placed his conclusions about the energetics of oxygen
transfer on a sound thermodynamic basis. The proposed work will lead to a better
understanding of oxidation reactions using high level theoretical and
computational methods to explicitly examine the potential role of the excited
singlet electronic structure of peroxynitrous acid in hydrogen atom abstraction
processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Robert D. Bach, of the Department of
Chemistry at the University of Delaware, with the support of the Organic
Dynamics Program, studies the mechanism of oxygen atom transfer, which is
important in understanding the metabolism of drugs in the body. This work is
especially important to understanding how the family of enzymes known as
cytochrome P-450 metabolizes drugs in animals.&lt;br/&gt;
