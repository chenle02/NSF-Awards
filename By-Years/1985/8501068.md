In this research, attention is focused on three problem areas in information
theory: feedback quantization schemes, nonstationary channels, and entropy-
constrained quantization. A fourth topic involving a noise source for a
stationary channel is also pursued. Feedback quantization schemes are encoding
schemes for efficient transmission of information. In this investigation a
general theory of stochastic stability for such schemes is being pursued. In the
last topic, considering the physical communication channel, a noise source is
constructed for each channel, thereby modeling the channel noise. This could
lead to a classification of channels according to the type of noise source.
