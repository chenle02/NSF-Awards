This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop
high strength biodegradable polymers with mechanical properties sufficient to
function as fracture fixation devices in high load bearing applications. The
majority of fractures today are fixed with metallic devices but to prevent bone
atrophy, these may require a second surgery to remove the device after bone
healing has occurred. By using resorbing biodegradable devices, the need for the
second surgical procedure is eliminated. At this time, commercially available
biodegradable devices do not have sufficient mechanical strength for high load
bearing applications. Prior work has shown that a new class of synthetic,
degradable polymers derived from tyrosine, may be useful in bone repair. The
objective of this Phase I project is to structurally modify these biomaterials
and demonstrate that the modified structures posses an optimal combination of
mechanical properties and degradation rate.

The commercial application of this project is in the area of orthopedics.
