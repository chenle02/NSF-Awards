The energy level of a cell is determined by the state of three interconvertible
components: ATP, the proton motive force, and the redox level of the electron
transport chain. Oxygen taxis, oxidizable substrate taxis and phototaxis are all
behaviors governed by sensing of the energy level. This research will identify
the energy-level sensor of E. coli and establish the principal mechanism of
sensing. An arcB mutant fails to show O2- taxis and oxidizable substrate
(proline) taxis. A cloned arcB locus will be used to identify the sensor by
expressing and localizing the arcB product. By comparing cell responses to CN
and uncoupler that similarly decrease the pmf, but have different effects on the
redox state, it will be found whether a redox chain component or pmf per se are
immediately responsible for energy level sensing. Understanding of information
transduction will be achieved by isolating pseudorevertants to arcB that will
map in a che gene(s). This study bridges two fields of knowledge: metabolic
regulation and behavior, since arcB controls both taxis and O2-dependent
transcription. It is highly possible that arcB (or a homologous compound) is
additionally responsible for other instances of so-called "pmf-dependent"
regulation in various bacteria, as well as in mitochondria and chloroplasts. It
is of fundamental significance to learn how the bacterial cell senses its own
energy level and uses this information to control behavior. A new type of sensor
which is substantially different from known sensors will be explored in this
study. The principal mechanism of energy level sensing will be elucidated. Since
it is possible that mitochondria and chloroplasts "inherited" the energy level
sensor from bacteria, this research may provide a model system for studying
behavior of higher organisms.
