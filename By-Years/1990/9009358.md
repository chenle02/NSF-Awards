An experimental study to investigate the interaction between droplets and
comparable sized turbulent gas vortices is proposed. Measurements of droplet
diameters, velocities, and accelerations in a turbulent air stream will be made
using strobed shadow photography. The turbulent air flow will be generated in a
wind tunnel with turbulence generating grids. Laser Doppler velocimetry will be
used to characterize the gas turbulence. Data on the mass and momentum transfer,
drop drag coefficients and evaporation rates will be obtained in the range of
droplet Reynolds numbers (1 to 500) seen in real sprays. The results will be
useful for better understanding droplet transport processes, with application to
modeling sprays in combustion chambers.
