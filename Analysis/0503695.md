Workshop on Minimal Surfaces, Sub-Elliptic PDE's and Geometric Analysis.



The study of PDE's, harmonic analysis, and geometric analysis in the sub-
Riemannian setting has reached a critical juncture: recently, researchers from
disparate fields have made significant progress in this area and have opened up
many new avenues of research. The conference will focus on contemporary
developments in the study of several problems from analysis and geometry in the
setting of Carnot-Carath\'eodory metrics. Most of the invited lecturers will
address a variety of interrelated topics, such as: ``best-constant'' type
problems concerning Sobolev and isoperimetric inequalities; the study of minimal
and constant-curvature submanifolds; rectifiability and geometric measure
theory; quasiconformal maps and potential theory; geometric flows and
applications. Analysis in Carnot-Carath\'eodory spaces is an important component
in the general theory of abstract, non-smooth analysis which has seen extensive
development in recent years. The conference, as envisioned by the PI's, will
foster the collaboration of different research groups and provide a ground for
discussion. The study of systems whose dynamics is subject to physical
constraints has been a focus of attention for a long time, both from the point
of view of pure mathematics and from the point of view of engineering and
physics. Motivation for these inquiries stems from the wide variety of
applications to problems in control theory, robotic planning, the structure of
crystalline materials, image reconstruction, nonholonomic mechanics, and others.
In mathematical terms such systems are represented by Carnot-Carath\'eodory
(sub-Riemannian) spaces. These are manifolds with a preferred set of directions
at every point. These preferred directions represent the constraints; motion is
only allowed in these directions. The study of geometry and analysis on CC
spaces is based on techniques from several mathematical disciplines: several
complex variables, contact geometry, partial differential equations, harmonic
analysis and geometric function theory. In turn, new results in the sub-
Riemannian context often yield important progress in these areas.
