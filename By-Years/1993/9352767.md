9352767 Gibson A computer laboratory with the mathematics software, Theorist, is
being developed to relieve students from difficult algebraic calculations, thus
enabling them to concentrate on concept development and understanding. In
addition, multimedia presentations that explain and reinforce Calculus concepts
in an exciting manner are being developed to encourage student interest and
success. Five multimedia modules, on limit, continuity, differentiation,
integration and series that explore, clarify and amplify concept understanding
are being developed. The modules are being developed to particularly meet the
needs of the divers student body; at least 50% of the institution's students are
non-native English speaking and sixty-nine percent of incoming freshman place
below standard college entrance level in mathematics placement tests. ***
