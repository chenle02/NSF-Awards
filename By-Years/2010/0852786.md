This project will aid the theoretical program on the interaction of radiation
with free and confined atoms and ions at Georgia State University. The PI will
continue to develop theoretical methodologies and perform a series of
calculations that explore ionizing collisions of electromagnetic radiation and
charged particles with matter and investigate the details of their deposition of
energy. The PI will develop/enhance theoretical methodologies and apply them to
investigations of electromagnetic radiation impinging on free atoms and ions,
with emphasis on breakdowns in fundamental approximations and processes for
which many-body interactions dominate, e.g., negative ion photodetachment. In
addition, the PI will study the collisions of atoms and ions with atoms with
particular emphases on the role of projectile electrons and higher order
contributions. All of these investigations shall be carried out in close
collaboration with experimental groups in an effort to insure the quantitative
accuracy of the theoretical methodologies developed. In addition, the PI will
continue to study the interaction of radiation with confined atoms and ions,
e.g., confined in fullerenes. Of great importance will be the realistic handling
of the confining potential, e.g., treating all 60 carbon atoms of C60. The
results will provide further insight into the nature of these fundamental atomic
processes that are of importance in plasma physics and controlled thermonuclear
research, atmospheric, solar, and astrophysics, radiation and radiological
physics and therapy, and for studies of x-ray laser mechanics. In addition,
understanding the properties of confined atoms will lead to insight into the
qualitatively new physics of a largely unexplored area. The project will bring
more minorities in the sciences.
