This grant will support a program to develop a quantitative model for the
global structure and dynamics of the solar wind- magnetosphere-ionosphere
coupled system. It divides into four sub-projects: 1. Map the magnetic field
that links the ionosphere to the solar wind through the dayside of the
magnetosphere. The solar wind imposes its influence on the magnetopshere-
ionosphere system mainly by attaching the magnetic field it carries with it onto
the earth's magnetic field, which fills the magnetosphere the way air fills a
balloon. The dayside of the magnetosphere is where the magnetic coupling takes
place. Therefore, mapping the magnetic field in this region is important because
it tells where the solar wind effect is concentrated, and it allows researchers
to see the imprint of the attachment process at the ionospheric end, which is
relatively accessible. 2. Develop a complete model of the magnetohydrodynamic
structure of the global boundary of the magnetosphere. This is an extension of
the first project, but the emphasis is on global completeness and explicit
boundary architecture. 3. Work out the theory by which the solar wind
communicates its influence to the ionosphere through electrical currents flowing
between them on their linked magnetic field lines. And 4. Develop further and
further apply a model which predicts the ionospheric winds that result from 3..
Overall the aim is to develop a global MHD picture of the way in which the sun's
plasma energy couples down into the atmosphere.
