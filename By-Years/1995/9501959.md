9501959 Rosenberg Support is provided to a junior member of the faculty at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology for research and teaching under the NSF
Faculty Early Center (CAREER) Program. The P.I. will introduce an innovative
laboratory course in which students will be introduced to forefront experimental
technique and instrumentation to be used in studying superconductivity phenomena
in various materials. His research project is a search for evidence that AXIONS
exist. These hypothesized particles are candidates for the missing, dark, matter
in the universe, a subject of intense interest. The experiment, already in the
setup stage at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) is a
collaborative effort with physicists from LLNL, University of Florida,
University of California, and Fermilab. They expect to achieve a power
sensitivity 100 times greater than that in previous experiments with a mass
reach extended to the 1.5 ueV - 12.6 ueV range. ***
