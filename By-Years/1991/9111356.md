This proposal is aimed at a joint in-situ quartz crystal microbalance and
spectroelectrochemical characterization of the electropolymerization and doping
of conducting polymers. The goal is to show feasibility for using these two
techniques together with ultraviolet-visible spectral measurements to show
specral changes that occur during known mass changes in the film under
electrochemical control of the doping process.
