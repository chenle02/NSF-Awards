This research involves an electron microscope technique called etch decoration.
This method is being used in research studies on mechanisms and kinetics of
carbon and hydrogen reactions. The surfaces include both catalysts and non-
catalysts. The method provides insights into dissociative chemisorption of
hydrogen, a topic of interest to many researchers in catalysis. An added aspect
of the current research involves carbon formation on solid surfaces, a topic
relevant to a wide range of reactions. The study of some commercially important
catalysts, as a part of the continuing research, will further the understanding
of the complex systems encountered in industrial operations.
