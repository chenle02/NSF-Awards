Regulation of Chlorophyll Synthesis in Plant Cells: Biochemical and genetic
approaches will be used to study in Chlamydomonas the regulation of synthesis of
delta-aminolevulinic acid, the first committed compound in synthesis of the
porphyrin ring of chlorophyll. The enzyme that ligates glutamate to its transfer
RNA has been purified. The remaining two enzymes of the pathway will be purified
and the genes for all three enzymes will be cloned and sequenced. Understanding
the biosynthesis of delta-aminolevulinic acid and its regulation is essential
for the understanding of the regulation of chlorophyll biosynthesis and the
assembly of the photosynthetic membranes in plant cells. Because of the known
similarities between Chlamydomonas and higher plants not only the knowledge but
also the genes may be transferable and thus available to genetic engineering for
increasing plant growth efficiency
