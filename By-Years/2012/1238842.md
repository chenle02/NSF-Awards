The PI's request partial support for the Integrated Ocean Observing System
(IOOS) Summit "A New Decade for an Integrated and Sustained Ocean Observing
System". The 2002 Ocean.US Workshop "Building Consensus: Toward an Integrated
and Sustained Ocean Observing System", in Warrenton, Virginia March 10-15, 2002
set the stage for the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS). Ten years later,
IOOS has evolved significantly to meet the nation?s ocean observing needs.
Looking ahead at the next ten years, with the foundation of an integrated system
now in place, the ocean observing community can begin planning how to optimize
technical, scientific, and management components. The Interagency Ocean
Observation Committee (IOOC) is planning this IOOS Summit, the week of November
12, 2012, to help give voice to the work of various ocean observers,
researchers, scientists, and policy expert-led subgroups charged with
identifying practical solutions to enhancing IOOS capabilities through the next
decade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Summit
is all about bringing together a diverse group of stakeholders to discuss the
future of ocean observing systems. The Summit will set the stage for planning
the next ten years, including how to optimize technical, scientific, management,
and policy components.
