An experimental Special Session on exemplary current doctoral work in
mathematics is scheduled for the October 28-29, 1994 Central Section meeting of
the American Mathematical Society, to be held on the campus of Oklahoma State
University in Stillwater, Oklahoma. At this session, selected doctoral students
who are completing PhDs in academic year 94-95 at doctoral programs in the
central section will present twenty-minute talks about their thesis work in
progress. All programs will be invited to have their eligible students apply.
The session organizing committee will select the presentations from the
applicants on the basis of scientific quality, taking diversity into account.
Funds are to be used to support the travel and local expenses of twelve of the
graduate student participants selected by the organizing committee to attend the
meeting.
