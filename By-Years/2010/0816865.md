Trichoptera (Caddisflies) are insects whose adults look like moths, which are
their closest relatives. Because Trichoptera larvae live in water, and because
different species are differentially tolerant to pollution, quantitative
sampling of these larvae is commonly used to monitor water quality. However,
biomonitoring requires accurate taxonomy, which is currently unavailable for
Trichoptera in the Tropics. With this research, a phylogeny representing 80% of
the world's Trichoptera genera will be constructed from both molecular DNA
sequence data and morphological data, and an accurate taxonomy for the group
will be obtained. This new phylogenetic framework and classification will allow
placement of newly discovered species and focused analysis on differential
sensitivity of species to water pollution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is
currently a large, independently funded effort to collect short pieces of DNA
that can be used to quickly identify species by their unique DNA sequences
(called 'barcodes'). Additional data will be collected in coordination with the
Trichoptera barcode initiative in order to extend the utility of these sequences
to phylogenetics. Training in all aspects of modern taxonomic and phylogenetic
methods will be provided to undergraduate and graduate students during this
research. This work will also have an impact on human health because Trichoptera
are extensively used in biomonitoring for water-quality assessment.
