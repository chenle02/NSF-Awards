This Chemistry Division award supports the continuation of a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of South Carolina.
Catherine Murphy is the site's Program Director and Hans-Conrad zur Loye is the
Co-Program Director. Fifteen faculty will serve as REU student mentors. Over the
award period (2002-2004), ten students will be supported each summer in a ten-
week program. Increased minority participation is planned through working with
the NSF AMP program at the University of South Carolina. Students will
participate in a variety of synthesis and characterization approaches to study
the novel properties of materials with structures ordered on the nanometer
scale. Planned activities include a symposia, laboratory and lecture tutorials,
and social functions to stimulate student-faculty interaction and student-
student communications. A series of assessments are planned throughout both the
summer program and following the summer, which includes evaluations from both
the research mentors and the students and following the progress of the student
after the program. &lt;br/&gt;
