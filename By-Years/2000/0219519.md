P.I. Webster, Donald (Georgia Tech) Proposal #: 0219519&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
PIs propose to develop a new apparatus to simulate oceanic turbulence in the
laboratory. The work proposed is a one-year effort to complete the design,
construct, and validate the apparatus. The proposed equipment is superior to
traditional designs, such as grid-oscillating tanks, because of greater
isotropy, improved homogeneity, increased simplicity, increased controllability,
increased transportability, and reduced cost. The system consists of a cubic
Plexiglas box with an actuator located at each corner. Each actuator
alternatively forces fluid out of and draws fluid into a small hole in the box
wall. This action induces a turbulent pulsed jet originating from each corner
aimed at the box center; the net result of the eight actuators is a highly
isotropic and homogeneous turbulent region in the volume surrounding the box
center. This system is based on a previous apparatus constructed for use with
gases. Once validated, the system will have broad application for research in
physical and biological oceanography as well as fundamental fluid mechanics.
