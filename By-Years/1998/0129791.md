This award renews support of the International Collection of Vesicular-
Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (INVAM) at West Virginia University Research
Collection. The collected fungi are soil-borne organisms that form mutualistic
symbiotic associations with the roots of at least 80% of all terrestrial plant
species. INVAM is the largest public collection of such fungi, with 1061
accessions at present. This award provides support to INVAM's continued
operation of the collection. This includes characterization and preservation of
collected germplasm , distribution of germplasm sources to user groups
worldwide, centralization of information in an extensive Internet website, and
education and training related to use and operation of the collection. In
addition, this award will support the implementation of lyophilization and other
long-term storage means to circumvent the use of serial culture.
