Collaborative Research on Corporate Governance as an Endogenous Economic
Institution The research outlined in this proposal aims to understand factors
affecting corporate board structure and the effect of structure on board
effectiveness. The theoretical basis of the work is a model in which CEOs who
perform well gain bargaining power in negotiating corporate governance which
reduces the effectiveness of boards at monitoring. The research proposes to test
implications of the theory on three data sets which are to be collected: a 60
year panel data set on the evolution of corporate governance systems; a panel
data set on the governance of medical charities, and a data set of stock prices
and CEO changes. Refinements of the theoretical model (e.g., allowing for free
riding of board members) will also be investigated.
