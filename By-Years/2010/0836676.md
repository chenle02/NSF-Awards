Mathematical Sciences (21) This project is reformulating the standard 3-semester
calculus sequence-primarily by changing the sequencing of topics-so that the
first two semesters constitute an appropriate 2-course sequence for students in
the life sciences, economics, and chemistry, while enhancing the calculus
experience for the math, physics, and engineering majors for whom the
traditional calculus sequence was developed in the first place. The work is
being done to achieve four specific goals: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The project
is conducting a thorough examination of the topics that are needed by calculus
students in STEM disciplines, as well as a careful evaluation of where in the
calculus sequence those topics should be covered. These tasks are being
undertaken by the PI and co-PI, with the assistance of an advisory board
consisting of six faculty members from STEM disciplines and economics at the
University of Evansville and a mathematics advisory board consisting of five
faculty members from mathematics departments at a variety of institutions,
including private and public universities and a community college.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. The project is developing a curriculum that is
sequenced to deliver a common core of topics and is supplemented with
interdisciplinary and discipline-specific projects. The principal investigators
are the authors for these materials, while the University of Evansville advisory
board is assisting with identifying topics for applications and projects. Course
materials are being classroom tested at the University of Evansville.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. The project is assessing the effectiveness of the
curriculum and using the results of the assessment to further refine and expand
the curriculum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. The project is encouraging other
mathematics educators to use the new curriculum by giving presentations at
professional meetings and making course materials readily available for
classroom testing.
