The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Chemistry Division at the
National Science Foundation supports the research of Professors Joseph S.
Francisco and Sabre Kais both from Purdue University who will examine how free
radicals contribute to numerous significant chemical processes in the
atmosphere. Aerosols and cloud droplets play an important role in both the
removal and the conversion of gases in the atmosphere. The interactions between
gas-phase species on liquid surfaces are central to understanding chemistry at
these interfaces. The overall goal of this award is to provide a theoretical
framework, based on first principles including classical and ab initio molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations, density functional theory combined with finite
element methods for Car-Parrinello simulations, and finite size scaling for
universal behavior of free energies and other thermodynamic quantities to
understand how atmospheric free radicals accommodate and react at the gas-liquid
interface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results of this project will help improve our
understanding of the contribution to radical accommodation and uptake leading to
more effective pollution control strategies as well as the improvement in air
quality for pollutants whose chemistry is highly coupled to atmospheric free
radicals. This multidisciplinary project will bring both undergraduate and
graduate students from the departments of Chemistry and Earth and Atmospheric
Sciences into the research environment. Moreover, this project will promote and
support broader efforts to recruit minority and underrepresented graduate
students to the chemical physics program at Purdue University.
