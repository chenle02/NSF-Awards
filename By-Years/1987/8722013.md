The proposed research deals with the teaching profession in the United States
from 1860 to 1940. The goal is to create a data archive on teachers throughout
the nation over this historical period, drawing on census data as well as annual
reports on teachers in selected cities. This research will provide an excellent
data set that will permit analysis of stability and change in teachers' social
origins, demographic characteristics and labor market experiences. This rich
archive can be used to illuminate the development of the teaching profession,
but will also be useful in studying the sociology of labor markets and
occupations more generally.
