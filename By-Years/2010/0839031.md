Severinghaus/0839031 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law
111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a project to develop a precise
gas-based chronology for an archive of large-volume samples of the ancient
atmosphere, which would enable ultra-trace gas measurements that are currently
precluded by sample size limitations of ice cores. The intellectual merit of the
proposed work is that it will provide a critical test of the "clathrate
hypothesis" that methane clathrates contributed to the two abrupt atmospheric
methane concentration increases during the last deglaciation 15 and 11 kyr ago.
This approach employs large volumes of ice (&gt;1 ton) to measure carbon-14 on
past atmospheric methane across the abrupt events. Carbon-14 is an ideal
discriminator of fossil sources of methane to the atmosphere, because most
methane sources (e.g., wetlands, termites, biomass burning) are rich in
carbon-14, whereas clathrates and other fossil sources are devoid of carbon-14.
The proposed work is a logical extension to Taylor Glacier, Antarctica, of an
approach pioneered at the margin of the Greenland ice sheet over the past 7
years. The Greenland work found higher-than-expected carbon-14 values, likely
due in part to contaminants stemming from the high impurity content of Greenland
ice and the interaction of the ice with sediments from the glacier bed. The data
also pointed to the possibility of a previously unknown process, in-situ
cosmogenic production of carbon-14 methane (radiomethane) in the ice matrix.
Antarctic ice in Taylor Glacier is orders of magnitude cleaner than the ice at
the Greenland site, and is much colder and less stratigraphically disturbed,
offering the potential for a clear resolution of this puzzle and a definitive
test of the cosmogenic radiomethane hypothesis. Even if cosmogenic radiomethane
in ice is found, it still may be possible to reconstruct atmospheric
radiomethane with a correction enabled by a detailed understanding of the
process, which will be sought by co-measuring carbon-14 in carbon monoxide and
carbon dioxide. The broader impacts of the proposed work are that the clathrate
test may shed light on the stability of the clathrate reservoir and its
potential for climate feedbacks under human-induced warming. Development of
Taylor Glacier as a "horizontal ice core" would provide a community resource for
other researchers. Education of one postdoc, one graduate student, and one
undergraduate, would add to human resources. This award has field work in
Antarctica.
