J. V. Ortiz of Kansas State University is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry program to continue his research on the electronic
structure of metal oxide clusters, nucleotides and metal complexes, as well as
computational studies of electronic binding energies of double Rydberg anions.
Theoretical methods based on electron propagator theory are being used,
including a generalization of diagonal self-energy approximations to open-shell
species. The project involves collaborations with scientists in Mexico, Chile
and other Spanish-speaking countries where the PI has engaged in outreach and
other activities for recruiting hispanic scientists.
