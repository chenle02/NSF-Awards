9405404 Bebout This award will support a detailed ion microprobe study of trace
element mobility during subduction zone metamorphism. The research will provide
fundamental observations regarding the partitioning of various trace elements
(B, Be, Li, Cs, Rb, Sr, Ba, Ce, U, Zr, Nb, Y) among minerals in the Catalina
Schist, California, which spans a wide range of P-T conditions (300-750oC, 5-11
Kb). An understanding of the magnitude and mechanisms of compositional
modification of subducted rocks is essential to unraveling the complex,
fractionated trace element signatures in arc volcanic rocks.
