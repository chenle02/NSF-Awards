The Fourteenth International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 14) is
scheduled to be held in Melbourne, Australia, May 11-15, 1992. Tony Montgomery,
from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, is general chair and Lori A.
Clarke, from the University of Massachusetts, and Carlo Ghezzi, from the
Politecnico de Milano, are Program co-chairs. The requested travel funds are to
help defray the high cost of travel to Australia. Many researchers do not have
funds to fully support such a trip. Travel funds from this grant would be
distributed by the two ICSE 14 program chairs and a small subcommittee selected
from the program committee members. All authors of papers and abstracts and
panel speakers will be notified about the availability of travel funds and asked
to submit an application if such funds are desired. Applications instructions
will ask for information about current travel funds and for a current curricula
vita or resume. Priority will be given to authors of papers and to young
developing researchers.
