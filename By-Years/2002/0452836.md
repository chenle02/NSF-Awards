ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF-funded REU Site at New York
University offers opportunities for basic research in the field of neural
science. The objective of this field of science is to understand the biological
basis of brain functions involving sensory perception, cognition, memory,
learning, planning and emotion. At the Center for Neural Science (CNS), in
particular, undergraduates are mentored to in several areas: cellular biology of
learning and memory, neuro-economics dealing with mechanisms that underlie
decision-making, visual neuroscience, etc. The neuroscientists at the Center
form a friendly, cohesive group, yet their scope of activities ranges from
genetics to molecular and cellular neurobiology to mathematical modeling of
neural networks. By keeping the REU group small (10 students are admitted
yearly), each student will be able to benefit from the intense, personalized
mentorship he or she receives, while also gaining knowledge about research
activities of all other participants through activities in the form of lunches,
visitation of other students' labs, and group meetings with all of the faculty
members serving as REU mentors. The program will seek to recruit under-
represented minorities from small liberal arts colleges and/or historically
black colleges. Rather than using SAT or GPA scores, the key requirement for
selection will be that students have demonstrated keen interest in neural
science research and are self-driven and inquisitive. More information is
