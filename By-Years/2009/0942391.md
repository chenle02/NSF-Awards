Chico State, Western Washington University and Whatcom Community College are
collaboratively developing and testing 15-weeks of life science learning
materials for prospective (K-8) elementary teachers. This curriculum is based on
a previously designed ten week course entitled "Investigating the Flow of Matter
and Energy in Living Systems" that has already been adopted by several schools.
Using a constructivist, inquiry-based approach, each unit begins with an
assessment of students' prior knowledge and ends with a reflection comparing
their initial ideas and their new scientific understanding. Students are
encouraged to structure their own learning with the hopes they will adopt both
student-centered pedagogy and the constructivist approach to curriculum
development in their teaching.
