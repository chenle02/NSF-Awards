The Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS)
Simulation Society Research Workshop is a periodic event to convene researchers
in simulation methods around an emerging research theme, with a stated goal of
encouraging participation of graduate students and junior researchers working in
simulation and related areas. The theme of the 6th Workshop is "From Data to
Decision Making: Contending with Uncertainty and Non-stationarity in Simulation
Research", and this version of the workshop will feature a day-long simulation
summer school for graduate students and junior faculty members on foundational
topics in simulation modeling. This award will provide funds for eight graduate
students and junior faculty to attend the Workshop and Summer School, each of
whom will be presenting his or her talk or poster at the workshop. Participation
in the Workshop and Summer School will provide students and junior faculty with
an opportunity to highlight their ongoing work and network with other
researchers from industry and academia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 6th INFORMS
Simulation Society Research Workshop will be held June 22-24, 2020, in
University Park, Pennsylvania. The solicitation for the travel support
opportunity will be sent to a variety of mailing lists, with particular effort
to broaden participation by attracting students and junior faculty from
underrepresented groups in engineering. By providing travel funds for graduate
students and junior faculty, NSF will help to decrease the cost of attendance to
encourage participation of students and will support the engagement of STEM
students in emerging research in the field of
simulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
