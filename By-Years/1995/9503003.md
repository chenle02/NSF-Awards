This study will investigate mechanisms for scattering high- frequency (HF) radio
waves from the mesosphere. The data to be used were obtained by a radar facility
near Midland, Texas, during a seven-day campaign in March 1994. The results will
help answer some long-standing questions regarding mesospheric scattering
processes and remote sensing in the HF band. A new technique for calculating
momentum flux will be implemented and compared with more established methods of
momentum flux estimation.
