This project will investigate the complexity of problems in logics. The focus
will be on results that classify the complexity of an infinite number of
problems. The first such result dates from 1978, when Schaefer proved his famous
dichotomy theorem for generalized satisfiability problems. He defined an
infinite number of propositional satisfiability problems (nowadays usually
called Boolean constraint satisfaction problems), showed that all these
satisfiability problems are either in P or NP-complete, and gave a simple
criterion to determine which of the two cases holds. In recent years, quite a
few dichotomy theorems have been shown about problems in logics. Almost all of
these problems have the following three properties in common: They are
variations of satisfiability, they are problems in propositional logic, and they
use Schaefer's constraint framework.

This project's goal is to extend the existing research in three different
directions, seeking dichotomy theorems for problems that are not related to
satisfiability, for problems in logics other than propositional logic, and for
frameworks other than Schaefer's constraint framework.

Broader Impacts:

Through her school's commitment to, as voluntary cost-sharing, reduce the
proposer's teaching load by one course per year, and through the direct support
of her summer months, this grant will have the broader impact of helping support
research at an undergraduate institution. This harmonizes well with RIT's desire
to become a more research-friendly institution. The travel support will allow
the proposer and her students to attend conferences to develop professionally
via learning of new advances, and presenting their results to the broader theory
community.
