The nervous system of multicellular organisms is a complex network of diverse
cell types with unique positions and patterns of connectivity. Understanding how
these cellular phenotypes develop form these intricate patterns is a central
problem in cell and developmental biology. The Drosophila compound eye is well
suited for studying these processes. The research is aimed at understanding the
cellular interactions involved in pattern formation in the developing eye,
specifically the role of photoreceptor cell R8 which is thought to play a
central role in these events. The investigators have recently identified a new
genetic locus rap (retina aberrant in pattern) whose functions are critical for
pattern formation in eye. Studies with a temperature sensitive mutant have shown
that rap function is essential during pattern formation and preliminary
immunocytological studies indicate that rap gene function is involved in early
events during pattern formation. In addition, genetic mosaic studies show that
rap gene function is required only in the Photoreceptor cell R8 for normal eye
pattern formation. The research is aimed at a genetic and molecular analysis of
the rap gene with a view to understanding the molecular nature of the rap gene
product and its expression patterns. Futhermore, the genetic interactions that
are important for rap function will be identified. These studies will facilitate
an understanding of the nature of cellular interactions underlying neural
pattern formation.
