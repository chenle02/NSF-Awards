Synthetic diamond cutters can significantly improve rock drilling operations
under some cutting conditions, but at a critical surface speed the effectiveness
of the drill drops off precipitously. It is felt that this phenomena is
associated with the decrease in mechanical strength which accompanies an
increase in cutter temperature. In the research proposed the temperature near
the cutter surface will be measured when granite cylinders are turned in a lathe
using a single diamond cutter. Thermocouples mounted in the tool will provide
the temperature as a function of cutting parameters (speed, cooling rate, flank
wear), and will be correlated with force measurements from a 3-D force
dynamometer. A previously developed finite element code will be used to
interpret the temperature measurements, and the experimental date will be used
to validate the code's predictive ability. Successful completion of the research
plan will permit the design of field tests, which in turn could lead to a
strategy for monitoring and controlling the down-hole cutter temperature. This
would favorably impact the drill life while speeding the well drilling
operation, resulting in significant savings for deep oil reservoirs in hostile
locations.
