This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, focuses on the development of an understanding of the process of
underpotential deposition of metals on single crystal and deliberately stepped
metal surfaces. Professor Abruna and his students at Cornell University will use
a combination of dynamic electrochemical methods and X-ray scattering probes
such as EXAFS and X-ray surface diffraction to study these processes. Real-time
growth of silver and copper electrodeposited on platinum electrodes will be
examined, and the effect on the structure of the adsorbed layer by halides and
pseudo-halides will be characterized. This information is crucial to the
understanding the science and technology of electroplating and thin film growth.
Studies of the processes involved in the electrochemical deposition of thin
metal films on metal substrates is the focus of this research project. X-ray and
electrochemical methods will be used to characterize the interfacial structures
as they are formed during the deposition process. This information is useful for
understanding technologically important processes such as electroplating and
corrosion inhibition.
