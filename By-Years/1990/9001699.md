This proposal requests support for renovation of the cineradiographic
instrumentation in the Museum of Comparative Zoology. Established in 1974 with
funds from the National Science Foundation and with construction provided by
Harvard University, the cineradiographic facility is a unique research resource
that is extensively used in experimental investigations of biomechanics,
locomotion, feeding and respiration in representatives of every vertebrate
class. The apparatus, which simultaneously provides cinefluorographic imagery
and permanent (16 mm) film records at speed of 50 - 200 frames/second, is in
urgent need of engineering overhaul and replacement of parts. Current and
anticipated future use of this facility, which is essential to the future
development of organismal biology, depends upon upgrading the equipment.
