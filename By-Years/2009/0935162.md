This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This engineering education research
award to San Jose State University will integrate fundamental concepts of
sustainability into two core lower division engineering courses (Introduction to
Engineering and Introduction to Materials). This project is part of a major
initiative of the college of engineering to promote, coordinate and facilitate
research, curriculum and activities related to the development and
implementation of green and sustainable engineering practices. The outcome of
the project will be teaching modules covering the topics of renewable and non-
renewable energy sources, energy conversion and efficiency, energy and water,
and product life cycle analysis. The teaching modules, along with the
accompanying equipment and software, will be disseminated widely and in
particular to the community colleges from which San Jose State receives transfer
students. The overall goal is to better prepare students for the practice of
engineering through developing their understanding of environmental
sustainability. These techniques are expected to increase student's interest in
engineering and will enhance the number who complete engineering degrees and are
ready to fill engineering jobs.
