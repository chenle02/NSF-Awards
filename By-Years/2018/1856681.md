The 17th annual Graduate Student Topology and Geometry Conference is to be held
at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign from March 30-31, 2019. It is
specifically aimed at graduate students, and many of the talks will be delivered
by student participants. The conference will represent a large body of students
in different stages of their Ph.D., and will provide a venue for students from a
diverse collection of institutions and geographic regions to come together and
interact. It aims to create a highly collaborative environment that will
stimulate research and foster lasting connections between researchers at
particularly crucial moments early in their careers. The structure of the
conference (e.g. the lightning talk sessions and brown bag lunch) is designed to
encourage future collaborations to strengthen the pool of researchers in this
area. The conference will allow graduate students to hear about cutting edge
research from established senior leaders and early career faculty.

The goal of this conference is to provide a venue for young researchers to be
exposed to new research areas, and present their own work in a productive and
welcoming environment, while having the chance to engage with experts in the
field. Particular attention will be paid to ensure that a broad collection of
topics are represented, so that rising generations of mathematicians are aware
of the current frontiers of geometry and topology. To this end, there will also
be talks by distinguished plenary speakers. These presentations will cover a
range of topics in topology and geometry including homotopy theory, low
dimensional topology, geometric group theory, geometric analysis, geometric
topology, and dynamics. The conference website is:
