The objective is the development of a cost-effective dynamic monitoring system
for steel bridges and other steel structures with permanently instrumented
sensors and computer integrated signal processing techniques. The theoretical
basis of this monitoring system is the "Vibrational Signatures Analysis:. In
addition to hardware and software development, this monitoring system will be
implemented on a 2/5 scale five story steel structure and a 1/6 scale model
bridge cooperatively with the NY State DOT. These two tasks are designed to
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system subject to a variety of
loading and environmental conditions. //
