9712916 Su This proposal seeks to improve the production of heterologous
proteins in plant cell culture by integration of three new technologies: anew
promoter; anew reporter gene; and an improved perfusion bioreactor. The recently
identified strong, inducible, acid phosphatase promoter and signal sequence in
Anchusa officinalis will be used in conjunction with the green fluorescent
protein (GFP) gene as a reporter protein to monitor and optimize expression and
secretion. A perfusion bioreactor will be designed to enhance continuous
production of secreted proteins. ***
