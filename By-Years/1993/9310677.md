It has been 40 years since the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA
and it is appropriate for the 58th Cold Spring Harbor Symposium of Quantitative
Biology to have as its theme "DNA and Chromosomes. The meeting will be held at
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories from June 2,-June 9, 1993, bringing together
approximately 350-450 scientists from around the world. The meeting will bring
together many of the leading investigators as well as a significant number of
younger scientists in a setting conducive to intense discussion and
interactions. %%% The research discussed at this meeting will have an impact on
all areas of biology in many different organisms and experimental systems.
Understanding the role of chromosome structure on DNA metabolism is at a
critical stage and this meeting should help to catalyze further advances.
