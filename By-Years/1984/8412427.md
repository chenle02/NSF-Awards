This research focuses on a class of semiconductor devices which employ localized
state charge storage in cryogenic environments. The devices are based on quantum
mechanical effects which can be extremely fast or extremely slow depending on
the strength of applied electric fields. The proposed work builds upon research
performed by the Principal Investigator in recent years.
