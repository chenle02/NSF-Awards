This award in the Research Planning Grant for women program is made by the
Chemistry Division to Dr. Sandra L. Laursen of the Department of Chemistry,
Kalamazoo College. The spin triplet state of the NH (imidogen) radical and its
reactivity with small hydrocarbon molecules in rare-gas matricies of varying
atomic number will be studied. The use of various rare gases will control the
efficiency of the spin-forbidden dissociation to the triplet state, and hence
the ratio of singlet to triplet concentrations in the initial electronic state.
The goal of the project is to clarify the role of spin multiplicity in the
dynamics of these and other excited-state reactions. The planning grant will
support purchase of a tunable light source crucial to the project and initial
studies to define suitable energy regimes.
