Shape memory metals (SMMs) are a unique group of alloys which exhibit qualities
of "memory and "trainability." These qualities make such materials prime
candidates for use in "smart" structures or as constituents in the development
of certain advanced composite materials. The use of these materials in
structural applications requires proper constitutive characterization. The goal
of this work is to design and conduct experiments on state of the art shape
memory metals in order to provide information for proper and complete continuum
materials characterization. The mechanical properties measured will form the
basis for testing, validating and calibrating appropriate theoretical models.
