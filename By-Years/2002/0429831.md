HRD-0429831&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Miami Museum of Science provides an
outstanding exemplar of how a traditional community-based agency can cast its
outreach activities to reach at-risk youth and non-traditional populations with
the effort resulting in meaningful success. The Museum has developed, sustained
and delivered a distinctive portfolio of mentoring programs to youth from
challenging economic and social circumstances that represent mostly African-
American and Chicano/Latino families for more than ten years. Many of the
science programs target K-12 learners and supplement traditional school science
curriculum using hands-on projects, field trips, and
internships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The submitted nomination package is in support
of a Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering
Mentoring (PAESMEM) to recognize outstanding mentoring efforts or programs that
enhance the participation of historically underrepresented groups in science,
mathematics, and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
