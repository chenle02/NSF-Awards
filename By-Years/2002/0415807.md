With this Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) award, the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the research of Professor Cheryl D.
Stevenson of the Department of Chemistry at Illinois State University in Normal
IL. This research will involve investigations of annulenes, cyclic systems with
conjugated double bonds, and monoannulynes, annulenes containing a triple bond.
These unusual molecules have properties that are dependent on the number of
electrons in the conjugated system. Systems with 4n+2 (n = 1,2,3 ...) electrons
are aromatic and stable while systems with 4n electrons are antiaromatic and
generally unstable. In this research, Professor Stevenson will generate a series
of highly reactive antiaromatic annulenes and monoannulynes and study the
properties of these interesting species, which have received little attention.
These unstable molecules will be investigated by low temperature NMR
spectroscopy and reduced to their more stable radical anions, which will be
studied by ESR spectroscopy. These investigations will be accompanied by
sophisticated computational studies involving spectral simulation and quantum
mechanical investigations. Much of this work, which has been ongoing in the PI's
laboratory for many years, will be carried out by undergraduate students. In
this way the project will serve as a training ground and inspiration for young
scientists who will be encouraged to pursue careers in science.
