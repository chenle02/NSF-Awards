Partial differential equations are ubiquitous in models of physical phenomena.
Discovering the statistics of the sets where quantum particles are least likely
to exist, describing the behavior of light waves near black holes, explaining
the existence of bands on the planet Jupiter by analyzing the equations of fluid
dynamics on a rotating sphere, and establishing the existence of solutions to
systems modeling ferromagnetism or plasmas require an analysis of partial
differential equations in the presence of background geometry. All of these are
fundamental topics that members of the team of principal investigators have
explored, and for which they are ideally situated to pass on their expertise.
The purpose of this project is to create a sustainable program that enhances and
modernizes the curriculum, enriches the training, and improves recruitment. This
will create larger and better prepared cohorts of mathematicians to advance the
understanding of the interplay between geometry and solutions to partial
differential equations.

The associated faculty will thoughtfully mentor postdoctoral, graduate student,
undergraduate student, and high school research trainees. Graduate courses that
may be taken asynchronously will be developed to broaden the curriculum. A
regular workshop will be formed to get new graduate students to engage with
research early. Developmental training groups will be designed to improve
trainees? technical writing and to guide them on aspects of academic life such
as seeking funding. An online topics course collaborative will be established to
promote sharing across academic institutions of specialized courses on cutting-
edge material. An online undergraduate research seminar will be created for the
dissemination of results from a newly formalized undergraduate research program
at the host institution and for the recruitment of new graduate students who are
conducting interesting research at other colleges and universities. The host
institution?s partial differential equations mini-school program, which allows
for trainees to interact with a principal speaker and their students, postdocs,
and co-authors in an intimate environment that permits in-depth presentations,
will be revived. Outreach activities such as a program to allow for interested
local high school students to engage with mathematical research and the Girls
Talk Math summer program will be supported. Many of the concrete needs that are
addressed are not unique to the host institution, and these initiatives offer
great benefit to a broad community of trainees.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
