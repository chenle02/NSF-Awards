Data analysis can provide a powerful and relevant approach to teaching key
mathematical skills to elementary school children. It provides a meaningful
context for the use of computation skills. It involves students directly with
important mathematical ideas that are applicable to science, social science, and
problem solving. It is a vehicle for bringing real applications of mathematics
into the classroom. It is a topic that is familiar to teachers. And calculators
and computers provide tools for collecting and analyzing data in the classroom
that previously have not been available. This project will develop
recommendations, prototype materials, and calculator and computer activities to
be infused into a new K-6 curriculum strand on data analysis. The materials will
emphasize age- appropriate data analysis skills such as counting, comparing,
classifying, looking for patterns, finding central tendencies and variation, and
predicting trends. This project will target a broad range of students,
especially those who have historically been underserved (girls, minorities, and
disadvantaged students). Project materials will reach approximately 10,000
teachers through a network that will distribute a newsletter as well as the
student materials. Videotapes will be produced for use in teacher education.
