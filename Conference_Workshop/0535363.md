The Department of Mathematics at the University of Miami will host a Winter
Conference and School in December 2005 entitled "Arithmetic, Algebraic and
Symplectic Geometry". The conference will focus on promotion and incorporation
of recent advances in higher dimensional algebraic geometry into arithmetic and
symplectic research directions and the creation of new bridges between
projective geometry and foliation theory, between singularity theory and
reconstructive Galois problems and between the geometry of coherent sheaves and
symplectic topology. The award will support junior researchers and graduate
students from U.S. institutions and will enable the dissemination of geometric
techniques among the new generation of young scientists.

The conference will address difficult classical questions about the hidden
symmetries of the physical world, the large scale structure of space-time and
the properties of matter at high energies. This activity aims to advance our
understanding of the mathematical methodology necessary to handle such questions
and to produce results applicable in stringy physics, soft condensed matter
theory and mathematical biology.
