The cooperative research program (`Energy and Charge Transfer with
Functionalized Phenols-Time-Resolved Photochemical and Radiation Chemical
Experiments`) is intended to initiate a collaboration between the Notre Dame
Radiation Laboratory (NDRL) and the Interdisciplinary Research Group on Time
Resolved Spectroscopy (IAG) at the University of Leipzig. Until now, the two
laboratories had been independently using two of the most powerful time-resolved
spectroscopic techniques (viz., pulse radiolysis and flash photolysis), but with
different detection methods: Fourier Transformed Electron Paramagnetic Resonance
at IAG and Raman spectroscopy and conductivity measurements at NRDL. The
combination of the unique methodologies along with the IAG's outstanding
expertise in the field of sterically hindered phenols and the NDRL's strong
background in charge and energy transfer processes promises a significant
advancement in the free-radical related chemistry of an important class of
chemical compounds.
