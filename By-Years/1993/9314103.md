9314103 EVANS In this project the PIs will carry out a series of experiments
relevant to understanding the rheological behavior of the oceanic lithosphere.
They will perform deformation experiments on serpentine and olivine aggregates
in the presence/absence of fluids. An important goal of their study is to
determine the brittle/plastic transition in their starting materials as a
function of fluid activity and grain size.
