AST-9313929. California Institute of Technology. PI: T. G. Phillips Astronomical
Studies with the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory This award supports research,
technological development and student education at the Caltech Submillimeter
Observatory (CSO). The Observatory consists of a precision 10.4m antenna
enclosed in a dome located near the summit of Mauna Kea, Hawaii. The CSO's
mission is to carry out spectroscopic and continuum observations of astronomical
objects in the wavelength range 1mm-350 m; the opacity of the Earth's atmosphere
to radiation at these wavelengths is the reason for the observatory's location
at an altitude of nearly 4,300m. The observatory was constructed with funds from
the National Science Foundation (NSF) during the period 1984-1987. As of this
writing, it is presently the only US facility capable of operations throughout
the submillimeter atmospheric window. Over the next three years, the CSO will
continue to study the physics and chemistry of the interstellar medium in the
Milky Way and other galaxies. This research will be carried out primarily
through spectral line surveys, searches for new hydride molecules and by
observing major interstellar cloud cooling lines, notably those of atomic
carbon. Planned technical developments include the installation of a chopping
secondary reflector, new feed legs and new Cassegrain optics which will allow
the introduction of bolometer and SiS focal plane array receivers. ***
