With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Schick and her colleagues
will conduct one season of archaeological fieldwork in the Nihewan Basin, Hebei
Province, northern China. This region holds some of the earliest documented
archaeological evidence for early hominid occupation of eastern Asia. A number
of sites from the Early and Middle Pleistocene, ranging from approximately 1.0
to 0.5 million years in age and been identified and several have been excavated
within the past two decades. The Nihewan basin is particularly important because
of the excellent conditions of preservation at both archaeological and
paleontological sites and thus the great potential for behavioral and
environmental reconstructions during this important time period of human
evolution and population dispersal. Dr. Schick and her colleagues have located
within the Basin a new area which appears rich in archaeological sites. During a
2-month field season they will investigate the distribution, chronology and
context of these sites. They will conduct systematic survey and test excavation
to tie these occurrences in with sites previously investigated. The work will
also integrate the sites into the larger geological and environmental setting
and allow reconstruction of the subsistence strategies these early humans
employed. It will also provide the basis for future larger scale excavation.
Archaeologists know that the earliest hominids first appeared in Africa and only
later spread to other parts of the world. While many African sites have been
excavated to provide insight into hominid adaptation, very little is known about
how these peoples spread to other continents and adapted the very different
environmental conditions which confronted them. The research which Dr. Schick
and her colleagues will conduct should help to remedy this. The information
collected will be of interest to many archaeologists.
