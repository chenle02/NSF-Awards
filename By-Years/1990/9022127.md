A new process for direct processing of light weight alloys by fused salt
electrolysis using low cost lithium oxide as a lithium source will be
investigated. The principal objective of the research is to develop physico-
chemical information that can be applied to the direct processing of aluminum-
lithium alloys for use in the manufacture of high strength, low density
structures. Specifically, the research will address the determination of the
following fundamental information: a) The solubility of lithium oxide in calcium
fluoride-lithium fluoride melts will be determined as a function of melt
composition and temperature. b) The anodic overvoltage on graphite during the
electrolysis of calcium fluoride-lithium fluoride-lithium oxide melts will be
measured. Anode reaction mechanism and limiting current density region will be
evaluated. c) Efficiency of electrolysis will be determined. Effect of
temperature, electrolyte composition, anode and cathode current densities,
electrode spacing and stirring of the cathode pool on efficiency will be
evaluated. The method for processing of aluminum-lithium alloys will be less
expensive, use low cost lithium compound feed and save energy by directly
producing aluminum-lithium alloys within the electrolytic cell.
