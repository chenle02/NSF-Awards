ABSTRACT CTS-9421661 An experimental investigation and corresponding theoretical
studies of gas-particle suspension flow in vertical pipes will be undertaken.
Particle concentration and velocity distributions will be measured in the pipe
cross-section using the techniques of electrical capacitance tomography (ECT).
The concentration fluctuations and their spatial will be measured and spatially
correlated. A twin-plane system will allow to obtain the particle velocity from
the cross-correlation of concentration fluctuations. The results will be used to
improved basic understanding of the two-phase flow phenomena and calibrate
numerical simulations. The research has relevance to the design and operation of
fluidized beds, pneumatic transport, silos, solid feed hoppers, and other
equipment in particle processing industries. ***
