This research involves the mathematical theory of probability and its
application, and consists of largely independent investigations by two principal
investigator, Professors Dai and Hill. Professor Dai's research will mainly
focus on queueing networks, which arise from computer networks and manufacturing
systems. It includes justification of the Brownian approximation for multiclass
queueing networks, understanding network performance when it is heavily loaded,
and computation of stationary distribution of a reflected Brownian motion. The
ultimate goal is to develop a robust set of computer software tools that can
accurately and efficiently predict the performance of a wide class of queueing
networks. Professor Hill's research includes: optimal stopping problems,
especially order selection and minimax rules; partitioning or fair-division
problems in probability and statistics; one-sided limit laws and probability
bounds, especially for means and quantiles; and fusions of probabilities and
their relationship to dilation, convex domination and martingales. The principal
investigators will carry out research in both theoretical and applied aspects of
probability. The more applied topics include investigating the performance of
queueing networks (inter-connected service facilities populated by randomly
arriving customers with random amounts of service requirements) which arise from
computer networks and manufacturing systems, and investigating optimal stopping
theory (sequential analysis of time dependent random processes such as pollution
levels in a city or stock prices). At one extreme, this research is aimed at
developing practical computer software tools that can accurately and efficiently
predict the performance of a wide class of random systems, and at the other
extreme it is aimed at discovering new basic mathematical theorems in abstract
spaces and settings.
