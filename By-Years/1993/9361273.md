9361273 Kumar In this proposal, a high speed field emission triode device is
described which does not require high vacumm for operation. This is enabled by
coating a micro-tip cathode with recently invented very low work function
diamond time film, such that the electric field to extract electrons from the
cathode is less than 5 volts per micrometer. Hence a voltage of only 5 volts
need be applied between the cathode and the grid to extract electrons making
this device compatible with standard semiconductor electronics. At the same
time, low voltage electrons have mean free paths in air which are longer than
the cathode-anode separation, thereby a non-vacuum operation of such a device
may be possible. In phase I, we propose to demonstrate the feasibility of such a
high speed device by designing, computer modeling and fabrication diode and
triode type field emitter devices. ***
