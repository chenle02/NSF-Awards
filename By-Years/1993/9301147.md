Dr. Thomas J. Wandless has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Wandless' doctoral degree was from Harvard University under the
supervision of Professor Stuart Schreiber. Dr. Wandless will continue his
research at Harvard Medical School under the sponsorship of Professor
Christopher Walsh. Dr. Wandless' postdoctoral training will provide him with the
tools of molecular biology necessary to study the interplay between protein
kinases and phosphatases and how they modulate distinct signal transduction
pathways. Longer term, he plans to study neuroactive peptides and their
receptors, biological mechanisms of the action of natural products and the role
of carbohydrates in defining the strength and specifity of protein-protein
interactions. %%% The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is
viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge
and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in
contemporary chemical research and teaching.
