This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr. Anslyn's Postdoctoral
Fellowship in Chemistry Award in support of his research at the University of
Texas/Austin. The goal of the research is the design and synthesis of man-made
hosts for the recognition and binding of carbohydrates in aqueous media. A
glucose-6-phosphate binding host will be designed and synthesized. The design
method will be based on a diamond lattice grid which allows for quick
identification of possible sites for molecular binding interactions between host
and guest. The host will possess an enforced cavity with molecular recognition
sites that are pre-organized and similar to those used by carbohydrate
sequestering enzymes.
