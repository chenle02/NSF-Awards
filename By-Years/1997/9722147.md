Research in theoretical particle physics will explore the emerging interface
between superstring theory and quantum field theories of elementary particles.
The implications of string theory for quantum field theories, and of exact
solutions of quantum field theories for string theory, will be studied in
detail. Specific research areas will include phase transitions and symmetry
breaking, within the context of exactly solvable quantum field theories. The
quantum field theories in question are natural extensions of the theories
describing quarks and gluons, and are of great phenomenological as well as
theoretical interest. Their high degree of solvability makes it possible to
address a number of central yet otherwise-intractible questions about elementary
particles.
