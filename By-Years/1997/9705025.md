9705025 Walton The possibility and characteristics of a high-power erbium-fiber
amplifier pumped with an ytterbium-doped-fiber laser will be investigated at
Howard University. By designing a double-clad ytterbium-doped fiber,
diffraction-limited power at 980 nm can be obtained by pumping with inexpensive
laser diode arrays. This fiber laser will then be used as a compact pump source
for standard, "off-the-shelf" erbium-doped fiber amplifiers which are optimized
for pumping in the 980-nm absorption band. The ytterbium-doped fiber laser will
be an enabling technology for telecommunications. Further, the lasing wavelength
can be tuned to pump prasedymium-doped fiber lasers in second telecommunications
window (1310 nm) and thulium-doped amplifiers and lasers that operate at 450 nm,
485 nm, 800 nm, 1400 nm, 2100 nm. ***
