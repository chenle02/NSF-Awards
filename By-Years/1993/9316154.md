9316154 Zeitler This award provides 64 % of the funds needed to implement
automation of the analytical procedures used in the argon dating laboratory in
the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Lehigh University. The
University is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary for the
project. The Lehigh University argon dating laboratory is providing age data for
an extensive set of research projects involving the principal investigator,
students and colleagues on- and off-campus. The current and projected load of
analytical work requires that the procedures be automated. Research topics
covered in the current work of the laboratory include dating of rocks of the
Himalaya, chronology of the rock samples in the KTB deep borehole project in
Germany, thermochronology of the rocks recovered from the Newark Basin
scientific drilling project, and dating of the Manson Impact Structure in the
U.S. ***
