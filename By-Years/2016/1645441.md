The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is based on
innovations that can help to secure industrial control systems (ICSs) that
control the Nation's most critical infrastructure (e.g., the electric power
grid, critical manufacturing plants, waste water treatment plants, etc.). The
goal of this team's technology is to help minimize compromises that can lead to
loss of life, widespread blackouts, environmental disasters, and financial loss.
Attacks against ICS operators are increasing each years at the same time that
barriers to entry for threat actors seeking to target ICSs are reducing. This
I-Corps team developed technology that can detect various attacks on ICSs. The
commercial opportunity for this technology is significant. This project explores
the commercialization that may lead to a comprehensive ICS security platform
that reduces attacks on critical infrastructure ICSs, thus saving lives and
minimizing financial loss.

This I-Corps project utilizes novel techniques to enhance intrusion detection,
access control, network management, and malware detection for industrial control
systems (ICSs). During the I-Corps program, this team will explore the uses and
potential for commercialization of device fingerprinting techniques that
leverage the two fundamental actions of ICSs (data acquisition and physical
actuation) and a network-based method for detecting the compromise of
programmable logic controllers (PLCs). The I-Corps program will allow the team
to understand the most significant threats at organizations that use ICSs. This
information will be used to enable the team to prioritize their feature
development and to develop an optimal go-to-market strategy.
