9405537 Vermeij PI will examine evolution and function of labral spines in
gastropods, Oligocene to Recent, including experiments on modern gastropods and
systematics of the studied groups. Many attributes of organisms are
interpretable as adaptations that enhance an individual's competitive ability or
defensive performance; under what conditions do such adaptations evolve and
spread? This study will test the hypothesis that enemy-related adaptations of
marine species mainly arose in lineages found in warm, productive waters. The
work will contribute to an understanding of biological escalation and serve as
an example of the integrated approach to answering fundamental questions in
evolutionary biology, and of the macroeconomic perspective on the history of
life.
