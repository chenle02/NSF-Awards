This Phase I Noyce STEM Teachers Scholars project is a collaborative venture of
the College of Education, the Bagley College of Engineering, and the College of
Arts and Sciences at Mississippi State University. It is providing scholarships
for three cohorts of students preparing to be mathematics and science teachers
for grades 7-12. Over the five year life of the project it is awarding
scholarships ($10,000 per year) to 20 undergraduates pursuing a double major in
chemistry, biology, physics, mathematics or engineering and science or math
education, and awarding six stipends ($15,000 each) to STEM professionals
pursuing a Master's of Arts in Teaching at the secondary level in order to enter
the teaching profession. Recruitment strategies include summer internships in
partnering schools, university summer programs, and community educational
organizations. School districts participating in this project are Starkville,
West Point, Oktibbeha County, and Noxubee County.
