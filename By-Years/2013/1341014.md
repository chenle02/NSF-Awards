The Trojan Express Network II (TEN-II) project at the University of Southern
California (USC) builds on existing network infrastructure to provide the next
generation of network services. TEN-II enables significant new scientific
research and education opportunities for multiple departments and research
groups. Examples include projects that need access to large data flows from
remote instruments, transfer of large data sets to or from national computing
centers or cloud-based providers, and multi-institutional research and education
collaborations that rely on the transfer of large data sets between partners in
a timely and reliable manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientific research and
education continues to be ever more data and compute intensive, and the demand
for higher performance and more reliable data transfer will continue to grow
over the next decade. The project is deploying a parallel network over existing
fiber infrastructure to provide high data-rate services to at least 6 research
laboratories across 3 facilities of the university that are geographically
dispersed around Los Angeles. The network is operated using Software Defined
Networking (SDN) technology and provides access to the campus high-performance
computing facility and to other institutions over regional, national, and
international advanced research and education networks. TEN-II authenticates the
use of the infrastructure based on users' credentials that are currently used to
access other IT services and interfaces with similar mechanisms under
development by regional and national networks.
