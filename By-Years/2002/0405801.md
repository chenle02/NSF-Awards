Second International Workshop on Microplasmas \ (Student
Support)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Second International Workshop on Microplasmas will be held at Stevens Institute
in Hoboken, NJ, on October 6-8, 2004. It is devoted to advancing the field of
microplasma processes by elucidating the basic research questions in involved in
the understanding of high-pressure plasmas with linear dimensions on the order
of micrometers, which are found to be more stable than those of larger
dimension. This meeting is intended to assemble experts from all over the world
to present recent advances in the field and to discuss the prospects of these
technologies for future development and study. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
provides funding to support the attendance at this conference of ten students.
The workshop can lead to broader impacts as follows. The conference will enhance
and promote collaboration among scientists and engineers from a variety of
disciplines and from a range of nations. It will engage a number of graduate
students in order to develop the next generation of researchers. The
intellectual merit of the conference is reflected in the high quality of the
participating researchers representing major laboratories from top institutions
worldwide. It will provide useful input to NSF as a guide to grant investments
in this evolving field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
