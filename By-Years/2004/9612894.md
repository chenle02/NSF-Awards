9612894 Krishnamurti The Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX) is an international
field experiment with participation from France, Germany, India, the
Netherlands, and the United States. The main effort under the U.S. component
focuses on assessing the role of sulfates and other continental aerosols in
global radiative forcing and is being supported jointly by the Department of
Energy and the National Science Foundation. In addition, complementary studies
involving investigations of a variety of related chemical and radiative
processes will be undertaken by scientists from other federal agencies and other
international partners. The composite observing system consists of a wide range
of platforms, from ships to aircraft, as well as surface-based and balloon
measuring systems, and satellite data. The main part of the three year effort
will be a four-month intensive field phase which begins January 1999. The
ultimate goal of this program is to obtain a better understanding of the decadal
and longer time scale climate forcing. The equatorial Indian Ocean during the
northeast winter monsoon season provides a unique natural laboratory for this
experiment. The experimental area is probably the only place in the world where
an air mass which has been modified by intense sources of continental aerosols,
anthropogenic trace species, and their reaction products (e.g., sulfates and
ozone) from the northern hemisphere comes into contact with the pristine air of
the southern hemisphere, which has been transported via cross equatorial
monsoonal flow, at the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The juxtaposition of
these two very distinct air masses will allow a thorough examination of both the
direct and indirect effects of the aerosols on the radiative properties of the
atmosphere. Dr. Krishnamurti and his colleagues will have principal
responsibility for producing the meteorological analyses for INDOEX. These
analyses will be done for planning purposes as well as for the experiment. Docu
menting the local and regional circulations is critical for understanding the
aerosol and pollutant transports and distribution and their impact on the
radiative profile at any given location. A wide variety of satellite and in situ
measurements will be assimilated with a state of the art high resolution global
model.
