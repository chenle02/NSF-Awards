Skidmore College, located in Saratoga Springs, NY, is the recipient of ARI
funds for the renovation and replacement of research and research training space
in the Dana Science Center. Erected in 1968, the Dana Science Center is home to
the Departments of Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Geology. Since the
construction of the facility, enrollment has increased by fifty percent, and
majors in both geology and physics have been established to complement the
majors in biology and chemistry. This tremendous growth has been accompanied by
a succession of minor ad hoc remodeling to the Science Center to provide
necessary, but inefficient research space. This renovation project will allow
the departments to reconfigure their research areas to provide for improved
safety, flexibility, and efficiency in meeting the research needs and desires of
students and faculty, thereby significantly enhancing both collaborative and
student research efforts. The renovation of the Science Center is one part of a
two-phase effort by Skidmore to improve its science facilities. In addition to
the modernization of existing laboratory space, the College is committed to
providing more dedicated research and teaching space by constructing an annex to
the building. Renovations will include: rearrangement of bench areas and
replacement of insufficient storage facilities, installation of new fume hoods,
separation of research space from instructional space, upgrade and replacement
of HVAC and plumbing systems respectively. Research activity in the departments
served by Dana will be enhanced by the reorganization and modernization of
laboratory space that will serve an increase number of student researchers.
Improved synergy will result from the removal of walls that serve as barriers to
effective communication. Future growth in research activities will be
accommodated without compromising safety or reducing access to facilities.
