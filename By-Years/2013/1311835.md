This award supports the analysis of photometric observations of over 100 star
clusters using the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment
(APOGEE). The PI will 1) provide a uniform calculation of star-cluster ages and
distance using uniform photometry from large surveys, 2) build a high precision
dynamical sample of open cluster tracers, and 3) determine the Galactic disk
abundance gradients using a large open cluster sample.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
APOGEE survey will provide a picture of the disk of the Milky Way galaxy that is
unrivaled in scope, richness, and detail. In turn, this research will provide
critical information for our understanding of the Milky Way in a fully
cosmological context. The PI will also make the APOGEE-derived dataset available
to the community, as well as train undergraduate and graduate students at Texas
Christian University.
