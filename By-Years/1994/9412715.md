9412715 Hayden This project involves the dissertation research of a graduate
student in cultural anthropology from the University of Pittsburgh. The student
will provide a cultural analysis of the development of the Slovak ecology
movement during Slovakia's transition from state socialism to national
independence. Using participant observation, semi- structured interviews,
archival research and a survey of individuals in several ecology organizations,
the student will trace the development of the ideology as well as the social and
political nature of these organizations in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia,
as well as in several regional centers. This project is important because it
adds to the nation's expertise about a critically important part of the world,
the former communist states of Eastern Europe. In addition the information to be
analyzed will illustrate an important social change going on, as people redefine
what the "Homeland" means from purely a nationalist definition to reflect newly
emerged environmentalist interests. ***
