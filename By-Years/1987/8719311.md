A characteristic feature of the mammalian primary somatosensory cortex is an
ordered representation of the contralateral body surface. The long term
objective of this research project is an understanding of the ontogenetic events
which contribute to the formation of these somatotopic maps. The research is
focussed on this problem in the somatosensory system of the rat because of the
discrete and easily visualized somatotopic organization within its central
nervous system. Attention will be centered on an earlier period when primary
afferents are first contacting their central targets. The research proposes to
determine the role of the periphery in establishing boundaries between
neocortical areas and delimiting the subcortical events which play a role in
this process. This problem will be approached at the light microscopic level of
analysis in both normal and fetally manipulated rats with a variety of
anatomical methods. This research should contribute to our understanding of the
factors which regulate the formation of discrete neocortical areas.
