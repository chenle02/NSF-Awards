The visible universe is heavily composed of nuclei made up of neutrons and
protons in a wide range of configurations born through the burning of stars and
even explosive astronomical events. The nuclei and their configurations are
determined by the underlying nuclear properties of matter, and determining those
properties allows better understanding of how the known and soon to be known
nuclei came to exist. One way to study the properties of nuclei is by exciting
and de-exciting the nuclear system. This award supports research that will focus
on analyzing the lifetimes of the quantum states in deformed nuclei to better
understand the way nuclei interact collectively. More specifically, the
experiments will use beams of neutrons that impinge on a nucleus to excite it,
and then detect the scattered neutron and the energy that is given off when the
nucleus de-excites. This project will also contribute to training the next
generation of scientists by actively engaging undergraduate students in research
at the University of Wisconsin La Crosse (UWL).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nature
of low-lying excitations, K^{pi} = 0+ bands in deformed nuclei remain enigmatic
in the field. This project focuses on the search for vibrational excitations in
deformed nuclei, using the (n,n' gamma) reaction. The University of Wisconsin-La
Crosse Nuclear Science Group will also conduct detector development during the
academic year in a small local laboratory. The results will be broadly
disseminated through publications and conference presentations by the PI and
undergraduate researchers.
