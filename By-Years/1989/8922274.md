Atomic experiments will be continued which are designed to find and measure
violations of space and time symmetry. Primary interest is in experiments
looking for a permanent electric dipole moment, which can exist only if time
reversal symmetry is violated. The next round of experiments on mercury atoms
could show an effect. Another experiment measures the parity violating optical
rotation in lead and thallium vapors, to test the standard theory of electroweak
unification and test other theories that predict a second z boson. Further
experiments will test interference between E1 and Stark induced M1 and E2
amplitudes on the alkali D lines, spontaneous spin polarization in alkali
vapors, and quadrupole interactions of nuclear spins.
