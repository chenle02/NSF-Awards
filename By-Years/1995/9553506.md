9553506 Florey The University of Wisconsin - Superior will initiate a 5-week
Young Scholars project for twenty students entering grades eleven and twelve in
the summers of 1996 and 1997. The disciplinary foci of the program are
mathematics, chemistry, and biology with emphasis on the deposition of acid rain
and mercury in Wisconsin and Minnesota lakes. Students use exploratory data
analysis and multiple linear regression to develop mathematical modelsof acid
rain pH. Students are introduced to ethical issues and career possibilities, as
well as developing a follow-up research project.
