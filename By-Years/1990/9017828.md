This study addresses the poorly known controls on the exchange of sediment
between the shoreface and inner continental shelf under varying fair-and storm-
weather conditions. The overall goal is to evaluate more complex interactions
between waves, currents, suspended load and bedform characterisics to improve
the understanding of shoreface erosion and accretion. Observations will be
gathered from tripod-based flow meters, suspended sediment sensors and
altimeters deployed at several sites from Virginia to Long Island. Measurements
will be used to evaluate theoretical models of shoreface response and
equilibrium adjustment. This information will be used to modify physical models.
