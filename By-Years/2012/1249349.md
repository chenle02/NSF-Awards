The National Science Foundation (NSF) is pleaserd to announce the selection of
MIT's Scott Aaronson, an Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering and
Computer Science, to receive its 2012 Alan T. Waterman Award. Dr. Aaronson works
with the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, MIT's largest
interdepartmental lab. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Waterman Award is the National
Science Foundation's (NSF) highest honor. The annual award recognizes
outstanding researchers under the age of 35 in any field of science or
engineering NSF supports. This is the first year that two awardees have been
selected. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to a medal, each of this year's
awardees will receive a $1 million grant---twice the amount of last year's award
---over a five-year period for further advanced study in his
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prof. Aaronson, a theoretical computational
scientist, pursues research interests that focus on the limitations of quantum
computers and computational complexity theory more generally. His research
addresses a variety of topics, including the information content of quantum
states, the physical resources needed for quantum computers to surpass classical
computers, and the barriers to solving computer science's vexing P versus NP
question, that is, whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified
by a computer can also be quickly solved by a computer.
