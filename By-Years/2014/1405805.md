This project is a continuation of an effort to better understand the ground
level photochemistry that causes the formation of ozone, a pollutant with
adverse effects on human health. Measurements of ozone precursors will be made
as part of an international study named The Campaigns of Air Pollution Research
in Megacity - Beijing and the North China Plain. This is a follow-on campaign to
one that took place in August 2007 and will include scientists from France,
Japan, Germany, Hong Kong, and the USA, as well as from China. Understanding
ozone photochemistry over China is important to understanding global
photochemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both photochemical and transport modeling
will be conducted to analyze the photochemistry and in-situ production of ozone
at the site. Several issues related to the local photochemistry will be further
analyzed. These include the investigation of key pathways for heterogeneous
production of nitrous acid and for the loss of hydroperoxyl radicals onto
aerosol surfaces. Data from the in situ and satellite measurements will be
analyzed using the 3-D Regional chEmical trAnsport Model (REAM). Model
simulations of photochemical reactions will be conducted, constrained by the
concentrations of long-lived species and observations of intermediate species
such as peroxyacetyl nitrate, peroxynitric acid, and glyoxal. The research
results of this effort will be used to update some of the photochemical
mechanisms used in the model.
