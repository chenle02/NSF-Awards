9512735 Hamilton This award supports a 24 month Science and Technology Agency of
Japan (STA) Postdoctoral Fellowship for Robert Hamilton at the Communications
Research Laboratory (CRL), Koganei, Japan. Mr. Hamilton will work with Dr.
Kenichi Okamoto, director of the Global Environment Division, on a research
project entitled, "Internet Techniques to Support the Creation of a U.S.-Japan
Science Data Information Exchange System." The project will study the data
generated by Japanese spaceborne remote sensors and devise methods to best
disseminate data via the internet to scientists in the United States and
throughout the world. The research at CRL will provide a special opportunity to
learn about these remote sensing technologies in order to best configure remote
sensing science data sets for internet transmittal. Research will be
specifically directed toward the data collected by various advanced remote
sensing technologies being developed at CRL as well as the construction of
remote sensing data sets for international access and use. The proposed research
is of theoretical and practical interest to the information systems community
and the benefits to be obtained from collaborative research will be valuable to
both participants. The Communications Research Laboratory is an outstanding
research facility, and the research will likely yield positive results for the
United States and Japan as well as the international scientific community as a
whole. As such, the research satisfies the objectives of the program in its
emphasis on the exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge through
international collaboration. ***
