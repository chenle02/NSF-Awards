This award provides funds to the Department of Zoology at Arizona State
University to purchase equipment which will help give freshman/sophomore-level,
non-major students a laboratory experience involving scientific inquiry,
critical thinking and evaluation skills, and student discovery using non-
invasive human physiology experiments as a vehicle. The laboratory will use
research-grade analogue recording equipment and transducers as well as computer-
matched data acquisition equipment, and computer-based statistical and graphic
data analysis software. The analogue equipment will be used for student-designed
experiments while the computer-based transducers will be used for more organized
laboratory exercises. Throughout the laboratory, emphasis will be placed on
development of critical analysis of data, and an increase in general and
specific scientific literacy rather than the "canned" experiment-memorization
driven laboratory experiences typical of human physiology courses. In addition,
the laboratory experience will be designed to give a specific introduction to
human body function to include areas of current interest and of current
misconception among college-age students.
