This project is focused on studying the stratospheric chemistry of organic
aerosols from wildfires. While it has been known for several years that intense
wildfires are able to generate pyrocumulonimbus clouds that can inject wildfire
smoke into the stratosphere, only recently have the effects of wildfire smoke on
stratospheric chemistry been of interest. This project will study the long-term
decay of wildfire aerosols and their chemical impacts in the stratosphere. A
better understanding of wildfires linkages to stratospheric chemistry is
important for understanding chemistry-climate coupling and the broader impacts
of climate change.

This effort involves several linked components. These include the study of: (i)
the chemical impacts of increased hydrogen bromide (HBr) solubility in organic
wildfire aerosols; (ii) ozone production in stratospheric air by wildfire
emissions; (iii) long-term decay of wildfire aerosols associated with the 2020
Australian wildfire event; (iv) the evolution and chemistry of specific wildfire
events in both hemispheres; and (v) the use of observations and modeling to
assess the impacts of concurrent wildfire and volcanic loadings on light
extinction and chemistry in the stratosphere.

This effort will provide mentoring and support for a full-time graduate student
who will carry out the modeling simulations. An undergraduate student will also
be supported to collect and analyze the satellite and lidar data.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
