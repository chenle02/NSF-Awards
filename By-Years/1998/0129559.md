This workshop uses recognized experts in information technologies to improve our
understanding of the appropriate use of information technology in sustainable
development. We intend to look particularly closely at remote environments
recently affected by conflict and natural disasters. Attention will be directed
toward methods of collecting and relaying information between a remote local
population and their environment, and we intend to evaluate both the methods and
metrics of collection and the capability for remote, high-dimensional
visualization of those complex local systems. The hypothesis is that collecting
health information locally with the capability of remote visualization can offer
a quantitative and predictive method for community analysis. With careful
attention to design, and iterative feedback for the community, we expect to
offer earlier recognition of a spectrum of possible threats. Information
collected, analyzed, and iterated may improve health while guiding local
development sustainability, thereby improving regional stability. Better
understanding the ecology and epidemiology of locations distant in geography and
in culture broadens our global insight and benefits national security.
