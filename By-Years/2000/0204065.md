CHE-0204065&lt;br/&gt;PI: Richert, Ranko&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project,
funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
Richert will perform research using triplet state solvation dynamics to study
relaxation and dynamical heterogeneity in glass-forming liquids. Experiments
will be performed on probe rotation, polarization-angle-dependent detection of
the solvation time correlation function, and heterogeneity on the microsecond to
nanosecond time scales. A new technique developed by Richert allows the first
simultaneous measurement of probe rotational dynamics and solvation dynamics.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project deals with the important topic of how
supercooled liquids make a transition to the solid state of aggregation. Many
previous experiments have pointed to the existence of heterogeneous regions in
the otherwise homogeneous liquid, with the heterogeneous regions exhibiting
different dynamical behaviors from the homogeneous ones. The principal
investigator has invented a unique technique by means of which the properties of
the heterogeneous regions can be obtained separately from the homogeneous ones
in a single experiment. Great advances in the understanding of the liquid to
glass transition are expected to result from this research, with potential
applications to polymer science and plastic crystals. Students will participate
in this research.&lt;br/&gt;
