Bolin This project is being funded as part of the National Earthquake Hazards
Reduction Program's investigation into the causes and effects of the January 17,
1994 Northridge earthquake. The research will, in a multi-site and comparative
framework, identify and analyze a comprehensive range of disaster response and
recovery issues among victims of diverse ethnic/cultural and socioeconomic
characteristics in Ventura and Los Angeles Counties. The analysis will include
an examination of the roles of governmental agencies in providing assistance to
diverse victim groups concentrating on intermediate to long-term recovery
issues. In addition, the role of non-governmental organizations, neighborhood
associations, and other locally based organizations that have responded to the
recovery needs of victim groups will be documented. ***
