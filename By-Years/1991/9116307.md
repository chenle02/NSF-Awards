Herbivorous opisthobranch molluscs such as sea hares have been a rich source of
interesting secondary metabolites with potential biomedical applications.
Hypotheses concerning the natural function of these compounds have been extant
over the past two decades. However, our understanding of how these compounds
mediate algal-opisthobranch-predator interactions is still very poor. The
research proposed here will address 1) whether feeding by herbivorous
opisthobranchs is deterred by algal secondary metabolites, 2) whether
herbivorous opisthobranchs can sequester secondary metabolites only from algae
that they normally consume, 3) whether secondary metabolites are distributed
within herbivorous opisthobranchs so as to maximize their potential for
deterring predators; or, alternatively, so as to minimize their toxic effect
upon the opisthobranch, and 4) whether patterns of selective sequestration and
modification of algal metabolites are most compatable with a) maximizing
defensive properties of the opisthobranch, or b) minimizing toxic effects to the
opisthobranch. The results of this research will advance our understanding of
the ecology of herbivores that sequester plant secondary metabolites.
