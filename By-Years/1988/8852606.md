This project will strengthen undergraduate instruction in geophysics, and will
create research opportunities for undergraduates through the acquisition of a
portable exploration seismograph. The instrument to be purchased is an EG&G
Geometrics Model ES-1225 twelve channel exploration seismograph. This unit,
which has modern microprocessor technology and digital signal enhancement
capability, will replace a 15-year-old single channel seismograph. The new
instrument will be used in four undergraduate geophysics courses to teach basic
principles of data acquisition in seismic exploration; use of computer software
for playback, analysis and interpretation of seismic data; and concepts of
digital recording, filtering, and signal enhancement. The unit also will be used
by undergraduates for senior thesis research in geophysics, hydrogeology, and
engineering geology. This two-year grant of $12,495 will be matched by an equal
amount of non-federal funds.
