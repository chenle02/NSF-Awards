This project concerns the study of local controllability for nonlinear systems
of differential equations. The main goal is to find computable high order
conditions for local controllability of analytic systems. Geometric and
algebraic techniques provide the basic approach for this study. A successful
outcome of the project would lead toward designing automatic stabilizing
feedback systems.
