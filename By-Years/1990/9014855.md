The rule that every elementary particle must bear an electrical charge that is
zero or an integral or rational fraction multiple of the charge e of the
electron, rests solely on experimental evidence. The limits placed by experiment
will be extended to test this hypothesis. Any deviation observed will require a
major restructuring of theory.
