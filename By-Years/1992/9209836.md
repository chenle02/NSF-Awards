Work in parallel processing for Computational Field Simulation (CFS) problems
has highlighted the need for techniques to support efficient mapping of large
dataspace problems between memory hierarchies in an efficient manner so that
data is available to the processors when they are ready to use it. Typical
memory hierarchies to date have good support for programs with small working-set
sizes and good locality of reference. Problems in the CFS domain typically deal
with huge data-sets and solution techniques which make passes over the entire
data-set have very poor locality of reference. The focus of this research is an
investigation into software techniques for allowing applications programmers to
describe the data access patterns for their application to allow a hardware
system to be built to efficiently manage the data movement between the different
levels of a memory hierarchy to provide data to the processor at peak speed.
This work will involve the simulation of this system so that its effective
performance enhancements can be analyzed to determine the feasibility of such an
approach.
