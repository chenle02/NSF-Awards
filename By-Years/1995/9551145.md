This project upgrades the existing Computer Cartography/GIS laboratory at the
university. The upgrade facilitates the further integration of computer
applications into the Environmental Science, GIS, Cartography and Regional
Planning curriculum in the Department of Geography and Geology. This laboratory
accommodates approximately 40 majors in the department plus students from
Environmental Science/Biology and the teacher training programs who must
complete coursework in Geography. The project specifically funds Pentium
computers, a flat-bed scanner, and software. The new Pentium computers and the
increased number of software licenses more than double the capacity of the
existing computer laboratory. The increased number of seats allows the
department to introduce more computer applications in the introductory courses,
freeing time in the upper-level courses for more advanced topics. The processing
power of the Pentiums permits more demanding applications in the courses. This
new curriculum better prepares our students for graduate programs and for jobs
in the planning agencies and GIS concerns who look to the university to supply
their personnel needs.
