9354728 Fuller Students in each course in a collaborative laboratory project
(CLP) apply the special skills, etc. they are learning in that course to a
research project. Thus, introductory biology students use basic techniques to
provide some data for a project while more advanced students use their special
expertise to quantify a different element of the research. For example, a CLP on
the effects of nutrients and zooplankton on phytoplankton communities is
designed as a collaborative project for the introductory biology, the phycology
and the ecology courses. The introductory students take samples and quantify
zooplankton; ecology students analyze the water chemistry and quantify
zooplankton; and the phycology students quantify the phytoplankton. Each student
brings an expertise to the project and all make a significant contribution to
the scientific endeavor. This approach requires interaction among students and
faculty and fosters a cooperative learning environment that pairs students with
students, faculty with students and faculty with faculty. This "community of
learners" extends beyond a single course to encompass all levels of the
curriculum. Furthermore, students appreciate the relevance of their results,
recognize the relatedness of different sub-disciplines within biology and are
introduced to the types of skills/techniques that they will participate in if
they continue in biology. These CLPs make the science that students do more
substantive, interesting and meaningful, and more sophisticated at all levels.
This approach to teaching science more accurately reflects how science is done,
and can serve as a model for how science is taught in all disciplines.
