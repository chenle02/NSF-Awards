County, state and national borders play vital roles in society. Among other
things, they define geographic limits for laws and taxation authority, drive how
resources are allocated for public services, and frequently serve as units of
observation for research in academic, industrial, international development,
humanitarian and defense contexts. To date, approximately 1 million
administrative boundaries have been created by governments around the world.
Because these boundaries change over time, sometimes very quickly, it is hard to
keep track of them. The geoBoundaries project is a data platform that contains
information about these boundaries along with software to analyze the data. The
geoBoundaries project provides free, transparent, and openly licensed geographic
information on geopolitical boundaries. This NSF award supports the continued
development of the project. Innovations include automating data processing,
including geographic referencing of printed maps extracted from library
archives, constructing new data standards with quality control and assurance,
and developing new ways to compare geographic information across different
datasets. Changes to the data and analytic tools are stored in a public, version
controlled system. Country and global information can be downloaded in a variety
of formats. The geoBoundaries project makes research possible across a range of
social, behavioral, and economic sciences.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
