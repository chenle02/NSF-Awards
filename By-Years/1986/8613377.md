The PI's wish to fabricate new types of modulation doped field-effect
transistors (MODFETs). A very high density of electrons will be supplied from a
selectively doped n-A1GaAs/GaAs (60-100A)/n-A1GaAs double-heterojunction
rectangular well structure grown by molecular beam epitaxy. The A1 mole fraction
(x) to be used in these devices will be less than the conventional value of 0.3.
It is expected that the reduction in x will avoid the persistent trapping
effects, normally observed in these devices at cryogenic temperatures, without
sacrificing the device performance. The dimensions and the doping concentration
will be chosen to achieve a high transconductance and a large current swing.
