9405146 Frostig One of the most informative ways to study the brain is to record
from the brains of intact animals in a non-invasive way the electrical signals
that brain cells use to communicate with each other. A new technique to do this
is called optical imaging of intrinsic signals, in which signals from the
illuminated surface of the brain are recorded with a digital CCD camera. One
major impediment to getting good signals from the nerve cells is that the blood
vessels on the surface of the brain disrupt the signals from the underlying
brain tissue. Another obstacle in the development of the technique comes from
the very large data set generated for each measurement (typically 120 images of
a grid of 144 x 192 pixels, each pixels with 256 levels of light). This research
focuses on ways to improve the digital signals recorded by the camera in studies
of the part of the rat cortex that processes the tactile signals coming in from
the rat's whiskers. It is a collaborative effort between biologists and
mathematicians to develop new mathematical tools to separate the signals from
the main blood vessels from those from the brain, so that the optical imaging of
the intrinsic signals will have more faithful spatial resolution. A second goal
of the project is to develop a more efficient way for the computer to handle the
large data set so that the images can have better temporal resolution. The
results of this study will have impact not only on neuroscience research, but
also development of improved diagnostic tools in clinical neurology as well as
impact on other types of image analysis. This multidisciplinary proposal was
submitted to the Federal Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Human Brain
Project and is being supported by three Programs within the National Science
Foundation - Statistics and Probability, Computational Neuroscience, and
Computational Biology.
