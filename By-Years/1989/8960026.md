Deposition of thin diamond films by plasma assisted chemical vapor deposition
(PACVD) is a rapidly emerging area of technology being pursued in The United
States, Japan and the Soviet Union. Diamond films have unique chemical and
physical properties such as oxidation resistance and hardness. Boron-doped
diamond films grown by PACVD can have electrical resistivities approaching 1
ohm-cm. Pore-free, adherent films of less than 1-micron thickness have already
been deposited on tungsten substrates. The goal of this study is to evaluate
these films as an electrically conductive, corrosion-resistant coating for
bipolar separator plates (carbon-carbon composites) in phosphoric acid fuel
cells (PAFC). Present plate designs fail because of corrosion of the carbon
filler and acid absorption by the plate which leads to eventual shoring of the
cell. Thin diamond films deposited on the bipolar plates, in addition to being
corrosion resistant, can also act as a barrier layer, thus preventing acid
absorption.
