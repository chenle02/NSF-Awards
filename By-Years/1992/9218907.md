9218907 Okal This research is to study the seismic structure of the Ontong- Java
Plateau, the largest expression of igneous activity of the ocean floor. Four
seismic stations composed of PASSCAL instruments will be deployed for two years
on the Micronesian islands of Chuuk, Pohnpei, Kosrae and Nauru. Earthquake
sources in the Solomon subduction zone will be used to investigate the
dispersion of surface waves over the plateau to measure seismic structure to
depths on the order of 200 km. Concurrently, a number of body-wave experiments
will be conducted targeting the structural anisotropy of the crust and upper
mantle in the area. The work is expected to provide answers to such questions as
the exact thickness of the crust, the nature of the deep crust, the structure of
the mantle (lid and underlying low-velocity zone) of the plateau, and the extent
and direction of anisotropy in the upper mantle. In turn, these parameters will
put constraints on the environment and mechanism of emplacement of the plateau
in the Cretaceous. ***
