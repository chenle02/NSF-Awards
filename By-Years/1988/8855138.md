The University of Idaho will introduce 25 high-ability Idaho high school
seniors to science and engineering as practiced by university researchers.
Measurement in Science, is used as a unifying thread as students are exposed to
a wide variety of disciplines and activities. The program is structured around a
series of discipline-focused modules including chemistry, physics, mathematics,
biological sciences, earth sciences, electrical engineering, and computer
science. Each module will feature teaching, demonstrations and hands-on
activities. Interspersed with the modules will be activities and programs that
explore research support services and facilities, the philosophy and ethics of
science and scientists, and the human dimension of being a scientist. Students
will participate in laboratory experiences preceded by theoretical explanations.
Follow-up activities will include projects conducted at their home schools under
the direction of faculty mentors and compilation of their results and
experiences in a Young Scholars Research Journal.
