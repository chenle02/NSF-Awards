Allocating indivisible items to multiple agents without monetary transfer is a
pressing problem in our society. In many situations, items are categorized into
multiple types and each agent must get at least one item per type. Such problems
are called multi-type resource allocation (MTRA). For example, MTRA arises in
allocating courses to students, allocating computational resources to users in
cloud computing, allocating medical resources to patients, as well as in multi-
type exchange market and centralized welfare programs that involve multiple sub-
programs. Unfortunately, most previous research overlook information regarding
resource type, and are thus hindered by three barriers: preference bottleneck,
computational bottleneck, and threats of agents' strategic behavior. The project
aims at establishing theoretical and algorithmic foundations of mechanism design
for MTRA with the help of Artificial Intelligence. The newly designed mechanisms
will improve the economic efficiency and computational efficiency of resource
allocation in multiagent systems, socio-economics systems, and operations
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In doing so, the researcher will design and
evaluate novel graphical languages to address the preference bottleneck; design
novel frameworks for discovering new mechanisms, including sequential allocation
mechanisms and extensions of the top-trading-cycles mechanism, to address the
computational bottleneck; use game theory to analyze and measure agents'
strategic behavior; and use high computational complexity to prevent agents'
strategic behavior. Outcomes of the research will be integrated into an open-
source Online Preference Reporting and Aggregation (OPRA) system, which serves
as a platform to bridge theory, practice, and education.
