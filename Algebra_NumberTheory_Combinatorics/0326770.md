Title: RIMS-UCI Collaboration Conference on Arithmetic Applications of Moduli
Degeneration

This project supports US participants to attend a workshop at UC Irvine, May 7
to May 10, 2003. The lectures combine algebra and complex analytic geometry to
give new insights into collections of algebraic relations from refined parameter
(moduli) spaces. Some lectures introduce a new zoo of cusp types. These
generalize cusps attached to modular curves. They extract what governs
previously subtle problems and enhance mature topics like Deligne's tangential
base points and Belyi covers. Tempered fundamental groups, Modular Towers and
cusp embeddings of curves in their jacobians appear in featured lectures. Number
theorists and algebraic geometers will find results going far beyond those from
a previous workshop in Kyoto, October, 2002 at RIMS Institute. Especially, there
are new applications to motivate students and post-doctorals to learn techniques
for classifying algebraic equations from their bad reduction types. The invited
speakers, and a capstone volume to the previous publication series, will attract
new Ph.D. students.

This project supports US participants to attend a workshop at UC Irvine, May 7
to May 10, 2003. Mathematical objects described by equations can be painfully
complicated, full of peripheral data one would like to eliminate. Special
structures on parameter spaces for these objects can help researchers filter all
but the essentials from these equations. This workshop follows the more
technical workshop at RIMS Institute in Kyoto, October, 2002. Our speakers will
emphasize significant new contributions to this data filtering process based on
cusp geometry. A lecture series by Yves Andre and focused lectures by the other
invited speakers will attract new Ph.D. students to the field. They will learn
new ideas for classifying equations by their bad reduction types. Applications
will be to a wide range of topics, including string theory and height measures.
A conference proceedings will disseminate the results in a capstone to a
previous series of related publications.
