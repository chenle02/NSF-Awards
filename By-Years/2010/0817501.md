In this collaborative project, five institutions are developing courseware for
teaching computer network security. The courseware comprises an open source
software platform for a virtual cyber security laboratory and accompanying lab
assignments and is based on prior NSF-funded projects at two of the
institutions. The laboratory materials being developed give students hands-on
experiences in cyber security courses.

The courseware being developed makes it easy for other institutions to create
their own virtual laboratories with very little hardware and requires minimal
maintenance and administration cost. The courseware is extensible so others can
augment it with specialized modules.

With respect to critical information infrastructure protection, the project
results in increased national capacity for education, new entrants to the
information security workforce, and increased national research and development
capabilities.
