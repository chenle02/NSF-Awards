The objective of this research is to study the influence of host plant gene
expression on the development of endosymbiotic legume/ Rhizobium root nodules.
The nature of this influence is less well characterized than that of the
bacterial partner, in part because of the relative unavailability of specific
plant mutants. In an attempt to circumvent this handicap, Lotus corniculatus
will be transformed to dominant mutant phenotypes in certain nodulin genes by
Agrobacterium rhizogenes introduction of appropriate antisense and ribozyme
constructs. The effect of the resultant suppression of nodulin gene activity on
nodule development will be determined in transgenic plants after infection with
Rhizobium loti. In this way, the effect of mutations in the Lotus homologues of
soybean nodulins 24 and 26 on establishment of the endosymbiotic compartment and
on further nodule development will be determined; as will the role of the Lotus
homologue of the early acting nodulin.75. This approach has the potential to
determine the functions of all plant genes involved in symbiotic nodule
development.
