0730456&lt;br/&gt;Jahren&lt;br/&gt;This work will develop inter-laboratory
standards and improved methods for high-precision mass spectroscopy and related
techniques to aid forensic examination of post-explosion
residues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will help overcome two fundamental
barriers in the stable isotope forensics of high explosives i.e. the need for
calibrated inter-laboratory standards (particularly for oxygen isotope
analysis), and the need for reduced sample size in order to accommodate the
analysis of explosion residues. The work is needed in order to make delta18O,
delta13C, and delta15N measurements on confiscated and post-blast residues of
high explosives widely useful for linking materials, perpetrators and sites of
assembly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two African American women undergraduate
"scientists-in-training" will participate in this work, and some results of this
study will be shared with students in grade 7 through college, to encourage them
to enter careers in science.
