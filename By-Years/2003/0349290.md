DMS-0349290&lt;br/&gt;Kevin M. Whyte&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program of
studying discrete groups via the quasi-isometric geometry &lt;br/&gt;of their
Cayley graphs was suggested by Gromov in his address at the 1982
&lt;br/&gt;International Congress of Mathematicians. This program has two
complementary &lt;br/&gt;parts: finding invariants to show that different groups
are not quasi-isometric, &lt;br/&gt;and constructing quasi-isometries to show
that similar groups are quasi-isometric. &lt;br/&gt;The PI has made several
contributions to this program in the past, including a &lt;br/&gt;recent proof
of quasi-isometric rigidity for the group of integral affine
&lt;br/&gt;transformations and the group of automorphisms of a surface group
(the latter &lt;br/&gt;in joint work with Lee Mosher). The PI proposes
significant extensions &lt;br/&gt;of these results in the context of the
development of the subject of large &lt;br/&gt;scale dynamics. In addition to
rigidity phenomena, the proposed research &lt;br/&gt;includes a detailed study
of less rigid groups, which should help to clarify &lt;br/&gt;questions about
quasi-isometric invariance of many algebraic and combinatorial
&lt;br/&gt;properties of groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roughly speaking, large
scale (or coarse) geometry is the study of geometric &lt;br/&gt;properties of
objects "seen from far away". From this perspective, any bounded
&lt;br/&gt;object is indistinguishable from a point, and a line of dots is
&lt;br/&gt;indistinguishable from a solid line. This sort of geometry has been
&lt;br/&gt;influential recently in many areas of mathematics, notably group
theory, &lt;br/&gt;topology, and geometric analysis. This research will explore
the large &lt;br/&gt;scale geometry of several classes of mathematical objects,
both classical &lt;br/&gt;geometric spaces and objects only now being viewed in
a geometric manner. &lt;br/&gt;There has been a tremendous amount of interest in
this area of study &lt;br/&gt;recently, with many of the experts in the field
located at one of the &lt;br/&gt;universities in the Chicago area. The proposal
includes a variety &lt;br/&gt;of programs to develop interaction between
mathematicians, and &lt;br/&gt;especially their graduate students, within this
community.
