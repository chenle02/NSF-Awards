In this project, various radio resource allocation problems that arise in multi-
hop wireless communication networks are proposed, where the main focus is on
broadband wireless infrastructure networks. The aim is to help facilitate the
realization of such networks by developing system level approaches to reducing
cost and maximizing performance. The resource allocation problems considered
include transmission scheduling, routing, power control, and topology
configuration, including node placement, and node density planning. In this
project, rigorous mathematical analysis techniques will be developed that have
not previously been applied to the design of wireless infrastructure networks.
These techniques will be combined with practical engineering approaches to yield
novel network architectures and improved insight into the design space for
multi-hop wireless networks. The results of the project could help to enable low
cost, ubiquitous wireless networks that support very high data rates.
Development of resource allocation technology underlying broadband wireless
infrastructure networks, as presented here, may enable other related
applications, including high bandwidth sensor networks and ad-hoc networks. For
example, cost effective high bandwidth wireless infrastructure network
technology may lead to "grass root" development of highly robust communications
infrastructures whose control and ownership is distributed among end-users. The
improvement of the efficiency of wireless information transport may enable
large-scale video surveillance networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
