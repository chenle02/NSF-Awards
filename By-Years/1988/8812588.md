The work focuses on the characterization of important motility related proteins
associated with the surface of membrane bound vesicles and/or with the subunit
lattice of microtubules. The subcellular distribution of these proteins, called
kinesin and vesikin, will be determined at the light and electron microscopic
levels, and the identity of proteins that associate specifically with vesikin or
kinesin will be determined by affinity chromatography. Both of these approaches
will utilize standard biochemical and immunological techniques. In a comparative
approach, mitochondria will be analyzed to determine what characteristics of
that organelle allow it to move bidirectionally in axons. This is important
because up to now motility studies have focused on axoplasmic vesicles that move
unidirectionally in axons. Finally, cDNA clones of kinesin and vesikin will be
selected and studied. The significance of these experiments is that they will
increase our understanding of the motor molecules involved in the important cell
biological phenomena of intracellular particle motility in general and fast
axonal transport in particular.
