This work consists of research in mathematical statistics. The problems involve
inference for spatial processes including the properties of predictors based on
estimated covariance functions and prediction problems for non-Gaussian spatial
processes. The relationship between prediction and estimation for general
stochastic processes will be studied. Researchers will examine the ways a
regression interpretation of James-Stein shrinkage estimators permits a unified
treatment of a broad class of problems in cluster analysis from a decision
theoretic perspective. Previous historical investigations will be extended to
cover main themes in the first half of this century. The asymptotic theory of
estimation will be studied with particular attention to the behavior of maximum
likelihood estimators on infinite dimensional parameter spaces. The application
of algorithms for the computation of posterior distributions to problems of
image reconstruction will be examined with particular attention to images
generated by positron emission tomography. The computation of probability
distributions over graphical structures will be investigated with applications
to genetics.
