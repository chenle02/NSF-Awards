9554473 Martin Under the Planning Grant Guidelines, the Arizona Science Center
will explore "Using Narrative to Introduce Science Concepts to Diverse Audiences
at a Science Center." By bringing together a group of experts to review key
questions about the uses and structure of narrative, the staff of the science
center will 1) develop a strategy and range of approaches to science
storytelling, 2) develop ideas for story premises and texts to interest visitors
representing diverse populations and including women, people in non-technical
occupations and minority families, 3) conduct research to determine visitor's
attitudes to these materials in order to learn about the appeal and
effectiveness of the narratives. Finally, they will synthesize and broadly
disseminate their findings. The discussion will be focused on a comprehensive
set of 120 exhibits entitled "How We Live With The Sun." The topics include
light and optics; heat, cooling, and convection; weather, electricity; and
technologies for harnessing solar energy. These topics represent the physical
science that underlies the way people adapt to the desert and the ways in which
Arizonans have applied knowledge of science fundamentals to useful ends.
