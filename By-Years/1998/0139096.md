The Coe College REU site has a focus on spectroscopy in physics and chemistry.
It emphasizes different techniques and projects in the areas of Optics (laser
induced time of flight mass spectroscopy, IR spectra), Materials Science
(thermal properties, density, glass modeling), Acoustics (of free reed musical
instruments), Gas Phase Chemistry (atmospheric science in a bottle),
Environmental Chemistry (water pollutants and iron catalysis), and Chemical
Synthesis (organic hypervalent compounds) . The site is very friendly and
student centered, with students working directly with professors and alongside
more senior research students. The site also offers a rich variety of research-
grade equipment for student training. Other activities will include weekly
seminars, the chance to make presentations at the end of summer, and many social
diversions in a rich research culture.&lt;br/&gt;
