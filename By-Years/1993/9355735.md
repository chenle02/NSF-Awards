9355735 Abstract The Mathematics Teacher Institute is a three-year project, at
$547,098, through the California State University, Dominguez Hills Foundation to
provide teacher enhancement to 50 area high school teachers in schools that will
receive students from the Renaissance Middle Grades Mathematics Project.
Participants will be involved for three summers, each with six school year
follow-up sessions. The first two summers will include 4-week programs with a
focus on mathematics content, unifying curriculum themes, instructional
strategies, and use of technology in moving to a standards-based high school
curriculum. The third summer session will be one week with a focus on designing
a school plan and staff development activities with involvement of the building
principal.
