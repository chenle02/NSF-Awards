There has been much recent work on scheduling techniques that&lt;br/&gt;ensure
fairness, temporal isolation, and timeliness among&lt;br/&gt;applications
multiplexed on the same resource. Many systems that&lt;br/&gt;could benefit from
the use of fair scheduling principles have&lt;br/&gt;workloads that necessitate
the use of multiple processors; consider,&lt;br/&gt;for example, the
proliferation of Internet service providers that&lt;br/&gt;host third-party
websites on multiprocessor servers. Unfortunately,&lt;br/&gt;most prior work on
multiprocessor fair scheduling has been rooted&lt;br/&gt;in task models that are
too rigid to apply in many settings. The&lt;br/&gt;little research on more
flexible models that has been done has been&lt;br/&gt;almost entirely
experimental in nature, with little or no formal&lt;br/&gt;analysis of the
scheduling algorithms being tested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, fair
scheduling algorithms based on rate-based&lt;br/&gt;scheduling principles will
be developed and analyzed, both formally&lt;br/&gt;and experimentally. Specific
project objectives include the&lt;br/&gt;development of (i) fair scheduling
algorithms that minimize task&lt;br/&gt;migrations; (ii) extensions to these
algorithms that allow tasks to&lt;br/&gt;synchronize and share resources; (iii)
extensions that allow real-time&lt;br/&gt;and non-real-time applications to
execute under a common framework;&lt;br/&gt;and (iv) techniques for managing
dynamically-changing workloads in&lt;br/&gt;which tasks may join and leave the
system.&lt;br/&gt;
