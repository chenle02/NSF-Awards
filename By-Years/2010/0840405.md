This award to the University of Nebraska - Lincoln will enable fifty of an
anticipated 300 scientists and science journalists to participate in an
interdisciplinary conference designed to address mechanisms for improving the
communication of scientific, mathematical, and engineering issues outside the
scientific community. In an intense two-day conference/workshop setting,
participants will take part in proven practice communication training designed
to improve the ability of researchers to communicate their science broadly to
non-expert audiences, and to enhance the skills of science writers whose
messages are directed largely to the public. Plenary, breakout and mini-workshop
sessions are designed to achieve these goals and to enrich mutual understanding
at the scientist/writer interface. Conference participants will also investigate
ways in which public STEM communication can be integrated into the undergraduate
and graduate curricula to better prepare future researchers and writers. A web-
based resource that captures the essence of the conference and that can be used
as a tool for researchers and journalists to improve their science communication
skills will be developed following the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
