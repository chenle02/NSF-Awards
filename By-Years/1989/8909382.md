The objectives of this project are to build a rigid, fast-scanning tunnelling
microscope with scanning tunnelling spectroscopy capability; to incorporate this
into an existing ultrahigh-vaccumm system equipped with low-energy electron
diffraction and Auger spectroscopy; to characterize the effects of adsorbates
such as carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, oxygen, and hydrogen on the surface
topology and tunnelling spectra of a platinum(100) surface; to study the effects
of surface defects on the adsorption, and possibly the reactions, of various
adsorbates on platinum surfaces; and to investigate the effects of crystallite
size of platinum supported on graphite on the adsorption and reaction behavior
of adsorbates. This project represents an application of recently developed
techniques to materials and systems important in catalysis. It therefore has an
exploratory aspect that makes the work somewhat speculative; potential
contributions to understanding of catalytic systems are great, however.
