To support the hands-on laboratory sessions, a testbed will be established that
will host &lt;br/&gt;widely used middleware produced by projects in the US, the
EU, and in Asia Pacific &lt;br/&gt;(AP). The testbed will be connected to major
international science grids and thus &lt;br/&gt;provide a rich environment for
hands-on learning and experimentation. The laboratory &lt;br/&gt;will be
populated with one PC for every two students. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The target
audience consists of young researchers and practitioners (from technical
&lt;br/&gt;industries, research laboratories, and academic environments) who
have recently &lt;br/&gt;started (or are about to start) working on grid
computing projects. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The school will have a broad impact
because it will prepare a substantial number of &lt;br/&gt;researchers to engage
in grid projects, both building and deploying grid infrastructure &lt;br/&gt;and
using it for applications. The students who have applied for admission are
engaged &lt;br/&gt;in grid projects for a wide variety of application areas,
including astronomy, biology, &lt;br/&gt;chemistry, earth science, medicine, and
physics. There are also students who are &lt;br/&gt;involved in projects that
are conducting research on grid middleware and on network
&lt;br/&gt;technologies for grids. As a result, this school will seed many
projects with people who &lt;br/&gt;have gained a good understanding of grid
technologies. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
