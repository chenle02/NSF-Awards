9706664 Pena de Ortiz The formation of long term memory is though to involve the
modification of cells within the brain. Such modification is believed to depend
on changes in the regulation of gene function in those cells. This project uses
the techniques of molecular biology to investigate changes in gene expression
during the acquisition of memory in one important part of the brain termed the
hippocampus. The project documents the time course of changes in gene expression
that occur as memories are acquired. Experiments then proceed to identify the
DNA sequences of genes linked to learning-induced changes, and thereafter the
functions of the products of those genes. The results of this project will add
significantly to the understanding of how the brain stores information
