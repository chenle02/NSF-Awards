9321505 Slaughter This research project will examine and monitor the ways that
currently developing science and technology policy shapes academic science. For
the past fifty years, defense and related agencies and independent agencies
concerned with basic research have accounted for a large portion of budgets for
academic science. If the current Administration pursues a civilian technology
policy, these funding arrangements will change. The objectives of this project
are to measure and attempt to explain change with regard to: ideologies of
science, budgets and types of science projects, sites for academic science,
alliances and coalitions that support academic science. The project will focus
on the following three questions: Whose voices and interests will be present and
represented in debates surrounding federal science and technology policy? What
impact will changes in science policy at the national level --specifically
enactment of a technology policy that reshapes the defense conversion and
biotechnology agendas -- have on channels (agencies and processes by which money
is distributed), levels (international, national, state, local), sectors
(industry, university, federal labs), and sites (concrete geographical
locations) where science is done? Do discourse and spatial analyses suggest that
an institutional class embracing private and public sectors and Democratic and
Republican parties has emerged and developed a coherent science and technology
policy? The project will monitor documents produced by forum groups concerned
with science policy in the defense conversion and biotechnology areas,
congressional committee hearings, and legislation, as well as materials from the
executive branch, DOD, NIH, and NSF, and perform discourse analysis to
understand what new narratives and ideologies of science are emerging. It will
track organizational changes in science agencies, budget changes and award
allocations to universities, university-industry partners hips, and
corporations, and perform time-series data analysis of changes to see who
benefits from change, should change occur. The project will gather data about
linkages between organizational and institutional actors who share similar
science policy ideologies to see if a new science policy coalition or class-wide
consensus on defense conversion and biotechnology is developing, and how it
intersects with policy agendas related to civilian technology policy. ***
