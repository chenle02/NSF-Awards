In this research project supported by the Inorganic, Bio- inorganic and
Organometallic Chemistry Program, Richard J. Lagow of the University of Texas at
Austin will continue work in the area of polylithium organic compounds, such as
di- and tri-lithiomethane, hexalithiobenzene, perlithioadamantane and
perlithiocyclopropane. In addition, the existence of hyper- valent compounds
such as penta- and hexa-lithiocarbon will be investigated. These polylithium
compounds are very unusual and highly reactive molecules which have high energy
densities. They may find utility as new materials or in new types of solid or
liquid batteries. Studies will include syntheses (generally via lithium vapor
chlorocarbon replacement reactions), characterizations by x-ray crystallography,
mass spectroscopy, and nobel gas matrix spec- troscopy and investigations of
chemical reactivities.
