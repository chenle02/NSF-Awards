DMS-0202812 L. Peterson, T. Branson, G. Jensen, G. Olafsson, A. Ryan

This award provides partial support for students and active research
mathematicians and scientists with limited means of support to attend and
participate in the 2002, 2003, and 2004 meetings of the Midwest Geometry
Conference. The award together with other funding will cover all expenses of the
plenary speakers.

The 2002 conference will be held on the main campus of the University of North
Dakota (April 26-28) and will be sponsored by the NSF, North Dakota EPSCoR,
North Dakota State University, and the University of North Dakota. The
conference will include the following four sessions and speakers:

1. Lie Groups and Geometry. Speakers: Jiri Dadok (Indiana), C. Robin Graham
(Univ. of Washington), and Bernhard Kroetz (Ohio State) 2. Quantum Geometry and
Topology. Speakers: Abhay Ashtekar (Penn State, Physics), Louis Kauffman (Univ.
of Illinois at Chicago), and Jack Morava (Johns Hopkins Univ.) 3. Geometric PDE.
Speakers: Sigurd Angenent (Wisconsin), Bennett Chow (Univ. of California, San
Diego), 4. Gravitation. Speakers: Peter van Nieuwenhuizen (SUNY Stony Brook,
Physics), Andrew Waldron (Univ. of California, Davis)

The organizers expect to recruit two additional speakers. Further information is
available at http://www.und.nodak.edu/dept/math/mgc2002

The 2003 conference will take place at Washington University in St. Louis,
probably in May. Gary Jensen, of Washington University, is the lead organizer.
Tentative conference plans include sessions on the following four topics: 1.
Three-manifolds, hyperbolic geometry, and geometric group theory 2. Geometry,
analysis, and probability on discrete groups 3. Minimal submanifolds 4. Surface
immersions in space

The University of Arkansas will host the 2004 conference sometime in 2004, most
likely in the spring. John Ryan, of the University of Arkansas, will be the lead
organizer. A tentative list of topics for the conference is as follows: 1.
Nonlinear analysis on manifolds and metric spaces 2. Spinor geometry 3.
Geometric group theory 4. Non-commutative differential geometry

Organizers of the 2003 and 2004 conferences will develop more detailed plans in
the months immediately preceding the respective conferences.
