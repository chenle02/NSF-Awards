This is an award to provide support for a project to study chemical oxidation
processes for the destruction of organic contaminants of water. The project
involves systematic investigation of oxidation processes that involve the use of
ozone, hydrogen peroxide and ultraviolet radiation. The investigator plans to
address the fundamental principles that are involved in these oxidation
processes, characterize the rate at which they occur and determine the reaction
mechanisms. She will use the results of these studies to construct mathematical
models that can be utilized in engineering design of decontamination processes
for water and for treatment of wastewaters. Ozone, hydrogen peroxide and
ultraviolet radiation have been applied to treatment of water and wastewater
without clear understanding of the chemical and physical mechanisms that are
involved in their action on organic compounds. This project is expected to
provide insights into those processes that will permit better design of
processes and systems than is now possible.
