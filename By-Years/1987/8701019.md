This research program will investigate the migration of small particles in flow
through tubes in order to determine whether such migration can be used as a
basis for separating algal matter according to their size and other appropriate
physical properties. The objective is to study systematically, using model
systems, the individual effects of tube gemetry, flow parameters and cell
parameters and concentration on the extent of migration and segregation. This
information can then be employed in designing an energy- efficient algal
harvesting technique, which will be of vaue to the biomass industry.
