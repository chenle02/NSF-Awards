DMS-0301168&lt;br/&gt;Iwaniec,
Henryk&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: The
Mobius Function&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The Proposal deals with approximations to
the Mobius function by &lt;br/&gt;coefficients of modular forms, particularly of
these associated with &lt;br/&gt;elliptic curves of positive rank. The key
problem is to achieve high &lt;br/&gt;uniformity with respect to the size of the
conductor relatively to the &lt;br/&gt;cardinality of the family of forms being
employed. The basic tools are &lt;br/&gt;character sums and exponential sums.
The estimates already established &lt;br/&gt;indicate that stronger results are
possible. Even a slight improvement will &lt;br/&gt;be critical for
applications, especially for the elimination of the &lt;br/&gt;"exceptional
zero" of L-functions. The Proposal includes several &lt;br/&gt;conjectures which
set the way to attack the main problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; One of the
fundamental goals of arithmetic is to measure the &lt;br/&gt;failure of unique
factorization property in number fields. The Proposal is &lt;br/&gt;motivated by
a desire to solve this classical problem in analytic terms,
&lt;br/&gt;specifically by giving an effective bound for the so called class
&lt;br/&gt;number. This will be significant also for understanding the modern
tools &lt;br/&gt;of analytic number theory, and may attract new researchers
because of &lt;br/&gt;possibilities to apply these methods to other central
issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
