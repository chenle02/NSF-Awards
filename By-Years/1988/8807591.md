The gas, ethylene, regulates several developmental processes in plants,
including seed germination, regulation of stem growth, fruit ripening and
senescence. The molecular mechanisms involved are undescribed. Dr. Anthony
Bleecker, a Postdoctoral Fellow in Plant Biology, will work in the laboratory of
Dr. Elliot Meyerowitz, of the California Institute of Technology, with mutants
of Arabidopsis Thaliana which either lack or have altered responses to ethylene.
The mutants will be biochemically, physiologically and genetically characterized
with the ultimate goal of finding ethylene receptor deficient mutants. This work
will give greater insight into fundemental developmental processes in plants and
could have important economic ramifications.
