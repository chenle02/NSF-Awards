Analog tape records of the lightning electric fields which occurred during
three storms will be analyzed for the time-of- occurrence and characteristics of
electric field pulses associated (1) with the initiation of continuing current
(2) with K-processes in both cloud and ground discharges (3) with preliminary
breakdown in ground discharges (4) with the initial portion of cloud discharges,
and (5) with dart and stepped leaders in ground discharges. The unique aspects
of these data, already in hand, are (1) that 100 ground flashes (about 350
stokes) whose fields are recorded on the analog tapes have already been
accurately located by two or more television cameras and (2) that the return
stroke fields on these tapes have been previously analyzed and the results
published providing assurance that the signals are "on-scale" and of good
quality.
