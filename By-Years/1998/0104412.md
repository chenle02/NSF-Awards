The inherent speed and potential for parallel processing make signal
manipulation in the optical domain an attractive alternative, but one that
requires the ability to produce well-defined nonlinear functions (e.g.,
wavelength conversion, phase-preserving optical multiplication, logic
operations), as well as to direct the optical intermediates and outputs as
necessary. We propose to expand our exploration of a new class of photonic
devices which possess both of these characteristicst nonlinear photonic crystals
(NLPCs). We show theoretically that the structure of an NLPC can be successfully
determined for a particular nonlinear optical application - a one-step
interchange of optical data between two wavelength division multiplexed (WDM)
channels. Preliminary measurements confirm the success of this inversion problem
(i.e., desired output 4 NLPC structure). We propose to explore the properties of
this and related lattice-based devices and circuits. We also intend to extend
this work to quasi-periodic and aperiodic nonlinear optical geometries, and to
nonlinear distributions based on nanoscale domain distributions. We believe that
this research direction will continue to uncover new and powerful applications
of all-optical elements for a wide range of disciplines, including
telecommunications, signal processing, and remote sensing.
