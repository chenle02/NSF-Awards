Model building is often guided by features that enable performance analysis and
analytic computations. Examples of such types of convenient features include
linearity, Gaussian or light-tailed features. The investigators intend to
develop mathematical tools that enable the analysis of stochastic systems that
exhibit non-linear, non-Gaussian and potentially heavy-tailed type
characteristics. Their goal is not only to provide tools that can be used to
identify when Gaussian approximations are appropriate and at which spatial
scales large deviations or heavy-tailed asymptotics should be used, but they
also aim to develop techniques to improve upon Gaussian and tail asymptotics by
means of corrected approximations and sharp large deviation results. These
techniques will help researchers identify the spatial and temporal scales under
which Gaussian approximations are valid. In addition, the investigators aim to
provide tools that allow to understand how such spatial scales transition into a
large deviations region which may incorporate heavy-tailed approximations and
more refined information. Since the qualitative behavior of a system can change
dramatically depending upon various input characteristics (e.g. light vs. heavy-
tailed), identifying regions or scales when tractable approximations can be
safely used would be of great value.

Recent developments in areas such as Communication Networks, Catastrophe
Modeling, Insurance and Finance demand more complex time-series models that are
either non-linear or exhibit non-Gaussian and/or even heavy-tailed features
(such as ARCH and GARCH type processes). For example, portfolios of insurance
claims or complex financial securities count their individual risk factors in
the order of thousands. The factors can give rise to extremely large losses
(heavy-tails) and the dependence structures among such factors, which is crucial
in the overall risk profile, is very complex (giving rise to non-Gaussian
behavior). As a consequence, the analysis of such complex models is challenging
both computationally and analytically and therefore it is necessary to resort to
approximations and efficient computational algorithms. The investigators propose
the use and development of mathematical techniques to better understand when
standard approximations, based on Gaussian laws and linearization, are
applicable; when non-linear features must be taken into account and how does one
transition from Gaussian-type approximations to a type of analysis that involves
large losses or extreme behavior. The outcome of this research will improve the
performance analysis of complex stochastic systems in the areas indicated above.
