This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This effort will provide for Design and
Development (D&amp;D) of the Advanced Technology Solar Telescope (ATST), a four-
meter, off-axis, Gregorian telescope with fully integrated adaptive optics,
capable of resolving fundamental physical processes and magnetic fields
throughout the solar atmosphere. The design of the ATST and the proposed
construction program result from the strongly community-based supported ATST
design and development effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The effort will augment the
project team with key staff to complete the design efforts and prepare for
construction start, and support recommended risk reductions and vendor
contracting preparation needed to move into construction. The completion with
industry of the site architectural and engineering (A&amp;E) work and the
foundation design is the highest priority item within this additional risk
reduction and vendor contracting package. The A&amp;E work and foundation design
drives the start of work on site and therefore drives the construction critical
path. Other recommended work includes adaptive optics deformable mirror
prototyping and wavefront sensor camera development and further instrument and
software and controls development. These risk reduction efforts with industry
flow directly from recommendations made by design and cost review
committees.&lt;br/&gt;
