The rapid data gathering and analysis capabilities of modern, computerized X-ray
powder diffractrometry (XRD) places this technique on an equal footing with the
more established techniques of IR and NMR for routine characterization in the
undergraduate laboratory. Data that once took hours to record and process can
now be obtained in minutes. At Rider, XRD is introduced into the curriculum at
an early stage of a student's development and provides a more diverse experience
at the upper levels. XRD is used as a routine tool for phase identification in
the organic laboratory, thereby exposing not only chemists but biochemists and
biologists to; its utility. XRD is also used in upper level chemistry and
geoscience courses for such tasks as quantitative analysis, crystallite size
determination, elementary crystallographic characterization and conformation of
simple structure. The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount
of funds.
