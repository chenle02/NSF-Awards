The PI will continue investigations aimed at furthering understanding of the
kinematics and dynamics of the secular variation, seeking to provide useful
constraints on theories of the geodynamo. This work is largely based on the use
of observations in the form of a time-varying model of the magnetic field at the
core-mantle boundary. Specific areas of attention include: 1. the determination
of the pattern of fluid flow at the top of the core; 2. forward modeling
techniques to provide simple explanations of observed phenomena in the magnetic
field, and to examine the importance of particular physical processes in the
core and lower mantle; 3. investigation of the short-period secular variation
and especially the search for wave-like phenomena in the core; 4. examination of
the dynamics of compositional convection, and possible growth of a stable layer
near the core surface.
