Abstract ATM-9527098 Thomas L. Mote and Vernon Meentemeyer University of
Georgia Research Foundation, Inc. UNIDATA: An Equipment Request to Advance
Education and Research in Climatology/Meteorology at the University of Georgia.
Funds will purchase two X-terminals and an overhead projection system for use in
student weather briefings, class lectures, and research presentations. Extra
disk storage is also necessary to enable the creation of an archive of selected
surface and upper-air observations. The equipment will be used primarily within
the Climatology Research Laboratory and will enhance the education of students
and provide the university with the means to access new research projects and
fully participate in the UNIDATA community.
