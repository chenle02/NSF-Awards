Flight in insects is a sophisticated behavior which requires an array of
physiological and morphological specializations. Flight behavior provides a
convenient system for investigating temporally precise neural processes, as well
as novel aerodynamic mechanisms. The research to be done under this award to Dr.
Michael Dickinson focuses on the flight control of insects at several levels of
analysis: from the physiological properties of identified neurons and muscles to
the mechanics of wings and resultant production of aerodynamic forces. The work
will characterize the neural circuitry and flight forces underlying a specific
steroetyped component of flight control behavior which involves the rapid
rotation of the wings during the transition from downstroke to upstroke which is
modulated during turning manuevers. The timing may be controlled by a specific
steering muscle whose output is modified by both rapid sensory feedback from
receptors on the wings as well as visual input descending from the head. The
circuitry will be studied by intracellular recording from motor neurons during
controlled stimulation of sensory pathways. The effects of muscle stimulation on
wing rotation will also be tested. The flight apparatus will be equipped with a
torque balance, so that the aerodynamic forces can be directly correlated with
changes in the timing of the flight locomotion. This research will contribute to
the understanding of rapid sensory-motor processing and aerodynamic mechanisms
of flight.
