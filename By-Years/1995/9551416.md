A laboratory, to support a three-course sequence in parallel and distributed
computing is being created. The goals of the lab are (1) to provide a rigorous
grounding in the basics of these fields, while exploring innovative educational
ideas: the use of a distributed spreadsheet to teach the basics of distributed
computing, and an active learning approach to teaching parallel algorithm
design; (2) to orient the courses toward the technical issues students encounter
in applying parallel and distributed computing to Information Technology (IT)
problems in the service sector (e.g., air transportation, telecommunications,
wholesale and retail trade, health care, the financial services industry) rather
than problems in scientific computing. The course is taught on workstation
networks and gives equal attention to database problems as well as to numerical
computing. The course also introduces issues of security and reliability, which
are often more important than program performance. The course sequence
culminates in a group project course in which students carry out projects
motivated by real problems from the IT sector.
