This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award funds a workshop focused on
developing a research plan for work in the Soledad Basin, a high sedimentation
rate anoxic basin with laminated sediments off Baja California. Topics covered
will include 1) the 20th century warming of the California Current System and
its effects on ecosystems, 2) teleconnections between North American drought
conditions and ENSO, and 3) the intensification of oxygen minimum zones along
the western margin of North America. The workshop will bring together an
international (mainly US and Mexican) group of scientists who are studying
modern and past climate processes and oceanographic/ecological changes in the
Soledad Basin, and examine the potential for a long-term monitoring program that
would allow better interpretation of the sedimentary record.&lt;br/&gt;
