ABSTRACT AST 94-15574 SCHMIDT, Maarten This grant will continue systematic
surveys of quasars of very large redshifts, in order to explore their properties
in the first few billion years after the Big Bang. Because quasars are highly
luminous, they can be observed to larger distances (and so greater ages, when
the Universe was much younger) than any other astronomical object. Since quasars
optically look just like stars, the main problem in finding them is how to
discriminate them from stars. The survey technique in this study involves video
recording of low dispersion spectra, which in the case of large redshift (i.e.
large distance) quasars will exhibit the strong emission line Lyman-alpha. The
survey is conducted like a census, aiming for completeness to well defined
limits. A sharp downturn in the number of quasars found in previous work beyond
a redshift of 3 indicates that the initial period of birth of quasars, and
probably that of galaxies as well, is being observed. ***
