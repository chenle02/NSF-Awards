The PI will investigate a number of problems, using homotopy aspects of
arithmetic geometry, that may be thought of as generalizations of the period-
index problem for the Brauer group, the u-invariant problem for quadratic forms,
and the Hasse principle for a quadratic form over a number field. The project
will focus on the interaction of field arithmetic and the complexity of
algebraic structures, such as quadratic forms, Brauer groups, linear algebraic
groups and homogeneous varieties. The project represents a set of techniques and
experiments designed to capitalize on the new topological perspective in the
study of algebraic structures. It will aim to support and further the
interactions of these areas with arithmetic algebraic geometry, algebraic
topology and the algebraic geometry of stacks and
moduli.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The relevance of these topics, rooted in algebra
within pure mathematics, is exhibited by their connections to a wide range of
other subjects in recent years. Besides their many ties to other branches of
mathematics, the algebraic structures at the core of this proposal have also
found applications within diverse areas from theoretical physics to wireless
communications. The research component of this project will seek to capitalize
on and enrich our understanding of the many connections to other areas of study
in order to gain more leverage in understanding these fundamental and important
algebraic structures. The project's outreach components include funding
conferences aimed at establishing a community inclusive of graduate students and
young researchers, undergraduate colloquium aimed at increasing interest in
mathematics, and facilitating a mentoring program for high school students in
northeast Georgia interested in mathematics. It will also pursue strategies
towards improving the mentoring and retention of graduate students in
mathematics.
