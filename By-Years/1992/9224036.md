This project will develop an innovative set of instruments to study how members
of the general public react to emerging global environmental problems. The
proposal assumes that willingness to take action on environmental issues is
influenced by some combination of the underlying backgrounds and values of
individuals and the way in which environmental issues enter their awareness and
are framed for them. The researchers will design a set of questions to assess
willingness to take action in regard to four specific environmental problems:
greenhouse warming, species loss, and two "newly emerging" environmental issues
to be chosen during the course of the research. Vignettes in the questionnaire
involving each environmental problem will be experimentally manipulated to vary
whether they involve claims of harm to the individual, to others, or to the
biosphere, and whether such claims of harm are said to be disputed by some
experts or not. Willingness to take action will be assessed through a variety of
questions concerning willingness to pay for countermeasures and likelihood of
joining activities to pressure private industry and government agencies to deal
with environmental problems. These vignettes and other parts of the
questionnaire will be developed through a series of pilot studies and then
employed in a small scale (N=200) telephone survey of a representative sample of
adults living in Northern Virginia. If this project is successful, the
researchers contemplate mounting a larger investigation employing the
experimentally varying questionnaire vignettes developed here. This project will
contribute to an understanding of the conditions under which members of the
general public are likely to join activities designed to deal with emerging
environmental problems. In addition, this research will improve our
understanding of the general process by which attitudes in regard to emerging
and unstable issues become formed.
