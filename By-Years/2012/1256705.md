This research project will address the fundamental, but complex biological
phenomenon of the link between brain function and behavior. The brain is an
integrated and dynamic system with regions, neuronal tracts, and cell types that
show distinct responses to environmental stimuli, and these responses must be
integrated to coordinate behavioral response. In this project, the mechanisms
underlying aggressive behavior in honey bees will be analyzed. It is known that
metabolism is integral to the aggression in honey bees, however, the
consequences of the aggression-related shift in metabolism, in terms of neural
and behavioral plasticity, remain unknown. The Project will combine the modeling
tools of systems biology with genomic data and experimental validation to
address the link between brain metabolism and behavior in the context of
aggressive behavior in the honey bee. The Price Lab will construct a genome-
scale metabolic network model for the honey bee, which will provide a framework
to hypothesize how changes in metabolic gene expression affect metabolism in the
honey bee brain. In addition, they will analyze genetic and regulatory variation
between sub-species of honey bee to identify candidate regulators of brain
metabolism. Identifying genetic variation in the regulators of brain metabolism
may provide insight into whether natural variation in aggression is a result of
heritable differences in metabolic regulation in the brain. The combined
modeling and experimental aspects of this project offer a multitude of
opportunities for students to take part in independent research and learn new
modeling and experimental techniques.
