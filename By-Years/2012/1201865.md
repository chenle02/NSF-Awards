Objective: The objective of this program is to develop a luminescent infrared
sensor that combines ultra high sensitivity and high selectivity while requiring
minimal alignment compatible with field use. This sensor will permit to rapidly
detect trace quantities of molecular species in the field such as hospitals,
airports, commercial borders or on the battleground and will have direct
implications for health care, law enforcement and national security.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The intellectual merit of this
research resides in providing the first demonstration of a label free yet highly
selective and highly sensitive optical sensor for molecular detection. The
proposed sensor will reach unprecedented sensitivity while providing spectral
resolution identical to conventional FTIR. This research will also provide new
insights on the fundamental interaction of infrared light with resonant
molecular vibrational modes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The broader
impacts of this research reside in its potential for developing novel sensors
with direct applications in health-care, defense and homeland security. High
sensitivity sensing of trace analytes has many applications ranging from breath
analysis to detection of explosives or illicit substances. The proposed sensor
can also be operated in solution and has very promising potential in bio-sensing
for detecting and monitoring the metabolism of single microorganisms such as
cells, virus or bacteria. It is therefore expected that this research will have
a very broad societal impact. In addition this research will be integrated into
several educational and outreach activities with an emphasis on under-
represented groups and international education.
