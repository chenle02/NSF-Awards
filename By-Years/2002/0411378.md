Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New and adapted separation experiments are
being developed to build awareness among our students of the capabilities and
limitations of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary
electrophoresis (CE). The project involves incorporating separation science
experiments and concepts across several chemistry laboratories so that, with
repeated exposure, students have a clearer understanding of the experimental
parameters that affect separation. Students will work together in an adaptation
of the group format described by John Walters in a series of articles (Walters,
J. P.; Analyt. Chem. 1991, 63, 971A; Analyt. Chem. 1991, 63, 1077A; Analyt.
Chem. 1991, 63, 1179A). Ultimately students learn to adjust these parameters to
improve separation. They also learn the full range of applicability of these
instrumental techniques by analyzing a broad range of samples with different
goals in mind, including chiral analysis, methods development and simulation,
and protein and peptide characterization. Chemistry majors will discover that
separation science has obvious applicability across all of the molecular
sciences, and they will become more adaptable in their ability to solve chemical
problems with a more complete and unified approach than before.
