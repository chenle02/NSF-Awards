9451534 Chen To offer undergraduate students hands-on laboratory experience and
to improve laboratory instrumentation for better undergraduate education in the
field of Environmental Science, we will incorporate Inductively Coupled Plasma-
Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES) into curricula and offer research
opportunities to undergraduate students. ICP-AES is the ideal choice for
elemental analysis for the majority of inorganic pollutants regulated by EPA and
OSHA. The ICP-AES workstation will greatly enhance the undergraduate laboratory
experience for students learning instrumental methods, environmental chemistry,
toxicology of heavy metals and fate of pollutants in the environment. Specific
experiments will be conducted to maximize the use of these workstations and to
increase instruction efficiency using new teaching methods like cooperative
learning groups and rotating workstations. Analysis of pollutants in the
atmosphere, soils, waters and sediments will be covered, so ICP-AES may be used
as an investigative tool in research and result in scholarly works with
undergraduate coauthors. Since chemistry, biology and environmental science
students will take laboratory courses using these workstations, the project will
impact a significant number of students.
