Recognition memory is the type of memory in which people can recognize whether
or not they have seen an item or experienced an event before. It is a basic form
of memory, essential for normal cognitive function; its absence is a sign of
very severe pathology. Recent work has shown that normal recognition memory is
characterized by strong regularities that permit the analysis of its underlying
psychological mechanisms. One such regularity is that anything that affects
performance on old items, items seen before, such as increased study time or
forgetting, also affects performance on new items, those not seen before, in
exactly the same way. For example, if forgetting is produced by increasing the
time from presentation of old items to test, an individual performs more poorly
on the old items, as one might expect, but also performs more poorly on new
items; this is unexpected, since the new items will never have been seen before
the test and might be expected to be unaffected by a delay preceding the test.
The symmetry of the effect indicates that the individual performs (though almost
certainly not consciously) a complex analysis of the state of items, an analysis
of the sort expected by a particular set of decision theories, including signal
detection theory. This research will explore this regularity experimentally, as
well as related regularities, and develop a mathematical description of the
underlying decision process that produces the regularities.
