9311567 Kennedy Dr. Kennedy is examining the conceptual foundations of the new
theories in physics which describe quarks, the so-called `gauge theories.' Gauge
theory is a dizzyingly exotic theory of the underbelly of our physical world.
Quarks are laden with properties like `charm' and `flavor,' but are so
absolutely imprisoned within protons and neutrons that direct observation seems
foreclosed. Gauge theorists seriously debate the prospect that these quarks
reside in a world which consists not of the mere three spatial dimensions plus
time, but of seven or even eleven dimensions. These fantastical proposals seem
all the more strange for being derived from a venerable, but odd principle
inherited from classical mechanics. Eugene Wigner has styled the principle of
`gauge invariance,' as the equivalent of introducing the `location of a ghost'
into the theory's equations but then requiring that all predictions remain
undisturbed. This odd procedure is the core of the theory. To date, philosophers
of physics have failed to evaluate and apply gauge theoretic advances in the
fierce debates now being waged. Dr. Kennedy, under this grant, is pioneering the
philosophical study of gauge theories. In the course of his research, he plans
to interview leading theorists in gauge theory. His research is concentrated in
the geometrization of gauge theories and the bearing of gauge theory on non-
locality debates. He hopes to resolve whether the model of the physical world
that gauge theory presents does in fact resolve some central and long-standing
questions about action at a distance. He is undertaking this research with
Jeremy Butterfield and Micheal Redhead at Cambridge University. ***
