This award supports a study of cosmogenic radionuclides in the GISP2 ice core.
Accelerator mass spectrometry techniques will be used to measure Beryllium-10,
Aluminum-26 and Chlorine-36 isotopes at selected depths on the core. The results
will be applied to dating ice cores and deducing the history of solar activity
and variations in the geomagnetic field. These analyses will also be useful for
studying climatic history through effects of atmospheric circulation and
atmospheric chemistry on nuclide deposition.
