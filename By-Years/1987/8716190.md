One of the least known regions and time periods is the Neolithic period in
northern China. In order to help remedy this situation, the student during the
course of this project will analyze data from the recently excavated site of
Jiangzhai which dates to the Yangshao period (ca. 6300 b.p.). The student will
analyze the spatial organization of Jiangzhai in order to understand the social
organization of the village. He will test a hypothesis that the village was
organized around a segmentary system thereby increasing knowledge about
prehistoric societies and the way they were organized. Specifically, this
research project will provide new information on the organization of early
neolithic communities in China. Significantly, the student has the support of
Chinese archaeologists. This means that he will have the opportunity to open a
vast new geographical area to U.S. archaeologists and at the same time increase
international cooperation and collaboration.
