9600364 Fisher The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty- four months of research
abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
conditions. This award will support a twenty-one month postdoctoral research
visit by Dr. Brian L. Fisher to work with Dr. Hamish G. Robertson at the South
African Museum in Cape Town, South Africa. Funding for this project is being
provided by the U.S.-South Africa Program. Dr. Fisher will perform a systematic
review of three groups of endemic ants on Madagascar. Ants are well suited for
analyzing historical patterns. Because the elevational and regional
distributions of many ant species are restricted, they are ideal for determining
patterns of endemism and vicariance. This study will provide important data on
the subject species and on the historical biogeography of the region. ***
