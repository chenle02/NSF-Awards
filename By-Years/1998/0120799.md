The SERC addresses the needs for software productivity and quality. It also
provides a focal point for the exchange of ideas among industry and academia and
serves as a direct infusion of these ideas, thereby accelerating technology
transfer. SERC resources include over 50 faculty and 100 students at 9
universities working with practitioners from software intensive industries to
solve software problems and advance the state-of-the-practice in software
engineering.
