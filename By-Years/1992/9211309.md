This is a Research in Undergraduate Institutions award (RUI) to study the
effect of economic development on gender inequality and women's labor for
participation. The study will focus on the effects of four factors on gender
inequality in labor force participation and distribution, namely the effect of
prior sociocultural emphasis on women's roles, the effect of a society's level
of economic development, the effect of the degree of society's economic
dependency on other countries, and the effect of the type of trade strategy
employed by a society. A longitudinal data set containing data for 92 nations is
used in panel regression analyses to identify basic patterns and test
hypotheses. Most research on the relationship between women's status and
economic development is based on case studies, and the results of these studies
are often contradictory. This study, in contrast, will provide a systematic
analysis data for many countries over a long period of time. This is likely to
clarify many of the ambiguities in previous research on economic development and
gender inequality.
