HRD-9353215 Jacquez, Ricardo New Mexico State University The purpose of this
project is to increase the number of baccalaureate degrees awarded to minority
students in science, engineering, and mathematics (SEM) by establishing an
Alliance for Minority Participation (AMP) in New Mexico. The New Mexico AMP will
be established through a partnership of 25 postsecondary institutions including
100 percent of the state's 20 public two- year colleges. A governing board will
implement the alliance in meaningful collaborations with academia, industry,
government and other entities. This issue is vitally important to new Mexico
because: (1) about half of New Mexico's population is of minority heritage
including 60 percent of all students in Grades K-12; and (2) New Mexico has the
highest population percentage of American Indians and Hispanics of any state.
The New Mexico AMP will be a multidisciplinary comprehensive undergraduate
program. The Alliance will increase the number of minority students receiving
baccalaureate degrees in SEM to over 700 per year by 1998 and to over 1,800 per
year by the year 2003. The program will implement the following strategies:
establish articulation agreements that will serve as the Alliance's cornerstone.
Faculty development and distance learning systems will also be utilized; provide
recruitment, retention, and assistantship programs; maximize summer bridge
programs for minority students; and provide research experiences through summer
internship programs.
