0914382 &lt;br/&gt;E. M. Hunt&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A one-year exploratory
research project will explore thermite-generated metallic foams containing
silver nanoparticles and their possible antibacterial effects. Silver is known
to have such an effect, and dispersing the nano-sized "silver bullets" could
have valuable societal / technological impacts, forming the basis for new
antibacterial products that would be nontoxic to higher
organisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The foam, its generation techniques, and its
properties are all interesting and represent innovative, exploratory research.
The PI intends to develop preliminary results testing her hypothesis that "the
Al particle size and amount of gasifying agent will affect the microstructure of
the metallic foam as well as the antibacterial efficacy." Factorial experimental
design will be applied to establish and optimize the effects of precursor
particle size, amount of gasifying agent, and optimum reactant mixture, where
the properties to be optimized have to do with antibacterial action on E. Coli
and Staphylococcus aureus. The PI is partnering with Dr. Naharun Ghosh,
Associate Professor of Biology, who will oversee this part of the work and serve
with the PI as a co-advisor of the graduate student working on the project.
Morphology will also be examined by electron microscopy (TEM and SEM) and X-ray
diffraction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project should also have valuable
educational impacts for the engineering and biology students involved in the
one-year project. West Texas A&amp;M is a primarily undergraduate-serving
institution, offering a useful opportunity to stimulate students for science and
engineering studies, as shown by the PI's other educational activities. By
engaging a female PI, an African-American male undergraduate, and a Hispanic
female undergraduate, the project would have impact on diversifying the STEM
impact.
