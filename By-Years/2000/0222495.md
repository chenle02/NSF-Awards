This dissertation would investigate how social networks explain the health
advantage of first-generation Mexican-American immigrants over second-generation
Mexican-Americans born in this country. The research uses participant
observation and in depth interviews with 60 first- and second-generation adult
Mexican Americans in Detroit to describe how local and transnational networks
differ between the generations and how these network differences help explain
differences in health outcomes.
