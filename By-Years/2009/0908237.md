In this investigation, Dr. Robert Fesen and a graduate student will study the
nearby supernova remnant Cassiopeia A. This object was produced by the explosion
of a massive star following the collapse of its inner core, and its proximity
allows detailed study of gas velocities and the abundances of many chemical
elements. The main part of the work is the analysis of a large number of spectra
obtained at the MDM Observatory near Tucson, Arizona. The velocities derived
from the spectra will be compared to the latest theoretical models of how gas is
excited by shocks. The goal is to create a complete map of all the ejecta,
including both parts of the high velocity jets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project will also assemble multiwavelength maps of Cassiopeia A for analysis by
this and other research groups. The study of this object is expected to have
many important implications for the general phenomenon of core-collapse
supernovae. The bulk of the data will constitute the Ph.D. dissertation of the
student. The PI and his team will continue their extensive outreach activities
to the public and to school groups. &lt;br/&gt;
