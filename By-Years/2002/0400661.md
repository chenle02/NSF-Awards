Spintronics is an emerging area in solid state science and engineering. Its
broad goal is to utilize carriers' spin to realize novel electronic devices that
rely on the creation, manipulation, and detection of spin and spin-currents. If
successful, such manipulation of spins can also have impact on another emerging,
and perhaps even more exotic, field of quantum computing, as spin is the leading
candidate for registering the quantum bit of information in the proposed quantum
computers. The goal of this project is to explore ballistic spin transport in
clean, two-dimensional carrier systems in AlAs quantum wells where, thanks to
their large effective g-factor, the electrons can be spin-polarized with a
modest magnetic field (~ 1T). The project involves the crystal growth of the
basic materials, via molecular beam epitaxy, the fabrication of various devices
using optical and electron-beam lithography, and transport
measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project incorporates a high quality and
comprehensive educational component. The PI is dedicated to the education of
both graduate and undergraduate students, and the project will result in the
education of students in critical, state-of-the art areas of science and
technology, including the fabrication, characterization, and physics of high
quality layered semiconductor structure. The PI is also committed to a broader
education of the public in science and engineering. He participates in various
K-12 teacher training programs in electricity and magnetism, general areas that
are linked to the topic of this proposal. The programs include training
sessions, kit development, and demonstrations at regional schools.&lt;br/&gt;
