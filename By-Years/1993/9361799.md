9361799 Dixon Analytical techniques, based on fluorescent lifetime measurements
are currently being developed for applications in clinical chemistry and
biological research. By measuring the phase of the fluorescent emission from a
sample relative to that of an RF-modulated excitation source, it is possible to
accurately determine the fluorescent decay rate. Although sensitive phase
fluorometers have been constructed in a number of research laboratories, they
require the use of large, expensive laser sources to excite the fluorescent
sample. The commercial introduction of a phase fluorometer requires the
development of compact, efficient laser sources with the correct combination of
output power, wavelength and modulation bandwidth. Diode-pumped, intracavity sum
frequency lasers can be modulated at rates up to 1 GHz and are capable of
producing output powers in the blue and green that are greater than 25 mW. In
this Phase I SBIR program we will investigate the feasibility of using a sum
frequency laser to excite the sample in a phase fluormeter. A 490 nm sum
frequency laser will be built and its modulation bandwidth and output power
determined. The source will then be imaged into a commercial fluorescence
microscope and the modulation depth of the fluorescent output determined as a
function of input frequency. ***
