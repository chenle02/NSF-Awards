Two of the end products in stellar evolution are white dwarfs and neutron stars.
They are extremely compact objects, with sizes of the order of the earth in the
case of white dwarfs and of the size of a medium-sized US city in the case of
neutron stars. Many of these objects rotate rapidly or possess intense magnetic
fields. Interesting and very complex nuclear reactions and emissions of high-
energy radiation may take place on them, particularly when they accrete matter
from their surroundings or interact tidally with a nearby stellar companion
(which itself may be a neutron star or a white dwarf). The Principal
Investigators propose to explore computationally the hydrodynamic, relativistic,
radiative, atomic, and nuclear processes related to the formation, evolution,
and detection of white dwarfs and neutron stars. More specifically, they propose
to investigate the production and transport of X- and gamma-rays near the highly
magnetic surfaces of neutron stars, the fate of neutron stars near their minimum
mass, and the formation of cold, low mass white dwarfs from slow accretion in a
galactic disk.
