This research project will focus on the development of new ways to test
hypotheses in some important models that are workhorses for much empirical work
not only in economics, but throughout the social sciences. Indeed, the models
considered will include the well known linear regression model. The Principal
Investigator and his collaborator, Joseph Romano (Stanford University), will
consider the use of randomization methods to test certain hypotheses in these
models. The researchers will provide conditions under which tests of hypotheses
constructed in this way control the probability of a false rejection in finite
samples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will also provide even weaker
conditions under which tests of hypotheses constructed in this way control the
probability of a false rejection approximately in large samples. Finally, the
researchers will explore the extent to which these tests have desirable power
properties, at least in large samples. Due to the widespread use of these
models, it is expected that improvements in the ways to tests hypotheses in
these models will have broad impact.
