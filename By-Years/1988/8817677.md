This Minority Research Initiation (MRI) planning grant will utilize
neuroanatomical techniques to determine the role of the mammalian tachykinin,
Substance P and Substance K, in the steroidal regulation of male mating
behavior. Results from preliminary studies indicate that Substance P production
is regulated by gonadal steriods in three critical areas of the mating behavior
pathway: the medial nucleus of the amygdala, the bed nucleus of the stria
terminalis and the medial preoptic area. This research is intended to extend
these findings by identifying the connections of Substance P containing neurons
within the mating behavior pathway using retrograde and anterograde tracers.
