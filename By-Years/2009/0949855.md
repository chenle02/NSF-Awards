Microbial Biodiversity of the Hawaiian Anchialine
Ecosystem&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anchialine environments are coastal land-locked
bodies of brackish water exhibiting tidal fluctuations due to their simultaneous
subterranean connections to the ocean and groundwater aquifers. Home to often
regionally endemic organisms, this ecosystem type is increasingly becoming
endangered due to anthropogenic pressures. This is especially true in the
Hawaiian Islands, which has the only natural anchialine environments in the US
but where &gt;90% have already been lost or degraded. Thus, the opportunity to
document the biodiversity contained within Hawaii's anchialine ecosystem is
rapidly dwindling. While microbes are essential to the function of this
ecosystem, they have so far been poorly characterized. To rectify this, this
project will utilize high-throughput DNA sequencing and environmental data to
identify factors influencing Hawaii's anchialine microbial community composition
across space and time as well as quantify how perturbation alters community
structure and function. Furthermore, a Hawaiian Anchialine Microbial (HAM)
repository will be established to maintain access to these microbial communities
given their potential for containing taxa of basic research and/or applied
scientific value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall, this project will broaden the
basic biological knowledge for one of Hawaii's least studied and potentially
most endangered ecosystems. Additionally, undergraduates and a graduate student
from underrepresented groups will be trained and mentored over the work's
duration. Federal and State of Hawaii governmental agencies have also identified
information to be developed by the proposed work as having significant value in
the future implementation of anchialine environment management strategies in the
Hawaiian Islands. Lastly, Hawaiian anchialine environments and their biota will
be utilized as a tool for educating K-12 students, teachers, and the general
public in Hawaii and Alabama on a range of scientific topics
