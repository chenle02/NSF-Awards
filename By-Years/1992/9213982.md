This grant covers experimental Elementary Particle Physics research by a group
at the University of Louisville in collaboration with other NSF and DOE
supported scientists. The group will complete it's study, at Fermilab, of the
production and decay of vector mesons. The group will also participate in a
major upgrade of the multiparticle spectrometer at Brookhaven in order to study
mesonic states with unusual quantum numbers.
