9602917 Willson This Americas Program award will fund a collaborative research
project between Dr. Mary Willson, Pacific Northwest Research Station, Portland
and Dr. Juan Armesto, Universidad de Chile , to examine the effects of forest
fragmentation on density and reproductive success of two endemic bird species in
the Chilean forest, the chucao and the huet-huet. The fundamental working
hypothesis of this study is that population densities and/or reproductive
success of the species are lower in smaller, more disturbed forest fragments.
After documenting these patterns in relation to forest size, the focus will be
on the possible ecological mechanisms by which fragmentation affects the
breeding of the birds. The south-temperate rainforests of southern Chile and
far- western Argentina are being cut at a very rapid rate and are rapidly
disappearing. Conservation planning requires an understanding of the ecological
mechanisms that influence population viability in order to determine the most
effective measure for minimizing the risks of regional extinction. The long-term
goal of this work includes the development of a landscape-level model for
biodiversity conservation in an agricultural landscape. ***
