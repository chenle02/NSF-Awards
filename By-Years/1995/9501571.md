Recent improvements in speech recognition technology has made spoken natural
language dialog a viable means of human-computer interaction. An important
unresolved issue is the handling of miscommunication. By studying previously
recorded human-human and human-computer dialogs, the following strategies for
reducing miscommunication in natural language dialog will be investigated: ( 1)
extending an expectation-driven model for input understanding; (2) developing a
context-based model for selective verification of user inputs; and (3)
developing methods for engaging in subdialogs for resolving miscommunications.
These theories will be implemented and evaluated under both simulated and
experimental conditions. The results from this project will provide a new
benchmark in evaluating the adequacy of current dialog theory as well as provide
further data on the characteristics of spoken human-machine dialog. The project
will also develop several enrichment educational programs in support of the
predominantly rural and less economically developed eastern part of North
Carolina.
