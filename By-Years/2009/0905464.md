Programmers are increasingly designing concurrent software to effectively
harness the computational power of multi-processor and multi-core architectures.
Writing correct concurrent software is challenging, and system-specific
concurrency libraries are particularly vulnerable in that they are affected by
the subtle and complex rules governing the relationship among reads and writes
to shared memory in multi-processor systems. The goal of this project is to
develop technology that will assist programmers in building high-performance and
correct system-level concurrent software with respect to precise modeling of the
essential details of the underlying architecture. The investigators will explore
specifications for accurate machine-readable descriptions of experimental and
commercial memory models in both constraint-based and operational styles. To
allow developers to understand subtleties of specific memory models, this
project will investigate algorithms and tools for checking equivalence between
two specifications and for automatically generating test programs that exhibit
the differences. Tools for verifying concurrency libraries with respect to
memory model specifications and for automatic insertion of memory ordering
fences, will be developed and evaluated on lock-free implementations of commonly
used data structures. The proposed research will be integrated in a new upper-
level course on multiprocessor programming.
