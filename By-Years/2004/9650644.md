Infrared (IR) analysis is one of the most commonly used analytical methods,
especially in organic chemistry. A dispersive IR is too slow for use by larger
classes and is not well adapted for analysis of solid samples. This project
represents a 10-year emphasis on the improvement of the student laboratory
experience including increased hands-on use of significant instrumentation. An
upgrade of the IR instrumentation enhances the quality of the student laboratory
experience. The department is incorporating Fourier-transform-infrared (FTIR)
based experiments in freshman- through senior-level courses. The speed and
accuracy of the FTIR allows the performance of experiments that were not
feasible with a dispersive IR. With the diffuse reflectance attachment, solids
as well as liquid samples can be analyzed readily. Four new experiments in the
freshman-level courses for majors, minors, and liberal arts students introduce
the freshmen to the FTIR. The major program enhancement occurs in organic
chemistry, where 14 experiments are being enhanced by the use of FTIR analysis
of reagents, products, and unknowns. The ability to analyze solid samples with
IR is a major improvement in the organic laboratory. A new polymer kinetics
experiment in Physical Chemistry utilizes the speed of the FTIR. A quantitative
IR experiment with an environmental application is being introduced in
Instrumental Methods, and a new experiment which demonstrates H-bonding effects
is being introduced in Biochemistry. The FTIR is also being utilized in the
summer research program (SEURP), especially in Organic Chemistry projects.
