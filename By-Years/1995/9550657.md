9550657 The objectives of the research are to examine: (1) the nature of U.S.
academic scientific and engineering research contributions to industry; (2) the
extent to which the research has contributed to industrial developments: and (3)
the educational relevance and value of the accompanying university-industry
research relationships. The project is designed to provide a better
understanding of the nature of academic research and its relationship to
industrial innovations. Sampling designs used to select interview participants
serve to maximize variability so that useful generalizations of patterns can be
derived, supplementing data obtained form mail surveys. Dissemination of project
results through publications, mailings, and presentations will provide timely
information on the nature of and factors shaping the contributions to industry
of academic research in science and engineering and their educational impacts.
Involvement of students in the project and dissemination in courses will
contribute directly to education.
