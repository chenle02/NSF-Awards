As laminated fiber composite structural elements become more popular, their
mechanical properties need to be efficiently modeled; in particular, that there
be a complete understanding of their buckling and postbuckling behavior. The
work will plan for a study focused on the development of methods for analyzing
the local, Euler, and flexural-torsional modes of buckling in laminated
composite beams of open and closed cross section. The effects of shear
deformation will be accounted for. The methods will be developed for beams whose
cross-sectional elements consist of rectangular laminated plates with varying
degrees of anisotropy.//
