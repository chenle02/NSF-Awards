Title: Numerical Methods for Hyperbolic Systems and Related Problems I propose
to study and design numerical methods for hyperbolic systems of conservation
laws and related problems. The underlying physical problems arise from fluid
dynamics, rarefied gas dynamics and wave propagation. I plan to work on three
main projects: 1. the development of robust shock capturing methods for
hyperbolic systems with relaxations, including kinetic equations; 2. the
construction and study of relaxation approximations and relaxation schemes for
viscous systems of conservations laws and Hamilton-Jacobi equations. 3.
asymptotic and numerical study on wave propagation in random media. These
projects if successfully carried out will provide attractive numerical methods
that are able to simulate a wide variety of challenging physical and industrial
problems. They also help to gain more understanding of the underlying physical
phenomena. With the development of modern computers, scientific computation has
been playing a central role in scientific investigation. The physical and
industrial problems we study here arise in complex fluids, optics and materials,
which can not be solved by other scientific tools. Nervetheless, numerical
computation has been demonstrated to be an effective tool to obtain very good
approximations to the solutions of these problems. Our goal, if met, will
advance our ability to utilize modern computers to solve these problems of
significant importance.
