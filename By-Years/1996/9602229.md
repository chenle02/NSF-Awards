9602229 Chavez This award supports development of a training program involving
mathematics, statistics and evolutionary biology. The project is a joint effort
of 11 core faculty members and 8 associated faculty from 9 departments and
administrative units who will collaborate in the education and training of
undergraduate and graduate students. The didactic and research programs will
focus on a combination of theoretical and empirical approaches to the
understanding of evolution considered at scales ranging from that of individual
genes to that of organisms and populations. The program aims to equip students
with a level of understanding of evolutionary biology and of applied mathematics
sufficient to permit them to work at the forefront of modern quantitative
biology.
