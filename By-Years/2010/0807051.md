This project is awarding scholarships to academically talented and financially
needy students and is supporting the scholars through a variety of structures
and programs. Women and students from underrepresented groups are being
especially targeted for support. Student scholars are enrolled in eight cohorts.
Four of the cohorts are composed of traditional students and four are composed
of transfer students. The students are enrolled in an engineering discipline and
simultaneously in an Engineering Leadership Program, in keeping with the
National Academy of Engineering's vision for the engineer of 2020. Through this
program, the engineering leaders of tomorrow are being recruited and developed.
There is significant industry and institutional support for the program.
