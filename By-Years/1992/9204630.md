The project will investigate the area of algebraic algorithms for symbolic
computation. Specifically, it will continue work on algebraic simplication. This
research will be on denesting nested radicals, and the computation for Galois
groups. The project will also study the relationship between polynomials and
integers. In the latter areas, the project will investigate such questions as:
When do lower and upper bounds translate from one domain to the other? The
project will also attempt to develop theory of symbolic computation for floating
point polynomials.
