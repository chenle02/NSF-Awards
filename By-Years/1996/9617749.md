`Team, Individual, and Organizational Learning from Experience in Two High-
Hazard Industries ` The PI proposes to examine various influences of
organizational learning by examining team processes in a nuclear power plant and
a chemical plant. Three levels of questions will be posed. First, at the group
level, the PI will examine relationships such as the influence of team members'
diversity on the richness of the incident review reports. At the individual
level, the PI will examine whether serving on an incident review team will
influence the cognitive complexity of the team members. At the organizational
level, such issues as the location and means of the learning will be examined. A
correlational analysis of reports within one or more nuclear power plants will
be performed in order to test some of these hypotheses. In addition, a second
study, which is quasi-experimental in nature, will involve pre- and post-
measures following a root-cause incident review. The PI will attempt to
manipulate such factors as the diversity of the teams performing such reviews.
