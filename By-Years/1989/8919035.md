This research will examine the development of conceptual thought and the
ability to recall the past in infancy and early childhood. To date, we still
have little information about the way infants conceptualize the world or how
long they can recall events that have happened to them. The phenomenon known as
child amnesia, in which adults recall little or nothing about their early years,
suggests that infants may not be able to recall events for very long. At the
same time, there is a small amount of evidence suggesting that two-year-olds can
recall events that occurred when they were one year of age. This research
program will use deferred imitation, in which children are asked to imitate
events they observed in the past, to measure recall in children too young to
talk. The expectation, based on pilot work, is that this research will
demonstrate that the cause of childhood amnesia is not an inability to store and
remember events as they occur in infancy. There has also been little
experimental work on concept formation in infancy. It has been suggested that
infants first form very simple concepts, of such things as dogs, chairs, and
cars, and only later develop broader concepts of animals, furniture, and
vehicles. This research will use several techniques to investigate this
hypothesis. One procedure will use an object- manipulation task, in which one-
year-olds show, by the order in which they touch objects put in front of them,
whether they consider them to be related or not. Another procedure will use an
object-exploration task, in which the amount of exploration of a new object is
used to estimate whether the infant considers it to be related to objects
previously explored. Based on work already accomplished, it is expected that
infants' understanding of concepts such as animals and vehicles will be found to
be more similar to those of older children and adults than has been thought
traditionally to be the case. The overall goal of the research is to provide a
systematic body of knowledge and a coherent theory about the early foundations
of thinking and remembering.
