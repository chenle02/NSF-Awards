Despite the importance of phonetics in modern linguistic study, there are no
regular graduate or undergraduate course offerings at the University of
Washington in linguistic phonetics, due to lack of facilities. Funding is
requested for the purchase of equipment to establish a phonetics laboratory at
the University of Washington, thereby allowing speech analysis lab components to
be included in several existing undergraduate classes. We will also be able to
incorporate illustrative materials from the lab in other undergraduate classes.
