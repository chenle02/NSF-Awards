The interaction of intense laser pulses with atomic clusters requires
consideration of physics spanning the range from laser-solid to laser-gas
interaction. Individual clusters are atomic aggregates up to ~1000 A in diameter
formed through van der Waals bonding of atoms/molecules in a gas jet expansion.
Intra-cluster density is that of a solid, while a gas of clusters formed through
nozzle expansion is much less. The laser pulse therefore interacts locally with
nanoscale solids (the individual clusters), yet sees the bulk medium as a gas
through which it can propagate. Thus, the physics of ultrashort laser-cluster
interaction has completely new features not realized either in traditional
laser-solid target experiments or in laser-gas experiments. This project will
explore further, and as yet untested, implications of a laser-cluster
interaction model developed by the group. Specific attention will be paid to the
investigation of strong compressions of intense laser-heated clusters. In a
second, more applied, set of experiments, work will continue on the study of
extreme ultraviolet and x-ray emission from intense laser cryogenic noble-gas
droplet interactions. This work has direct implications for extreme ultraviolet
(EUV) source development for next-generation lithography.
