Aerosol processing is a well established method to produce submicron particles
for technologies like pigments and sinterable ceramics. Although the particle
size distribution often controls the quality of the final product, this
parameter cannot currently be measured on-line because of the dense particle
streams. In addition, the number density and temperature of the particles in the
reactor are also unknown. This proposal is a combined research effort by
Advanced Fuel Research, Inc. and the University of Maine to develop a sensor for
particle analysis of high-temperature gas reaction mixtures. The sensor will be
on-line and in-situ and will deconvolute the Fourier Transform Infrared spectra
to yield the particle size distribution. The Phase I research will demonstrate
the technology by deconvoluting the measured infrared spectra of known TiO2
particles to yield an accurate size distribution. A simple laboratory scale
flame will show that in-situ measurements are feasible. Phase II research will
include extensive research on a TiO2 flame in an industrial laboratory. The
final step of Phase II will be a field test on a commercial TiO2 reactor.
