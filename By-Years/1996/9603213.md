An exploratory initial project between the PI and Hans-J`rg Schneider of the
University of the Saarland has found a group of cationic cyclophanes that cause
an unexpected base-pair opening in RNA, but stabilize the duplex state of DNA.
These highly selective differential results with RNA and DNA have potential in
drug development, biotechnology, and in enhancing our understanding of the
mechanism of selective recognition and conformational reorganization of RNA and
DNA. In order to develop an understanding of this process at the molecular
level, it is essential to expand the analysis by probing the compound and RNA
dependence of the base-opening reactions. Training of young investigators will
be significantly enhanced by the opportunity to conduct research with the German
group.
