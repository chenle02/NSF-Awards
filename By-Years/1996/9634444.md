ABSTRACT Proposal Number: 9634444 PI: Foss This is a grant to provide funding to
offset the costs of travel to attend a panel discussion of Automotive Research
Issues in Fluid Mechanics at the Second ICASE/NASA Langley Research Center
Industry Roundtable at Williamsburg, Virginia. This activity is a natural
extension of the NSF/Big 3 Workshop on Fluid Flows/Fundamental Research Issues
that took place at Michigan State University in August, 1995. It is hoped that
this activity will further identify significant fundamental fluid mechanics
research issues and foster a greater degree of collaboration between industry,
government and academe in the area of automotive research.
