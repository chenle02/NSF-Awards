This Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) site at Purdue University for the summers of 2004-2006. The program
director is Mark A. Lipton who is assisted by co-PI Jean A. Chmielewski. Nine
students will participate in a ten-week program. Chemistry majors, especially
women and underrepresented minorities, will be recruited from colleges and
universities that do not provide opportunities for research. Faculty from the
Departments of Chemistry and Medicinal Chemistry &amp; Molecular Pharmacology
will direct the research in the multidisciplinary area of molecular biology.
Research topics include: design of small molecules to interact with enzymes,
hormone receptors, biological transporters, lipid membranes or nucleic acids;
drug delivery; and chemical understanding of disease states. Weekly training
sessions, tutorials and research presentations will be held to increase the
students' understanding of the interdisciplinary area of chemical biology.
Formative and summative evaluation of the program will be undertaken using
quantitative and qualitative techniques.
