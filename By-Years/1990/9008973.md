To develop a computer program which can simulate the growth of GaAs and related
compounds on patterned substrates by Organometallic Chemical Vapor Deposition
(OMCVD). The growth simulation is based on the Wulff construction technique
which has been shown to accurately predict the shapes of epitaxial layers grown
on patterned substrates. In order to perform the Wulff constructions a detailed
knowledge of the oreintation dependence of the growth rate is needed. Therefore,
a comprehensive investigation of the OMCVD growth rate as a function of
crystallographic orientation, growth temperature, and alloy composition will be
conducted. Such a simulation program will be very useful for designing discrete
and/or integrated microwave millimeter-wave, and optoelectronic devices and
circuits.
