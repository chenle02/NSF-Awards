9352501 Henley This project provides a multi-purpose microcomputer laboratory
(1) to enhance teaching in experimental psychology; and (2) for the learning of
computer applications in the discipline. The microcomputers, dynamic classroom
display, and simulation software form a laboratory which has significantly
improved the teaching environment for computer applications. The project has
increased students' access to basic microcomputer facilities, and to local and
remote computer networks. The project is also expected to improve instructional
capabilities in experimental psychology by providing a laboratory facility for
majors and, through the innovative use of simulation software, provide direct
experience with the critical thinking, design, conduct, analysis, and reporting
of experiments not possible through the traditional lab approach.
