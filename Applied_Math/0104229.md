The investigator will research high-order and pseudospectral methods for the
numerical approximation of solutions of linear and nonlinear partial
differential equations of evolution. The proposed activities divide into methods
for time and space: high-order time stepping without severe stability
restrictions, even in the presence of stiffness, and the use of radial basis
functions for spatial differencing (with emphasis on the need for efficient and
stable computation). Analytical and numerical techniques will be used to frame
and solve interesting issues.

Computational simulation is a vital part of research and design in science and
engineering. Many problems of academic and industrial interest remain beyond
present computing power, and there are also significant benefits in solving
tractable problems more quickly and accurately. Innovations in both hardware and
software will be needed to continue the progress of recent decades. The research
in this proposal is directed at finding and improving the techniques that will
be used in scientifically oriented software in the near future. There is an
emphasis on phenomena that propagate or evolve over long distances or times.
Specific fields of study that could benefit include optical communications,
imaging by electromagnetic or acoustic illumination, and computational
chemistry.
