Expert systems that perform diagnosis are being used increasingly in medicine,
aerospace, and other high-stakes domains. Research has recently shown that
heuristic schemes widely used in such systems to encode uncertain knowledge -
used in diagnosis and decision making - can produce faulty reasoning. Schemes
based on probability and decision analysis have been proposed as sounder;
however, they have often then been dismissed as intractable. The goal of this
research is to develop and evaluate new probabilistic and decision-analytic
schemes, that are both sound and tractable. The planned products comprise
methods for encoding uncertain knowledge in probabilistic form; for encoding
judgments on values, costs, and preferences; efficient algorithms for
probabilistic inference and decision making; and methods to generate
comprehensible explanations of systems conclusions. These techniques are
demonstrated and evaluated by application to two large knowledge-based systems,
including a reformulation of QMR (Quick Medical Reference), a system for
diagnosis in internal medicine; and a system for fault diagnosis and repair of
gas turbines for power generation. These techniques are expected to lead to
diagnostic expert systems that are easier to build and modify, that are more
reliable, and that generate diagnostic test strategies that minimize unnecessary
and expensive testing.
