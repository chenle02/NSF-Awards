Quantum mechanics is a theory of microscopic physics that underlies many of the
technological advances of the century. Nevertheless, there continue to be
puzzles connected with its interface with the macroscopic world. The systematic
study of that interface, within statistical mechanics, has puzzles of its own
connected to the origins of irreversibility. The Investigator has suggested an
intertwining of these problems with a common resolution, and has summarized his
previous publications in a recent book, `Time's Arrows and Quantum Measurement`
(Cambridge Univ. Press, 1997). Continued research in this area will consist
mainly in the sharpening of experimental tests proposed in the book. An
encouraging aspect of this project is that the experimental techniques involved
are similar to those presently being developed for quantum computing and quantum
cryptography (especially some of the EPR pair work). Other research by the
Investigator will concern developments in the Feynman path integral, especially
its application to Lagrangian-only theories. Finally, collaborative work in
statistical mechanics will involve abstract studies on non- equilibrium systems
as well as practical applications to zeolites and other problems in
photochemistry.
