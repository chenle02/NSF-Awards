This project is establishing a computational chemistry facility in order to
introduce undergraduate students to the concepts of modern molecular mechanics
and molecular modeling. The facility integrates these modern computational
methods into a broad range of chemical topics extending from theoretical
physical chemistry to bio-organic DNA chemistry. It is utilized in both the
classroom and undergraduate research environments. An academic- industrial
alliance is being established to acquaint students with an industrial
perspective for the use of these tools. In addition, the industrial consultants
suggest and develop new computational experiments for classroom use as well as
conduct workshops for high school science teachers during the summer months.
