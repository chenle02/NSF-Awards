This award will complete the preparation for study of a cranium and partial
skeleton of the world's oldest proto-mysticete whale, recovered in 1987/88 from
the late Eocene La Meseta Formation, Seymour Island, Antarctic Pennisula. The
cranium is virtually complete, lacking part of the petrosal region, and several
vertebrae and ribs of the thoracic skeleton also are preserved. As such, it is
the oldest known proto-mysticete in the world, suggesting - with evidence from
many other groups - that Antarctic waters produced many evolutionary novelities
in advance of their appearance in lower latitudes. The specimen is entombed in a
dense, highly indurated sandstone, making its preparation tedious and time
consuming. About one- half of the work has been accomplished, under the auspices
of the University of Otaga, Dundedin, New Zealand, being supervised by Dr. R.
Ewan Fordyce. Once preparation and study have been completed, the specimen will
return to the United States where it will be curated into the collections of the
Smithsonian Institution. Because of this and in recognition of the significance
of the specimen, the Smithsonian Institution Department of Paleobiology will
contribute to the project.
