9512919 Hagedorn George Hagedorn of VA Polytechnic Institute, a mathematical
physicist, will team up with two Argentineans from the Universidad Nacional de
Cordoba, Guido Raggio in chemical physics and Roberto Fernandez in statistical
mechanics, to study and improve existing algorithms used for computing non
adiabatic effects in certain quantum-mechanical systems. They will also apply
mathematical and numerical approaches to the study of these same phenomena. The
work will analyze surface-hopping techniques in a study centered on collisions
and other interactions between two systems of widely different mass. The
investigators will try to supply a rigorous mathematical basis for computational
techniques used in these studies, and will also search for new or improved
algorithms related to the surface-hopping techniques. The problems addressed are
important conceptual ones in theoretical physics. Results may come in the
theory, the development of techniques, and in the understanding of the systems
studied. The collaboration is a new one for the three researchers and will
include a graduate student from VA Polytechnic. ****
