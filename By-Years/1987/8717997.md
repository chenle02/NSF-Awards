With current knowledge about the primary events of photosynthesis and the
availability of methods for isolating and characterizing the pigment-protein
complexes of the photosynthetic membrane, it is an ideal time to conduct
experiments designed to delineate how structural features are related to
function. Dr. Loach's major emphasis will be to examine the core light-
harvesting (LH) complex of photosynthetic bacteria. Recently he has been able to
isolate a subunit form of this complex and has developed methods that allow the
reconstitution of either the subunit form or LH-I from bacteriochlorophyll and
the protein. This is a very powerful tool. It is planned to use these methods to
systematically vary the structure of the pigment molecule and the two
polypeptides in order to probe the interaction between the prosthetic groups and
protein.
