This program of research aims to better understand the Universe at the smallest
scales by probing nature's basic symmetries and their relation to the origin of
mass. The 2012 discovery of a Higgs boson with mass close to 125 GeV represents
both the crowning achievement of the standard model of particle physics and a
hint beyond it - how can a light Higgs boson possibly survive huge,
destabilizing quantum effects without new, undiscovered physics? Further, dark
matter is known to exist from astronomical observations; however the particle
properties of dark matter remain shrouded in mystery. The combined activities of
the UIC group address those basic questions puzzling science - the origin of
mass and the particle nature of dark matter - and have the potential for
surprising discoveries that may change the way we understand our physical
world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award also supports technological advances for
high energy frontier experiments, in particular building and commissioning
sophisticated high-speed electronics and silicon tracking systems for particle
physics experiments. The challenges faced in advancing those technologies
enhance the disciplinary knowledge in engineering fields. The data analyses and
hardware projects supported by this award provide valuable experience and
knowledge for students and post doctoral associates at UIC, enabling them to
pursue successful careers in the private sector, academia, or research
laboratories. The UIC group also fosters close collaboration between high school
teachers and the UIC group members, strengthening teaching and learning in
Chicago-area high schools. As these high schools serve predominantly minority
students, this project aims to increase the number of students from historically
underrepresented groups that major in STEM disciplines.
