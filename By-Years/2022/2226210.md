The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of an affordable, accurate, and reliable technology that will
provide a unified solution to track a bike location. This technology may reduce
the costs associated with two million stolen bikes each year. It may also aid in
detecting accidents promptly which is vital in providing trauma treatments, as
well as the prevention of fatal injuries. The development of this new US
technology may directly impact public health, insurance companies, and the
community by improving the safety of bicycle riders and reducing the economic
burden of bike accidents and theft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is
based on the development of an accurate, versatile, and affordable bike location
tracking, accident detection, and vital sign measurement system utilizing a
variety of sensors on an internet-of-things (IoT)-based platform. The system is
connected to the cloud via cellular services and sends real-time data that is
acquired by the sensors to the cloud. The technology utilizes a novel algorithm
to detect bike accidents and vital signs. The algorithm gathers data from the
sensors, performs feature extraction, and applies machine learning algorithms to
detect accidents and measure vital signs. In addition, the technology utilizes
GPS location tracking to locate the exact location of the bike and sends the
location to an emergency contact in case of an accident so that the rider can
receive needed help as quickly as possible. The location tracking system also
helps in locating stolen/lost bikes. The biosensors mounted on the bike handle
can measure the rider's vital signs, such as heart rate and blood oxygen level,
and provide information for activity tracking, as well as detect arrhythmia or
heart failure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
