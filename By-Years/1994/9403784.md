9403784 Poritz The topics covered in the research involve moduli problems and
gauge theory relative to vector bundles over punctured Riemann surfaces. Such
notions have potential applications to aspects of mathematical physics involving
integrable systems and soliton theory. Harmonic map techniques will be applied
to tackle rigidity questions of actions of lattices on compact manifolds. ***
