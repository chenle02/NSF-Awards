The primary objective of the project is to enhance and port a software
simulation package, SIMARC, to a Sun workstation network. The purpose of the
SIMARC package is to enable the user to quickly develop Modularly Configured
Attached Processor (MCAP) architectures and simulate the execution of various
algorithms on these architectures. The SIMARC package has already been developed
at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) for IBM PC compatible computers.
The simulator and assembler portions of SIMARC would be ported by a group at
UTEP and the architecture editor portion would be ported by a group at the
Instituto Technologio de Estudios Superiores Monterrey Campus Ciudad de Mexico.
Also both groups would use the package to develop high-performance architectures
for executing signal processing and communications algorithms. The principal
result of the project would be a software package that could be used for the
fast prototyping of customized attached processors designed to efficiently
execute specified sets of algorithms. ***
