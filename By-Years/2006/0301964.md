A very important issue in particle physics today is searching for signals of
physics beyond the standard model. The B meson system is especially important in
that decays of this particle are very sensate to possible novel sources of CP
violation that occur in non-standard models. This research will focus on two
classes of models which are extensions of the standard model, namely left-right
models and multi-Higgs models.&lt;br/&gt;One aspect of the proposal will be to
formulate new observables or techniques that might be used to help discriminate
low energy signals of new physics. CP asymmetries that will be examined include
possible decays of the b quark into a strange quark and photon or dilepton pair,
as well as decays of the B into J/psi and phi mesons.&lt;br/&gt;
