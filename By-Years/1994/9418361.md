9418361 Fourkas This starter grant award to Boston College will support the
research of Professor John Fourkas. The research will focus on ultrafast
dynamics of stretched liquids. Negative presure techniques will be used to
control the relative importance of intermolecular attractive forces. Ultrafast
nonlinear-optical spectroscopic techniques will be used as a sensitive, real-
time probe of the microscopic dynamics that are affected by tension-induced
changes in the intermolecular potential. Optical Kerr effect experiments will
monitor the effects of stretching on intermolecular vibrational and
intramolecular reorientational dynamics, both of which are strongly affected by
attractive forces. Initial experiments will involve studying anomalous behavior
of water, and techniques will be developed to study arbitrary liquids at
substantial negative pressures. A detailed knowledge of the roles of attractive
and repulsive intermolecular interactions is essential in developing an
understanding of the microscopic details of chemical processes in solution with
the ultimate goal of being able to observe and control directly the course of
chemical reactions in solution through changes in the nature of the liquid
itself.
