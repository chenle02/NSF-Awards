Cooperative research in several areas of computer- intensive statistics will be
undertaken with partial support from this award by Dr. Arthur Owen of Stanford
University and Dr. Peter Hall of the Australian National University. One area
involves comparing the efficiency of using bootstrap and other nonparametric
inference statistical methods to that of using analytic techniques in areas such
as genetics. In addition, computational issues in complicated statistics will be
studied as they apply to determining parameters in multiple regression models.
The project represents excellent collaboration between Australian and U.S.
researchers with complementary expertise in the area of computer-intensive
statistical methods. U.S. researchers will have access to Dr. Hall's group, as
well as similar centers of excellence at Bond University and the University of
New South Wales. New algorithms and better theoretical understanding of these
statistical methods are expected to result from the project, as well as
potential applications of these improved techniques to genetics and other areas
requiring regression models.
