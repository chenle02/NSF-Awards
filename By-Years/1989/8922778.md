In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program of the
Chemistry Division, Professor Harris will develop new methodologies for studying
weakly interacting molecules, for examining the behavior of matter in strong
magnetic fields, and for investigating the interaction of polarized light with
clusters of atoms. A new method for determining the correlation energies of
inhomogeneous electron gases will be used to determine the Van der Waals
energies of interacting closed shell systems. A density functional theory of
matter in strong magnetic fields will be developed, and the manner in which
polarized light scattering may be used to give information about clusters of
atoms in given quantum states will be examined. A new method for determining
ground and excited state properties of many-electron systems will also be
investigated.
