The objective of this research is the demonstration of the practical validity of
measuring electric potential in the atmosphere using several kites attached to a
common tether. If this technique is successful, a simple and relatively
inexpensive method will be available to monitor continuously electric potential
and, by inference, that of the earth.ionosphere system. The measurements will be
conducted on Christmas Island, Republic of Kiribati.
