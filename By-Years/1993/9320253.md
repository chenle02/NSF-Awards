9320253 Chin This project explores the application of ocean surface current
radar (OSCR) systems to the identification of outfall mixing zones. A single
deployment of an OSCR system is typically equivalent to deploying over 1,000
current meters, with spacings between current meters on the order of a few
hundred meters. Clearly, OSCR systems have the capability to define ambient
surface currents in far greater spatial and temporal detail than is currently
feasible using any other method of measurement. This study will investigate
whether data derived from short-term OSCR deployments can be effectively
incorporated in a (far-field) mixing model that describes the dispersion of
contaminants discharged from sewage outfalls. This project is composed of three
tasks: (1) Verify the stationarity of spatial current patterns measured by
short-term (on the order of a month) OSCR deployments; (2) Develop an algorithm
to utilize OSCR measurements to simulate mixing of contaminants discharged from
ocean outfalls; and (3) Utilize the developed algorithm to predict dispersion at
a site where OSCR measurements are available, and validate the algorithm by
comparing the predicted and measured dilutions. ***
