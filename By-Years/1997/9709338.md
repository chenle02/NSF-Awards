9709338 Ohlsen The nonlinear dynamics of equatorially trapped waves and their
interactions with complicated topography and basin boundaries will be studied in
the laboratory. The new experimental technique utilizes the magnetic body force
of ferrofluids to achieve the full spherical geometry of geophysical flows. A
complimentary finite-difference numerical model of shallow water waves on a
sphere will be used to aid in interpreting the laboratory results.
