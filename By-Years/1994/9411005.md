9411005 Beuth This Research Initiation Award is to study residual stresses that
exist in products built by the successive application of molten layers of
material. This process offers many competitive advantages over other methods of
manufacturing for some products that are produced in small numbers. The research
will attack two of the problems that are limiting the application of this
technique; namely, warping of the product via residual stresses and stress
driven delamination. Progress in refining the shape deposition manufacturing
process is dependent upon results from research such as that contained in this
project. ***
