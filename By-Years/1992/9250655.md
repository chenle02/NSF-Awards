A laboratory combining chemistry and geoscience is being developed for water
chemistry studies. The project is supported with new analytical equipment, an
inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES). In
interdisciplinary courses, using Seneca Lake as a natural laboratory, students
perform collaborative geoscience-chemistry and environmental studies projects to
investigate many of the lake's chemical components. Student research projects
are also developed using the ICP-AES.
