The naturally-occurring radionuclids Th234, Pb210, and Po210 have in the past
proven to be useful as tracers of particles dynamics in the marine water column,
especially so for the estimation of the vertical flux of particulate organic
matter. In this project, investigators at the estimation of the vertical flux of
particulate organic matter. In this project, investigators at the University of
Washington will study how these radiotracers interact with colloidal organic
matter (i.e., organic material traditionally, if somewhat artificially, defined
as being smaller than particulate but larger than dissolved material) in the
coastal waters of Santa Barbara Basin. After isolating and chemically
characterizing the colloidal organic matter, the investigators will determine
how these two isotopes are partitioned been particulate, colloidal, and
dissolved phases. The results are expected to lead to a better kinetic
understanding of the role colloidal material plays in the generation of
particulates and in the marine geochemistry of tracer isotopes.
