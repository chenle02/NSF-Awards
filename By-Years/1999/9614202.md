engineering students to attend the 1996 IEEE Power Engineering Society's Summer
Meeting. The goal is to give students opportunities to learn about the most
recent developments in power system research, engineering, construction, and
operation. Through demonstration of the vitality and vigor of the power
industry, students can better evaluate its attractiveness as an area of study
and its importance to the future of the United States and other countries. ***
