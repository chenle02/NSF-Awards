This action funds Loretta Au of Stony Brook University to conduct a research
project, entitled "Quantifying the influence of mutations on protein structure
and function," during the summer of 2012 at the National University of Singapore
in Singapore, Singapore. The host scientist is Dr. Christopher Hogue.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is its integration of mathematics
and biochemistry to understand how the function of a protein changes when amino-
acid substitutions are made to the original sequence. Detecting and measuring
these effects can help highlight regions in a protein that are involved in a
specific function, as well as the extent to which that function may be changed.
Knowing this can help guide projects in protein engineering, by suggesting where
modifications should be made to yield a stable protein with a novel or improved
function and also by providing a sense of which proteins might serve as ideal
models for design.

The Broader Impact of this work is to help develop software for learning about
protein evolution in a classroom or laboratory setting. Experimental methods are
often limited to studying proteins that have been able to adapt or overcome
natural selection; our computational approach can simulate a variety of
mutations, including those that deteriorate protein integrity. These examples
provide biophysical and biochemical reasons for how modifications are able to
improve or worsen protein stability and function. The Broader Impacts of an
EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience
outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific
infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society,
culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for
international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers,
and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.
