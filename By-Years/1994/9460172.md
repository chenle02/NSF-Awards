Current methods used in the manufacturing of advanced composite materials
contribute to long delivery times and high component costs, and limits
widespread usage of composites in commercial applications. A new technology has
been developed for forming silicon carbide using thermal spray techniques in
open air. The goal of this SBIR Phase I proposal is to investigate this silicon
carbide forming technology for low cost fabrication of composite structures. The
sic technology will be evaluated as (1) a surface coating for fiber reinforced
composites and (2) as a matrix material for incorporating various high strength
fibers into composite structures. If successful, this technology has the
potential for an order of magnitude reduction in composite manufacturing cost
and time. This proposal is a 6 month effort which focuses on experimental
evaluating using small prototypes to assess technical feasibility. The total
cost of the Phase I activity is $61,500.00
