Mobility scooters are an affordable and popular assistive mobility technology
that is critical in facilitating the social participation of people with
mobility challenges/disabilities, thereby improving their quality of life.
However, the challenges of mobility scooter driving safety are evident, and
mobility scooter accidents can cause serious injuries, with the potential
consequence even being death. To tackle this challenge, this project builds a
driving safety assessment system for mobility scooter drivers based on multi-
sourced data. This system can be used at home or in clinical settings to assist
doctors and rehabilitation experts. This work generates a mobility scooter
safety assessment metrics framework and system that provides new usable,
accurate and interpretable techniques to advance rehabilitation and tele-
medicine processes for the target group of population, empowered by deep-
learning-based data intelligence. The interdisciplinary project team forms
synergy between Computer Science and Kinesiology and Health Promotion from two
Hispanic Serving Institutions, i.e., California State Polytechnic University,
Pomona and University of Texas San Antonio, in collaboration with Casa Colina
Hospital and Centers for Healthcare and California State University Northridge
Center of Achievement. This work introduces real-world research problems to
underrepresented minority students in participating institutions, and the
demonstration of research capacity expansion can be disseminated to other
Minority Serving Institutions.

This project consists of the following research thrusts: 1) Building a
longitudinal mobility scooter driving dataset collected from the mobility-
disabled/challenged population with various conditions (e.g., neurologic
disorders, age-related diseases, and dysfunctions); 2) Developing a mobility
scooter driving safety metrics framework; 3) Designing robust, multi-modal deep
learning algorithms for accurate safety assessment, employing pose-estimation
and time series analysis of multi-modal data; 4) Implementing the proposed
driving safety assessment system on usersâ€™ mobility scooters using customizable
hardware and software, and conducting extensive testing and evaluation of the
proposed system.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
