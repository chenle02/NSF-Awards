STUMP 9626879 Capturing the popularity of dinosaurs and other fossils, Dinofest
International will be a major science education event inspiring interest in
science by everyone who attends or otherwise participates. Dinofest
International is unique in that it transcends and builds bridges across the
boundaries between scientists and nonscientists, students and teachers, and the
interested public. Through displays of fossils from the seven continents, the
public will gain an understanding of their world wide distribution and the
international nature of science beyond political boundaries. Three primary and
interrelated components will be presented at Dinofest International: 1) science
education centering on a spectacular exhibit of dinosaurs and other fossils, 2)
a symposium of dinosaur experts presenting papers intelligible to non-
specialists, and 3) an interactive broadcast linking a panel of dinosaur experts
with audiences of school children at remote sites throughout North America. The
prime focus of Dinofest International will be tens of thousands of square feet
of dinosaurs and other striking fossils, many never seen before, organized about
the theme of hands-on exhibits and demonstrations, for school children and their
teachers. Study guides and opportunities for teacher training will be provided.
A symposium involving the world's leading dinosaur experts will cover all
aspects of dinosaurs, such as how they functioned and behaved, theories of
extinction, and DNA cloning. The emphasis will be on clear, understandable
presentations geared for the literate public, as well as the experts. A special
session on Science Education and Policy will be featured. A proceedings volume
will also be published. The third major component of Dinofest International will
be a live broadcast from Arizona State University involving a panel of dinosaur
experts responding to questions and comments from school children at a number of
selected sites across North America and possibly elsewhere in th e world.
Additional components of Dinofest International include a large, multi-media art
exhibit displaying pictorial and three dimensional art with a natural
history/dinosaur theme, and a film festival during which the classics of
dinosaur-centered films will be shown.
