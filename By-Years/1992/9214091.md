This award, made in the Advanced Materials and Processing Program of the
Chemistry Division, is concerned with improving the quality of films of
epitaxially-grown metals, silicon and germanium by means of kinetic energy-
selected neutral beams. The beams will be produced by pulsed laser vaporization
of solid substrate targets with intermediate deposition on a transparent window
before laser ejection to form the high kinetic energy beam. Beams will be
velocity selected by a high speed mechanical chopper to obtain well-defined
neutral kinetic energies in the range of 1-10 eV. Epitaxial growth of the beams
will be probed in situ by low energy ion scattering spectroscopy, Auger
spectroscopy and low energy electron diffraction. Studies will address the
effects of kinetic energy on film quality and growth modes for the low substrate
temperature deposition of metals on silicon single crystals, the formation of
silicides, the homoepitaxy of silicon, and the heteroepitaxy of silicon-
germanium. %%% Fundamental knowledge of the the mechanism of layer-by layer
growth of metals on refractory substrates will advance the technology of
semiconductor contacts for VSLI microelectronics.
