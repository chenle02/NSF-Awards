The Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division funds this
award. Professor Victoria J. DeRose from the University of Oregon investigates
the structures of complex ribonucleic acid (RNA) biopolymers. RNA takes part in
a wide variety of life sustaining processes. It adopts complex and dynamic
structures that are challenging to monitor and predict with current methods. In
this research, new platinum compounds are developed as RNA structure probes and
used to determine RNA structures in cells. The outcomes of this project are
novel methods and reagents for RNA structure analysis, and new information about
large RNA structures in cells. The breadth of methods applied to this project
supports a unique interdisciplinary training environment for workforce
development, including summer undergraduate training for women and other
underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering and mathematics
(STEM). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this research are to develop methods
for long-range tertiary interactions in large RNAs and to understand
determinants for targeting compounds to complex RNA structures. The project
develops exchange-inert platinum (Pt(II)) complexes as RNA crosslinking reagents
and incorporates them into approaches for RNA structure determination. Pt(II)
compounds crosslink purine-rich but noncanonical regions in RNA such as internal
loops and junctions and are robust through RNA isolation methods. To enable
crosslink analysis, novel modified Pt(II) click reagents are synthesized with
installed handles for selective post-treatment modification of Pt(II) RNA
species. Structure analysis protocols based on the unique chemistry of these
Pt(II) complexes and high-throughput sequencing methods are developed, along
with methods to directly image crosslinked species. The specificity of small-
molecule RNA interactions is probed through design of enhanced Pt ligands. These
approaches are used to predict structures of RNAs in vitro and in-cell,
including tertiary structures in long non-coding RNAs.
