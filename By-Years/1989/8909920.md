Theoretical studies are proposed of systems in which an electron sees
simultaneously two forces of comparable strength. One study involves high doubly
excited states in atoms, another the effect of a magnetic field on high singly
ionized states. In these systems the combined potential is non-separable, and
novel analytical techniques are required. Adiabatic and WKB methods will be
used, also diagonalization within degenerate basis states and mapping to linear
differential equations. Long sequences of doubly excited states out to very high
excitation and near-zero-energy resonances in a magnetic field will be
calculated.
