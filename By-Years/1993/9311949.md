9311949 Murthy A theoretical research program will be conducted to understand
the low-energy electronic properties of doped fullerenes. The renormalization
group method augmented by exact solutions for small systems will be the primary
theoretical technique used. Specifically, the following topics will be
addressed: exactly solve small fullerene analogs by the Lanczos method; carry
out a momentum shell renormalization group on the fullerene molecule and obtain
effective interactions at the Fermi surface; use the renormalization group to
identify important correlations on a fullerene molecule and construct a
variational wave function leading to an understanding of the physical mechanism
of pairing; include the relevant intrafullerene phonons in the renormalization
group; use the renormalization group for the full crystal to generate the
appropriate superconducting mean-field theory. %%% This theoretical study will
attempt to understand the properties of the new fullerene molecule. In
particular, the thrust of the work will be on applying new techniques developed
for the study of phase transitions in order to understand the superconducting
properties of these new materials. If successful, the techniques developed will
have wide application in addition to contributing to the understanding of
superconductivity in the fullerenes. ***
