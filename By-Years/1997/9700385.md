This grant is to purchase a positional measurement system dedicated to support
of research in manufacturing engineering and ergonomics. The positional
measurement system is a video based data acquisition tool which captures the
location of key components for manufacturing workstations through optical
sensors and analyzes them using state-of-the-art software. The equipment will be
used in several projects, including: (1) the effects of force production and
fatigue on movement accuracy; and (2) a predictive model of assembly process
times to improve design for assembly and operational scheduling. These research
projects constitute the core investigation of an innovative methodology to
enhance the effectiveness of manufacturing systems. The positional measurement
system enables the increase of speed and accuracy in which time and position
data can be collected, thus reducing the time required to collect the data. It
substantially enhances the research capability and academic infrastructure of
the institution in manufacturing engineering.
