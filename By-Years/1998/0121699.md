The Reciprocal Net project is constructing and deploying an extensive
distributed and open digital collection of molecular structures. Associated with
the collection are software tools for visualizing, interacting with, and
rendering printable images of the contents; software for the automated
conversion of local database representations into standard formats which can be
globally shared; tools and components for constructing educational modules based
on the collection; and examples of such modules as the beginning of a public
repository for educational materials based on the collection. The contents of
this collection come principally from structures contributed by participating
crystallography laboratories, thus providing a means for teachers, students, and
the general public to connect with current chemistry research. The collection
will be fully integrated into the emerging NSDL framework, constituting a
resource of outstanding value for education at every level. The methodologies
and tools of the project enable it to be fully distributed and self-sustaining
after the initial startup period.
