This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER). A novel technique
involving the initiation of cationic polymerization using metal ions is being
explored. In the experiment, Al+ or Cu+ ions are generated in the gas phase by
pulsed laser vaporization/ionization of a metal target using the second harmonic
of a Nd:YAG laser (532 nm). The ions are pulled toward a monomer liquid
(isobutylene which can only be polymerized by cationic mechanisms) by applying
appropriate electric fields across the reaction chamber. Under different
experimental conditions (temperature, pressure of a carrier gas, laser energy,
electric field strength, reaction time) different polymeric products (viscous
liquids or solids) were obtained with average molecular weights ranging from 285
to greater than 40,000. Full characterization of these materials is currently in
progress. Experiments are in progress to extend the scope of this discovery to
include transition-metal ions, mixed metal ions, copolymerization, etc. This
technique could lead to a powerful approach for the synthesis of a wide variety
of polymeric materials with unique properties such as stability, strength, and
photo/electrical conductivity.
