The focus of this research is on the representations of Lie algebras, Lie
groups, and quantum groups, and their combinatorics. The principal investigator
will work on (1) centralizer algebras of tensor representations; (2) Weyl group
symmetric functions; (3) branching rules and centralizer algebras; and (4)
weight and root multiplicities for Kac-Moody Lie algebras. This research is
concerned with a mathematical object called a Lie algebra. Lie algebras arise
from another object called a Lie group. An example of a Lie group is the
rotations of a sphere where one rotation is followed by another. Lie groups and
Lie algebras are important in areas involving analysis of spherical motion.
