This project deals with the interrelationships among fabrication,
microstructure, and properties in two phase alloys. Within this broad category,
several areas of interest include: 1) The effects of alloy deformation on second
phase particles: specifically, how factors such as particle size, shape and
volume fraction effect the rotation, fracture, and plastic deformation of
particles. Practical applications of this research would include improved
modeling of fracture toughness in dispersoid or inclusion containing alloys,
fabrication of ultra-fine heavily deformed in situ composites, and enhancement
of fiber alignment in discontinuous fiber composites by deformation processing.
2) Gradient layers: Sharp interfaces in coated or composite materials may be
eliminated and thermal/mechanical stability enhanced by inserting gradient
layers whose composition gradually varies between that of the two components.
However, at present neither the theoretical nor practical effects of such
gradients is well understood, nor has the effect of the gradient's thickness,
average composition, or "compositional slope" has been characterized. 3)
Microstructural effects on crack closure: In the near threshold region, crack
growth may be retarded by microstructurally dependent effects. The role of
second phase particles in promoting roughness of the crack surface and/or mode
II cracking. 4) Amorphous metals: Effects of second phase interfaces on the
behavior of metallic glasses.
