9422033 Schwan This award provides support for the acquisition of a
computational cluster of 10 Sun SPARCstations, and 2 user-interface capable SGI
Indy workstations. The research projects to be supported include interactive
scientific programs, distributed collaboration, interactive simulations, and
efficient state sharing in interactive systems. A goal of the research is to
develop systems and user interface technologies that will allow the realistic
solution of problems using computing, networking and user interface
capabilities. Primary research projects include on-line interaction with
scientific simulations running on multiple, networked parallel machines;
collaboration support systems that will allow users to collaborate over long
distances; interactive simulations that will allow end users to run and view
system simulations in conjunction with actual system operation; and development
of operating system technologies that address the efficient sharing of state on
single parallel machines and across multiple networked workstations or
supercomputers. ***
