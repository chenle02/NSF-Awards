New econometric models, data visualization techniques and other empirical
methods have the potential to improve science policy. This project organizes a
workshop to examine the policy needs of federal agencies, discuss the
availability of data, and the role of new methods to enhance the returns to
federal investment in science, demonstrate the impact of science funding and
increase the societal and economic benefits. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under the
auspices of National Academies Board on Science, Technology and Economic policy
(STEP) this workshop brings together science policy experts from federal
agencies with scholars from multiple disciplines to examine the development of
new metrics and impact assessment procedures. This workshop has the potential to
transform the process of evaluation and impact reporting by federal research
managers. &lt;br/&gt;
