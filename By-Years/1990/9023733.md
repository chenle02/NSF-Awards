The Skidaway Institute of Oceanographic will acquire a two- axis, fiber-optic
laser doppler velocimeter (LDV) for the study of benthic boundary layers.
Studying the small-scale dynamics between seafloor sediments and the water just
above requires a multi-dimensional approach. Such studies involve laboratory and
field measurement programs, and numerical modelling. Recently developed LDVs
offer a modern way to non-invasively measure mean velocities, turbulence
intensity in both along-stream and vertical directions, and turbulent shear
stress. The LDV flow measurement system will be integrated into a large flume
research facility being constructed with institutional funds. It will serve a
number of investigators in the Southeastern U.S. working on multidisciplinary
problems relating to sediment geochemistry, sediment transport, and benthic
ecology.
