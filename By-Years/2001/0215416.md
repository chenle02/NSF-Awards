For collaborative proposals:&lt;br/&gt;Rutgers University,
0215416&lt;br/&gt;Univ. of Maryland, 0215094&lt;br/&gt;Stephen's Inst. of
Technology, 0215399&lt;br/&gt;VIMS, William &amp; Mary,
0215433&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative award establishes the Mid-
Atlantic Center for Ocean Science Education Excellence to serve 4 states
(Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey and New York). Using a 'matrix model', the
Center will scale-up successful individual programs at the partner institutions
and establish strong linkages between partners. A primary thematic focus is on
the visualization and K-12 classroom use of data from ocean observatories and
monitoring buoys (Rutgers, UMCES, VIMS). Stephens Institute of Technology will
contribute expertise in K-12 educational technology and delivery. Hampton
University will serve as a conduit to underrepresented minority groups and
provide financial support for both undergraduates and graduate students.
