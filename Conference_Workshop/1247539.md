The PI proposes to organize a two-day conference in frontiers of numerical
analysis and scientific computing in Kent State University in April 2013. The
topics of this conference include (1) fast iterative solutions of large systems
of linear and nonlinear equations, (2) iterative solutions of ill-posed
problems, (3) solutions of inverse problems, (4) large-scale eigenvalue and
singular value problems, structured problems in linear algebra, and (5)
mathematics for liquid crystal, and applications to biology. The conference
topics center around the recent developments of tools in numerical analysis and
scientific computing.

In recent years, there have been new and important developments in the field of
numerical analysis and scientific computing. Advances in the design of new
computational algorithms and their theoretical analysis and applications to
different branches of sciences, have generated many new frontiers in this field.
An important tool, inherent in most numerical solution approaches, is the use of
iterative methods. Any breakthrough in the algorithm and theory of iterative
methods will have a huge impact on solving many important problems in different
disciplines. On the other hand, the applications from different fields provide a
great platform for the advance of algorithmic designs and analytical theories of
iterative methods. The PI proposes to organize a conference to address the fast
development in these frontiers. The focus of this conference includes: fast
iterative solutions of large systems of linear and nonlinear equations,
iterative solutions of ill-posed problems, solutions of inverse problems, large-
scale eigenvalue and singular value problems, structured problems in linear
algebra, orthogonal polynomials, quadratures, mathematics for liquid crystal,
and applications to biology. This conference covers computational subjects which
are crucial for solving complicated problems in a wide range of scientific,
engineering, industrial, and economic disciplines, with applications in areas
such as medical and biological image processing, cancer diagnosis, liquid
crystal display, mobile tablet, information technology, aircraft design, radar
technology, petroleum and natural gas reservoir, and natural disaster
prediction, etc.
