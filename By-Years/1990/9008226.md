This project focuses on design of efficient algorithms for combinatorial
optimization problems. Many efficient parallel algorithms were obtained as a
result of a deeper understanding of combinatorial structure of the problems, and
therefore the emphasis of this research is to combine the work on improving the
parallel/distributed complexity of the algorithms with the work on improving
their sequential complexity. In particular, the research concentrates on finding
efficient parallel deterministic algorithms for the class of problems related to
bipartite matching and on finding efficient sequential algorithms for problems
related to generalized flow and multicommodity flow. Another important part of
this research is to develop techniques that allow transformation of efficient
parallel algorithms into algorithms that are efficient in the context of
distributed computation.
