This project will assemble a database of number density measurements in the
plasmasphere from 5 different satellite missions (OGO-5, ISEE-1, CRRES, Polar,
and IMAGE). The missions had complementary orbits and spanned roughly 4 solar
cycles. The cycle of erosion and recovery of the plasmasphere depends on the
relative changes of the strength of magnetospheric as well as on the time since
the last major change in convection. Therefore, this project will employ a
superposed epoch time analysis. Convection events ranging from mild to severely
disturbed will be identified using an automated algorithm and epoch times will
be assigned to all data. The project will create a global empirical model of
plasmaspheric density that includes both plumes and fine-scale structure,
parameterized by space, selected geomagnetic indices, epoch time, sunspot
number, and season. Fine structure analysis will be done by isolating from the
global-scale distribution those density features whose size falls below a pre-
defined length scale. The fine structure will then be characterized by its
dependences on the various parameters being used in the model. Comparisons of
the model results with number densities obtained from LANL and DMSP spacecraft
(two missions not used in the models creation) will be used to validate the
model.

This model will be used along with specific case studies from the 5-mission
database to examine the time-dependent morphology of plasmaspheric plumes, the
details of dayside transport of the eroded plasma, and the fine-scale structures
that are created during the transport. Plasmaspheric plumes can slow down the
dayside reconnection rate (modulating the energy input to the entire
magnetosphere). In addition, the global density distribution, and the fine
structure that prevails throughout the plasmasphere exert a significant
influence upon the growth, propagation, and effectiveness of waves that scatter
energetic particles. All results will be published and posted to the GEM Wiki
website, and to a mirror site hosted by Southwest Research Institute.
