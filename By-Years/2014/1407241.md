Machine learning is a very active area of interdisciplinary research, closely
related to statistics, optimization, and computer science. The goal of this
project is to develop several cutting-edge machine learning techniques for
solving high dimensional problems. The team plans to develop new techniques for
estimating complex graphs and to establish inference procedures for sparse
regression methods, using some recently developed tools in optimization.
Techniques to be developed in this project have a wide range of applications in
many disciplines. Such applications help to promote interdisciplinary research
among statistics, operations research, and bioinformatics. Several students will
be involved in the research activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many machine
learning techniques fit in the regularization framework. This project will
develop several new regularized methods. In particular, the team will use sparse
regularized tools for complex graphical model estimation. Furthermore, the team
will build a new inference tool for sparse regularized regression methods such
as the LASSO, by reformulating the LASSO problem as a stochastic variational
inequality in optimization. State-of-the-art techniques in optimization will be
introduced to the statistical community. The researchers are committed to
establishing both theoretical properties and efficient computational tools for
the designed methods. Applications in various disciplines will help to generate
new knowledge and inspirations from those disciplines.
