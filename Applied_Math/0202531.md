Title: Singularities and Statistics in Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations

A first goal of this proposal is to study mathematically singularities in fluids
and plasmas, and their connection to physical processes. Specific problems
include free surface pinch-off in fluids, geometric depletion of singularities
in active scalars, incompressible Euler and MHD equations related to vortex and
magnetic reconnection. A second goal of the proposal is to study statistics of
long time behavior of dissipative systems, such as thermal fluid convection.
Specific goals include bounds on heat transport in convection, energy cascades,
coarse inertial manifolds, and turbulent front propagation.

Fluids and plasmas involve many active length and time scales that interact
dynamically. The long time behavior of complex systems, such as turbulent
convection, involves also many interacting spatial and temporal scales.
Mathematical studies are needed to guide computer simulations. What quantities
are well behaved, and can be safely predicted with rather inexpensive, coarse
computations? What conditions produce rapid generation of small scales? Which of
these are important and result in qualitative changes? What are the
characteristics of the ensuing dissipative energy transfer? These are
fundamental questions for progress in understanding and computation of complex
phenomena. This proposal is aimed at a core of such questions.
