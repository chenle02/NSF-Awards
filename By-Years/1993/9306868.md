The purpose of this award is to support a conference at the University of
Missouri on the interaction of Functional Analysis, Harmonic Analysis, and
Probability Theory. Proceedings of the conference will be published. The core
topic of the conference is Banach space theory, which is that part of
mathematics that attempts to generalize to infinitely many dimensions the
structure of 3-dimensional Euclidean (i.e.ordinary) space. The axioms for the
distance function in a Banach space are more relaxed than those for Euclidean
distance (For example, the "parallelogram law" is not required to hold.), and as
a result, the "geometry" of a Banach space can be quite exotic. Much of the
research in this area concerns studying the structure theory of Banach spaces.
