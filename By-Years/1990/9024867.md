Professor Battle will continue his work to construct nontrivial quantum field
theories. In particular, this project will concentrate on the nonlinear sigma
model, a strictly renormalizable asymptotically free theory. His technique of
construction will use the relatively new concept of wavelet which he will
develop to meet the particular requirements of quantum field theory. Quantum
fields are the basic quantities which are thought to be responsible for all the
interactions between particles which exist in nature. It is therefore notable
that these objects which are essentially mathematical entities, have not been
shown to exist. Professor Battle is one of the few mathematical physicists who
work in the area of construction of quantum field theories. His project involves
the construction of a model theory called the nonlinear sigma model. A side
benefit of Battle's work is his use of wavelets in this construction. These
objects have turned out to be of use in many other areas of pure and applied
mathematics, and Battle has and will continue to contribute toward their
development.
