As STEM technicians are increasingly involved in multidisciplinary projects,
team work, communications, interpersonal and business skills become crucial to
successful employment. The Institute for Virtual Enterprise proposes to plan for
a Center for Technological Entrepreneurship that provides the means to infuse
entrepreneurship in technical courses. The Center develops, maintains and
disseminates modular curricular materials based on successful practices at
community colleges such as problem- and scenario- based learning and including
those developed and tested in the Virtual Enterprise Institute. Students using
these materials, particularly those from populations underrepresented in STEM
technician fields and students from rural areas, are networked through a series
of virtual activities. The modular materials are disseminated through a network
of faculty demonstration sites mentored by the Center. The planning process
includes two workshops with advisory partners from industry and academia that
are to determine the state of entrepreneurial STEM education at community
colleges and to investigate the need for and design of entrepreneurship student
networks. The planning process also produces a catalog of the skills required by
STEM entrepreneurs and validates the approach of developing modular materials to
infuse these skills into existing STEM courses through the development of
faculty demonstration sites.
