This project will bring eight undergraduates to the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois for a one
semester experience during the school year. Recruiting will be national in
scope. The selected students will be matched with an NCSA research project in
accordance with their interests and background. The disciplinary focus will be
in the computational sciences, with particular emphasis in the application of
parallelization and visualization concepts and techniques.
