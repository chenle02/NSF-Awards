The Philadelphia Elementary Science Kit Collaboration (PESKC) of The Franklin
Institute is a model urban alliance that includes the museum, local corporations
and the School District of Philadelphia. Since 1983 this partnership has
successfully piloted hands-on science kits and workshops to support the use of
activity kits in the K - 6 classrooms and to increase the content area
preparation of elementary teachers. PESKC has four primary goals: --to develop
and produce twenty-eight science activity kits that will augment and support
four major curriculum goals. --to provide professional development workshops for
Philadelphia teachers to train them in the effective use of the kits and to
improve their competence and confidence as science educators. --to expand a
network that will link elementary teachers to science resources in the local
community. --to continue an active program for dissemination of kits and urban
partnership model to defray development cost and support the replication of the
program in urban and other communities across the nation. Additional merits of
this proposal have been its success in a large racially diverse urban school
district, the manufacturing of the kits in Philadelphia by a non-profit job
training agency that provides jobs for those who find it difficult to secure
employment, and the firm commitment of The School District of Philadelphia to
maintain permanently the elementary science kit after implementation ends in
1991. In summary, this proposal addresses a need in elementary classooms and
provides persuasive evidence that PESKC will institutionalize numerous
mechanisms to insure the effectiveness of the materials, teacher education and
dissemination of the model. The leadership is excellent as is the reputation of
The Franklin Museum of Science. The program is consistent with the objectives of
Instructional Materials Development Guidelines and shows the promise of being of
high quality.
