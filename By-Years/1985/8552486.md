This award supports research in analytical solid mechanics, with principal areas
of specialization being fracture mechanics and plasticity. Much of this research
is directed toward the development of the theoretical foundations of non-linear
fracture mechanics. A principal thrust is the analysis and prediction of stable
crack growth and its transition to catastrophic fracture in elastic-plastic
materials. One objective is to develop an approximate analytical method for
assessing how different loadings and specimens affect near-tip elastic-plastic
fields. Crack growth and instability criteria are then based on the near-tip
fields derived. An ultimate goal is to develop analytical criteria capable of
predicting ductile crack growth throughout the range from initial well-contained
yielding up through large-scale and general yielding.
