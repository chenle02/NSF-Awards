This project seeks to carry out research leading to the development of an
intelligent fault, configuration and performance management framework for
virtual carrier networks. The research activity will consider improvements to
the management framework in a multiple cloud setting so that the high
availability and resiliency requirements of carrier grade networks can be
realized. To accomplish this objective,&lt;br/&gt;the project team will apply
novel Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to perform network fault detection and
isolation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research activity has 3 main thrusts: 1)
adapting classical machine learning algorithms to target a very dynamic,
distributed and real-time environment; 2) developing deductive-predictive fault
and performance detection and localization techniques; and 3) developing a
hybrid 'central-distributed' technique for training the machine learning models.
A key project outcome is to enhance understanding of how Network Function
Virtualization (NFV) management, cloud management and operations support can
leverage machine learning. The research team will develop new techniques for
training machine learning models, and a testbed will be developed to validate
the approach.
