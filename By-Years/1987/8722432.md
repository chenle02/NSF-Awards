The research consists of two topics, both related to the development of business
cycle models which are formulated from micro-economic principles. The first part
develops a class of stochastic growth models that combine the most appealing
features of both the representative agent and overlapping generations models.
Like the representative approach, the modelling concepts (consumption, income,
etc.) allow an econometrician to directly match up theoretical constructs with
real world data from aggregate time series. But this model will be much less
restrictive than the representative agent paradigm. The second part uses a
popular model of periodic phenomena to explain business cycles. The model was
first used by Duffing in his study of a pendulum that is forced by a regular
motion and it has not previously been studied by economists. Duffing's model,
when applied to business cycles, suggests that seasonal fluctuations in tastes
or endowments may be the source of apparently random fluctuations at business
cycle frequencies. This model has the advantage of explaining the erratic
movement in economic time series, rather than assuming it, and unlike previous
applications of chaotic dynamics to economics, it is not restricted to systems
which change stability as one moves away from stationary equilibrium.
