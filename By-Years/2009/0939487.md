This award supports undergraduate students attending the Laser Science XXV
Conference to be held in San Jose, CA, October 11-16, 2009. The student's
participation will be via the 'Symposium on Undergraduate Research' scheduled
for Monday, Oct. 12. The students will present the results of their research and
discuss these with each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One broader impact is the
opportunity for these young students to attend a national meeting and give their
first public talks. A secondary benefit arises because collaborations among them
are often born in these sessions. A third impact is the networking among these
students that will be so vital to their future careers as professional
scientists. Also, this meeting encourages them to continue along such a career
path.
