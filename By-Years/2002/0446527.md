Joel Bowman of Emory University is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry program to carry out research on the vibrational
dynamics of several important molecular systems, including the hydrated proton
and hydroxide ion. Another project involving the CH5+ species is being done in
collaboration with Anne McCoy of Ohio State University. A thirdproject to study
the delocalized states of the HCN molecule is being done in collaboration with
Bob Field of MIT, whose group is carrying out experimental tests of Bowman's
calculations. The work is having a broader impact on the fields of atmospheric
chemistry and molecular biology.&lt;br/&gt;
