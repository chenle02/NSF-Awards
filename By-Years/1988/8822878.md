This research is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of spectroscopy. The focus of this research is on improving the
capabilities of analytical chemistry as applied to problems in microbiology.
Particular emphasis is placed on the identification of bacterial and viral
pathogens as well as improving the reliability of DNA sequencing. All of the
proposed studies are based on the use of time-resolved fluorimetry for selective
analytical measurement. A secondary objective of this research is to develop a
new generation of laser-based analytical instrumentation. This research is
designed to explore the possible use of lasers for identification of bacteria
and viruses. Methods for evaluating the structure of DNA will also be explored.
All of these studies are based on the characteristic decay of molecules which
emit light after excitation with laser light. A secondary goal of this research
is to develop new types of instruments which use lasers for analytical
measurements.
