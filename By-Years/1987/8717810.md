The Workshop on Natural Disasters in European/Mediterranean Countries and the
U.S. will take place in Perugia, Italy, on June 27 to July 1st., 1988. The
meeting is sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the National
Research Council of Italy. The purpose of the workshop is to provide a forum to
exchange ideas on scientific progress and on needed research to control and
mitigate the effects of natural disasters, i.e., floods, landslides,
earthquakes, droughts, and other land failures, in southern Europe and in the
U.S.A. The problems and interests that the countries involved have in common
will be identified. The proceedings of the workshop will be published and their
recommendations could lead to cooperative activities on these important research
areas.
