This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a process
to produce SiC multifilament fiber to sell at less than $50/lb. U.S. industry
has a critical need for composite materials that require an economical
ceramic/silicon carbide (SiC) fiber to produce the composite. World supply of
ceramic fibers and particularly SiC is dominated by Japan whose price is in
excess of $300/lb. Many industrial, aerospace and defense applications are
impeded by the high cost of SiC fibers, fiber property limitations and foreign
supply. Advanced innovative manufacturing processing offers the potential to
produce a superior high quality small diameter multifilament SiC fiber for less
than one sixth the current price. This program will develop nontraditional
unique chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processing for the production
demonstration of multifilament SiC fiber, establish that mechanical properties
exceed existing SiC fibers and utilize operational data to demonstrate the
lowest cost of all ceramic fibers.
