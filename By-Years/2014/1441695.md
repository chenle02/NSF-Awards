Design of complex semiconductor circuits and systems requires many steps,
involves hundreds of engineers, and is typically distributed across multiple
locations and organizations worldwide. The conventional processes and tools for
design of semiconductors can ensure the correctness, that is, the resulting
product does what it is supposed to do. However, these processes do not provide
confidence about whether the chip is altered such that it provides unauthorized
access or control. Such undesirable behavior may due to a weakness in the design
that results in an unintentional side channel or due to maliciously inserted
Trojan hardware. This project develops techniques for improving the reliability
and trustworthiness of hardware systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Invariant-
Carrying Machine (ICM) approach developed in this project is based on light-
weight formal methods, and requires only minor additions over the conventional
design process. In this approach, each design carries with it an inductive
invariant that is used to guarantee the security. When receiving a design from
the third party or after a complex design process, the user can check whether
the circuit inductively satisfies the invariant and whether the invariant
satisfies the security rules. Any violation will raise a red flag for deploying
the design. The project develops principles and tools for checking inductive
invariants, investigates suitable security properties, and validates the
approach by testing on hardware Trojan benchmarks.
