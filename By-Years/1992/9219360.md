9219360 Egbert This is a program of research to improve processing and inversion
methods for geomagnetic observatory arrays. The main goal of this research is to
reduce the significant uncertainties in mantle conductivity suggested by the
large variation of published models. To accomplish this, historical and recent
geomagnetic observatory array data will be used to seek constraints on large
scale averages of mantle conductivity. The research involves development and
application of two related methods: multivariate statistical techniques for
exploratory data analysis and data reduction; and methods for simultaneous
inversion of observatory array data for both external sources and Earth
conductivity. ***
