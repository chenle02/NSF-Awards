Over a 28-month period 9 Chicago metropolitan area high school mathematics
teachers at three "hub" high schools and Elmhurst college faculty will assist 60
faculty and their administrators in nine participating high schools in the
application of technology to the mathematics classroom through the use of an
ongoing mentor program. Each of pair of mentor teachers will work with faculty
at three participant schools for a two-year period. The focus of the project is
on trying technology and technological skills to the NCTM Standards, local
textbooks, national curriculum projects, and specific district curricula. The
program involves: 1) spring and summer workshops for mentor teachers and
participant faculty; 2) continuing in- service and on-site visitations by the
mentor teachers; 3) adaptation of new classroom materials and exploration and
development of teaching strategies that take into account local faculty
expertise, hardware/software, course offerings, current texts, and curriculum
emphasis; and 4) the establishment of a resource center/library of technology-
oriented teaching materials at Elmhurst College for the hub, participant, and
other area schools' faculty.
