Howard University, in cooperation with the Naval Research Laboratory, will host
the second Howard University Symposium on Nonlinear Semigroups, Partial
Differential Equations, and Attractors. The conference will bring together
distinquished U.S. and foreign researchers in the mathematical, physical, and
engineering sciences working on the analytical, topological, and numerical
aspects of realistic nonlinear models. These scholars will present current
research and exchange ideas on approaches to current problems in applied
mathematics. The conference will be held August 3-7, 1987.
