An important part of auroral research is to understand the generation of the
auroral current systems and the acceleration of auroral electrons (responsible
for the auroral emissions which can be seen on the ground). This grant addresses
three separate but related topics which are concerned with the coupling,
energetics, and dynamics of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system and the auroral
acceleration process due to Alfven waves. The first topic is an investigation of
the ionospheric cavity and its relationship to auroral arc breakup. The second
topic is the coupling of the shear flow generator at the low latitude boundary
layer to the auroral ionosphere. The third topic is an investigation of a new
mechanism for auroral electron acceleration due to Alfven wave breaking. These
investigations will be carried out primarily through fluid simulations using
fluid models though a hybrid kinetic simulation will be used for the third
topic.
