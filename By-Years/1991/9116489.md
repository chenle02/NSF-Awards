The goal of the research is the experimental determination of the heat transfer
and friction characteristics of internal flow in rectangular channels of
different aspect ratios with one, two and four rib-roughened walls. The data
will be used to evaluate a model for predicting the enhanced heat transfer
performance. Such flow configurations are important for gas turbine heat
transfer and other applications.
