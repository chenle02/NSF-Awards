The purpose of this project is to study a new class of rank statistics for
analyzing nonserial dependent data with missing observations. The dependencies
are assumed to come from multivariate data or repeated measures data.
Nonparametric methods which do not involve the assumption of normally
distributed data are to be developed. The testing and estimation procedures
proposed will be based on asymptotic distributions of ranks of dependent data.
They incorporate intercomponent and interblock rankings and, as a result, are
applicable to a much wider class of problems with nonserial dependent data. They
will also have improved power properties.
