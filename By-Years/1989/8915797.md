This project continues innovative work begun on a previous NSF grant. It
utilizes an identity, originally used by Lord Kelvin in electrostatics, to
calculate the exact stresses in a composite elastic body by analytical
techniques. The solutions that are obtained are important in their own right and
also as problems that can be used to evaluate approximate methods for the
evaluation of stresses in composites.
