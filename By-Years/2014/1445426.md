The PI?s hope to build hold a weeklong symposium to help develop a long-term,
collegial peer network of young polar researchers (those within 5 years of
receiving their doctorates) who would benefit from mentoring and other
interactions with established polar scholars through a common experience at a
symposium. Participants also will receive an introduction to communication,
team-building and leadership skills, and elements of interdisciplinary research.
They expect to develop a core cadre of approximately 30 young scientists. The
proposed symposium would build upon, and also act as a follow on to, a similar
symposium organized by the PI?s during the International Polar Year, the "IPY:
Next Generation Polar Research (IPY NGPR) Symposium".
