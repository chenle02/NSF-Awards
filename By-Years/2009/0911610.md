The Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports the
efforts of Professor Craig L. Hill of Emory University to prepare and
characterize new classes of polyoxometalate (POM) complexes containing either
terminal ruthenium-nitrido bonds or late transition metals with terminal metal-
oxo bonds. The catalytic abilities of these complexes are under investigation.
In another project, robust chiral microporous solids are prepared via self-
assembly methods and form the first enantiopure polyoxometallates that can
undergo asymmetric oxidation catalysis. As with most catalysis reactions, new
products may be obtained more selectively, under milder conditions (air
oxidation, water-compatible), and at a faster rate. The final aspect of this
work includes studies of ion pairing and transport in inorganic cluster
compounds which contain structurally well-defined internal water pools. These
later studies have relevance to biology, medicine and geology.

Professor Hill is actively engaged in collaborations with several Historically
Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), primarily undergraduate institutions
and international groups (in Germany and France). He is the current co-chair of
the NSF Inorganic Workshop as well as the NATO Advanced Research Workshop on
Complexity.
