This project applies socio-historical techniques to a 19th century evangelical
missionary organization, the Norwegian Missionary Society, to understand how
those men and women who traveled to Madagascar in the second half of the century
perceived and understood relations among themselves, and relations between
themselves and their potential converts. Of particular concern are patterns of
ideology and power that divide along lines of religion, gender, race and class.
When the historical record permits, the effects of changes introduced by
missionaries on the indigenous culture are discussed. But the main emphasis is
on how the ideological and cultural models borne by the missionaries reveal
their cultural and national identities and characterize their society of origin.
