This research concerns descriptor variable systems. Such systems arise in a
variety of engineering areas, and this framework is becoming more common because
of the increase in computing capability and the emphasis on flexibility in
problem formulation and modeling. Two major topics are proposed for research.
The first is for the continuation of the proposer's previous work on the theory
and application of nonlinear descriptor systems. This work focuses primarily on
the development of general algorithms for solving such systems. These algorithms
would be important for solving nonlinear descriptor models, but also for the
solution of analytical problems arising in optimal control, dynamic games, and
dynamic equilibria. The other major topic proposed is the study of stochastic
descriptor variable systems. This area is important because stochastic systems
are often formulated in descriptor variable form. In addition problems of
estimation, smoothing, and stochastic equilibria all lead to stochastic
descriptor variable systems. A general theory would provide unity and new
algorithms for these problems.
