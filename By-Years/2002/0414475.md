0414475 Fernando It is proposed to create a cyberinfrastructured Environmental
Field Facility (EFF), focusing on the Phoenix metropolis and its regional
environs as a potential node of the Engineering Analysis Network of the NSF's
CLEANER initiative. This EFF, called MEASURES (Multi-scale Environmental
Analysis in Urban and Regional Ecosystems), will emphasize scientific,
engineering and socio-economic issues related to the flow of air and water as
well as transport and dispersion of flow-borne contaminants over a range of
spatio-temporal scales. Intense observations that employ cutting-edge sensor and
communications technologies, detailed theoretical analyses and laboratory
experiments, high-performance computational simulations, sophisticated
predictive modeling and sensor-model fusion are the key approaches to be
employed. The data and new findings will be disseminated rapidly in suitable
formats: to public officials in support of the policy/decision making and
planning, to resource managers for adaptive management, to the general public
for triggering an informed discourse, and to the researchers for scientific
discovery and knowledge creation.&lt;br/&gt;In this planning proposal, a"proof-
of-concept."project is proposed as an antecedent to MEASURES. It involves
extensive monitoring of air flow patterns of multiple space-time scales,
movement of contaminant plumes from point sources and deposition thereof in the
regional domain circa urban Phoenix, Arizona. Particular attention will be paid
to total Mercury (Hg) associated with regional power plant emissions,
considering that certain lakes in eastern Arizona are contaminated by this
neurotoxin; this appears to be a regional counterpart of a serious global
problem that is largely attributed to aerial transport/deposition and runoff.
