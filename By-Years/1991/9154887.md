The Pennsylvania State University will initiate a four-week, residential,
interdisciplinary Young Scholars project for 72 students entering grades 11 and
12. Eight participants will be placed in on-going research laboratories on
projects leading to specific research goals. The laboratory experience will
mimic today's real world, research and development as a joint effort and
teamwork. There will be three different participating laboratories in each of
the Colleges of Agriculture, Earth and Mineral Sciences, and Science.
Collaborating engineering faculty and graduate students will participate in each
laboratory. To encourage interaction between participants, the composition of
the groups for other planned activities will be different from that of the
research-team groups and different from each other. These activities include:
communication skills, research methodology, envisioning quantitative
information, library techniques, research talks, career panels, career mentoring
by graduate students, open house at the four colleges involved, science teaching
as a career, career counseling, gender issues discussion, science and
engineering course requirements and descriptions, the social context of
technology, and an all-day research retreat.
