This dissertation will investigate the cultural frames that state policy makers
use when advocating change in laws regarding social welfare and criminal
justice: Are criminals and welfare recipients portrayed as rational actors, as
victims, or as morally deficient? Is criminal law described as intended to
rehabilitate, deter, punish, or incapacitate? How is race included in these
debates? The research will collect texts from hearings, legislation, speeches,
op-eds, editorials, and other advocacy surrounding proposals to change eight
laws in each of four states (New Jersey, Minnesota, Indiana, and California)
that vary on their welfare generosity and criminal law. Computerized content
analysis will be used to identify themes and compare them across states, time,
legislative outcome, and advocacy source.
