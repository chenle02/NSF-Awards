Abstract(Jarosz,1400661): &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding to
help defray the expenses of approximately 60 US participants, primarily graduate
students and young researchers, and 10 invited speakers participating in the
"7th Conference on Function Spaces" to be held on the campus of Southern
Illinois University Edwardsville from May 20-24,
2014.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There will be talks by internationally known speakers
on a wide variety of topics including spaces of functions, topological and
Banach algebras, and operators. In addition to plenary talks there will be many
contributed talks by graduate students, postdocs, and young researchers, up to
10 a day in parallel sessions. There will also be a two hour recorded open forum
led by experts to discuss recent trends and new problems in the field of
function spaces.
