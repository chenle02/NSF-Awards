The Computer Science and Engineering Department of the University of Nebraska-
Lincoln offers a two-semester course sequence to prepare students to meet the
growing cross- disciplinary need for scientists and engineers in computer
vision. A new laboratory program is being developed to significantly contribute
to the instruction of these courses. A sequence of laboratory exercises provides
hands-on experience with practical image processing and computer vision
problems. An original feature of this laboratory program is that students select
one of several application tracks tailored to their field of interest, thus
providing students from different disciplines the opportunity for practical
experience in their area of study. The current laboratory equipment is being
augmented with five computer workstations for acquiring, processing, and
displaying images.
