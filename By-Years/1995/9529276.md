In response to the need of scientists and educators for assistance in developing
courses and programs to teach responsible scientific conduct, the National
Research Council will convene a meeting of approximately 30 scientific conduct
instructors and curriculum developers, ethicists, researchers, and
administrators, across the fields of biology, chemistry, physics, medicine,
social sciences, and engineering. The meeting will be a strategy session to
consider what kinds of information educators need as they design their programs
on scientific conduct, and how that information can best be put together in a
way that provides them with meaningful guidance. To achieve that objective, the
workshop participants will identify the needs of prospective educators involved
in programs and courses on scientific conduct, and the kinds of information that
will be most useful to them as they design their programs; examine a range of
materials (courses, methods, textbooks) being used currently to teach scientific
conduct, and discuss strategies for evaluating them; compile a list of candidate
elements that might be included in a guide to assist educators in developing
their programs, and discuss strategies for relating these to an instructor's
choice of curricular materials or approaches; discuss options for designing an
effective guide for educators. Participants will consider how such a tool can be
designed to have the most impact.
