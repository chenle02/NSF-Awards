The goal of this research project is to study the role of phase transformations
in the rheological properties of the deep mantle. Phase transformations may
change the rheological properties through various mechanisms, including the
change in crystal structure and the change in grain-size. The present project
includes the following elements. (i) High-temperature deformation experiments on
single- and poly-crystals of analogue materials. Analogue materials to be
studied include oxides garnets and titanate perovskites. Both grain-size
insensitive (dislocation) and grain-size sensitive (diffusion) creep will be
studied to identify the deformation mechanisms in each regime and to determine
the boundaries between the two deformation mechanisms. (ii) Transmission
electron microscopy of dislocation micro- structures in high pressure polymorphs
of silicates and experimentally deformed analogue materials to compare the
dislocation slip systems and dislocation core structures, and to infer the
relative strength of coexisting minerals.
