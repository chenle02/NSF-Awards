Dr. Dickman proposes Monte Carlo studies of linear polymers on two and three
dimensional lattices. Various equations of state for polymers - Flory and Flory-
Huggins mean-field theories, as well as the predictions of renormalization group
methods - have yet to be subjected to a definitive test. It is proposed that
these theories be compared against the results of Monte Carlo simulations of a
particularly simple model: athermal chains on a lattice. The simulations are to
extend over a wide range of densities, and to rather long chains, and should be
performed in both two and three dimensions. Such studies are rendered feasible
by a new method in which the pressure is related to the segment density at a
wall. It is therefore natural to investigate wall-polymer interactions in the
course of the simulations. The studies should also yield information on
correlations and on the variation of chain conformational properties with
density.
