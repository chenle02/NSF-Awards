The investigators will deploy an all-sky imager to perform mesosphere
temperature mapping at the Air Force's high altitude Space Surveillance facility
on Maui. The Air Force and the National Science Foundation are jointly funding a
campaign to study the Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere (MALT), referred to as
Maui/MALT. The investigators will participate in the Maui/MALT campaign by (1)
providing unique data on gravity wave and tidal characteristics and their
induced intensity and temperature perturbations, and (2) providing frequent
measurements of mesospheric temperature and intensity variability at two
heights. Measurements will be made over a two-year period permitting long-term,
seasonal studies of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. The long-term
measurements will complement and enhance the wind and temperature measurements
to be made by a coincident lidar instrument coupled to the 3.67m Advanced
Electro-Optical System telescope. These studies contribute to knowledge of the
dynamics and energetics of the middle atmosphere and its sensitivity to global
change.
