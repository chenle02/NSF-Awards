Spermatogenesis is a reproductive process that yields sperm, which are unique
cells capable of fertilizing eggs and thus beginning the life of a new
individual. In animals, spermatogenesis occurs via a number of progressive
changes in the shape and behavior of male sex cells. Among these changes are two
kinds of cell division. The first is a simple process producing large numbers of
stem cells called spermatogonia. The second is a unique division, called
meiosis, which occurs in two stages and which results in 4 sperm, each with a
reduced number of chromosomes. The objective of the current project is to
discover the chemical messenger (1) that tells spermatogonia to change their
behavior and to begin cell division and also the one (2) that indicates the
amount of time such cell division should continue. Therefore, these chemicals
are important (1) in causing sperm to be produced and (2) in determining how
many sperm are produced. The beginning and maintenance of cell division in
spermatogonia are poorly understood processes in all animal systems, including
mammals. Walker plans to use the Common North Atlantic sea star or starfish in
studies of the basic biological process of spermatogenesis because each animal
can produce trillions of sperm in a 5 month period and because the spermatogenic
process can be studied simultaneously using entire, living sea stars or using
cells in culture which are derived from the tests of these animals. No other
animal spermatogenic system permits such close observation of spermatogenesis
during the important period when spermatogonia are beginning cell division. The
importance of this work is that it should identify chemical messengers that
begin and maintain sperm production in an animal. No such messengers have as yet
been identified for any animal. Estrogens, not androgens (like testosterone)
provide the initial signal that causes spermatogonia to begin to divide and that
polyamines, which are chemicals produced by spermatogonia or associated cells,
then cause spermatogonia to continue to divide. Two chemical messengers (and
perhaps others) are involved in the process of sperm production. The PI may
ultimately be in a position to suggest means for external control of sperm
production in more sophisticated animals like mammals.
