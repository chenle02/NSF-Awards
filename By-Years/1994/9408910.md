Black Holes, compact binary systems, compact stars, rapidly spinning stars and
accretion disks, dark matter, and quantum aspects of gravity will be studied
analytically and numerically. Important sources of gravity waves might include
rapidly rotating compact stars that pulsate unstably. Rapidly rotating neutron
stars will be studied, partly in order to understand better the connection
between observed features of such objects and the behavior of nuclear matter.
Recently developed techniques will be used to study the oscillations and
stability of rapidly rotating stellar models and accretion disks, in order to
assess the likelihood of detection of these phenomena. The possibility that a
component of the dark matter in the galactic halo consists of black holes will
be studied further, in connection with the possibility of observing such a
component. A variety of analytic techniques will be employed to study how one
correctly describes phenomena, including black hole evaporation, at the
fundamental quantum level in the presence of strong gravitational fields.
Particular emphasis will be placed on interactions of black holes with their
environment.
