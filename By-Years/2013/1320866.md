Large-scale simulations lead to overwhelming demands on computational resources,
the main motivation for model reduction. One seeks to produce a reduced-order
model which approximates the original one as accurately as possible, making the
simulations much faster and cheaper, while preserving appropriate properties.
Model reduction is essential for numerous large scale simulations that require
many many runs of the same model at slightly different parameter
settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has two major themes that address
serious computational issues for linear and nonlinear model reduction. The first
problem has to do with the stability and/or passivity preservation in model
reduction of large-scale systems. This takes place in the newly developed
Loewner or data-driven framework. The second involves extensions of the DEIM
approach to nonlinear model reduction. The techniques developed recently by the
investigators have been utilized in a number of areas including: numerous Navier
Stokes CFD applications, turbulent flows, shallow water equations; nonlinear
elliptic-parabolic systems for modeling lithium-ion batteries; electrical,
thermal and micro-electromechanical systems; complex engineering and geophysical
flows; finite elastodynamics; nonlinear fracture mechanics, cardiac
electrophysiology; reduced order quadrature; neural modeling; production
optimization of oil reservoirs; and many others.
