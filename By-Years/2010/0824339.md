This award will provide funding from the Petrology and Geochemistry Program to
partially sponsor the travel of 20 US graduate students to participate at the
General Assembly of the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry
of the Earth's Interior (IAVCEI) that is planned for August 18 - 25, 2008 in
Iceland. These volcanology students will participate in this international
conference and also in complimentary field trips and workshops in Reykjavik,
Iceland. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IAVCEI General Assembly Meetings take place only
once every four years and are the main venue for establishing successful
international scientific cooperation in the field of Volcanology worldwide. In
the past, the attendance of US graduate students at this particular conference
led to a number of international collaborations and generated many integrated
research ideas. Because the cost involved in the attendance of a meeting in
Iceland is rather high, attendance of US graduate students would be
significantly hindered without some financial support. It is expected that
funding for this award will promote the participation of these early career
scientists and allow them to engage in an international experience that also
includes bonding with future colleagues from other countries.
