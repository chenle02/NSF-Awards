This action funds Michelle Anne Maier of Oregon Health and Science University to
conduct a research project, entitled "Assessing zooplankton grazing on chytrid
fungi in Lake Inba, Japan," during the summer of 2012 at Toho University in
Funabashi, Chiba, Japan. The host scientist is Dr. Maiko Kagami.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to confirm the role of the
mycoloop pathway in the aquatic food web by evaluating grazing of zooplankton on
chytrid zoospores in the laboratory and in the field using microscopy and
molecular techniques. This work promises to elucidate the role chytrid parasites
play in efficiently transferring nutrients from phytoplankton to higher trophic
levels.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
