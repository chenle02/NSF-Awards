Based on a prior GK-12 project that partnered 31 graduate teaching Fellows with
36 teachers in 14 schools in the Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools, this
current project pairs the Fellows with teams of teachers at select middle
schools. These teams come together for three weeks during the summer to build
their partnership relationship, review national and local standards, and select
and design activities for the upcoming year. The Fellows enter their partner
classroom in the fall, and spend 10 hours per week in the classroom presenting
hands-on inquiry-based science activities in 7th and 8th grade classrooms. They
also participate in a bimonthly seminar, and take a 3 hr science methods course.
Each of the participants contributes a particular strength to the key
activities. Teachers provide ongoing feedback through meetings and focus groups,
as well as act as mentor teachers within their school and during the summer
workshops; the Fellows' research advisors attend two class periods per semester
to observe their Fellow in action and to interact with the K-12 students and
teachers. Mathematics is integrated into each activity and mathematics graduate
students and master teachers are active participants. The summer partnership
building includes a two week in-laboratory experience for the partner teachers.
Broader impacts of these activities include the outreach to a wide number of
schools and the model it provides of giving teachers a central role in planning
and evaluation. This project is receiving partial support from the Directorate
for Biological Sciences
