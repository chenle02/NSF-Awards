9310504 Thomas This study of a longitudinal data base examines the distribution
of cultural capital through extracurricular activities and the relative impact
of race and gender upon this social process and its outcomes. It draws upon the
theories of Bourdieu and Passeron to explain the interactive processes by which
schools differentiate learning opportunities through the knowledge associated
with their informal curricular outcomes. The researchers will study 12 randomly-
selected desegregated public high schools in six southern cities over a
retrospective 25 year period, employing both qualitative and quantitative
methods, including content analysis of school yearbooks, validated with school
site observations, accreditation reports, and interviews. %%% The results of
this research will contribute to sociological theories of education, and they
will strengthen the knowledge base for policy decisions concerning school
tracking and support for various kinds of extracurricular activities. ***
