PI: Sideris DMS-9500284 A class of isotropic, hyperelastic materials will be
sought for which the corresponding equations of motion have smooth global
solutions for small initial displacements. For planar, compressible, inviscid
fluids, classes of initial data will be identified which delay the appearance of
singularity formation. Smooth global solutions for the equations of motion for
planar, inhomogeneous, incompressible, viscous fluids will be constructed. These
problems have some features in common, and their analysis will require inter-
related techniques. Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical
modeling of the physical world. The role of mathematical analysis is not so much
to create the equations as it is to provide qualitative and quantitative
information about the solutions. This may include answers to questions about
uniqueness, smoothness and growth. In addition, analysis often develops methods
for approximation of solutions and estimates on the accuracy of these
approximations.
