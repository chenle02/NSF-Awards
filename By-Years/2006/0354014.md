This award provides funds for an REU Site in anthropology in West Central
Highland Guatemala. The topic for the Site is culture change and continuity in
Guatemala. Ten undergraduate students will participate in the 12-week summer
program. The students will be recruited from Brigham Young University,
University of Illinois-Chicago, University of Texas-Pan American, and Southwest
Texas State University. The goal of the Site is to prepare a diversified pool of
talented undergraduates, especially those from underrepresented groups, for full
participation in the professional community of social science by experiencing
all the stages of research, including problem conceptualization, independent
field research, analysis, write up, oral presentation at academic fora, and
scholarly publication. While in the field, students will conduct ethnographic
field research and also attend a weekly methods and ethics seminar.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing
efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active
undergraduate research experiences.
