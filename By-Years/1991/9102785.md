The objective of this U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project in nuclear
physics and astrophysics between Krunoslav Subotic of the Boris Kidrich
Institute and Walter Benenson of Michigan State University National Cyclotron
Laboratory is to study and produce new nuclei, which have never been observed in
nature. Dr. Subotic will participate in high beam experiments at MSU over a
three year period. Data analysis will take place at both MSU and the Boris
Kidrich Institute. Measurements and identification of new nuclei will further
understanding of supernovae and the formation of the early universe. It is
expected that this project will lead to a long-term relationship with the Boris
Kidrich Institute. Their cyclotron facility is nearing completion and is
expected to be operational in the near future. This project was approved by the
U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on Cooperation in Science and Technology and is
supported through a joint fund consisting of matching contributions from the
U.S. and Yugoslav governments. The U.S. contribution is provided annually by the
Department of State. No NSF funds are involved. The award, except for funds for
U.S. scientist travel, is made to the Yugoslav institution.
