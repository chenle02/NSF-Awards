This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will complete
the development of reusable, self-encapsulated animated characters for use in 3D
virtual environments. 3D characters are difficult to develop because of the
inflexibility of current motion representations. Presently animations are
compiled into characters using a static data structure. This makes the addition
of new animations an off-line, time-consuming process. Using extensive motion
annotation, our technology allows applications to link together animations at
run-time. The end-product objective is a network of 3D mobile applications that
run on multitouch-enabled devices like smart phones. The technology enables 1)
transfer of characters within a growing network of applications (i.e., 'plug and
play' characters), 2) user selection of animations to use in each application,
and 3) character control through a novel multitouch-based interface.
Intellectual merits involve creation of a character authoring and control
interface, and analysis of alternative, flexible representations of character
animation at the semantic level.

This project will have broader impact in three areas. First, multitouch is a new
interactive paradigm that will become ubiquitous through the proliferation of
smart phones and tablets. This project will investigate multitouch schemes for
intuitive control of complex, articulated models such as 3D humanoid figures.
Second, this project will advance our understanding of semantic categories for
human motion. Such labels are important for motion synthesis and motion
recognition. Third, this project will develop methods for building virtual
environments incrementally. Virtual environments are used widely in
entertainment, training simulations, virtual worlds, and other 3D applications.
The company will develop technology for adding new assets in a scalable manner.
