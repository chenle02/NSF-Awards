The major contributors to the productivity of the world's ocean are the
microscopic drifting plants known as the phytoplankton. The efficiency of their
photosynthesis is regulated by the availability of the nutrients and trace
metals dissolved in the water around them. Dr. Morel is an expert in examining
the role of trace metals, particularly iron, zinc, nickel, copper, cadmium and
cobalt, in phytoplankton growth. The will continue his research by developing
and testing specific biochemical hypotheses regarding the mechanisms by which
specified trace metals might limit the rate of growth of organisms in the sea.
