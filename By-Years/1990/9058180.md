The goal of this project is the development of a formally verified high level
synthesis system for generating hardware descriptions from concurrent programs.
Concurrent programs are widely used to specify distributed systems such as
communication networks. However, specification is just one aspect of distributed
system design. Implementing the specification requires generating hardware and
software components and, unfortunately, no methodology exists for ensuring that
this implementation is correct. The primary verification tool now used in
hardware design is simulation. Simulation cannot explore the full state space of
complex systems and hence does not give sufficient confidence of behavioral
correctness for safety critical applications. The formal design techniques
developed for reasoning about concurrent programs do not suffer from this "state
explosion" problem; however, no existing synthesis system can generate hardware
from a concurrent program while guaranteeing that behavioral properties are
preserved. This project will develop the tools necessary to prove that a state-
of-the-art high level synthesis program is behavior preserving.
