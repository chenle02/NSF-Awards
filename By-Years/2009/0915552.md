Operators of large-scale enterprises and ISPs need to understand the type of
traffic that their networks handle, and emergent applications and traffic
behavior, in order to better service them and detect anomalies. Also, better
assessment of the carried traffic will inform network planning and security.
Particularly for private enterprise networks, monitoring methods can be used to
detect inappropriate traffic classes indicating unprofessional (or at least
unauthorized) activity. This work will adapt and innovate methods of
unsupervised machine learning to classify traffic flows to ascertain the types
of end-user applications which are active in an enterprise network.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the project will include explaining
networking concepts to a wider audience of machine learning researchers, and
vice versa so that the newly developed techniques will have wide dissemination
to the networking community, as well as to other domains in science and
engineering. Also, cross-disciplinary graduate-level courseware on applications
of machine learning to network flow data and related concepts will be developed
and disseminated. More practical developments will be achieved through
collaboration with industrial partners. Finally, the project will aim to support
graduate students from under-represented groups in computer science and
engineering, particularly women.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary technical
merit of the research to be conducted will pertain to the high-volume and
considerably complex network data under consideration, including prevalent short
flows, given limited computing and communication resources to do so.&lt;br/&gt;
