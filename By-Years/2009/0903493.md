This proposal concerns the structure of the derived categories and associated
triangulated categories arising in commutative algebra, and is partly motivated
by developments in the representation theory of finite dimensional algebras, and
in the cohomology of finite groups. The research focuses both on qualitative
aspects of the derived category (for example, support varieties) and on
quantitative aspects (for dimension, in the sense of Rouquier). The Hochschild
cohomology algebra emerges as a critical player in these investigations, for it
acts on the derived category and to capture significant homological information
about it, especially over complete intersection rings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In
studying a topological space (or other geometric objects) it is often useful to
consider how it can be built out of simpler objects, like discs or spheres. One
can then attach numerical invariants to the building process (for example, how
many steps are required?) to obtain a measure of the complexity of the object.
Surprisingly, similar considerations turn out to be extremely fruitful also in
the more discrete world of algebraic structures. The questions addressed in the
proposal seek to investigate algebraic gadgets called commutative rings, which
arise naturally in various branches of mathematics and physics, from this
perspective.&lt;br/&gt;
