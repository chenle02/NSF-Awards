&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to explore a novel idea for
circumventing the fundamental superparamagnetic limit that causes thermal
instability leading to arbitrary switching of the nano-sized magnetic elements
required for increasingly high density disk drives beyond 1 Tbit/in2. The
approach is to fabricate nano-patterned graded anisotropy magnetic media using
top-down nano-imprint lithography patterning of sputter-deposited films. Recent
theoretical predictions indicate that by creating nano-columns of magnetic media
that gradually change from a soft magnetic material with low anisotropy at one
end to a hard magnetic material with high anisotropy at the other end, the
thermal instability may be avoided. Moreover, small magnetic fields can be used
to switch high anisotropy materials, making it easier to design the read-write
head that is the other essential component of the disk drive.&lt;br/&gt;The
intellectual merit of this project is that it will address a fundamental
physical problem that is at the heart of the current limitations of data
storage. The project is interdisciplinary in nature, and the shared graduate
student will combine an in-depth study of various magnetic materials for
creating the graded media with device aspects related to the actual nano-column
fabrication and testing. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts resulting from this
GOALI project will be the multi-disciplinary education and exposure of a female
graduate student to industrial pressures as well as academic rigor, and the
opportunity for experimental proof of a revolutionary concept for future data
storage. &lt;br/&gt;
