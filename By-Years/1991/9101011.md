This is a dissertation improvement award. Demography, a discipline founded in
1878, studies the relation between population and social structures and culture.
This project relates the historical development of demography to cultural and
political values of the time, especially to social policies promoting lower
birth rates. The study focuses on individuals involved in establishing
demography, and on political tracts and other literature reflecting concerns
with birth rates.
