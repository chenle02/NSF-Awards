This Idaho S-STEM project is providing scholarships to two cohorts of 15
freshmen students majoring in computer science, materials science, electrical,
mechanical, or civil engineering. The recruiting efforts of the program help to
attract underrepresented students to engineering and computer science. The
program provides scholarship awards of up to $10,000 per year for two years for
residential college students and $5,000 per year for two years for off campus
students; as well as an opportunity for additional support of $2,000 in years
three and four for students in both groups. Additionally, the program integrates
scholarship recipients into the Engineering Residential College, new learning
communities, research experiences, and other existing student support programs.
The program strives to achieve a freshman retention rate of 80% or higher.
