9218482 Smithson This project involves a pilot seismic profile designed to
improve understanding of processes of continental growth associated with terrane
accretion in the Coast orogen of southeast Alaska and British Columbia. The
seismic data will provide constraints pertaining to models for the role of
thick-skinned thrusting, metamorphism and magmatism in the formation of
continental lithosphere. They will also constrain models on how subduction and
translation were accommodated during a major shift in relative plate motions
from head-on (mid Cretaceous) to transcurrent (Eocene), and how this
rearrangement affected crustal development. The seismic results will guide
design of subsequent research proposals on these problems. The seismic profiling
will use an acoustic source array deployed from a marine research ship that
crosses the Coast orogen along a 130 km long fjord, and densely spaced (3-5 km)
3-component seismic recorders placed along the shore to record offsets from 0 to
200 km. The ship will also deploy a 4 km long hydrophone streamer for
simultaneous MCS (multi-channel seismic) profiling. This unique experiment
combines proven marine seismic techniques with the new capability of the seismic
recorders to determine mid to lower crustal structure and physical properties of
an area of known continental accretion. ***
