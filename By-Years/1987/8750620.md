The Chemistry Department at Rhode Island College has recently acquired a high
pressure liquid chromatograph (HPLC) and a computer interfaced atomic absorption
(AA) spectrometer for use in improving undergraduate instruction. With these
additions, students are exposed to a wider range of the instruments used in
modern research and industrial laboratories and gain experience in using these
instruments to increase their problem-solving skills. Analytical skills are
being developed which will help prepare students for graduate school or careers
in chemistry and other sciences.
