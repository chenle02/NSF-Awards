In recent years, the field of biology has become more focused on the study of
life at the cellular and molecular levels of organization. Therefore modern
biology is more dependent upon instrumentation and technology. The Biology
Department is integrating molecular methodologies into several laboratory
courses. As the department continues its effort to provide more investigative
opportunities for students in the laboratory setting, it is vital that it
continues to incorporate techniques of molecular biology. The courses directly
impacted by these reforms include Honors Microbiology, Immunology, Cell and
Molecular Biology, Virology, and Biotechnology. The equipment being used to
implement these improved opportunities for learning includes apparatus for gel
electrophoresis and power packs, a hybridization incubator, speed vacuum
centrifuge, 4 C microfuge, transilluminator, dot-blot apparatus, CO2 incubator,
and an inverted microscope. *
