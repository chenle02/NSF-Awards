Dr. Rolnick is a major contributor to the equations of motion method as the
basis for a microscopic description of collective motion in groups of fermions.
He is particularly interested in the application of this technique to the study
of odd-mass and even-mass nuclei near closed shells. The equations of motion
method has not lived up to its earlier promise because of problems related to
backward going states and overcounting. In collaboration with Professor Klein of
the University of Pennsylvania, Dr. Rolnick plans to investigate these problems,
so as to make the equations of motion method a more useful technique for
studying many-fermion systems. Techniques for investigating the properties of
many- particle systems are of great interest and importance. A technique of
considerable promise and application, particularly in nuclear physics, is the
equations of motion method. The planned research would resolve some of the
difficulties limiting this approach, so that it will be more useful. The
research experience gained by Dr. Rolnick will also assist him in this teaching
and advising at Deep Springs College.
