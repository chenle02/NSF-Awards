9308979 York This project will explore a new technology for low noise power
amplification in the microwave and millimeter wave regime using a combination of
parametric effects and quasi optical techniques. Although parametric amplifiers
have long been known to posses superior noise properties to conventional
transistor amplifiers, they have not been fully utilized in modern microwave
systems due to limited power handling capacity, requirement of a strong high
frequency pump signal, and sensitive circuit design. Some of these problems can
be circumvented by operating a large planar array of low power parametric
devices synchronously, with input and output signals coupled through simple
antennas to propagating beams in free space. There is also evidence from
analogous parametric laser systems that noise figure can be reduced further by
exploiting the inherent phase sensitive amplification of parametric systems
(squeezed states). Two types of arrays negative resistance parametric
amplifiers, and frequency upconverters will be explored during this project. In
the former case, spontaneous parametric oscillation is also possible and could
provide a useful technique for sub harmonic and harmonic generation.
