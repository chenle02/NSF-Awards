Goldreich 9414232 Theoretical research will be done on a variety of topics
including interstellar turbulence, multimode pulsations of white dwarf stars,
rotation and magnetic fields of degenerate dwarf stars, and dynamics of narrow
planetary rings. Each project aims to elucidate the underlying physical
mechanism responsible for a well-observed but unexplained phenomenon. ***
