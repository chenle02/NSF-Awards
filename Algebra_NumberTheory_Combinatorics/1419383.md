The Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science
(SACNAS) will hold its 2014 National Conference in Los Angeles, California,
October 16-18, 2014. The National Conference aims to present research from
diverse disciplines, share advanced research and discoveries, interact with
attendees, and mentor science students. This award will support participants at
two scientific symposia. The session will consist of talks in topics of algebra,
number theory, and combinatorics at a wide range of mathematical levels. Talks
will be 30 minutes and will leave time for a closing question and answer period.
One symposium will introduce accessible research topics for students with a
post-calculus background, providing a wide range of interesting problems to
motivate undergraduates to pursue further research and work in mathematics. The
second symposium will provide current cutting-edge mathematical research done by
mathematicians from underrepresented groups as well as provide a venue to meet
and interact with researchers interested in mentoring underrepresented students
in mathematics. The website for the SACNAS conference is

These scientific symposia sessions address a variety of broader impacts in the
mathematical community. First, by organizing these sessions during one of the
nations largest conferences for Hispanics and Native Americans, the symposia
will reach students and professionals from traditionally underrepresented groups
in academia. These participants will have the opportunity to see and contribute
to current mathematical research presented at the 2014 SACNAS National
Conference. In addition, conference participants will be able to hear from
mathematicians who come from groups traditionally underrepresented in the
mathematical sciences and from mathematicians who have successfully mentored and
advised underrepresented students in numerous mathematical research projects.
This will give participants an opportunity to hear about possible research
projects, meet new mentors and/or advisers, and begin to build a research
community beyond their institutions.
