Saar, Steven AST-9731652 Dr. Saar will investigate the effects of stellar
magnetic and surface phenomena, such as magnetic activity, rotation, and
starspots, on high-precision radial velocity measurements which are used for the
detection of extra-solar planets. His goals are two-fold. By better
understanding the cause of radial velocity variations due to intrinsic stellar
properties, he plans to verify current extra-solar planet candidates and to
provide guidance to current and future planet searches. His work will also lead
to improved understanding of the interaction of magnetic fields with convection
in stellar photospheres, and how convective properties vary with stellar
parameters. Much of his work concentrates on performing an analysis of line
bisectors from high resolution spectroscopic data of a sample of main-sequence
dwarf stars which have long-term spectral observations and cover a range of
basic stellar parameters in temperature, activity level, and rotation
properties. ***
