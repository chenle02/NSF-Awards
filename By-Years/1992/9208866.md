Their base is the substantial recent progress made in the understanding of
cerium-based heavy-fermion (HF) materials, in terms of the single-impurity
limit. Their first thrust will focus on the new characteristics that arise upon
formation of a regular Ce lattice, and how the thermodynamics and transport are
affected by inter-site magnetic correlations. It is known that there exist
significant differences between the Ce and uranium families. Their research will
concentrate on those aspects of U-based HFs with especially strong deviations
from the single-ion, Kondo-like behavior of their Ce counterparts.
