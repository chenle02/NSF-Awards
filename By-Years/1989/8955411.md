The University of California at Davis will initiate a six-week, residential,
Young Scholars project in the Life Sciences for 40 students entering grades
10,11. The program combines individual student research projects done under the
guidance of a research mentor with a colloquium series dealing with evolving
knowledge in selected fields of biological and environmental sciences. Emphasis
is on understanding biological and methodological concepts in current research
and in extending skills in designing and conducting research and techniques for
reporting outcomes. Issues dealing with the nature of scientific knowledge,
ethics, and relations to humans are addressed. Broad exposure to career options
and academic planning.
