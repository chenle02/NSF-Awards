Sheeted dikes are common components of ophiolites, however the direction of
magma flow in the fissures that become dikes is essentially unknown but has
considerable significance in understanding the dynamics of active mid-Ocean
Ridges. This project will utilize a well-studied ophiolite-the Troodos ophiolite
in Cyprus- to address this question. The approach will be through analysis of
Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility (AMS) in the context of petrofabrics and
contact relationships of dikes. Results will provide structural data that will
aid interpretations of the Troodos ophiolite and provide a unique data set to
assess the importance of lateral intrusive propagation in sheeted dikes
generally.
