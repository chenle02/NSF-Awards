This research documents traditional Yup’ik ecological knowledge pertaining to
the harvest, processing, sharing, and use of foods along the middle Kuskokwim
River, Alaska. This knowledge contributes to food security through fishing,
hunting, and gathering activities. Employing a participatory framework, this
project will produce an ethnographic account of food-related knowledge rooted in
the local geography of the Kuskokwim River. The PI team will accompany
participants on a field survey to identify harvesting locations, archaeological
sites, and other culturally significant places. Place names and sites will be
contextualized through Yup’ik elders’ oral histories. This research will advance
understanding of the local context of food security and of how geography and
traditional ecological knowledge intersect. The project will also contribute
high-resolution data to the ethnogeography of one of Alaska’s greatest
watersheds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project responds to local research
priorities and employs mixed methods, including participatory gatherings, site
visits by researchers and Alaska Native elders, and concurrent archaeological
survey along the middle Kuskokwim River. In the first year of the project,
participating elders will gather for conversation on five food-related topics,
to be determined through consultation. Possible topics include salmon fishing,
food preservation and storage, food sharing, and starvation strategies. Field
survey will follow, involving visits to sites along the Kuskokwim identified as
significant by elders. Sites will be documented through discussion with elders
and though audio-visual recordings. Archaeological survey will relocate known
sites and document those previously unrecorded. Broader impacts include an
online relational map with Yup’ik place name pronunciations and narrative
context for each site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
