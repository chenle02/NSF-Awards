This award will support a long-term visit by Professor Robert Yeats, Department
of Geosciences, Oregon State University, to Japan for a cooperative research
project with Dr. Yoshi Kinugaso of the Seismotectonic Research Division at the
Geological Survey of Japan in Tsukuba. The Research will include a study of the
recognition and evaluation of seismogenic blind thrusts. Earthquakes that occur
in fold belts can be studied using surface geology and subsurface well logs and
seismic lines, particularly those that occur in petroleum-producing regions. A
better understanding of the tie between folds, faults and seismegenesis in
recent years is partly the result of a growing awareness of the extreme hazards
posed by fault propagation fold systems in highly populated regions of
California. Research will include a study of the structural aspects of
earthquake faults that do not cut the surface but instead appear to be
accommodated by regional-scale folding. Results of the research have the
potential of broadening U.S. databases on seismogenic zones expressed at the
surface as folds. Additionally, the research could lead to the possibility of
constraining earthquake size by considering the possibility of fault and fold
segmentation as well as slip rate. The Geological Survey of Japan is well known
for their ongoing research in the area of evaluating seismic risks from surface
faulting. Their expertise, coupled with Professor Yeats' expertise in the area
of seismic risks from blind faults, should provide a fruitful collaboration. It
is expected that this collaborative effort will continue after the formal
agreement has terminated.
