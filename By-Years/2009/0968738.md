In this Communicating Research to Public Audiences (CRPA) project, the
University of Washington and the Pacific Science Center (PSC) are highlighting
the results of Dr. Kelley's active research discoveries about deep-sea life
located on active hydrothermal vents of the ocean floors (OCE-0426109). The STEM
content of this project includes oceanography, marine biology, and ecology. The
project team will develop a multimedia, interactive kiosk exhibit that builds on
the existing Portal to the Public project at PSC. Kelley's graduate students are
actively involved in the exhibit and outreach components.

The target audience for "Life in Extreme Environments" is the approximately
800,000 U.S. and international visitors to PSC, including a significant number
of urban, underserved minorities. This CRPA project will become a component of
the existing Portal to the Public exhibit. This exhibit kiosk will subsequently
be made available to other scientists to promote research and related topics in
their respective disciplines. The exhibit will be fabricated and evaluated by
PSC staff.
