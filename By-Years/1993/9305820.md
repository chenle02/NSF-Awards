9305820 Lomen This Americas Program award will support a regional program
development workshop on the uses of technology in the undergraduate mathematics
curriculum. The workshop, which is jointly organized by Prof. David Lomen of the
University of Arizona and Prof. Luis Manuel Tovar of the Instituto Politecnico
Nacional (IPN) in Mexico City, will introduce participants to existing
mathematical software, discuss ways in which it can improve the teaching and
learning of mathematics, and explore new ways of using technology in the
classroom. Expected outcomes of this workshop are: bilingual educational
materials on the use of technology in mathematics instruction; development of an
Internet interest group and bulletin board facility to link participants and
future collaborators via existing networks in Mexico and in Latin America with
the U.S.; and future collaborations between leaders in software development,
mathematicians, and math educators of the hemisphere. ***
