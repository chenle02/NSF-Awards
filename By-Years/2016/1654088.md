Predation is an important driver of ecological structure in modern shallow
marine ecosystems, but the development of modern predator-prey dynamics in past
oceans are poorly understood. Many of the most important modern marine predators
and their prey animals appeared during the Late Triassic, about 228 ? 202
million years ago. This research will examine the role of predator-prey
interactions in building modern-style ecological systems during this time of
dramatic environmental change. Student mentorship groups comprised of
undergraduates and students from nearby tribal high schools will develop
research projects to solve environmental problems using the skills learned as
part of the present study. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the present
research is to quantify the antagonistic relationships between predator and prey
taxa from three distinct marine regions during the Late Triassic. Series of
fossiliferous bulk samples will be collected from regions in Nevada, Italy, and
New Zealand to determine geographic patterns of predator occurrence and
abundance, coupled with abundance and morphological pattern data for prey
groups. In order to create a temporally- and spatially-resolved faunal dataset
reflecting shifting ecological relationships, the three fossiliferous bulk
sample sequences will be correlated to each other and to recognized geologic
events using multiple chronostratigraphic methods. Paleoecological niche
modeling will be used to test the concept of escalation in this predator-prey
system, thus allowing for an evaluation of the role of both intrinsic and
extrinsic factors in ecological function and health. Results will be made
available through public databases, publications, and presentations at
conferences by student researchers.
