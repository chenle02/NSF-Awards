The protein calmodulin is the principle transducer of messenger calcium. It is
believed to exist within the cytosols of all cells of all eukaryotes. In its
calcium forms, (but not in other forms) it activates at least ten and probably
as many as twenty different enzymes or structural proteins. It has evolved by
gene duplication and is very highly conserved especially among the animals.
Previous crystal structure studies have revealed that calmodulin consists of two
protein lobes joined by a short pepitde linking chain. This proposal is to study
two crystal structures of proteins related to calmodulin. Crystals suitable for
x-ray diffraction studies have already been grown. The significance of these
determinations is their test of the model in which the central linker of
calmodulin functions as a flexible tether allowing specific patches on the two
labels to enfold a target.
