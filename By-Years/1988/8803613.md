This proposal seeks funding for the establishment of a database, which includes
all relevant information, such as locality, age of the rocks, age brackets of
the magnetization, formation name, author, year, structural, field, and
laboratory observations of the remanent magnetization, magnetization polarities,
paleopole location and relevant statistics. It is intended to include a quality
assessment of the result as well. The main use of the database will be to solve
nd pose scenarios is past plate history. The database will be relational. The
establishment of this database will be subcontracted by the University of
Michigan to Dr. M. W. McElhinny, a senior and established premier scientist in
the field. The paleomagnetic community has urged the establishment of such a
database in a resolution of the International Association of Geomagnetism and
Aeronomy.
