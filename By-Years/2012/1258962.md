In this project, the PI proposes to study the boundary cohomology of (general)
PEL-type Shimura varieties, namely the cone of the canonical morphism from the
compactly supported cohomology to the ordinary cohomology, with torsion (or
integral) automorphic coefficients. A consequence will be a better understanding
of the whole torsion cohomology of PEL-type Shimura varieties, which might
answer many questions about freeness, liftability, and congruences, and might
explain intriguing (potential) pathologies in the torsion interior cohomology
(which the PI noticed in his joint work with Junecue Suh). The PI hopes to show
that such pathologies do occur in general, but with arithmetically meaningful
(and maybe surprising) explanations. The PI also hopes that techniques developed
in this project will be useful for studying other interesting questions, such as
the arithmeticity of theta correspondences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometry and
number theory are two oldest branches of mathematics, and combined applications
of them (such as error correcting codes) have become indispensable in modern
daily life (involving, for example, telecommunication and data storage). The so-
called Shimura varieties are important geometric objects because they relate
analysis, geometry, and number theory in a natural yet mysterious way, and
advances in the theory of Shimura varieties have contributed to many of the most
exciting recent developments in number theory. This project aims at exploring
some relatively new territories in this important theory, where many basic
questions have yet to be answered. The PI believes that progresses in this
project will establish new links among several very different branches of
geometry and number theory. The project will also support activities
disseminating the knowledge and new ideas in this field.
