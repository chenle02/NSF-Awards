9525984 McMillan The goal of this exploratory research is to examine the
experimental evidence for a new type of behavior in the liquid state. A first-
order phase transition between two liquid phases has been observed that is
driven by entropy and density differences between the two liquids rather than by
compositional fluctuations in the system yttrium oxide- aluminum oxide
(Y2O3-Al2O3). The study of this liquid-liquid phase transition is important in
order to further develop a fundamental understanding of the nature of the liquid
state, and for the advancement of new materials useful in the construction of
lasers. %%% Liquids in the Y2O3-Al2O3 system are of considerable commercial
importance, because they give rise to the YAG family of laser host materials and
other refractory ceramics. It is likely that the existence of the structural
phase transformation in these liquids may be harnessed to tune the properties of
crystals around the garnet crystal. The study of the new phenomena also has
significant intrinsic scientific interests. ***
