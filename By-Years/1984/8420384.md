The design of concrete masonry structures to resist earthquakes and other
lateral loadings is an important part of the overall structural design process.
Concrete masonry structures are widely used in the United States and worldwide.
This is an experimental prism and shear wall test program to verify that
strength and ductility can be increased with confinement steel. Completion of
this research project will lead to an improved economy of design practices and
increased earthquake safety to structures by improving ductility.
