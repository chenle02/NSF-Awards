Blowup Analysis for two-dimensional Elliptic Equations
with&lt;br/&gt;Exponential Nonlinearities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract of
Proposed Research&lt;br/&gt;Lei Zhang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project is to
study some highly nonlinear elliptic equations related to problems in geometry
and physics. These equations have some very singular terms and their solutions
also are quite singular. This research is to try to describe the nature of the
singularities of the solutions precisely and will require the application of a
many deep results from recent studies of non-linear
equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The descriptions of the singularities of these
equations is likely to be quite important for physics and will help provide a
geometrical and analytical understanding of the associated field theories.
Similar equations also arise in some models of biological phenomena and these
descriptions may be useful there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt
