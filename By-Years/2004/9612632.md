Advances in technology have made it possible to integrate a processor core, a
program ROM, and application-specific circuitry all on a single IC. Thus, high-
level language compilers are essential tools for overcoming complexity in
embedded system design. This research is on development of a retargetable
compiler framework that can generate optimized code for a variety of processor
architectures. The approach includes development of a machine description
language to describe a wide range of processor architectures. Further tasks
include: building a retargetable code generator and optimizer, and a simulator
for the compiled code to obtain performance metrics. Very general code
optimization algorithms that are parameterizable with respect to the number of
functional units, registers, and the topology of interconnect between them are
being explored. The developed algorithms are being integrated into a framework
for machine-dependent code generation and optimization.
