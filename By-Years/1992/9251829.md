The Department of Chemistry is acquiring instrumentation to institute a novel
series of independent study courses on practical instrumental analysis. Under
this scheme teams of students, consisting of freshman through seniors are
providing analytical expertise to the department, University and, some members
of the surrounding community. The approach stresses team-oriented problem
solving with instruments and the development of the skills necessary to select
the appropriate analytical method/technique as well as gaining expertise with
the instruments.
