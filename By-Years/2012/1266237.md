This project will study relationships between L^2-invariant theory and ergodic
theory. The former provides invariants for CW-complexes through the process of
applying group von Neumann algebra techniques to the algebraic topology of
universal covering spaces, and it has applications to geometry and K-theory.
Ergodic theory provides invariants such as entropy and mean dimension. These
were originally defined for integer group actions, subsequently for amenable
group actions, and most recently for sofic group actions. The Principal
Investigator also intends to extend the entropy theory of sofic group actions to
actions on operator algebras and actions of hyperlinear groups.

Classical topology studies the shape of geometric objects. The invariant theory
involved in this project achieves such a goal by using so-called von Neumann
algebras, which were first introduced as a mathematical tool to study quantum
mechanics in physics. Ergodic theory studies the long-time behavior of systems
under evolution (e.g., the "sandpile model" in physics). In the last few years,
some surprising connections between these two fields have been discovered,
connections that lead to applications in both areas. The Principal Investigator
plans to deepen and broaden such connections.
