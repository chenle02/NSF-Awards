This research is proposed under the Small Grants for Exploratory Research
program and focusses on the environmental and cultural determinants of human
fertility. It is becoming increasingly apparent that many variables such as
subsistence behavior greatly affect fertility and demography and that cross-
cultural studies are of major significance in teasing apart the factors
involved. The primary objective is to assess the feasibility of a full scale
project concerning the reproductive ecology of three native groups in South
India. The three groups involved would allow the comparison of groups living in
the same physical environment but practicing different subsistence patterns as
well as the responses to culture change. The investigator needs to assess the
verbal and written reports as to the subsistence adaptations in these
populations and to verify that these three groups will allow the appropriate
comparisons.
