Abstract- Glezer CTS- 9724471 Micromachining facilities and diagnostic equipment
are consolidated and expanded into an integrated facility for development and
testing of robust fluidic sensors and activators. Equipment acquired includes a
large-area alignment system, a parylene deposition system, a hot vacuum press, a
precision machining apparatus, a laser vibrometer, a particle image velocimetry
system, and microscope/video systems. Initial application will be in research on
thermal management, modification of aerodynamic surfaces, thrust vectoring,
hybrid activators, real-time viscosity measurement, and mixing in combustion.
