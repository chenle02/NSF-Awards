Read, Jane Louisiana State University Land-cover change detection in
northeastern Costa Rica will provide spatio-temporal data of human impacts on a
tropical forest environment. The objectives are to identify causes and effects
of human activities on land cover and identify a method using remote sensing and
geographic information systems (GIS) to detect local land cover changes in the
study area, which comprises two protected areas in the province of Heredia. The
use of selected remote sensing/GIS methods using Landsat data for three dates
from 1970 to 1990 will take place at both the base institution and in the field.
Change maps developed from these analyses will be quantitatively assessed
against change maps derived from field observations, aerial photographs, maps
and literature sources. The study will improve understanding of the performance
and accuracies of standard remote sensing/GIS techniques for assessing land
cover change detection in tropical forest environments. It will also enlarge our
knowledge of human impacts upon the environment in a global context.
