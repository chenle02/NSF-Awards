9452667 Mendez Metropolitan State College of Denver, in collaboration with the
Denver Public Schools, seeks to initiate a four-week summer commuter program in
mathematics for 48 disadvantaged and traditionally underrepresented (women and
minority) students entering 7th and 8th grades, who have exceptional interest
and high potential in science, mathematics and/or engineering. Students will
learn new mathematics with an emphasis on scientific applications, working
together in small problem solving groups. They will study probability and
statistics through hands-on experiments involving data collection and analysis
and descriptive graphing techniques, curve fitting, and function approximation
models in multiple interdisciplinary contexts. They will explore chaotic
phenomena and investigate functions, iterations, fixed points, orbits, and their
limits, fractals, and game theory. They will focus on applications in various
fields. Students will participate in extensive graphing calculator and computer
activities. Additional components of the program include career awareness,
ethics and academic year follow-up activities. ***
