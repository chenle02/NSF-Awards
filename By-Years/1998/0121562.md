Electronic markets are emerging as a primary medium of trade in business-to-
business, business-to-consumer, and consumer-to-consumer settings. In order to
design viable electronic marketplaces, a host of novel interrelated game-
theoretic and computational issues must be&lt;br/&gt;addressed. With a team of
interdisciplinary researchers from multiple institutions, this project will
develop a unified theory of games and computing to guide and facilitate the
growth of such markets. Specific research directions of the project include the
following: (1) Market designs will be generalized to incorporate combinatorial
bidding, multi-attribute preferences, multi-stage mechanisms, continuous
mechanisms, and multi-unit sale; (2) New algorithms for clearing, quoting,
incentive-compatible pricing as well as new incentive-compatible tractable
mechanisms will be designed with particular emphasis on online and incremental
updating of market states; (3) Bounded rationality of the agents will be
investigated under a wide spectrum of models of computations, equilibrium
concepts of game theory, and trade-offs between centers and agents; and (4)
Novel approaches to relaxing the classic common prior assumption will be
explored in order to develop practically useful models for ecommerce. The
successful completion of this project will make significant contributions to
both theory and practice in the areas of electronic commerce, multi-agent
systems, algorithms, computational complexity theory, and game
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
