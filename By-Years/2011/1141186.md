This project is a partnership among industry, the local community, and Drexel
University with the goal to design and implement a Biomechanical Engineering
curriculum that enables students to translate research results into commercially
viable products. Building on the successes of the Gateway Coalition and the
VaNTH Engineering Research Center, the project begins at the junior level,
carries through to graduation and incorporates problem-based learning,
cooperative education and entrepreneurial training. Faculty researchers, through
the partnership, are assisting students as they learn to turn research results
into products.

The project goal is being met by modifying existing junior level courses into a
problem-based format, integrating cooperative education into the curriculum, and
using Biomechanical Engineering faculty expertise to deliver the innovative
classroom techniques.

The project evaluation is assessing benefits to students, faculty and co-op
partners and consists of short and long term data collection and analysis. New
understanding generated in the program will be widely disseminated and tested at
local schools consisting of Lehigh University, Worcester Polytechnic Institute,
Rochester Polytechnic Institute and Olin College.
