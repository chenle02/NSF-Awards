The overall goal of the Huston-Tillotson College (HTC) planning project is to
conduct self-assessments and external research that will result in the
development of a full HBCU-UP implementation proposal. The full proposal will
include a conceptual blueprint for an exemplary program that is complementary to
the goals of the institution and responsive to the learning needs of a student
population that is under represented in science, technology, engineering and
mathematic (STEM) fields. The proposed planning grant will: (1) conduct a
detailed evaluation of its STEM faculty, curriculum, students, and scientific
infrastructure; (2) study and adopt the effective practices of institutions with
exemplary STEM programs; (3) design professional development strategies that
will improve the capabilities of STEM faculty and thereby increase student
learning outcomes; and (4) develop cooperative agreements with research-
intensive institutions as partners and collaborators.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the planning process, HTC will: (a) procure the
services of a professional evaluator to conduct a STEM institutional assessment,
(b) identify contingencies for unmet needs; (c) adapt the best-practices of
partner and model institutions by performing site visits to other institutions;
and (d) integrate the results into a cohesive and sustainable plan of action for
the institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The
planning grant activities are based on a research and have objectives that are
tied to the institutional strategic goals. The planning grant will evaluate all
STEM programs to determine the best course of action to enhance the STEM
programs for the institution. HTC is poised and committed to enhancing the STEM
education that is offered to its students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact
&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the development of a full HBCU-UP
implementation project on the STEM programs at HTC includes: 1) The development
of a collegiate environment that attracts STEM majors, trains and retains them
to graduation, and 2) The increase of the numbers of HTC students going into
graduate programs or careers in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;
