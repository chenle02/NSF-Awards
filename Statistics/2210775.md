The goal of this project is to systematically develop a set of data exploration
and visualization tools for a new type of regression analysis for a form of data
that has become increasingly common in recent applications. Such data, known as
random objects, do not possess some basic properties of conventional data: for
example, they do not have directions or angles that are taken for granted in
conventional analysis. Examples include mortality distributions, large-
covariance matrices, and observations on spheres. Many existing statistical
tools, such as least squares, regression, R-squares, and dimension reduction,
cannot be directly applied. A new type of regression, called Fr√©chet regression,
has recently been developed to handle this data type. The current project aims
to fill the gap between the new data type and conventional methods by
transforming random objects into forms that are accessible by conventional
methods with high efficiency. The project will focus on sufficient dimension
reduction for the new data type. The results are expected to provide data
analysis tools and related computer packages for the new type of regression, to
assist preliminary data exploration, data visualization, model diagnostics, and
improved estimation accuracy. The project will also involve training and
mentoring for graduate students in modern statistical sciences.

The project aims to develop flexible and computationally scalable methods for
sufficient dimension reduction for a new type of regression where both the
predictor and the response can be metric-space-valued random objects. The
results are intended to apply in both linear and nonlinear cases. The underlying
idea can be used convert existing methods from the multivariate setting to
metric-space-valued random elements. The main difficulty in dealing with metric-
space-valued random objects is that there are no inner or outer products between
observations, which are required by most of the traditional statistical tools,
such as covariance matrices, correlation, projection, regression, and ANOVA
decomposition. To circumvent this difficulty, the project employs a universal
kernel that bridges the gap between metric spaces and Hilbert spaces, which
allows construction of an independence structure within the framework of Hilbert
spaces though the process of orthogonalization. The bridge provided by the
universal kernel is of fundamental importance in metric-space-valued data
analysis in general, going far beyond the current setting of sufficient
dimension reduction, because a great number of current methods for multivariate
and functional data analysis can only be used in the Hilbert space setting.
