This action funds Zachary A. Piazza of Brown University to conduct a research
project, entitled "Potential building blocks for novel materials: a joint
theoretical and experimental study of highly symmetric transition-metal-centered
gold clusters," during the summer of 2012 at Tsinghua Univeristy in Beijing,
China. The host scientist is Professor Jun Li.

The Intellectual Merit of this research project lies in its potential to
discover and understand the electronic structure of building blocks to new and
useful materials while testing and aiding in the improvement of state of the art
calculation methods generally useful for chemists studying many types of
chemical systems. The four systems being characterized each contain one
transition metal atom surrounded by 9 gold atoms. This is being done through
performing theoretical relativistic quantum chemical calculations and comparing
these calculations with experimental photoelectron spectroscopy data.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
