This project will continue work on the development of methods for the formation
of C-C bonds using previously undiscovered radical processes. More specifically,
the project will study reactions at the interface of two important
subdisciplines of organic chemistry, radical-based organic synthesis and
transition metal-arene complexes. While transition metals have been used
extensively to modify the ionic reactivity of bound organic molecules, very
little study has been made of the radical reactions of such systems. This
project will address this shortcoming in the chemical literature through the
systematic study of a series of transition metal complexes to determine their
utility in radical processes.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research of Professor Jeffrey Byers and six undergraduate summer research
assistants in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Middlebury
College. Since both transition metal-promoted processes and radical processes
are of significant importance to the chemical industry, this work could open up
new avenues for the efficient generation of complex molecules of broad
applicability and importance. The possible applications of this methodology
include any of the disciplines related to the petrochemical industry, including
such diverse fields as pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals, and materials
science.
