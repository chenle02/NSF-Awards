9724277 Dravid A scanning focused ion beam (FIB) system for fabrication,
lithography and site-specific micromachining of a diverse set of materials
systems will be acquired by Northwestern University. Material systems to be
studied using the FIB capabilities include structural ceramics, metal alloys,
electronic, polymeric and biological materials. %%% The instrument will assist a
large number of research programs at Northwestern and local institutions. It
will also impact the undergraduate curriculum at Northwestern as well as the
University's education outreach activities. ***
