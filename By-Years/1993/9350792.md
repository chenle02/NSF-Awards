The project will develop a unified physical chemistry lab for the study of
thermodynamics and kinetics in which some traditional as well as novel
experiments are all related to nonequilibrium chemical self-organization. The
Belousov- Zhabotinskii oscillating reaction will be the major focus. Students
will study the phenomenology and dynamic behavior through "hands on" experiments
via electrochemical techniques, calorimetry and video analysis (for the
quantitative study of spatial phenomena). The polymerization of methacrylic acid
will be studied with video analysis of propagating reaction fronts and
viscometry of the product polymer. All experiments will use computer data
acquisition with comparison to numerical models.
