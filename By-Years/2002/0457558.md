This grant provides funding to solve an important class of stochastic
optimization models in which the governing probability distributions change
according to decisions made over time. Specifically, this problem will be
addressed for single- and multi-item maintenance optimization models as well as
executive-level management decisions involving allocating funds across a
collection of projects. First, a method of adaptively updating weights on a
mixture of failure distributions in the context of a stochastic dynamic program
will be developed. Then, an infinite-dimensional hierarchical Bayes model will
be constructed by transforming the problem to a finite state space using a novel
implementation of existing Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods called Polya trees.
The resulting models will be solved by stochastic dynamic programming or
stochastic integer programming, as appropriate. Sampling-based methods will be
incorporated, as necessary. The maintenance optimization and executive decision-
making problems will be formulated, and the solutions implemented, jointly with
the Risk Management Group of the South Texas Project Nuclear Operating Company
(STPNOC).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, solutions to both the higher-
fidelity single-item maintenance models and the multi-item maintenance models
can positively affect financial performance measures, as well as production and
safety goals at STPNOC and other nuclear power companies. The proposed models
and methods may be distributed more widely through the nuclear power industry
due to collaboration with the Electric Power Research Institute.&lt;br/&gt;
