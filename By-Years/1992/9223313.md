This Americas Program award will fund a dissertation improvement research by Dr.
James H. Brown, graduate advisor, and Mr. Pablo A. Marquet, PhD student, of the
University of New Mexico. The present award will extend research on patterns of
distribution and abundance of small mammal species in the highlands, already in
progress in Argentina and Chile, to Bolivia. The investigators will collect and
analyze data to test hypotheses regarding regional patterns of assemblage
structure. Results of this research will provide new insights and new impetus to
conservation efforts in South American countries where human induced landscape
changes and overpopulation represent an increasing threat to biodiversity. This
research will be among the first studies specifically designed to evaluate
patterns in the distribution and abundance of small mammal species at a regional
scale in South America. Thus, it will open the way for comparisons with similar
studies carried out in North American deserts and will also provide the first
assessment of the conservation status of the small mammals species inhabiting
the Puna area of Chile, Argentina and Bolivia.
