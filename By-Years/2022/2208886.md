Languages have vastly different ways of marking grammatical relations like
subject and object, including differences in word order, marking on nouns and
verbs, and employing different sentence structures altogether. The goal of this
project is to investigate how grammatical relations can differ across languages
and change over time, with a particular focus on an endangered language. By
recording sentences, stories, and conversations with speakers, this project will
document and analyze an unusual system of grammatical marking, which is
undergoing rapid change due to contact with other languages. The resulting
language documentation will be useful not only to linguists, but also to
community members interested in maintaining the
language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The language being investigated shows an ergative
alignment, where transitive subjects are treated differently from intransitive
subjects and transitive objects; unlike many ergative languages, however, this
pattern is only apparent in the formation of relative clauses, not from word
order or marking on nouns and verbs. This pattern was previously thought to be
impossible and presents some challenges for recent work in theoretical syntax.
This research will explore the properties of this unusual pattern and its
implications for our understanding of clause structure more broadly, including
how clause structure is affected by language contact. To address this question,
the study will be based on interviews with a broad sample of speakers, whose
language use may differ according to age, education, and place of
residence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
