9707002 Zhou A highly sensitive technique for the atmospheric measurement of
formaldehyde and oxygenated carbonyl compounds, including hydroxyacetaldehyde,
hydroxyacetone, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, and formaldehyde will be further
developed and deployed in the field. Oxygenated carbonyl compounds are important
products of the atmospheric oxidation of both biogenic and anthropogenic
hydrocarbons. Because of their photolytic activities in the solar spectrum of
the lower troposphere, these compounds become important precursors for
atmospheric free radicals. The measurement technique is based on aqueous
scrubbing of the compounds of interest using a coil sampler followed by
derivatization with DNPH and HPLC analysis. The detection limits will be on the
order of 10-30ppt with a time resolution shorter than 20 minutes. The instrument
will be deployed during a multi-investigator field campaign in 1998 at Pinnacle
State Park, NY, where a large variety of atmospheric trace species will be
measured simultaneously as part of the NARSTO-Northeast program.
