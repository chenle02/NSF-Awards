The interactions between vision, cognition and action are much more extensive
than previously believed. This is the central motivation for the 26th Symposium
of the Center for Visual Science (CVS), entitled "Blurring the Borders Between
Vision, Cognition and Action," scheduled for May 29-31, 2008 at the University
of Rochester. Twenty researchers who work with neurophysiological, anatomical,
behavioral or computational perspectives will participate. Topics will include:
Visual and Cognitive Circuits, Visual Signals in Cognitive Circuits, Cognitive
Influences on Visual Processing (including attention, context and learning) and
Vision During Action. To attract younger scientists, ten travel fellowships will
be awarded to graduate students or postdoctoral students who will present their
work in a poster session.
