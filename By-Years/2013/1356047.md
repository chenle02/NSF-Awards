The research team plans to further develop a technology for measuring permeation
rates of gas mixtures through barrier materials. The team has built permeation
testing equipment that utilizes an approach to interface a gas permeation test
cell with a high vacuum mass spectrometer (MS). The cell/MS interface design
reduces measurement delay time and enables real-time measurement of gas
permeation using a MS detector. The result is a test system that can measure the
permeation rate of any gas or gas mixture through barrier materials. This
single-instrument system can measure the permeation of any gas, eliminating the
need for separate pieces of equipment for each type of gas to be tested. The
instrument can also measure permeation of gasses and gas mixtures for which
there are few available instruments. The technology also enables multiplexing of
many sample cells with one detector, leading to accelerated test throughput.

The versatility and accelerated testing capability of this instrument has the
potential to produce an increase in test result data per unit of personnel time
and capital investment. There is a growing need to measure ultra-low rates of
gas permeation due to advances in gas barrier performance of packaging
materials. The technology is an enabling technology, which will give users new
and more expedited technologies to test permeability and create new materials.
