DMS-9622890 PI: Zhijian Wu University of Alabama @ Tuscaloosa In the past
several years, the principal investigator has mainly focused his research on
function and operator theory on analytic (one or several variables) or monogenic
function spaces. The operators include Hankel, Toeplitz, commutators,
multipliers, bilinear forms, approximation and atomic decomposition. The spaces
(analytic or harmonic) are Bergman, Hardy, Dirichlet and the scale of capacity
related spaces which includes the Bloch space and the space of bounded mean
oscillation functions. The study also involves differential operators such as
d-bar, Laplacian, Div, Curl and Dirac operators. The principal investigator
proposes to continue his ongoing study, to explore more connections and
applications of function and operator theory to other areas. Although there are
many problems related to the study which arise in nature, the principal
investigator plans to focus specifically on the aforementioned operators on
potential related function spaces, the function theory of these spaces, Nehari
type problems in Dirichlet spaces, minimum solution operators to some
differential systems and Clifford analysis in the theory of compensated
compactness. He will use function and operator theoretical tools and techniques
in harmonic analysis, together with new ideas and methods in his investigation.
Beside their own charm in pure mathematics, problems in this project have rich
connections and applications to many fields of applied sciences. For example
Hankel operators (or more generally commutators and bilinear forms) are very
popular in various aspects of engineering design and system science. Their
behavior provides important information to automatic control, navigation systems
and robust stabilization. The study of Hankel and related operators in various
underlying spaces will provide effective ways to deal with control problems in
different situations. Another good example is the recent discover o f the
connection between Clifford analysis and the compensated compactness phenomenon
in non-linear partial differential equations of multi-variable spaces.
Experience and previous achievement indicate that the principal investigator has
the potential to accomplish his goal.
