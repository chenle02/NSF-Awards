An introductory-level electro-mechanical motion devices and systems laboratory
is being developed which has as its principal focus low-voltage devices, typical
to low-power control system applications. The primary purpose of the laboratory
is to reinforce experimentally the concepts which are presented in a Junior-
level course in electro-mechanical motion devices course, which has evolved over
the last seven years as an elective. Recently this course attained the position
as one of the five basic courses of which all electrical engineering students
must select three; all other courses of this stature have associated
laboratories. Also, this laboratory provides a modern setting for the student to
select their required design project in the electro-mechanical systems area. The
requested equipment includes data acquisition systems which are interfaced with
personal computers which will assist in the interpretation and analysis of the
steady-state and dynamic characteristics of the electro- mechanical devices
considered as well as provide computer simulation as a tool.
