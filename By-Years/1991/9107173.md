This proposal seeks to extend ongoing work in reservoirs and small
impoundments, pursuing an evaluation of the generality of the trophic cascade
hypothesis. This hypothesis is currently being tested in north temperate open-
water and inshore, benthic communities. Southeastern reservoirs, the focus of
this work, differ dramatically from northern lakes in that an open-water
omnivore, gizzard shad, occurs in abundance. Neither controlled by fish
predators (owing to impressive fecundity coupled with a narrow window of
vulnerability to predators) nor by their zooplankton prey (following the mid-
summer zooplankton crash, shad switch to detritus and phytoplankton), gizzard
shad regulate community composition via "middle-out" processes, rather than
being regulated by top-down or bottom-up forces. These investigators have
designed a series of experiments across a range of spatial scales (1 m3 to 100
hectares) to evaluate whether gizzard shad can control zooplankton populations
and hence recruitment of bluegill (via exploitative competition for zooplankton)
and largemouth bass (by reducing their bluegill prey). Preliminary evidence
gathered during the past 5 years strongly supports the perspective that gizzard
shad may well drive community composition in Ohio reservoirs, thus serving as a
"critical" species that may well operate in a "middle-out" fashion. The
experimental approach of this study will evaluate the generality of the cascade
hypothesis by assessing its conceptual strength in reservoir food webs comprised
of weak biotic linkages.
