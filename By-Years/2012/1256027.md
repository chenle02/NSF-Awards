Foodborne disease outbreaks and associated product recalls have become major
sociopolitical problems in recent years. Governance of this problem requires
coordination amongst a heterogeneous, extensive, and distributed set of
institutional actors who utilize a variety of technical means and tools to try
to keep pathogens out of food. This dissertation details how foodborne disease
is governed in the contemporary United States. Using qualitative STS methods,
including organizational ethnography, in-depth interviewing, and document
analysis, this study focuses on the challenges institutional actors grapple with
in detecting and managing risk, and standardizing methods.

The topic of foodborne pathogen outbreaks is an important policy problem of
public concern that touches on one of our nation?s largest economic sectors, the
food system. Results of the research will be communicated with federal and state
public health and regulatory officials to promote better understanding and
improved communication between institutional actors. In addition to academic
audiences, some publications resulting from the research will be aimed at
policy-makers and consumers given the wide public concern about food safety.
