This project combines research and educational activities in several areas of
theoretical ultracold atomic physics, focusing on the superfluid properties of
cold atoms. Superfluidity is a novel quantum phase of matter, usually occurs at
very low temperatures, in which particles flow without friction. The same
physics also underlines the mechanism of superconductors. Ultracold atoms offer
an ideal platform to study this quantum phenomenon. Particles in nature, being
fundamental or composite, can be categorized into two classes --- bosons or
fermions --- depending on whether their spin is integer or half integer. Both
kinds can become superfluid under proper conditions. However, the properties and
formation mechanisms of bosonic and fermionic superfluids differ greatly. The
goal of this project is to investigate the novel properties of bosonic and
fermionic superfluids, as well as their mixtures, in the context of ultracold
atoms.

This research project is both of fundamental importance and of great relevance
to current experiments in the field of cold atoms. They serve the purpose of
providing theoretical guidance and support to cold atom experiments. The
specific topics to be explored span a wide spectrum of fundamental problems in
the field of cold atoms with close ties to solid state physics. These studies
will shed new light on many outstanding problems in superconductors which are
materials of technological significance. Students and postdoctoral fellows
involved in this research will receive a solid training in theoretical cold atom
physics which will be very valuable for their future career in science and
engineering.
