Phytoplankton receive energy from the sun (from above), and nutrients from the
water column (from below). Molecular diffusion proceeds so slowly that primary
producers in the euphotic zone would deplete their nutrient resources over a
time scale which is well below what is observed through experiments. They must,
therefore, depend sensitively on the replenishment of nutrients through
upwelling processes. There are large nutrient stocks at depth due to the
constant death and decomposition of organisms that populate the euphotic zone.
Thus a reliable model of phytoplankton population dynamics must incorporate an
accurate physical model for the upwelling process. While work on this physical
component has been undertaken by a small number of researchers, the general
consensus among ocean biologists is that considerable work remains to be done.
For instance, Bleck et al (1988) have shown the importance of fronts to the
upwelling process using the MYCOM isopyncnal vertical grid model. For coastal
upwelling, a "hybrid" version may be more suitable. However, the physics
component must be supplemented by a suite of biological considerations such as
the adaptivity of diatoms to variations in light; the role of zooplankton in
limiting the phytoplankton populations; and the mobilities of nutrients,
phytoplankton, and zooplankton. This biological component is currently beyond
the PI's realm of expertise, and it is through collaboration with Dr. Gary
Hitchock at the Rosenstiel School that useful predictive models will be forged.
