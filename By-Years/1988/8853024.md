This project is providing electrophoretic and immunochemistry equipment for use
by undergraduate students enrolled in the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
courses. The equipment is being used to educate students in both the theory and
the practice of modern techniques used to separate and analyze proteins and
nucleic acids from biological sources. The new instrumentation includes a video
densitometer, an ELISA reader, eight electrophoresis set-ups, computer
interfaces and software. A sound set of educational and scientific goals is
being pursued systematically under this project. The approach being employed
stresses the quantitative uses of electrophoretic and immunochemical methods for
detecting molecules (using modern densitometry and absorbance measurements),
along with more traditional approaches. Under the resulting program students now
are receiving the hands-on laboratory experience necessary to prepare them for
scientific careers in biotechnology, the health professions, industry, and
research. The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal sum
obtained from non-Federal sources.
