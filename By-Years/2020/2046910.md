For many applications in health, security, and robotics, the capability for
computers to track objects in video is critical. From autonomous vehicles that
reliably avoid obstacles to security cameras that swiftly respond during
emergencies, artificial perception systems need to remain accurate during poor
visibility situations, such as with cluttered rooms, dark streets, or occluded
objects. This integrated research and education project aims to develop machines
that are able to spatially sense their visual surroundings, even when the
surroundings have low visibility with significant obstructions. On multiple
levels, the investigators will furthermore use their integrated approach to
advance education in artificial intelligence, such as outreach activities for
K-12 students and streamlined curriculums for both undergraduate and graduate
education in computer vision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research program
introduces a framework that tightly integrates geometry, motion, and acoustics
in order to learn rich spatial representations of natural scenes from unlabeled
visual data. The research team will study how learning from the incidental
structures of unlabeled videos will cause rich spatial representations to emerge
without human supervision. The framework will leverage the propagation of sound
through objects to learn visual tracking under occlusion. In other cases, the
project will use scene geometry to transfer incidental supervision between
camera views in order to learn spatial memory models. A key advantage of the
approach is the efficiency to operate on videos that span both large physical
spaces and long temporal horizons. Motivated by implicit surfaces in mathematics
and graphics, the algorithm will analytically represents videos as continuous
functions, which are compact and robustly embed video dynamics in 3D
space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
