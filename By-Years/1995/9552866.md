for Local Systemic change in the district. With the assitance of a planning
grant a comprehensive vision for mathematics and science instruction will be
discussed, alliances will be formed with partners and a strategic plan for K-12
instruction will be developed. This will result in a plan for implementing
effective instruction by means of systemic teacher enhancement. Funds amounting
to $43,500 are requested from NSF with cost share estimated at $9,000.
