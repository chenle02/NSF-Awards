The general area of this research is on quark models and hadronic and nuclear
dynamics. The specific topics for investigation are (1) proton-antiproton
annihilation into two- meson channels, (2) the low energy theorem and its
apparent break down in the photoproduction of neutral pions, (3) flavor symmetry
properties of hadrons probed by external currents, (4) chiral symmetry in
nuclei, and (5) astrophysical applications of neutrino-nucleus reactions.
