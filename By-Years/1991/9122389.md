The political transformation of the Soviet Union from an authoritarian to an
increasingly participatory society provides a unique opportunity to examine the
emergence of new modes of political activity during a period of state formation.
This study links data on political participation and other forms of
organizational behavior from two already completed first stage surveys of
approximately 7,000 respondents in Estonia and 12,000 in Russia (RSFSR) with a
second wave of more detailed interviews of approximately 1,500 in Estonia and
3,500 in the RSFSR. The interviews will explore the extent of political and
organizational involvement. Explanations for this involvement will be sought in
the reasons people give for their activity, in the resources of time, money, and
skills they have available, and in the networks of friends and acquaintances
that get them involved in organizations. Because the first interviews were
before the August, 1991 coup attempt and the second wave will be in early 1992,
the investigators will gather important data on how people's activities and
attitudes changed during this historic period. The end result should be a
significantly better understanding of how political participation and democracy
is developing in Estonia and in the RSFSR.
