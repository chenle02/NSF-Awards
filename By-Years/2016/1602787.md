The award will support travel for approximately 10 U.S. professors, post-
doctoral researchers, and graduate students to attend the 16th International
Congress on Catalysis (ICC) to be held in Beijing China on July 3-8, 2016. The
ICC Congress is held once every four years at rotating locations around the
world, and is the premier worldwide conference covering research advances in all
areas of catalysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Catalysis is an enabling technology for
a wide range of chemical and energy-related processes, as well as increasingly
for processes aimed at environmental remediation, sustainable energy, and
control of greenhouse gas emissions. Twenty-five to thirty per cent of all
manufactured products involve at least one catalytic step. The 16th ICC will
help to focus worldwide attention on the role of catalysis in ensuring a
sustainable future. Strong U.S. participation will ensure that U.S. researchers
will play a prominent role in defining the research agenda needed to address the
most pressing commercial and societal needs required to maintain U.S.
competitiveness and environmental stewardship in all areas of catalysis.
