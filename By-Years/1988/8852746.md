The scientific equipment provided by this award enhances the quality of
introductory and advanced courses in archaeology and physical anthropology by
enabling undergraduate students to experience hands on use of instruments in the
classroom, laboratory and field program settings. Two surveying instruments, a
theodolite and an alidade, greatly improve student competence in field
situations involving archaeological surveying and mapping and expand the range
of their performance to include skill in the use of equipment common to Old
World as well as New World archaeology. The microscopes provide laboratory
opportunity for students to observe and identify cellular structure and
histology of bone tissue and the nature of wear patterns on hominid teeth.
Physical anthropology students use the calipers and microscope provided to
measure and examine specimens in the search to identify and distinguish
different species of human and nonhuman primates. The award will be matched by
an equal amount from the grantee.
