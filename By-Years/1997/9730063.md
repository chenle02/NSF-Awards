9730063 Hazen Life thrives in a remarkable variety of aqueous, high-pressure
environments. Hydrothermal vents support rich ecosystems, while rock-bound
microbes survive in deep aquifers associated with granite, basalt, and
sediments. Life is generally sparse at depth, but it's potential Significance is
great, for these habitats may represent a crustal volume exceeding a billion
cubic kilometers. The extent to which high-pressure organisms exploit this vast
volume will depend, in large measure, on the efficiency of high-pressure,
hydrothermal organic synthesis. Modern organisms use enzymes to catalyze
metabolic reactions, notabley steps by which molecules are enlarged through CO2
addition? In the proposed experiments mineral surfaces, including transition
metal sulfices, will be investigated as possible catalysts for these reactions
under high-pressure, hydrothermal conditions. This exploration will provide
fundamental data on organic synthesis under geologically relevant conditions--
data essential to future studies of life in extreme environments.
