Buta, Ronald 96-17154 Dr. Buta will study the kinematics and dynamics of
resonance ring galaxies. The research will directly test the idea that rings are
related to resonances by obtaining 2-dimensional near- infrared imaging of a
substantial sample of ringed galaxies. This study should provide many important
insights into the nature of disk instabilities in galaxies because the location
of corotation is crucial to determine both the effectiveness with which angular
momentum is transferred to the outer regions of galaxy and the ability of a
spiral density wave to be maintained.
