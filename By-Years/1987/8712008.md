This proposal by Dr. Jonathan Roughgarden of Stanford University is to conduct a
workshop/seminar on theoretical aspects of field ecology. This section of
ecological research brings the more exact but simpler science of mathematics to
bear on ecological problems. The ecological community has experienced for some
years now the elegant, though sometimes incredible revelations of this approach.
This approaches proponents, though highly enamored of their contributions, do
not enjoy the credulity they feel is their due from the ecological community.
Their clamant is recognized and there is much to be gained by conjoining
mathematics with ecology, especially if the former provides succint formulations
that clearly and truly embody the biological principles involved. This requires
clearer understandings between mathematical/theoretical ecologists and
empericist/theoretical ecologists. To this end, a workshop involving the two
groups is necessary and long overdue. The field of ecology will be served in
many of its facets, including computer simulation of ecology, population and
ecosystem ecology. Dr. Roughgarden and his colleages at Stanford have
reputations in this area and Stanford is equipped to support this workshop. The
Program recommends funding.
