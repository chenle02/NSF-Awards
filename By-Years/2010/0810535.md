This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will lay the foundation
for creation of a new microphone with performance characteristic of the highest
precision measurement microphones today, but with size and cost approaching
those of microphones found in consumer electronics.

The broader impacts of this project are that by reducing the cost of
instrumentation microphones, access to high-quality test and measurement will be
more available to schools and educational institutions. Beyond instrumentation
applications, having a high performance, low-cost, small-sized microphone can
have a strong impact on other consumer markets isuch as the hearing aid market.
