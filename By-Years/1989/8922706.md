The principal investigator will explore the use of multivariate Bayesian
classification methods in spatial statistics. He plans to study the contextual
classification of remotely sensed data using iterative Bayesian and empirical
Bayesian procedures. He plans to extend existing models to broader contexts,and
hopes to improve current models in various ways. Both simulated and actual data
will be studied. He will study nugget effect models, various spatial correlation
structures, and adaptive starting value models using natural conjugate prior
families (while using iterative procedures for posterior classification).
Results should be applicable to satellite imagery in agricultural and
geophysical contexts, to image reconstruction, and to problems in pattern
recognition.
