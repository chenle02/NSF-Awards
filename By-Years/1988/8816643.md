This award provides one-half of the funding required to purchase a
multicollector, solid-source mass spectrometer to be installed and operated in
the Department of Geological Sciences at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute
&amp; State University (VPI). The University is committed to providing the
remaining half of the funds necessary for the purchase and will house and
maintain the equipment. The new frontiers of research in isotope geochemistry
lie in the application of isotope data to reactions taking place at the micro-
scale and this state-of-the-art instrument will allow the VPI earth science
group and regional colleagues to continue their active program in geochronology
and the use of isotope tracers in reconstructing the geologic history of the
Appalachians.
