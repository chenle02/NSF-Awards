This award provides travel support for students and postdoctoral fellows to
attend the 29th Annual Symposium on Computational Geometry, to be held June
17?20, 2013 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

The Symposium on Computational Geometry (SOCG) is the oldest and most
influential international conference in computational geometry. Throughout its
almost 30-year history, SOCG has played a seminal role in the formation and
evolution of the field, and it continues to serve as the flagship venue for
groundbreaking research in all areas of geometric computing.

The funds will be used to encourage and facilitate the participation of under-
represented groups in this top-tier computer science conference. They will also
contribute towards attracting more underrepresented groups to computer science
research giving students an opportunity to engage in the important technical,
professional and social exchanges that SOCG fosters. Finally, the conference
itself and all conference attendees will benefit from the greater attendance and
consequently higher proportion of students and under-represented groups that
this travel grant makes possible.
