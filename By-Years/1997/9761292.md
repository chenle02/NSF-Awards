Advanced CMP Products Inc. will develop a unique wafer to wafer transfer
capability for micropackaging technology, based on a technique known as tethered
transfer. This process has demonstrated high yield and hermetic capability, and
can transfer complex devices such as micromechanical resonators. The process is
tolerant of substrate asperities and particulate contamination, and does not
subject target components to high temperatures or agressive chemistries. The
proposed concept is relevant to a $1.2B market for microfabricated packages in
wireless telecommunications, consumer electronics and other industry sectors.
