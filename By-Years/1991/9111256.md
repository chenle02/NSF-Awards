This is a Research Initiation Award dealing with a wind power generating system.
The proposal presents a novel configuration of a variable speed wind power
generating system consisting of a doubly-excited brushless reluctance machine
and a low power rating converter. With this unique configuration, rotor windings
and brushes of the electric machine are eliminated. In addition, the power
converter controls both active and reactive power to provide improved control
flexibility.
