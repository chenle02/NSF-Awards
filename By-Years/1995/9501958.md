9501958 Barros New mathematical models will be developed for flood forecasting
and control which will accommodate the non- stationarity in the hydrologic data
and will integrate the interactions between geomorphic, hydraulic and hydrologic
processes of flood-producing events. The objectives of the project are: to
improve the estimation of Probable Maximum Precipitation (PMP) by resolving the
orographic component of extreme storms; to create a novel method for estimating
standard design storms; to establish generalized extreme flood forecast and
drought forecast indices; to couple a physically-based precipitation model to a
framework of surface and subsurface hydrology models currently in development by
the United States Corps of Engineers; and to examine basic landscape dynamics by
investigating the cause effect-feedback relationships between geomorphology and
hydrology, between river morphology and hydraulics, and between land-use
changes, geomorphology and hydrology. The educationally component of the project
consists of a course renovation plan for teaching Engineering Hydrology aiming
at the progressive inclusion in the classroom of the new concepts developed in
the research phase and of emerging advanced computer technologies. ***
