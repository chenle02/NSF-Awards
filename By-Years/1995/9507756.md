9507756 Condon In an effort to increase the number of women entering graduate
school in CISE disciplines, the Computing Research Association (CRA) has been
awarded a continuation of the Distributed Mentor Project (Award CDA-9302536)
where 20-25 female students are matched with a number of female professors in
CISE research areas each of the years 1996-1998, to participate in a summer of
research at the mentor's institution. The students will most likely be computer
science or computer engineering majors although this is not required. In
addition, the pi's have been funded to conduct a longitudinal evaluation of the
two projects over the years 1994-1998. The evaluation will measure how well the
projects have met the goal on increasing the number of women in CISE disciplines
entering graduate school. The most useful aspect of the mentoring/research will
also be assessed on an annual basis in order to provide feedback for improving
the remaining years of the project. The CRA is an association of U.S. and
Canadian academic departments of Computer Science and Computer Engineering, and
Industrial Laboratories engaging in basic computing research. The mission of CRA
is to represent and inform the computing research community and to support and
promote its interests. Dr. Weingarten is the Executive Director of CRA. Dr. Anne
Condon, the academic leader of this project, is an Associate Professor of
Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin. ***
