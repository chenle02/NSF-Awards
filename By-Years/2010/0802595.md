The need for technicians with traditional skill sets as well as with experience
in programming, networking, and systems integration knowledge is well-documented
and technicians who can manage controls present an emerging and rapidly
expanding market of high-wage employment for community college graduates. The
lack of technicians qualified in building automation systems constitutes one of
the greatest barriers to rapidly implementing energy efficiency, greenhouse gas
reduction, and sustainability targets in commercial buildings. This project
builds on previous efforts aimed at upgrading technician education to meet
today's challenges for energy efficiency in buildings. Courses are being
developed in the area of building automation and sustainability and a new
associate's degree program will be offered in building automation, filling a
critical gap in degree offerings. The project involves extensive collaboration
with national ATE centers, with industry, and with four-year institutions. A
Physics for Building Science and Sustainability high school summer program is
being expanded and a teacher training component is being added through this
project. Results from the project are being rigorously evaluated and
disseminated on a national scale.
