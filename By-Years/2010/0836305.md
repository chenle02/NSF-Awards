IIS - 0836305 &lt;br/&gt;International Participation in JCDL and Hypertext
2008&lt;br/&gt;Larsen, Ronald L. &lt;br/&gt;University of
Pittsburgh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides support for travel for
several international scholars to attend the Joint Conference on Digital
Libraries (JCDL) and in the Hypertext conference, to be held consecutively in
Pittsburgh, PA, June 16-21, 2008. The invitees are major figures in their
respective digital libraries communities and manage and organize activities in
Europe and Africa that have significant bearing on building international
interoperable repositories. Their participation both provides valuable
information on research and infrastructure agendas in their countries and will
extend international dialogue and collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;
