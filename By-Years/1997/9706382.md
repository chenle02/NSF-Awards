9706382 Banfield The proposed research will investigate the inorganic and
biological mechanisms by which layer silicates are weathered, with implications
for geochemical cycles, soil fertility, and plant nutrition. Specifically, work
will focus on interactions between biotite, chlorite, muscovite, and rhizosphere
microorganisms and the reactions that convert these minerals to clays. This work
builds on our previous studies of inorganically and biogeochemically mediated
alteration of chain silicates and extensive studies of layer silicate
structures, microstructures, chemistry, and reaction mechanisms in
hydrothermally altered rocks. Layer silicates partially transformed to clay
minerals will be characterized using atomic-resolution transmission electron
microscopy and state of the art energy-filtered electron microscopic techniques.
Atomic-resolution and low dose image capture capabilities will be used to
determine whether structural details of clay products are consistent with a
transformation mechanism that involves structural inheritance. Our work will
employ both weathered layer silicates from the rhizosphere region of natural
soils and layer silicates weathered in a laboratory rhizosphere. The
distribution of microorganisms on mineral surfaces will be studied using domain
level and more specific oligonucleotide probes. The hypothesis that
microorganisms in soils accelerate mineral dissolution by production of
extracellular enzymes (e.g. "mineralases" , analogous to cellulases and
chitinases microbes produce to degrade wood, chitin, and related organic
substrates) will be tested. This work involves collaboration with Prof. Robert
Goodman (Plant Pathology, UW-Madison.
