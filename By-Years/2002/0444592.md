The broad aim of this research is to improve understanding of how nitrogen (N)
loss and retention processes affect long-term N accumulation and "N limitation"
in terrestrial ecosystems. The specific aim is to determine the major pathways
of N loss from Alaskan tundra ecosystems, the controls over those losses, and
the importance of the losses for N accumulation and for interactions with the
carbon (C) cycle. The field research will be based at Toolik Field Station,
Alaska, and the research design is built around three core questions:
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; What are the major forms and rates of N loss from
different tundra ecosystem types? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; What are the major
environmental and biological controls over these N losses?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
What are the impacts of N loss on overall N and C budgets of tundra ecosystems?
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research design includes both field and laboratory
experiments, and also the monitoring of N movement through soils and surface
waters of a small watershed, Imnavait Creek. Simulation models will be used to
construct N budgets at various timescales and to predict changes in N and C
cycling in response to climate change and other disturbances.&lt;br/&gt;
