Professor Renken will initiate a new program of computational research in the
subject of quantum gravity. He will use the mathematical technique of dynamical
triangulation and the renormalization group to model important features of
quantum gravity. The problem of quantum gravity in 3 or 4 dimensions is
currently a very active area of theoretical research. Although it is impossible
to predict whether this work will provide a final theory, it is highly likely to
generate significant advances in our understanding of thermodynamics and
continuum limits in candidate lattice theories.
