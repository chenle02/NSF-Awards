The objective of this research is to investigate charge transport properties in
interface-controlled organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) using light
scattering techniques, with a long term goal of applying OFETs in memory
devices. The approach includes (1) layer-by-layer growth of polymer films using
pulsed laser deposition to control the semiconductor-dielectric interface in
OFETs; (2) probing the dielectric-semiconductor interface using Raman
spectroscopy from biased OFET structures and correlating the changes in the
vibrational spectra with theory to identify the structural changes upon charge
transport; (3) charge modulation spectroscopy of OFETs; (4) surface-enhanced
Raman scattering from metal nanoparticle doped dielectric and organic
semiconductors for memory applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
research takes a comprehensive approach to probe charge transport in OFETs by
combining light scattering techniques with conventional current-voltage
characteristics, yielding information on electron-phonon interactions and
structural changes at the interface. Such a technique has a potential
transformative character as it promises to become a standard probe for studying
charge transport mechanisms in a host of other optoelectronic devices. This
hypothesis will be further put to test in organic memory applications where
surface-enhanced Raman scattering studies will be carried out to gain insight
into the operation of memory devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of
the work is demonstrated by recruitment of undergraduate interns including
underrepresented minorities from Lincoln University (a Historically Black
College &amp; University) to give them opportunities in cutting-edge research.
The proposed work involves participation and training of graduate students which
will contribute to the US workforce in the area of organic
optoelectronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
