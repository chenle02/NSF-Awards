The project is a major step in the continuing enhancement of the inorganic and
instrumental capabilities of the chemistry program. A Fourier transform infrared
spectrometer and associated computer software has been purchased for use by the
students in the laboratories beyond the freshman courses. The students are
thereby gaining direct experience with a modern spectrometer and benefit from
its speed and accuracy in their laboratory assignments. The students are also
gaining direct experience with the power and convenience of the computational
routines that are possible with digitized data. The grantee is matching the
award from non-Federal sources.
