The main focus of this study is to acquire and interpret a middle to late
Pleistocene record of paleoclimate and the paleomagnetic field from nonmarine
sediments in an effort to determine the effect of large and rapid climate
changes on nonmarine systems. The overall stratigraphy and chronology of the
sediments will be established using a multidisciplinary approach including
detailed lithologic descriptions, tephrochronology, radiometric age dating, and
paleomagnetic correlations. Paleoclimate will be inferred from ostracod faunal
analyses, pollen floral analyses, and the geochemical analysis of ostracod
shells. The paleomagnetic work will a) established a causal relationship between
geomagnetic excursions and secular variations and b) established a high
resolution "type section" paleomagnetic variations for the Pleistocene of
western North America.
