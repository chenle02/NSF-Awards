9521002 Terray Near-surface turbulence measurements will be conducted in Lake
Ontario in collaboration with scientists from the Canada Centre for Inland
Waters to study the dependence of near-surface mixing on wind speed, wave
development and stability. The anticipated result is the development of an
improved understanding of small-scale physical and biological processes that
depend on the details of mixing close to the air-sea interface. ***
