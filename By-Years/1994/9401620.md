This project, in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry
Program, is concerned with the use of electron donor ligands that undergo
irreversible fragmentation after photochemically induced electron transfer to
probe the dynamics of excited state transition metal systems. In principle, the
use of an irreversible chemical reaction that occurs after the electron transfer
will allow for the determination of excited state dynamics that cannot be obtain
by direct time resolved spectroscopic methods. The method will be applied to
molecular and ion paired systems using nanosecond/picosecond transient
absorption spectroscopy and quantum yield measurements. Absorption of
electromagnetic radiation occurs with the formation of an excited state of
absorbing molecule. What happens to this absorbed energy very much depends upon
the lifetime of the excited state. This project is designed to acquire
fundamental information about the behavior of excited states in a variety of
transition metal compounds. Ultimately the information obtained from these
studies may prove useful in developing better chemical methods of solar energy
conversion.
