This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports research on silica-related compounds by Dr. Frank J. Feher, Chemistry
Department, University of California-Irvine. Synthetic methods for three types
of silsesquioxane compounds will be developed: incompletely-condensed
silsesquioxanes from fully-condensed (RSiO3/2)n frameworks; versatile precursors
to water-soluble frameworks; and endohedral complexes. The goal is to develop
methods for preparing the target compounds in bulk for use in catalytic
reactions. A key step in all of these syntheses is selective partial hydrolysis
of fully-condensed frameworks to give well-defined products. Some of the
resulting compounds will be studied as models for surface reactions thought to
occur at catalyst sites with various numbers of proximate hydroxy groups or at
sites that control stereospecificity. Others will be used to form `cages` that
can host small molecules, thus controlling reactivity. Large assemblies of
compounds containing silicon and oxygen called silsesquioxanes have previously
been synthesized and used as models for silica and as building blocks for other
network solids. Compounds of this type are used as catalyst supports for
transition metals and as catalysts in important industrial processes. In this
research, new compounds in this family will be prepared in order to extend the
usefulness of this inexpensive class of materials.
