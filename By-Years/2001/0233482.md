With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Carol Espy-Wilson will study a
knowledge-based speech recognition system's performance in noise. The research
is linguistically motivated way, in that it seeks acoustic correlates of
linguistic features. This project emphasizes two components of the PI's larger
research agenda: (1) analysis of signal representation to ensure its robustness,
and (2) application of a neural model to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio
before or during the extraction of a knowledge-based speech signal
representation. The broader impacts of the project lie in its progress towards
speaker-independent speech recognition, which has practical applications in
industry, education and speech rehabilitation.&lt;br/&gt;
