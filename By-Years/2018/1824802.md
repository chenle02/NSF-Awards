This Gordon Research Conference (GRC), preceded by a Gordon Research Seminar
(GRS), aims to provide a forum for innovative progress in science and technology
of molecular materials by enabling new cutting-edge technologies through
fundamental research. Electrons, the main players in functional materials, have
two degrees of freedom, spin and charge, which are responsible for magnetism and
conductivity, respectively. Making these degrees of freedom integrated,
emergent, and synergetic is a key to innovation in molecule-based materials and
devices. The following topics will be covered: molecular spintronics and
molecule-based devices; strongly correlated systems and emergent phenomena;
molecular qubits and quantum technologies; topological states, chiral magnets;
superconductivity under extreme conditions; light-induced processes; novel
materials, functionalities, and ideas. The GRC/GRS Co-Chairs are actively
involved in the topical areas of research and are well qualified to conduct this
project. GRC Co-Chairs, Prof. Kanoda and Prof. Shatruk have experience in
organizing other high-impact conferences and participated in both previous GRCs
of this series. The GRS Co-Chairs,&lt;br/&gt;Andrej Pustogow and Lakshmi
Bhaskaran, participated in the previous GRS and GRC that took place in
2016.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
