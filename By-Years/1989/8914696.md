This proposal is to obtain a high resolution transmission electron microscope
(JEOL JEM-1200EX-BIO) to replace a 20 year- old JEM-100B which is currently one
of two standard transmission electron provided as "core facilities" to
biological investigators at the University of California at San Diego (UCSD).
These microscopes, along with facilities for specimen preparation, constitute
the Laboratory for Neurocytology that is operated on a recharge basis in the
School of Medicine at UCSD. There are over 20 research projects involving 12
established investigators currently dependent on the use of the
electronmicroscopic facilities of the Laboratory for Neurocytology. The major
user group consists of established scientists mainly from the School of Medicine
with research interests in neurobiology. Other users from the general campus or
the allied institutions also benefit from the special facilities for freeze-
fracture, three-dimensional reconstruction, or cryosectioning, not available for
use on a recharge basis elsewhere in this geographic area.
