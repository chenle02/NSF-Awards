0103635 Pemantle The principal investigator will work in several areas of
combinatorial probability. In the area of asymptotic enumeration, he will obtain
approximations to coefficients of multivariate meromorphic generating functions
that are asymptotically valid as the multi-index goes to infinity in any
possible way. The ultimate goal is to automate this procedure, at least for the
class of (multivariate) rational generating functions with nonnegative
coefficients. Previous results indicate this may be feasible, or at least may be
carried out to some extent. These results are to be applied to several
combinatorial problems in probability theory, including asymptotics for random
tilings for the so-called Aztec Diamond configurations and other related tiling
ensembles conjectured to produce polynomial phase boundaries. In the area of
random processes with reinforcement, he will investigate the rate at which
processes of stochastic approximation type converge to their ultimate limiting
behavior. In particular, the slow convergence of vertex-reinforced random walks
and uniformly reinforced social network models to their limits is to be
explained by giving quantitative bounds on the probabilities of deviating from
this behavior at finite times. It is hoped that this will both explain
simulation data and give a theoretical basis for the use of these models. Among
the other miscellaneous problems are several problems in economic game theory
and one concerning asymptotics of solutions to functional equations.

Recent progress in computer algebra has made many types of computation
automated which once were done only by skilled practitioners. Nowadays, a few
messy equations are no barrier at all to a complete theoretical and practical
understanding of a problem. The most tangible result of the asymptotic
enumeration project will be the transformation of a formerly difficult type of
computation into a straightforward, though messy, series of steps. Applications
reach far beyond the motivating examples of random tilings, and include queuing
theory, signal processing and combinatorial enumeration. Reinforcement processes
arise most commonly in three application areas: formal models of learning,
population biology, and economic behavior. In each of these areas, the results
of the project will shed light on when and why the theoretically predicted
limiting behaviors are not observed in the timeframes of real applications.
