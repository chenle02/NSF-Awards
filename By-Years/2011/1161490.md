The objective of the proposed research is to develop the foundations for
resource allocation in femtocell networks, and evaluate the performance of the
solutions using real testbeds. Wireless resource allocation in femtocell-based
networks is particularly challenging due to four main reasons: (1) interference
between femtocells and between femto- and macro-cells; (2) variable and
unpredictable delays in signaling and data communication between each femtocell
and the operator's network; (3) limited bandwidth for signaling over a wireless
channel to a large number of femtocells; and, (4) involvement of three parties
with differing priorities: the operator, the users, and the femtocell owners.
The specific research tasks in this project are: (1) For legacy systems, develop
distributed solutions for both downlink and uplink scheduling and handover under
co-deployment of macro- and femto-cells that do not require any changes to
existing hardware and standards; (2) Develop distributed, adaptive and self-
organizing solutions (unconstrained by legacy requirements) for resource
allocation by using a powerful tool from statistical physics, called Glauber
dynamics; and (3) Design mechanisms to facilitate offline truthful auctions in
practical settings involving the end-users, the femtocell owners, and the
operator. The solutions will be implemented and evaluated on two testbeds under
development at University of Michigan and at Ohio State University. The proposed
research has the potential to significantly impact the cellular industry and
end-users. Given the high penetration rates of cell-phones worldwide, this
research has an immediate and widespread impact.
