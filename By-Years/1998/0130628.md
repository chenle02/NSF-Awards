Stigma is an example of a culturally and socially determined behavior that has
enormous impact on the health of individuals and populations worldwide. It is
time for a major behavioral and social science approach to complement the legal
approach and moral reproach that have characterized the global response to
stigma regarding persons with marginalizing illnesses, such as schizophrenia ,
epilepsy and HIV/AIDS. This award is in support of an international conference
that will take place over two and a half days in September, 2001. The conference
is hosted by the Fogarty International Center at the NIH. Sessions will focus on
cross cutting, socio-cultural issues including policy. It will also include
sessions on population genetics and stigma.
