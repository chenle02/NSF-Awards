This award will support a two-pronged attack on the problems of understanding
supernova progenitors and of the physics of supernovae up to and immediately
after the explosion. The first project, to be led by Dr. Arnett of the
University of Arizona, will model the late evolutionary phase preceding iron
core collapse (Type II supernovae) in massive stars. This will be the first time
that such calculations have been done in three spatial dimensions, and will
cover evolution to the onset of core collapse including an evaluation of the
role played by rotation and other mechanisms of symmetry breaking. This epoch is
characterized by a complex interplay between turbulence and nuclear burning that
determines the entropy and density structure of the pre-collapse core, which
along with rotation are important characteristics in determining the outcome of
the core-collapse event. The second effort, led by Dr. Starrfield of Arizona
State University, will explore accretion onto white dwarfs using compositions
ranging from pure helium to a mixture with varying abundances of heavy elements.
The goal of this work is to determine the initial conditions that lead either to
a Supernova Type Ia explosion, an energetic helium flash, or helium novae. This
work is motivated by the inconvenient situation that the kind of star producing
Type Ia supernovae is still unknown, and both theoretical and observational
arguments for and against various scenarios have only grown more complicated in
recent years. Common to both projects is a numerical code that includes a new
theory of turbulent convection in three-dimensions that includes good resolution
in both spatial dimensions and in time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is
expected to impact the wider astrophysical community through the release of
stellar evolution and convection codes. The project will also support the
training of students and a postdoctoral fellow, and the results of this work
will be incorporated into the curricula at both institutions.
