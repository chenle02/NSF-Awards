Solutions of viscoelastic polymers in water exhibit much lower drag and heat
transfer coefficients than water for turbulent flow is a circular tube. This
phenomenon is not understood. Since such flows are common in the chemical, food,
and petroleum industries, the drag and heat transfer reductions are of practical
importance. The proposed research will encompass measurements of drag and heat
transfer over a large range of flow conditions, for various viscoelastic fluids,
and with systematic variations of all the important parameters. The data will be
interpreted with respect to the available predictive models and will serve as
the basis for improving the models. Also, semi- empirical representations of the
results will be developed for design purposes.
