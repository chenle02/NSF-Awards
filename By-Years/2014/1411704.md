The 2010 El Mayor-Cucapah Mw 7.2 earthquake was the largest earthquake to strike
southern California in the last 18 years. It triggered shallow creep on many
faults in Salton Trough, Southern California, making it at least the 8th time in
the last 42 years that a local or regional earthquake has done so. However, the
triggering mechanism of fault creep and its implications for seismic hazard and
fault mechanics remain poorly understood. The main goal of this project is to
develop an improved view of fault creep by analyzing geodetic data and modeling
the triggering process, both static and dynamic, in the framework of rate-and-
state friction. The investigators will first construct an improved fault creep
dataset by developing an automatic creep detector that can process thousands of
InSAR images, whose results will later be integrated with the existing
creepmeter and field survey datasets. Second, they will use realistic static and
dynamic shaking due to nearby earthquakes as stress perturbations to a 2D planar
fault model with rate-and-state frictional property variations both in depth and
along strike. These parameters can eventually be used in the calculation of
seismic hazard. By developing both state of the art models and the most
comprehensive dataset of creep events for a large fault system, they hope to
transition from a conceptual understanding of fault creep towards a
quantitative, predictive understanding of the conditions that create creep
events on particular faults. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will improve our
understanding of the mechanics of the shallow portions of faults, which has
significant implications for the shaking/hazard levels expected from future
earthquakes in the Salton Trough, an agriculturally and economically important
area. The automatic transient detector is one of the first of its kind and will
inspire new detectors applying pattern recognition on geodetic data.
