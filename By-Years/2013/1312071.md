This project is focused on a novel application of recently developed tools in
computational topology to certain problems of risk in financial networks.
Complex problems often benefit from being viewed in a new light; the
investigators use persistent homology to study behavior of financial trading
networks. Persistent homology focuses on how a family of simplicial complexes
D(t) vary with a real parameter t. Typically one starts with a discrete data set
(point cloud data) corresponding to t=0, and then as t varies, points are
replaced by balls of radius t, centered at the original point. Thus varying t
yields a filtered family of simplicial complexes, the Rips-Vietoris complex of
the associated topological space. In the context of trading networks, the
parameter t represents margin; a low value for t corresponds to allowing highly
leveraged trading. The aim of the project is to understand how changes in the
topology of the D(t) associated to a trading network correspond in some way to
systemic collapse. Put simply, the investigators explore the circumstances that
cause a local event to cause global contagion.

The problem of understanding interconnectedness is one of today's premier
challenges. Connectivity is ubiquitous; interconnections often allow a system to
be tapped to its full potential and enhance its robustness. The flip side of
connectivity is that it gives rise to pathways for unexpected emergent behavior
("black swan" events) and even systemic collapse. The world is awash in data:
how can we extract meaning (and understand connectivity) from it? One answer is
via the mathematical discipline of algebraic topology, which is a tool to
distill the study of complex objects or spaces into a simple form. For example,
how can we distinguish between an orange and a donut? The obvious answer is that
the donut has a "hole"; algebraic topology makes the natural intuition (which is
not so natural in higher dimensions!) rigorous. In particular, algebraic
topology is built to probe the relationship between local and global structures;
this makes it an ideal tool for studying financial trading networks. The
proliferation of problems where there is a confluence of local/global
transitions and a large experimental data set has given rise to the field of
applied algebraic topology, yielding a systematic way to unfold connections. The
investigators interpret various notions of collapse of financial networks via
this unfolding perspective. The work focuses on clearing networks, which encode
trades and liabilities, and bring the tools developed in applied topology to
bear on unfolding the interconnections in such networks. In particular, the
investigators study how local events propagate: under what circumstances does
contagion and systemic collapse result from a local event?
