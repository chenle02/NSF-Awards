This project is concerned with centralizer algebras, insertion schemes,
stability and constructions of graded Lie algebras. The principal investigator
will study tensor products of representations of complex simple Lie algebras and
the behavior of spinor representations as the rank of the orthogonal Lie algebra
goes to infinity. In addition, she will study constructions of graded Lie
algebras as a means of systematically exploring simple Lie algebras of small
characteristic and of determining root multiplicities for GIM and Kac-Moody
algebras. This project is on the interface of physics, combinatorics, algebraic
geometry and characteristic p algebra. It involves constructive representation
questions left hanging since the time of Weyl and Brauer. These questions are
presently of great interest to combinatorialists and physicists.
