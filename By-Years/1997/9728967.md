ENG-9728967 Rosenberg, Allison This award is in support of a two-day workshop,
conducted as a joint undertaking by the Government-University-Industry Research
Roundtable (GUIRR) and the Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy
(COSEPUP), will examine the primary stumbling blocks to effective partnering
between research organizations in the university, industry, and government
sectors. The workshop will utilize a case study approach to feature real
examples of institutional experience. The objectives of the workshop are to
identify the most destabilizing factors (operational, cultural, or otherwise)
impeding collaborative research across sectors, and to explore and disseminate
information about constructive and practical approaches to solving those
problems.
