Computer based data acquisition and testing is becoming more and more prevalent
in the field of electronics. Presently the electronic technology equipment at
Nassau Community College consists exclusively of discrete, non-computerized
measuring instruments. The project is incorporating data acquisition into the
Electronics program at Nassau Community College through upgrading one of their
two electrical measuring labs by the incorporation of state of the art computer-
based "virtual" instruments. Students using this lab are being exposed to the
concept of computer based data acquisition and computerized data analysis over
the two years they are in the electronics program. The project builds the
integration of the data acquisition equipment and analysis programs into every
electronics course containing a laboratory portion. The students knowledge of
data acquisition and analysis is being gradually expanded semester by semester
as new aspects in this area are presented. Upon completion of the program the
project equipment will allow the student to have a thorough understanding of
data acquisition.
