Two projects are being proposed. The first is in the area of robust estimation
theory as applied to power systems. Security monitoring and control of an
electric power system depend on a reliable data base. Unfortunately, in a
typical power system there are bad measurements, parameter errors, and/or
topology errors. The present industry practice is to use a weighted least
squares approach which has no tolerance for large errors and frequently fails.
In this connection robust estimation theory has advantages but work needs to be
done to make the method practical. Among these are the need to further the
extension of the theory to sparse matrices and to determine appropriate "high
breakdown point" estimators. Other issues to be addressed include real-time
estimation and optimal sensor location. The second area of research concerns the
use of real-time phasor measurements for voltage and transient stability
monitoring and control, including dynamic security analysis and automatic
control during an emergency state of a power system.
