ABSTRACT: 9312655, PI-Montgomery, "Baroclinic Wave Packet Dynamics in Low Level
Confluent/Diffluent Flow as a Mechanism for Tropical Cyclogenesis": In earlier
research, the principal investigator investigated the interactions of upper
level potential vorticity disturbances and low level disturbances as a possible
mechanism for tropical cyclones initiation. While this mechanism appears to be
important in the subtropics, it is not clear whether it applies to the deep
tropics as well. Under this award, Dr. Montgomery will simulate and diagnose the
cyclogenetic potential of baroclinic wave packets in barotropic
confluent/diffluent flow (basically corresponding to the flow in the boundaries
between subtropical highs) in both dry and moist neutral atmospheres, using a
three dimensional semi geostrophic model. The study would attempt to mimic the
passage of a tropical easterly wave into a region of confluence or diffluence.
In addition, he will other possible lifting mechanisms such as the beta effect
and isolated vortices in shear flow.
