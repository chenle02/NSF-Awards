Graph partitioning is a fundamental combinatorial optimization&lt;br/&gt;problem
that has many practical applications such as&lt;br/&gt;in supporting efficient
load balancing for parallel processing,&lt;br/&gt;in VLSI layout, and in data
clustering. This proposed research program &lt;br/&gt;focuses on the study of
spectral methods for graph partitioning.&lt;br/&gt;Spectral methods make use of
the eigenvectors of graph matrices (e.g., &lt;br/&gt;the Laplacian or the
adjacency matrix of a graph) to construct a quality&lt;br/&gt;partitioning. They
have been popularly used in practice&lt;br/&gt;for partitioning meshes in
scientific simulation, for dividing graphs&lt;br/&gt;derived from circuits, and
for clustering data in web-graph analysis&lt;br/&gt;and information
organization. However, the quality of the partition that &lt;br/&gt;these
methods should produce has so far eluded precise analysis.&lt;br/&gt;Spielman
and the PI made some breakthrough progresses.&lt;br/&gt;In particular, by
proving that the second smallest eigenvalue of&lt;br/&gt;the Laplacian matrices
of bounded-degree planar graphs&lt;br/&gt;is at most O(1/n), Spielman and the
PI&lt;br/&gt;showed that proper use of spectral techniques can
produce&lt;br/&gt;a bisection of graphs with cut size at most
$O(\sqrt{n})$,&lt;br/&gt;which is best possible for the family of planar
graphs.&lt;br/&gt;
