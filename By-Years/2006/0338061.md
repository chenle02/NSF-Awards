Thermal perturbations associated with seismic slip may significantly affect the
dynamic friction and the mechanical energy release during earthquakes. Previous
theoretical work and field observations suggest&lt;br/&gt;that a number of
temperature-dependent mechanisms, including micro-and macroscopic melting,
enhanced plasticity, and pore fluid pressurization may dramatically modify the
effective fault strength at&lt;br/&gt;high slip velocities. However, the
magnitude, the spatio-temporal patterns, and even the sign of the thermally-
induced variations in the effective fault friction are not well known. Recently,
experimental&lt;br/&gt;measurements of the rock friction have been extended to
slip rates approaching the seismic range of meters per second. The experimental
data reveal a complex dependence of the effective rock friction
on&lt;br/&gt;temperature, slip rate, and fault-normal stress; both weakening and
strengthening behavior is reported. Perhaps the most intriguing finding of the
high-speed laboratory experiments is an apparent&lt;br/&gt;increase in friction
upon the onset of macroscopic melting. This increase may indicate a change in
the basic physics from the asperity-contact sliding to a viscous-like flow at
high slip velocities. This project investigates effects of the co-seismic
heating on the dynamic fault strength by developing a hermodynamically
consistent model of the fault zone deformation that explicitly includes heat
transfer, phase transitions (e.g., melting and freezing), and realistic rheology
of the fault zone rocks. Observables used to validate the model predictions
include field observations of the "fine structure'' of the exposed fault zones
(in particular, the degree of slip localization), morphology of the
pseudotachylite veins, and new results from the laboratory&lt;br/&gt;high-speed
sliding experiments. This work may contribute to the on-going discussion about
the magnitude of stress at which the major crustal faults operate.&lt;br/&gt;--
