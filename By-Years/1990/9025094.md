Ill. Inst. of Tech. The objectives of this proposal are the investigation of
solids entrainment to the jet area in a fluidized bed, and the development of a
multiphase model to explain and scale-up the results. The experiments is simple,
but important for understanding a phenomenon commonly encountered in fluidized
bed systems. Modeling is performed with simplifying assumption by retaining in
the equations only the most significant effects. Matching funds for personnel
and materials will be provided by the Energy Center at IIT. The proposed
analysis of a fluidized bed with a central jet has relevance for numerous
applications. The fluidized beds with no jet is a limiting case of the present
device. It is expected that the proposed approach will provide a quantitative
basis for better understanding and designing the fluidized bed systems.
