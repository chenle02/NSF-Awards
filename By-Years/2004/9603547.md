9603547 Spaziani Growth, molting and regeneration of lost limbs in crustaceans
is controlled by steroid hormones (ecdysteroids) from a pair of glands
(Y-organs). The Y-organs, in turn, are regulated by a protein hormone (MIH) from
the animals' brain. This system is comparable to human glands (testes, ovaries,
adrenals) that secrete steroid hormones (testosterone, estrogen, cortisone) and
that are controlled by protein hormones from the brain and pituitary gland. The
PI has found that crustaceans, like humans, make steroid hormones from
cholesterol and that the cholesterol in blood is bound up in lipoprotein (HDL).
Accordingly, crustacean glands are being used as a simplified model to study how
cholesterol enters cells, how those cells converted it to hormones, and how the
process is controlled by the brain hormone. The project focuses on how inflation
is transferred from the cell surface, which contains receptors that "recognize"
MIH and HDL, to the interior, ultimately to genes that code for enzymes
responsible for hormone synthesis. In particular, the hypothesis will be tested
that informational signals are specialized lipids which cause (a) the activation
of membrane enzymes, and (b) the release of intracellular calcium, both in turn
responsible for activation of key enzymes in the path toward hormone synthesis.
A subset of questions centers on the probability that increased hormone
synthesis can be triggered by rises of calcium in the circulation as well as by
calcium already resident in the cell. Methods include use of radioactive calcium
as tracer and fluorescence indicators that detect release of intracellular
calcium. The research results will help to solve related mysteries in vertebrate
glands. Generally, this research contributes to knowledge of the biology of
crustaceans and their insect relatives, economically important animal groups,
and embraces the fields of neurobiology, endocrinology and development in
addressing basic questions on neuroendocrine coordination and control of steroid
hormone secretion. ***
