Dealing with consequences of historical land dispossessions associated with
colonialism, racism, and capitalist expansion dogs a variety of countries
throughout the world. Nowhere is the issue of land reconciliation more important
than in South Africa. That country today confronts a variety of land issues
flowing from the country's history of land dispossessions, ranging from "land
grabs" by the urban landless, to efforts by farm workers to achieve rights of
ownership to their land, to claims by "surplus people" to land from which they
were removed by government actions under apartheid. Land reconciliation raises
and illustrates many significant theoretical issues related to the emerging
interdisciplinary fields of transitional justice and justice psychology.
Generally speaking, justice research argues that people judge law and politics
by whether they comport with their standards of fairness. Such judgments are
important since legal and political institutions perceived to be unjust are
unlikely to be accorded legitimacy, and without legitimacy, compliance becomes
problematical (i.e., it may become more closely related to calculations of costs
and benefits) -- perhaps thereby exacerbating behaviors such as illegal land
invasions. At the level of the political system, this project will examine land
reconciliation, which is hypothesized to be most effective when law and elite
and mass preferences coincide. At the micro-level (the level of this research),
this study examines preferences on land reconciliation policies. These
preferences are hypothesized to flow from (1) how issues land get framed in
terms of the four sub-dimensions of justice (distributive, procedural,
retributive, and restorative); (2) instrumental interests, especially as
reflected in experiences with various forms of land dispossession; and (3) basic
cultural values, in particular individualism (expected to be most common among
those of European ancestry) versus collectivism (which may predominate among
Africans). In addition, the principal investigator will investigate (4) whether
South Africans approve of land invasions and are likely to join such movements
in the future. The principal component of the research design is a survey of
samples of both South African elites and members of the mass public. The survey
incorporate a variety of innovative techniques, including persuasibility
experiments, the use of experimental vignettes designed to assess the role of
competing dimensions of justice on preferences for land reconciliation, and
follow-up in-depth interviews with especially knowledgeable respondents.
