In this project within the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organo- metallic
Chemistry program, Susan E. Kegley of Williams College will synthesize
organometallic compounds of molybdenum which contain a chiral molybdenum atom
bonded to an olefin and other auxiliary ligands. The reaction chemistry of these
compounds will be studied and in particular their possible use for asymmetic
induction reactions which could provide ready access to inexpensive chiral
intermediates for constructing more complex biologically-active molecules. The
particular compounds to be investigated are cyclopentadien-
ylcarbonyl(bis-1,2-dimethoxyphosphinoethane)molybdenum(prochiral olefin) cation
and derivatives in which the phosphine ligand is also made chiral by various
substitutions on the ethylene car- bons. The resulting diastereomers and
enantiomers will be separated and resolved and then the coordinated prochiral
olefin of a particular stereoisomer will be subjected to nucleophilic attack by
various nucleophiles such as hydroxide, alkoxides, ammonia and carbanions. The
chiral organic group will then be cleaved from the metal atom to produce the
synthetically useful chiral molecules.
