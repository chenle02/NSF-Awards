Kevrekidis 9711224 The investigator and his collaborator Edriss Titi of the
University of California, Irvine, study the long-time behavior of solutions to
dissipative evolution partial differential equations under perturbations; they
undertake a combined theoretical and computer-assisted approach, with a number
of illustrative applications in mind. These spatiotemporal perturbations are
motivated physically by phenomena occurring in media with varying properties,
such as reaction and diffusion in inhomogeneous media (leading to PDEs with
spatially or spatiotemporally dependent coefficients). They may also be the
result of a feedback control loop on a spatially distributed system. In the
project, they are interested in maintaining / exploiting / prescribing low-
dimensional dynamics through large amplitude perturbations and/or scale
variation effects. The tools they build upon are the global machinery of
inertial and approximate inertial manifolds, as well as scientific computing for
the simulation and the bifurcation and stability analysis of nonlinear evolution
PDEs. The new set of questions they address requires the extension and
combination of these tools with aspects of separation of time scales in control
theory (e.g. persistence of inertial or approximate inertial manifolds in closed
loop systems) or in homogenization theory (when coefficients in the PDE
representing properties of the medium vary on disparate spatial scales). This
project extends, develops and implements mathematical and computational tools
that enhance our ability to study reaction and transport processes (modeled by
dissipative nonlinear evolution partial differential equations) under
inhomogeneous conditions. Such conditions constitute more the rule than the
exception under realistic physical circumstances, whether due to imperfections
in the process (in which case we want to guarantee a certain level of
performance) or due to intentional design of composite media, or to fe edback
control (where we attempt to optimize a process, like the selectivity of a
chemical reaction). The method and algorithm development part of the project is
applicable to a wide class of such systems. The particular applications,
however, focus on the modeling, analysis and design of novel composite catalysts
for heterogeneous reactions, and on the exploitation of modeling for the control
of spatially extended systems (such as fluid flows).
