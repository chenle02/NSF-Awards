An undergraduate Photonics Laboratory is being developed to support laboratories
in five senior level electives in the Department of Electrical Engineering:
Fiber Optics, Design in Electromagnetics and Optics, Fourier Optics, Laser
Electronics and Optical Sensors. This new undergraduate laboratory in optics and
photonics also will be used to develop experiments to be used in required
courses in electromagnetics and devices and circuits.
