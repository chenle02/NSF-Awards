This award provides partial funding for the upgrade of a Fourier Transform
Infrared spectrometer system in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the
University of California in Berkeley. The University is committed to providing a
match of 33% of the costs of the equipment for this project. The upgrade project
will consist of renovation of the source, drive and electronic components of the
existing system, a new microscope system for improved microsampling, and the
development of a novel detector design for microspectroscopy. The upgrade will
allow better spectroscopic characterization of phase changes and properties of
earth materials subjected to ultra-high pressures (simulating conditions in the
Earth's deep interior) during laboratory experiments inside a diamond-anvil
pressure cell.
