9453150 Wright The Local Systemic Change Through Teacher Enhancement project is
the result of a collaboration between five Alabama school districts and the
University of Alabama, Huntsville (UAH). The project will combine resources from
the school districts, UAH and local engineers and scientists to support a hands-
on, module- based science curriculum. The curriculum to be implemented will
include NSF funded STC, FOSS, and Insights materials as instructional modules.
The five school districts will also support a Materials Resource Center that
will supply and refurbish materials for teachers and provide professional
development for teachers and principals. During this five-year project, 518
teachers will receive 100 hours of professional development and 102 selected
lead teachers will receive substantial enhancement of 230-400 hours. This
extensive training will build local capability for continued improvement after
the project expires. The summer program focuses on the enhancement of the lead
teachers. They will analyze progress made during the past year, plan follow-up
activities and prepared new workshops for teachers and principals in the
upcoming school year. They will provide leadership to the teachers in their
schools for implementing change. Three of these lead teachers will be chosen to
become full time project staff so they can conduct workshops, visit schools to
assist in on-site enhancement, and guide district and multi-district teacher
enhancement sessions. Lead teacher- principal teams will inform parents about
the program. Cost sharing is 117% of the total NSF requested budget. ***
