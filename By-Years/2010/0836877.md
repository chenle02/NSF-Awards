Computer Science (31) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the problem
of the decline in the number of computer science (CS) majors by creating a
computer science course for non-majors designed to satisfy the college
mathematics general education requirement and to increase students' appreciation
of computer science and its relevance in today's
society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Efforts to reverse the decline in enrollment in
computer science are numerous and target different student populations but these
programs tend to be long-term or dependent on students enrolling in CS courses
in the first place. The new course is an attractive option for students to
satisfy their mathematics general education requirement. It gives an opportunity
to the computer science faculty to present the computing field as essential to
the students' lives and to society. Materials are developed to integrate the
mathematics and the computer science concepts and to incorporate significant
computer applications that impact students' lives and the society at
large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The course designed initially for Columbia College,
a liberal arts women's college with a large minority representation of mostly
African-American students allows testing the course material on two under-
represented groups in computer science. However, the designed course is
appropriate as well for most liberal arts colleges with little adaptation. In
addition to core units, additional units vary between the different offerings of
the course during the project duration to provide more choices to departments
adapting the course. The project includes significant dissemination activities
to increase the impact of this project well beyond Columbia College.
