The purpose of this grant is to support US based graduate students for traveling
to and attending the ACM MobiCom 2009 conference to be held in Beijing, China,
on September 21-25, 2009. MobiCom is a premier conference that serves as a
meeting point of researchers from academia and industry, as well as
practitioners in different fields of wireless networking and mobile computing.
In conjunction with the main conference, MobiCom 2009 will also host several
workshops and tutorials on topics of emerging interest. The NSF travel grant
will allow a diverse set of students from US institutions to participate in this
forum and gain valuable experience by interacting with senior researchers as
well as peers in this field. Such interactions and exposure can positively
influence the quality of the students' individual research and professional
growth, in turn shaping the future of wireless networking technology.&lt;br/&gt;
