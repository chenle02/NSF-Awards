Capturing the essential behavior of nonlinear phenomena with the simplest
possible models is of paramount importance in science and engineering. This
allows for understanding of basic mechanisms, the design and implementation of
efficient numerical methods for simulation and control of devices, and the
analysis of both models and algorithms. These crucial aspects of modern research
are blended together in this research project, which deals with modeling,
formulation, and numerical analysis of physical and biological phenomena at a
scale where surface tension competes with bulk effects and could in principle be
manipulated (or controlled) to produce scientifically interesting and
practically useful dynamical behavior. Applications of the work include nano and
microtechnology (such as the design and control of micro electro-mechanical
systems (MEMS)), biotechnology (such as the study of biomembranes), and high
performance computing (such as the design of novel efficient numerical methods).
Results of the work will enhance modeling and prediction capabilities and help
educate students and postdocs in exciting, mathematically and computationally
challenging, and practically relevant areas of research.

This project investigates models, such as biomembranes, ferrofluids, liquid
crystals, and bilayer actuators, that are governed by nonlinear geometric
partial differential equations defined on deformable domains that are unknown
beforehand. Numerical approximation is carried out via adaptive finite element
methods, with a posteriori error estimation and multilevel solvers, which allow
for the resolution of problems with very disparate space-time scales with
relatively modest computational resources. The project will advance
understanding of adaptive approximation methods and the role of geometry in key
questions concerning: 1. Convergence and complexity of adaptive finite element
methods (FEM) for elliptic PDE; study of fractional diffusion, hybridizable
discontinuous Galerkin methods, hp-FEM and isogeometric methods, and the
Laplace-Beltrami operator on parametric surfaces. 2. Design of high order
arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian methods for parabolic PDE on deformable domains
and surfaces. 3. Control of problems involving surface tension and magnetic
effects, with or without free boundaries, relevant for device design in
technology and biomedicine. 4. Computational modeling and analysis of
ferrofluids and liquid crystals; these are technologically useful and
mathematically intriguing complex fluids which can be actuated by magnetic and
electric fields, and thus manipulated and controlled for specific purposes. 5.
Novel FEM for geometric PDE: handling of large deformations with isometry
constraints, typical of bilayer actuators, and dealing with fully nonlinear PDE.
