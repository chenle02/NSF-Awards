9530258 Du The corrosion of silicon nitride materials at high temperature in dry
and wet oxygen will be studied. The effects of aluminum implantation will
receive special emphasis and the effects of sodium contamination will be
evaluated. The surface composition and microstructure will be characterized in
detail at various stages of the corrosion process and correlated with corrosion
rates which will be determined by in-situ thickness measurements involving laser
reflectance complemented by ex-situ ellipsometry and profilometry measurements.
A kinetic model will be constructed to describe the corrosion process and to
evaluate corrosion rate constants, diffusivity values of rate-controlling
species, and their temperature dependence. ***
