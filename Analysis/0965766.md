Many real life applications yield a data set which manifests itself as a
collection of points in some metric space. In some cases one may take this
metric space as a high dimensional Euclidean space, and in some cases even this
is too restrictive an assumption. A standard task or challenge which one faces
is finding a faithful representation of this collection of points (or a big
portion of it) as a subset of a low dimensional Euclidean space. The meaning of
the words faithful, big, and low is clearly context dependent, and it is often
the case that winning a little more in one of these three categories yields a
loss in the other two. In many cases it makes sense to assume something about
the geometry of the data set. This task has thus far yielded much attention from
computer scientists and applied mathematicians using a wide range of approaches.
The PI proposes to use and develop harmonic analysis and geometric measure
theory techniques to attack these problems. In particular, the theory of
quantitative rectifiability (a quantitative approach to geometric measure theory
stemming from harmonic analysis) and diffusion geometry (the study of geometry
through diffusion processes, heat kernels eigenfunctions etc.) will be used.

We are at an age where one has the ability to collect large amounts of data in
a reasonable time, but in many cases we do not have the ability to make full use
of this data since the mathematical tools are not sufficiently well developed.
The research we propose involves the development of new mathematical techniques
for extracting information from large data sets and representing it in simpler
form, thus making it easier to work with and understand. Applications include
the study of databases of images and documents, and the modeling of complex
dynamical systems (e.g. transaction data, weather patterns, molecular dynamics).
