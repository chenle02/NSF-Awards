In the proposed work key design and implementation issues will be addressed
which will make free-space optics a more viable interconnect alternative at the
board interconnection level. The major goals of this work are to: a) Develop a
layout and design program which includes relevant optical and electrical
properties of free space optical interconnects. b) Combine the alignment
properties of lithographically formed binary optical elements with the high
spatial frequency recording capability and single exposure formation properties
of volume gratings. c) Evaluate methods to reduce misalignment effects of free
space beams propagating between boards, and establish a minimal set of
substrate-mode holographic interconnects for distributing signals in the plane
of the board. d) Develop and evaluate alignment and packaging techniques for
stacked optical systems with electronic processor elements. e) Use the
interconnect design model to build a board level interconnect system which
transfers data in parallel between three boards. The interconnect locations on
boards will be optimized to reduce latency effects.
