Cedarbaum 9224797 This U.S.-Argentina Cooperative Science Program award
supports travel expenses of A. Cederbaum, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New
York to Argentina. Dr. Cederbaum will carry out research in biochemistry, in
collaboration with S. Puntarulo and A. Boveris, of the Univ. of Buenos Aires.
The award also covers disposable supplies needed for the research and some
publication costs. The research id directed towards understanding the role of
transition metals in catalyzing the production of active oxygen radicals by
biological systems, in particular the ferritin system. The physiological role of
ferritin is important, and the approach taken by the investigators is likely to
solve some long-standing problems involving the action of ferritin.
