9455954 DeTurck A consortium of six institutions: the University of
Pennsylvania, Villanova University, Polytechnic University, Community College of
Philadelphia, University City High School and the Society for Industrial and
Applied Mathematics, are planning to undertake a major initiative to integrate
research and real-world applications into the basic mathematics curriculum, and
to integrate advanced mathematics better into the upper-level curricula of
disciplines which use it. Efforts are focused upon: development of basic and
advanced interdisciplinary courses which are oriented to specific applications
areas or goals; development of applications and laboratory-oriented courses for
mathematics majors; use of Calculus-reform pedagogy and methods in more advanced
mathematics and other disciplinary courses; creation of applications modules for
mathematics courses; and, creation of mathematics modules for other-disciplinary
courses. During the course of this planning grant, work will be initiated on
planning for new courses and materials, continuing work already begun; and the
production of one or two finished modules.
