Approximation theory has been an important branch of mathematics for over 100
years; the mathematics involved ranges from the very abstract to the very
applied. Several new research areas such as computer-aided geometric design and
robotics depend heavily on tools from approximation theory. Some of the most
currently active research areas in approximation theory are wavelets,
multivariate splines, multivariate data fitting, orthogonal polynomials,
rational approximation, abstract approximation, modern moduli of smoothness, and
computer-aided geometric design. This project will support the Seventh
International Symposium on Approximation Theory, to be held January 3-7, 1992 at
the University of Texas at Austin. The conference will include 9 one-hour
invited survey lectures and over 100 sessions for contributed papers. A volume
of conference proceedings is planned.
