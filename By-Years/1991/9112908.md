This research is concerned with the physical processes underlying the
magnetically dominated energy-conversion processes that drive solar-terrestrial
activity. The methodology involves the formation of an MHD treatment of
transport-enriched evolution and instability processes, and their multi-
dimensional nonlinear simulation onsupercomputers. The proposed program involves
analytical and computational plasma physics, illuminated by the study of solar-
activity measurements. It is planned to extend both the physical accuracy and
solar applications of past computer simulations. Convective energization and
reconnection of magnetic structures will be detailed, as well as the dynamic
magnetic response (and support of) gravitating prominences, the speed-up of
flare reconnection, and the evolution and activity of coronal streamers. These
studies are motivated by the desire to understand related phenomena in the wider
universe of astrophysics, and by the need to predict their consequences in the
solar-terrestrial system.
