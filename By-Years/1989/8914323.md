This proposal requests funds in partial support of a symposium entitled: "The
Genetics and Molecular Biology of Arabidopsis". The symposium is the fourth in
an annual series organized by the Institute of Molecular and Cellullar Biology
at Indiana University. It will occur on the dates October 12-15, 1989 at
Bloomington, Indiana. The purpose is to provide an up-to-date account of the
current status of this fast moving research area. The funds requested will be
used in partial support of the travel expenses of the approximately 17 speakers
who have agreed to participate as well as graduate students who will make poster
presentations.
