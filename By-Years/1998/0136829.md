Summary: This proposal request support to study evolution of wind strength and
development and migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone in the North
Pacific Ocean during the late Paleogene and Neogene. The study will use grain
size, isotope data and composition of dust in a series of marine cores in the
tropical and subtropical Pacific to trace wind strength and dust source (Asian
or American) during the Oligocene to Recent. The goals of the project are to
determine the evolution of strength of zonal winds, and to trace the development
and migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone through time. In addition
the study will better constrain the provenance of the American dust component
and determine the changes in the latitude of the facies change between Asian-
source and American source dust in the Pacific Basin. &lt;br/&gt;
