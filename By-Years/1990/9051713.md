As a result of a program review, the Psychology Department is increasing its
commitment to the research and laboratory components of its curriculum. It is
establishing a laboratory component in the Physiological Psychology course. This
laboratory permits students to learn laboratory methods, explore the
relationship between biology (physiological function) and behavior, and develop
their own research projects. This opportunity was virtually non-existent
previously. The project furthermore, provides students with exposure to animals
as research subjects. Exposure to humanely-treated research animals provides
students with a broader perspective on animal rights issues. The university is
contributing an amount equal to the award.
