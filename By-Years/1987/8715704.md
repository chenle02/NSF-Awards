Hypertext is an approach to information management in which data are stored in a
network of nodes connected by links. Nodes can contain text, source code,
graphics, audio, video, or other forms of data and are meant to be viewed and
manipulated interactively. Hypertext '87, to be held November 12-15, 1987 at
Chapel Hill, NC, will be the first large workshop/conference devoted to the sub-
ject. Individuals with widely differing backgrounds and experi- ence with
hypertext will be encouraged to participate in discus- sions of systems,
applications, and issues.
