George G. Stanley of Louisiana State University will study the synthesis and
chemical reactivity of binucleating polytertiary- phosphines and their
coordination compounds in this research within the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and
Organometallic Chemistry Program. These coordination compounds will be examined
with respect to their catalytic behavior on the hydroformylation reaction with
alkenes to produce aldehydes and subsequently primary alcohols, both of which
are commercially important classes of organic compounds.
BisÄ±phenyl(2-diethylphosphinoethyl)phosphino!methane, a tetra- tertiary
phosphine which forms bimetallic complexes with the metals in close proximity
(closed-mode or "cradle" complexes), and some tetraphosphine analogues, will be
used as the ligands of choice for this study. The unique property of this set of
ligands to form the cradle complexes, instead of the open-mode usually observed
with previously examined polyphosphines, allows the study of metal cooperativity
in this series of catalysts. Reactions to be studied include double
hydroformylation of conjugated dienes (e.g., butadiene), asymmetric hydro-
formylation of prochiral alkenes, and carbon-carbon bond formation in alkene and
alkyne cyclizations and oligomerizations.
