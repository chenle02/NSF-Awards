This project is aimed to explore a new design concept on damage based design for
highway bridges to resist earthquake ground motions and other dynamic loads.
This is a jointly supported pilot study by NSF (Division of Civil and Mechanical
Systems) and FHWA (Turner Fairbanks Highway Research Center) to develop new
bridge design principles and criteria for future applications. In this pilot
project, proof-of-concept study is carried out, both analytically and
experimentally on a structural component by examining the damage initiation and
accumulation process under selected input earthquake ground motions. The PI
intends to show that seismic performance of bridges may not be satisfactorily
described by using the quasi-static approach or based on behaviors under cyclic
loading conditions. Many structural damages are results of combined failure
modes (strength, deformation, stiffness, low cycle fatigue, etc.). They can only
be understood based on principles of structural dynamics of M-DOF systems.
Damage based performance criteria are important foundations for the Bridge of
the Future.
