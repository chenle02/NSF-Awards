Although religion and race are important factors influencing national political
campaigns, it is only recently that political scientists have begun to build a
theoretical and empirical base to investigate this topic. This study
investigates the role of religious resources in the political mobilization of
Black Americans. The recent presidential candidacy of the Reverend Jesse Jackson
in 1984 and 1988, and the presidential candidacy of Pat Robertson in 1988,
suggest accelerating involvement of church-based candidates and organizations in
the political process. Because of the stronger centrality of religion in the
lives of women, particular attention is placed on understanding the role of
gender in a church-based political mobilization process. The major objective of
the investigation is to construct a model of church- based political action
among Black women and men which can be tested empirically. These political
activities will range from church- centered campaigns to engaging in political
protest activities. A church-based mobilization framework which draws upon
social learning and resource mobilization theories should advance our knowledge
and understanding of the dynamics which influence the political acitivism of
religious Black women and men. The methodology for this project involves
secondary analysis of data from the 1984 National Black Election Study (NBES), a
telephone survey of the Black adult population. This study includes a pre- and
post- election interview format. A total of 1,150 respondents were interviewed
in the pre-election study and 871 were re-interviewed in the post-election
study. The analysis of these data should increase substantially our
understanding of the role of religious resources in the political mobilization
of Black Americans.
