Professor Richard's group will continue development of sensitive new
transducers designed to operate with bar detectors for the search of
gravitational radiation. Assemblies consisting of tuned harmonic oscillators of
decreasing masses attached at the end of a cylindrical bar antenna are being
developed to amplify the small displacements generated in the antenna by a
gravitational signal. A very high finesse laser illuminated Fabry-Perot sensor
with power dissipation at the level of a few microwatts or less is used to
detect amplified mechanical displacements. The sensitivity projected for a
three-mode 2400kg A15056 antenna operating at 800Hz and cooled to = 0.03K (such
as planned by two research groups) is at the level of .h = 8.7 x 10-21. Such a
sensitivity would permit observations of astrophysical significance.
