The "field to Finish" surveying equipment acquired in this project completes the
integrated system needed to teach engineering students state-of-the-art data
collection, processing, computing, design and plotting practices that they will
encounter in professional employment. Through the planned curricula changes the
concepts of automation in data collection, computer-aided design and drafting
are introduced into civil and surveying engineering. Modern engineering practice
requires that graduates have knowledge of modern data collection and design
techniques. The project goal is to produce professional engineers and land
surveyors with "hands-on" experience. The award is being matched by an equal
amount from the principal investigator's institution.
