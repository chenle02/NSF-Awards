Neural information processing is receiving growing attention particularly
because of its suitability for handling massive amounts of data extremely
efficiently, for its fault tolerant characteristics, its massively parallel
architecture, and the new fundamental approaches and controversy which it has
stimulated. The proposed workshop brings together experts in this field to
discuss the many diverse aspects of potential importance.
