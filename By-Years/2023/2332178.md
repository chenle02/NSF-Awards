Over the past decades, the Internet has undergone a major change from being
primarily a research-oriented network for academics to becoming a cyber-physical
infrastructure “critical” for modern society in general and the global economy
in particular. This transformation has occurred largely by happenstance, rather
than by design, and under the assumption that the current architecture that has
ensured its robustness in the past would be sufficient to provide the robustness
now expected from it. To re-architect today’s Internet as critical
infrastructure requires a new understanding of the architectural principles on
which it should be based on. It requires a reassessment of the possible
scenarios that can challenge the network’s basic functioning and the threats
that can arise as a result of the network’s constant evolution. At the same
time, it must explore paths for incremental deployment that embed the necessary
incentives for adoption. Given the close interdependence of the Internet and the
power grid, both the analysis of potential threats, as well as any re-design to
enhance survivability, must consider both systems in parallel and inform each
other’s progress.

The success of this proposed effort depends on close collaborations among a
broad and interdisciplinary team of scientists, including networking
researchers, power/smart grid experts, economists, and social science
researchers. The goal of the workshop is to bring together an initial group of
national and international experts to develop a transformative research agenda
towards re-architecting tomorrow’s Internet for survivability, ensuring that the
network is able to fulfill its mission even in the presence of large-scale
catastrophic events.
