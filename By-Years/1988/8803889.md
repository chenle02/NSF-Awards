The project carries out a two year study of lateral expulsion of pore fluids
resulting from vertical loading of sedimentary strata by both tectonic and
depositional processes. The study focusses on 1) compaction and topography-
driven lateral flow as a mechanism of mass and heat transport in sedimentary
layers, 2) variations in the flow pattern of pore water caused by the temporal
and spatial changes in porosity and permeability, 3) geochemical and
paleomagnetic evidence for and constraints on lateral flow, and 4) application
of these results to the lateral migration of pore fluids and hydrocarbons in the
Appalachian and Colville Foreland Basins and the Northern Gulf Coast Passive
Margin. The objective of the project is to better understand the role of pore
fluid migration and diagenesis in sedimentary layers and to be able to use this
information quantitatively in the evaluation of fluid expulsion as a mechanism
for heat and mass transfer in sedimentary basins.
