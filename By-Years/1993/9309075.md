Gekelman The project will carry out a laboratory study of Alfven waves and
their interaction with plasma particles-a set of physical processes of major
importance in solar and space physics-through the use of the new large linear
plasma device at UCLA and modern optical laser induced fluorescence techniques
developed at Colorado. The goals of the project are to explore and begin to
understand dissipation, resonance, heating and wave-induced transport through
which Alfven waves are damped by and coupled to the plasma medium.
