ABSTRACT K. Y. Simon Ng This is a postdoctoral industrial fellowship awarded
under the GOALI program. It is to support Dr. Haryani Permana to work in the
General Motors North American Research and Development Center with Dr. David
Belton. The goal of the effort is to fill a gap in the fundamental understanding
of palladium-rhodium interactions in automotive emission control catalysts. The
activity of a planar model catalyst is compared with the high-surface-area
supported palladium-rhodium catalyst to established the relevance of the model
system. The model catalyst is studied using ultrahigh-vacuum surface analysis,
in-situ infrared spectroscopy, and scanning probe microscopy to gain insight on
the interactions of palladium and rhodium under various conditions. This
research is relevant to the design of more effective and longer lived catalytic
converters for control of nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons in automotive
emissions. ***
