The single cell green alga, Chlamydomonas, has two whip-like flagella that are
used for swimming. If the flagella are mechanically removed by vigorous
agitation, they grow back rapidly. During regrowth a family of genes that encode
the flagellar structural proteins, alpha-and beta- tubulin, are activated and
produce copious amounts of RNA and protein. Once the flagella have completely
regrown, the tubulin genes becomes inactive. The objective of the proposed work
is to elucidate the molecular mechanism responsible for tubulin gene regulation.
In tubulin gene that are necessary and sufficient for on-off switching. The
experimental approach to be used involves gene transfer techniques, and the use
of isolated nuclei. The principal investigator also describes experiments
designed to isolate and characterize proteins in the nucleus that bind to the
tubulin gene regulatory regions, and as a consequence, somehow activates or
inactivates the genes. One of the central questions in biology today concerns
the mechanism involved in the regulated expression of genes in higher plants and
animals. This mechanism is fundamental to such processes as growth and
development. This proposal, then, approaches a timely and important problem by
developing and exploiting a model system ideally suited for the analysis of gene
expression.
