Collective induction is the cooperative search for descriptive, predictive, and
explanatory generalizations, rules, and principles. Research with cooperative
4-person groups using face-to-face communication indicates that the groups are
remarkably able to recognize correct hypotheses if proposed by a group member,
but rarely form correct emergent group hypotheses unless proposed by a group
member. Increasing information increases the number of correct hypotheses, but
also increases the number of incorrect group hypotheses. The research will
compare face-to-face versus computer-mediated communication under three
conditions that are predicted to raise computer-mediated collective induction to
or beyond the levels reached in face-to- face communication. The research should
help to realize the potential of computer-mediated communication by allowing
effective collective induction by any group of dispersed members.
