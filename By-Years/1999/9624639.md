A major obstacle to building robust systems that can read, summarize, and
extract information from text is the need for large amounts of linguistic
knowledge to handle the myriad syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic ambiguities
that pervade virtually all aspects of text analysis. The objective of this
research is to address this knowledge engineering bottleneck for natural
language processing (NLP) systems. The work extends a general knowledge
acquisition framework that allows an NLP system to bootstrap its own knowledge
bases directly from text using standard inductive machine learning techniques in
conjunction with an annotated corpus and robust sentence analysis. In
particular, the framework is being extended to handle additional problems in
lexical and structural ambiguity resolution and is being evaluated using Penn
Treebank data within the context of a larger NLP task. The work is of both
theoretical and practical significance. First, the research will begin to
determine the conditions under which machine learning techniques can be expected
to offer a cost-effective approach to knowledge acquisition for NLP systems,
especially in comparison to existing statistical techniques. Second, the work
will expand the current system into an integrated tool that uses machine
learning techniques to guide NLP system development.
