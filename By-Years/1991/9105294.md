This award will provide one-half the funds needed to acquire an electron beam
microprobe that will be installed and operated in the Department of Geological
Sciences at the State University of New York in Binghamton. The University is
committed to providing the remaining funds needed for the acquisition of this
instrument. The instrument will be accessible to researchers at SUNY- Binghamton
and will also be run as a regional facility to accommodate the need for
quantitative micro-analysis by a regional group of educational institutions and
by industry in the region. Application areas at SUNY-Binghamton include earth
sciences, materials science, chemistry, physics, anthropology and engineering.
