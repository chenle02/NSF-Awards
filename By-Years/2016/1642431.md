Non-Technical: The proposed project seeks financial support for organizing a
Workshop on the issues of reproducible advanced technologies for the next
generation of nano/quantum devices. The workshop will address the current state
of the art, the roadblocks preventing a reliable and reproducible manufacturing
of nano/quantum devices. Participants will propose and prioritize realistic
research and development approaches that can lead to possible solutions. The
Workshop will be held April 27-28, 2016 at the Basic Research Innovation and
Collaboration Center (BRICC) in Arlington VA. Technical: Examples of technology
approaches and devices discussed are atomic resolution electron microscopy, GaN-
based materials and new oxides, Molecular Beam Epitaxy for current-generation
nano-quantum devices, nanoimprint-based large-area, high-throughput
nanomanufacturing, genetic code for reproducible nano/quantum devices and
reproducible 2D films. The Workshop will allow learning and understanding of the
latest advances in design, growth, fabrication, device physics related to
electronics and optoelectronics, as well as their reproducibility related
issues. The report expected from it will summarize the outcome of the
discussions.
