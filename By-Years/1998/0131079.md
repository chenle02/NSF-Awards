University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digital Government: Automated Dental
Identification&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will support the development of
tools for rapid identification of individuals based on dental records. The
technology proposed has potential for high impact in investigations, such as the
World Trade Center, where only dental records are available to aid in victim
identification. Technically, the work will involve the creation of a pilot
Digital Image Repository, include image manipulation (feature extraction, image
enhancement), high-speed databases (archiving and matching), neural nets, and
parallel computation using a network of workstations. The grantee will
collaborate in this work with the FBI.
