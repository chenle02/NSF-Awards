9409281 Bar-Yosef With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Ofer
Bar- Yosef and a large multinational group of collaborators will continue
National Science Foundation supported archaeological research at the site of
Hayonim Cave located in Israel. Hayonim contains deposits rich in lithics and
faunal remains - as well as fragmentary human skeletal material - which span the
time range of ca 160,000 - 120,000 years ago. Excavation and analysis will
proceed over a three year period with a series of related goals. Materials will
be collected for thermoluminescence and electron spin resonance dating of the
deposits. If successful this will provide absolute age estimates. Extensive
horizontal exposures will be obtained to permit recording and examination of
hearths and spatial distributions of artifacts and bones. Each of these classes
will be analyzed. Reseachers will reconstruct the lithic operational sequences
employed for tool manufacture and microwear analysis will be conducted to
determine tool function. Data from a number of sources suggest that anatomically
and behavioral modern humans first appeared in Africa perhaps 200,000 years ago
and spread sequentially to other parts of the world. The Near East, as the
gateway from Africa may provide essential data on this expansion. Work to date
indicates that for a long span of time both modern humans and earlier
"Neanderthal" forms either coexisted or alternated presence in the area. Just
when the first modern humans arrived however is unknown and Dr. Bar Yosef's
research directly examines the suspected period. Hayonim cave is worthy of
concerted research because its deposits not only cover this time range but also
contain well preserved faunal and lithic remains. This research is important for
several reasons. It will provide data of interest to a large number of
anthropologists. It will shed light on the emergence of modern humans and
increase our knowledge of a little understood period of time.
