The central goal of the project will be to develop the ergodic theory of random
transfer operators generated by random media systems. The principal questions in
ergodic theory are existence, uniqueness and attraction properties of invariant
measures for stochastic or deterministic dynamical systems. In the quenched
random media setting, invariance is naturally replaced by skew-invariance and
attraction has two natural counterparts, forward and pullback attraction. The
main question is that of the existence of a global attracting skew-invariant
positive solution for a cocycle generated by products of random linear cone-
preserving operators. Therefore, one of the key points of the project is to
develop a general analogue of the Perron--Frobenius theory for positive linear
cocycles in noncompact settings. This approach will allow the asymptotic
analysis for a wide class of infinite-dimensional stochastic systems and include
the classical ergodic theory of Markov processes as a specific case. It is most
promising in the situations where the random environment possesses certain
localization properties. It is also aimed at the infinite-dimensional situations
where the classical minorization conditions fail. Naturally, under this project
several problems tightly related to the main topic will be studied: the problems
of invariant measures for PDEs with random forcing and boundary conditions;
localization issues for random directed polymers and associated parabolic
models; universality classes for action-minimizing paths in random potential;
the questions of regularity of transfer operators for infinite-dimensional
systems and related techniques of infinite-dimensional Malliavin calculus and
non-adapted stochastic analysis.

Random media problems and ergodic theory have been intensively explored by
mathematicians and physicists for many years. In this project, these two fields
are brought together. Ergodic theory studies statistical patterns arising in
complex systems where it is hard or impossible to make exact predictions, and
only probabilistic predictions make sense in the long run. There are many
interesting and important practical situations including those from physics,
biology and economy where the dynamics is determined by the randomness present
in the environment which adds another layer of complication to the analysis. In
particular, the statistical patterns themselves become random. The main and
unifying goal of this project is to describe the random statistical patterns in
the long-term behavior of these stochastic systems and understand qualitatively
and quantitatively the mechanisms of their formation. The proposed activities
include attracting students to this area of research beginning at the
undergraduate level.
