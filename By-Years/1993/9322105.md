9322105 Shreve This REU site award supports an undergraduate applied mathematics
summer institute consisting of ten students working on open-ended problems using
numerical and analytic approaches to attack them. To assist the investigations,
the high level programming language Maple will be introduced along with rigorous
training in mathematical analysis. Problems areas include nonlinear analysis,
numerical methods in partial differential equations, free boundary problems and
random walk models of stock prices applied to securities. There will be a weekly
seminar series. The institution will provide additional funds for two more
student participants. Students will be encouraged to participate in professional
meetings, presenting the results of their work orally or in written for
publication. ***
