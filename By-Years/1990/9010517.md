This project is concerned with the design and analysis of randomized algorithms
while treating randomness as a resource. Various techniques for reducing or
eliminating the use of randomness in both parallel and sequential algorithms
will be analyzed. The approach involves constructing sample spaces of sub-
exponential size and then using efficient search techniques to reduce the number
of random bits needed to sample from this space. A complementary approach is to
study the interaction between specific pseudo-random generators and classes of
algorithms. To identify the limitations of such techniques, trade-offs between
the use of randomness and other resources such as space and time will be
studied. An important part of the project is the application of techniques to
the efficient solution of combinatorial problems which arise in fields such as
computational geometry and learning theory. The use of randomness and
probabilistic methods has led to significant theoretical developments in almost
every area of computer science. However, there are no sources of true randomness
and the cost of generating high-quality random bits is prohibitive. In this
research a methodology for reducing the dependence of algorithms on randomness
while maintaining their performance quality will be developed.
