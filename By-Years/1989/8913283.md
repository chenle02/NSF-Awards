Professor Cheuk-Yiu Ng is supported by a grant from the Experimental Physical
Program. He is studying single molecule, or ion, dissociations originating from
collisions with other similar kinds of species. These species are of a somewhat
different nature than he has studied previously and he will, therefore, also be
constructing some new equipment in order to accomplish his objectives. More
specifically, Professor Ng will be studying unimolecular decomposition,
collision-induced dissociation and reaction dynamics of internal energy selected
cluster ions such as the positive species from argon, xenon, water, ammonia and
several others as well. By measuring the kinetic energy distribution of fragment
ions absolute state to state decay rates can be inferred, thus allowing us to
gain greater insight into the bonding and energetics of cluster ions.
