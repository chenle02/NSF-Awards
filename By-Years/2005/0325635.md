Wavescalar, A New Approach to Scalable System
Design&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the center of our
modern society is the rapid growth and pervasiveness of Information Technology
(IT). This has been made possible by the exponential increase in raw silicon
fabrication capabilities enabling a rapid increase in computational power.
Recent research has shown that scaling up our current microprocessor models will
no longer convert these advances in technology to commensurate increases in
performance. WaveScalar is a new processor architecture designed to scale into
the next decade and beyond. It is designed to directly confront the emerging
problems of wire delay by transforming the large slow broadcast networks of a
superscalar into short fast point-to-point links. It is constructed from a grid
of simple-to-design uniform processing nodes whose complexity is three orders of
magnitude less than current processor designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research
undertaken from this proposal will tie together the architecture, compiler, and
operating system foundations of this new microprocessor model. The architecture
research includes a detailed design of the architecture of the WaveScalar
system, including investigation of node design, instruction placement, and
system interconnects. The compiler research includes developing new optimization
techniques specific to WaveScalar and assisting the microarchitecture through
compiler support. The operating system component includes a study of basic
primitives of operating systems in this new computing platform including
mechanisms for application specific memory management and context switching.
Finally, WaveScalar is a low-complexity, highly threaded architecture and as
such may be well suited for nanotechnologies. A detailed investigation of the
WaveScalar architecture for these emerging technologies will be
undertaken.&lt;br/&gt;
