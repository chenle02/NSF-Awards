9555737 Beal Mathematics is required for work in most sciences, yet many girls
lose confidence in their ability to do math and take the course requirements,
thus ensuring that women will be underrepresented in science. Prior research
indicates that a critical factor contributing to girls' declining self
confidence in their math competence is the type of instruction and performance
feedback typically provided by classroom teachers. The goal of this project is
to utilize the power of intelligent computer based tutoring systems to enhance
the confidence, motivation, and skill mastery of female students in elementary
grades 3 - 5. We will apply intervention before late elementary school, the
point at which gender differences in attitudes towards math become apparent. The
intelligent computer tutor is designed on the basis of research indicating that
female students benefit from and appreciate pedagogy that reflects a)
exploration rather than competition; b) an interface and environment that
includes females (versus software based on male students' interests); c) the
provision of confidence enhancing feedback that sets high expectations, provides
specific information about how to overcome errors, and emphasizes appropriate
effort rather than native ability as key to math success.
