This is a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award, which investigates
the mechanisms of nanocrystal assembly into electronic devices and the basic
mechanisms of charge transport in them. The research will focus on the effects
of Coulomb interactions, electron tunneling, and charge fluctuations. The model
systems to be studied include well-defined configurations of nanocrystals in one
and two-dimensional arrays. A range of tools will be used to study these
systems, such as low-noise electrical measurements, charge imaging, and atomic-
force microscopy. The project will provide excellent training for postdoctoral
researchers, graduate and undergraduate students in device fabrication and
measurements of nanostructures. As part of the proposed research, high-school
students will be involved during the summer and will assist graduate students in
the proposed experiments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the electronic circuits are
shrinking in size, the electronic industry will soon reach the nanometer size
scales, where quantum effects dominate the electronic transport. At these small
scales when electrons are confined into small regions, interesting new effects
occur due to the fact that electronic charges and spins are quantized. The
proposed research will focus on measurements of nanocrystals. Nanocrystals are
nanometer-scale crystals that exhibit properties of both atoms and large
crystals, and are already leading to new applications from electronics to
biology and medicine. The proposed work will develop ways for controlled
nanocrystal assembly into electronic devices, and will investigate the basic
mechanisms of electronic transport through nanocrystal structures. This program
is an excellent opportunity for undergraduate and graduate students to learn
about device fabrication and electrical measurements. In addition, the female PI
will be involved in a range of outreach activities, such as high-school outreach
with the local Philadelphia schools, and the Women Interested in Studying
Physics (WISP) group at the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;br/&gt;
