Masonry construction comprises a large portion of building construction in the
U.S. and the world. Reinforced masonry construction use is increasing in
moderate to higher seismic zones because of its apparent features of economy,
fire safety, architectural flexibility, and ease of construction. The present
state of masonry structural analysis and design and materials and construction
technologies does not enable an accurate prediction of building behavior under
lateral loads such as seismic loads. This research project will coordinate the
U.S.-Japan Coordinated Program for Masonry Building Research. The U.S. side of
the program consists of over 20 separate research tasks that must be coordinated
to attain the program goals. Among the activities that will be performed are
organizing and conducting meetings with the task researchers, monitoring program
progress, expediting data exchange between researchers, interfacing with the
masonry industry to arrange for materials and establish researcher-user group
communication, and interfacing with the UJNR panel and the Japanese research
program.
