The overall objective of this CAREER proposal is to integrate beam physics
research at Cornell University's Laboratory of Elementary Particle Physics
(LEPP) with undergraduate research, education, and outreach in the Physics
Department at Alfred University. The research objective is to expand our
knowledge of the interrelationship between accelerator beam dynamics and the
performance of storage rings, specifically the Cornell Electron-Positron Storage
Ring (CESR). This novel approach to accelerator research will encompass remote
operation of sophisticated beam diagnostic equipment to measure the beam
dynamics and correlate with important accelerator parameters.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the outreach and educational components
of this project are to: i) provide undergraduate students with the opportunity
to work on a research project at a large user facility with sophisticated state-
of-the-art equipment that will provide them with valuable research skills in
experimental physics and reinforce their knowledge of classical and modern
physics; ii) develop a laboratory for light optics and fast imaging systems
whose equipment can be used at Cornell, Alfred or potentially at other
universities; and iii) provide a location for high school students to learn
about accelerators as an outreach to the local community and a recruiting tool
for prospective physics majors at Alfred University.
