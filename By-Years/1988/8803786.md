In this proposal for joint research with Harvard University we request funding
for the continuation of global and regional studies of earthquake source
mechanisms using waveform inversion. The research will cover the following
topics. 1. Continuation of the centroid-moment-tensor (CMT) analysis of current
events. 2. Utilization of the data from the High-Gain Long-Period (HGLP) network
which operated between 1972 and 1976. 3. CMT and very broad band analysis of the
HGLP data for selected events between 1972 and 1976. This period is
characterized by many large earthquakes lacking, so far, proper analysis. 4.
Systematic search for earthquakes with a statistically significant non-double
couple component. Two events near Torishima Island, Japan, and three events on
Iceland have mechanisms that appear to be consistent with magma injection. 5.
Global synthesis. Compilation of a catalog CMT solution in a volume which would
include discussion of the seismicity on a region by region basis. 6. Quasi-real
time source studies. The objective is to produce reliable source mechanisms one
to two hours after the occurrence of the event. 7. Analysis of spatio-temporal
distribution of earthquakes and its relation to tectonic processes.
