Scanning tunneling microscopy will be used to study how low coverages of
chemically active surface modifiers, to include sulfur, oxygen, and phosphorous,
affect the adsorption and dissociation of small molecules of catalytic interest,
such as carbon monoxide, methane, and methanol, on transition metal surfaces,
such as molybdenum (100), tungsten (100), and nickel (100). STM will be used to
image molecules and impurities, and to probe local variations in atomic
geometry, electron structure, and work function. The goal is to control
electronic structure modification, and the ability to tune chemical reactivity.
