This project concerns the investigation of connections between algebra,
algebraic geometry, and topology. Algebraic geometry studies properties of
geometric objects that are invariant under transformations given by polynomial
functions, while topology studies properties invariant under smooth, continuous
deformations. The goal is to gain a better understanding of the way that
structures in algebraic geometry are reflected by structures in topology, using
a blend of algebraic and topological methods. The investigator aims to settle
several important longstanding conjectures in this area.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One part of the project is to find a cleaner proof of the
recently-verified Bloch-Kato conjecture. A related part of the project is to
understand how Voevodsky's slice filtration is related to algebraic cobordism
and other motivic spectra and to verify several of the slice conjectures. The
investigator will also study the relationship between the singularities of a
variety, its K-theory, and its cdh-cohomology, using recently-developed
cohomological techniques. Another part of this project is to relate the
algebraic Witt group of a real surface to a recently-developed topological
invariant, one that is easier to compute.
