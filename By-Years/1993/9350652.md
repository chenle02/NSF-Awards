9350652 Brletic The project will purchase a Fourier transform infrared
spectrophotometer (FT-IR), spectral libraries, temperature- controlled IR cells
and various reflectance accessories to be used in five upper-level chemistry
courses (Instrumental Analysis, Physical, Polymer, Advanced Organic, and
Advanced Inorganic Chemistry) along with Independent Study Projects. The FT-IR
and accessories will provide students with tools for the cutting edge studies in
vibrational analysis. The underlying theory of infrared (IR) analysis will be
introduced at the freshman chemistry level and "hands-on" experience provided at
the second year level. This project will allow for: improved experiments dealing
with qualitative and quantitative analysis; new projects dealing with the
application of normal coordinate calculations and partition functions to gas-
phase spectra; and new experiments involving samples (aqueous solutions,
polymers, emulsions and coatings) studied by reflectance. ***
