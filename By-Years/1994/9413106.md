With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program Professor Novak of the University
of Massachusetts will design, prepare, and study the use of organometallic
catalysts for the "living" polymerization of isocyanides and other unsaturated
monomers. The reactivity and applicability of new Ni(I), Ni(II), Ni(III), and
Pd(II) catalysts will be exploited in order to synthesize novel di- and tri-
block copolymers for application as thermoplastic elastomers. The premise to be
tested is that the reactivity of polymer endgroups can be altered in predictable
fashion to produce unique substances. This research will use new catalysts to
prepare new carbon containing polymers that incorporate other elements into the
polymer skeleton. New thermoplastic polymers will be prepared whose properties
may prove superior in the manufacture of vehicles, consumer products such as
furniture, and novel materials to be used in areas of advanced technology.
