Plant wide optimization and integrated process plants are goals that industry is
planning to implement in the near future. Optimal process operation, which can
decrease costs and increase yields, is potentially attainable with current
computer technology. In this project the PI plans to study on-line optimization
and control strategies for complex or integrated process units using dynamic
process models. The use of dynamic process models ensures the utilization of
current transient measurements as well as an optimum path to the steady state
optimum through the feasible region. The final product will be techniques to
accommodate medium term disturbances that affect the process and the derivation
of the necessary changes to the set points to keep the unit or plant at optimum
performance. The specific approach to be used is to decompose the problem into
two phases: an identification phase (reconciliation of the process model with
all available process measurements of the recent past) and an optimization phase
(using the updated model to calculate the trajectory of manipulated inputs which
will maximize the objective function).
