The objective of this project is to study transformation-induced plasticity
(TRIP) and develop constitutive laws for the fracture of steels. The research
will verify the constitutive relationships for multiaxial states of stresses and
evaluate the toughness enhancement in a solid with a macroscopic crack as a
result of the phase transformation. The results of this study will have a good
potential to extend the concepts developed in the transformation toughening in
ceramics to metals and improve the fundamental understanding of elastic-plastic
fracture mechanics of metals.
