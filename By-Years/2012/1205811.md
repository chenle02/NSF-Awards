Research at the Intensity Frontier builds upon the development of High Intensity
Accelerators and Storage Rings. With the increase in circulating beam currents,
particularly for positively charged beams, various effects such as the rise of
electron clouds become increasingly challenging. For example, the beam intensity
in the Fermilab Main Injector is predicted to increase approximately four-fold
for the Project-X upgrade, and electron cloud formation is expected to be a
problem. The IIT group intends to measure in detail electron cloud formation in
the presence of different materials and under varying beam conditions. The
program of effort will involve design work to evolve the performance and variety
of electron cloud measurement techniques, as well as to validate or improve
electron cloud models used in numerical simulations by the scientific community.
The research will be performed collaboratively with experts at Fermilab and at
Argonne National Laboratory. Through this program, IIT is building a nascent
graduate program in accelerator physics and materials research to support future
accelerator development, with students involved in all aspects of the research,
from hardware to modeling to numerical simulations.
