&lt;br/&gt;The NSDL is intended to serve learners in both collaborative and
individual settings, as well as formal and informal modes. If one carefully
studies learning in school, workplace and home, one finds that most learning is
a subtle mix of collaborative and individual effort. Unfortunately, to date
digital library services focus almost exclusively on the needs of individual
users. Support for collaboration has been largely limited to mechanisms for
anonymous, asynchronous collaboration within the whole user community, where
results obtained by individuals may be fed back into metadata for future use by
all. Little support has been developed for direct collaborative use of digital
libraries by small groups of people working together. The adaptation of
groupware components from current CSCW and CSCL systems makes it feasible to
develop collaborative learning environments as digital library services,
significantly increasing the potential impact, efficiency and value of digital
libraries. This Project provides a model and test case of such an approach
within the successful Math Forum Digital Library (MFDL). The MFDL now aims to
extend the appeal and mathematical depth of the Problem of the Week by bringing
students together in small, online groups for asynchronous and synchronous
collaborative learning at a distance. The four project goals for advancing
collaborative services in the NSDL are the following:&lt;br/&gt;1. To better
understand the computer support needs of small groups collaborating in a digital
library.&lt;br/&gt;2. To design a collaborative learning environment within a
digital library.&lt;br/&gt;3. To evaluate the use of a collaborative learning
environment within a digital library.&lt;br/&gt;4. To incorporate a
collaborative learning environment within a digital library as a sustainable
service.&lt;br/&gt;
