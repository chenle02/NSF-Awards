Large space structures will become very important in the future of manned and
unmanned space flight. Types of large space structures include frameworks of
solar panels, space stations, and probably the manned interplanetary spacecraft.
%%% The purpose of the proposed research is to study the different forces (e.g
gravitational) and stresses (e.g thermal, vibrational) exerted on these large
space structures. One goal of this project is to develop three-dimensional
computer simulations of forces and stresses acting on a frame. Also, it is
planned to create scale models to determine the maximum load the frames can
withstand for a particular set of material.
