9321548 BUSS The webs woven by orb-web spiders can be viewed as silken lines
that record a series of spider movements. Thus webs, which persist, have been a
classic system for studies of behavior and the inheritance of particular
patterns of web weaving. However, a controversy still exists about whether all
the orb-weavers are related in a single lineage or whether there are two
lineages exhibiting this basic behavior with numerous modifications and losses
within each. This project will use DNA sequencing to address the relationships
of orb-web spiders that have previously been based solely on morphological and
behavioral evidence. The resulting molecular based phylogeny or pattern of
relationships can then be used to test hypotheses concerning the origin and
diversification of web design. %%% Knowledge of spider relationships may be
clarified by this project. This information can be of value in conservation of
biodiversity as well as in designing programs for natural control of pest
insects with diminished use of pesticides. ***
