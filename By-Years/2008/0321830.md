The overall theme of this project is to explore the deep connections between
convex geometry and combinatorial lattice theory, and to pursue applications in
each direction. From the geometric viewpoint, this project will focus particular
attention on the structure of convex bodies, star-shaped sets, mixed volumes,
and dual mixed volumes, with a goal of characterizing valuations and set
functions that are invariant under various group actions and applying these
results to problems in geometric probability, convex geometry, geometric
tomography, and analysis on Grassmannians. This project will also pursue an
investigation of the many deep and previously unexploited connections between
convex geometry and algebraic combinatorial theory, with the particular end of
the development of a combinatorial theory of invariant valuations and kinematic
formulas on finite lattices, (where the invariance is with respect to the action
of an automorphism group). A central goal of this investigation is the
development and application of combinatorial analogues to Hadwiger's
characterization theorem for invariant valuations and to classical kinematic
formulas in the context of partially ordered sets, with a special focus on the
combinatorial structures that arise in convex geometry. Convex geometry and the
theory of valuations treat the fundamental question of how to measure (or in the
case of finite features, to enumerate) and ultimately to characterize intrinsic
features of geometric objects. Examples include the reconstruction of
information about a geometric object from limited data, such as information
about projections and shadows (stereology) or slices and cross-sections
(tomography). These techniques lead in turn to many applications, such as those
in biotechnology (such as molecular biology), economics and finance (analysis of
efficient and equitable distributions of limited resources over a population),
and computer graphics (the visual display of information).
