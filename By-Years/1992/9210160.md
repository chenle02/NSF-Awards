The purpose of this research is to analyze the cyclical behavior of small versus
large firms, and to understand the differential response of the two kinds of
firms with respect to monetary policy. The long run objective is to assess the
importance of recent theories which emphasize the role of credit market
imperfections in the propagation of business cycles and in the monetary
transmission mechanism. The focus on cross-sectional differences in firm
behavior at different stages of the business cycle exploits that idea that small
firms are more likely than large firms to face problems getting credit. The
empirical work centers on examining panel data on real and financial firm
variables provided by the Census Bureau. Data is available for firms in the
manufacturing, wholesale trade, retail trade, and mining sectors. An important
difference with existing panel studies of firm behavior is that the sample
distribution of firms is highly representative of the true firm population
within each sector. In particular, small firms are more accurately represented.
The representative nature of these data will facilitate drawing inferences about
the relevance of the results for macroeconomic behavior. An objective is to
quantify the impact firms facing financial constraints have on the aggregate
volatility of output, inventories, and investment. This research is important
because it will provide a better understanding of the interaction of small firm
behavior and the business cycle.
