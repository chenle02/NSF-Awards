This proposal requests support for event trigger development and electronics
acquisition for the D0 experiment at Fermilab. This project will allow the
detector to be effective when exposed, the higher beam intensities are
participating in this effort. New real time triggers to handle higher rates are
essential, and will involve novel combinations of serial and parallel processors
to do the job.
