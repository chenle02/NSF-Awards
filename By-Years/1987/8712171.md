The PI plans to build and test a novel chemical vagor deposition (CVD) reactor
consisting of five parts in a rectangular cell. The proposed reactor is totally
different from those presently in commerical use. By operating the reactor at a
low pressure a stagnant fluid medium of constant temperature will be provided
for film deposition in the absence of buoyancy-driven free convection. The
supply of source gas for the deposition will be by diffusion rather than forced
convection or flowing fluid. Experimental work will be done first to see if the
reactor is viable. Then, based on this prototype the governing design equations
will be tested over wide ranges of operating conditions and modified to
establish a reliable set of design relationships. Once the concept and design of
the novel reactor are demonstrated on the basis of silicon epitaxy and
polysilicon deposition, the use of the reactor for superlattice film growth will
be tried. Superlattice structures with very sharp interfaces between alternating
layers will be grown by using two of the reactors side by side with the
deposition zones interconnected by a corridor.
