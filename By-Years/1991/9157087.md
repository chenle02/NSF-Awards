Supercritical fluids (SCF) have become increasingly popular, especially as
extraction solvents. Already, General Foods uses SCF carbon dioxide to extract
caffeine from coffee beans and the EPA is experimenting with the use of SCF's to
clean up contaminated GAC, soils and sludges. Basic understanding of the
thermodynamics of SCF's is, however, still lacking so that these important
processes continue to be designed at least somewhat empirically. The most
striking contribution from my prior research is the development of a
spectroscopic technique that showed greatly enriched local densities of SCF
solvents around solutes when operating in the region near the critical point.
This was the first evidence of its kind to support the idea that "clustering"
occurs in SCF's even when both the solvent and the solute are nonpolar. The PI
believes that this clustering and other specific chemical interactions are the
main components missing in traditional equation of state models that,
unfortunately, are not able to accurately predict SCF phase behavior.
