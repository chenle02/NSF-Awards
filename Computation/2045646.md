Rational functions are a mainstay of computational mathematics, and due to
several recent breakthroughs, they are now ready to go from a specialized field
to a central computational mathematics tool. The project has two main aims: (1)
Providing new feature detection tools in signal processing that are useful in
classification tasks, including arrhythmia and seizure detection from ECG
signals and (2) Using rational neural networks to get unprecedentedly accurate
partial differential equation discovery, leading to new models of complex
fluids. It is possible that rational-based superresolution in signal processing
for ECG signals is an idea that could be as revolutionary as compressed sensing
for MRI imaging. Developing new models from experimental data will contribute to
the heated debate on how active fluids are modeled, potentially leading to
biological turbines. An educational component of the project includes a novel
undergraduate curriculum design; outreach to the local high schools; writing a
textbook, and creating online YouTube lecture courses. Training of graduate
students will be integrated in the project.

In the first part of this project, the PI will develop data-driven algorithms
for signal processing, including tools for filtering, feature detection, and
superresolution. The PI will tackle open problems related to understanding the
convergence behavior of these adaptive algorithms with consequences in model
reduction and nonlinear eigensolvers. In the second part of the project, the PI
will use rational neural networks in deep learning to develop an approach that
rigorously discovers Green's function associated with elliptic partial
differential equations from data. This will be a step towards gaining
mechanistic understanding from experimental data in active fluids and advection-
dominated flows.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
