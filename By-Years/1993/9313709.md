Investigators at the Polar Science Center of the University of Washington will
purchase a quantity of Submarine Ship launch eXpendable CTDs (SSXCTD) and
fabricate a boom for deploying other scientific instruments from a U.S. Navy
submarine. The Navy is providing the civilian academic ocean science community
with a unique, first-time opportunity to make scientific measurements under the
ice in the Arctic Ocean from a nuclear powered submarine. This cruise is
scheduled for the late summer and is a prototype for potential future submarine
science cruises. SSXCTDs are submarine- launched counterparts to XCTDs that are
deployed from research vessels. These free-falling probes measure seawater
temperature and conductivity as a function of depth. Use of SSXCTDs are crucial
to the planned physical oceanography program on the submarine. Making ocean
science measurements, especially under the ice cap, from an operational
submarine has long been of interest to civilian investigators. This summer's
cruise represents an opportunity to test the feasibility of using operational
submarines for basic scientific research.
