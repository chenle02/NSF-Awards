The research covers topics in the geometry and analysis of planar domains and
conformal mappings in complex function theory. The relationship between
conformal mappings and circle packing immersions will be pursued. The research
has possible applications to complex dynamical systems and fractals. Since the
the circle packing problems involve the geometry of configurative systems, the
research may also have possible applications to the initiatives of manufacturing
and materials research. Schramm's presence at the institution will benefit the
current activities of the resident group and their graduate students. ***
