The 40Ar/39Ar Laser Probe is an increasingly accessible tool that has great
promise for studying the stratigraphic record of tectonic events. This project
will attempt to resolve several tectonic issues concerning the provenance of
Eocene basins in northern California and Oregon by dating individual detrital
grains of biotite, while mica, and hornblende by 40Ar/39Ar Laser Probe
techniques. These include the uplift history of the source terrains, whether or
not the klamath Mountains was uplifted during the Eocene and whether tectonic
rotation was a major factor during the Eocene. The results of the study will
also provide a test and practical demonstration of this provenance technique.
