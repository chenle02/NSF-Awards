At the nano-mechanical scale, heat conduction processes exhibit a wide variety
of phenomena that are different from macroscopic observations. Conventional
models, such as the Fourier's law, are inadequate. In addition, there are
overwhelming observations that suggest that heat conduction properties depend
critically on the system size and geometry, creating a unique challenge for the
portability of the mathematical models. This project aims to bridge the modeling
gap by developing a first-principle based approach that leads to a hierarchy of
generalized models. The new models have the potential capabilities to describe
various important behavior of heat conduction processes, including the wave
propagation characteristic, fluctuation, delay, and more.

The proposed approach will derive new constitutive models from first-principle,
and mathematically, the models are obtained from a microscopic many-particle
description with three levels of reductions: A spatial reduction that eliminates
atomic-level details and singles out the dynamics of the average energy, a
temporal reduction that removes the nonlocality in time, and a statistical
reduction that efficiently samples scale-dependent, statistical noises. Such a
first-principle based approach derives its benefit from its combination of
mathematical transparency, robustness, and amenability to error estimates.
Unlike conventional theories, the current approach yields a stochastic
constitutive model. Combined with energy balance, the constitutive models lead
to stochastic partial differential equations, for which there is a wealth of
interesting mathematical and computational issues.
