This project supports participation in the thirty-fifth annual meeting of the
Southeastern Atlantic Regional Conference on Differential Equations (SEARCDE),
on October 10-11, 2015, at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. The
conference began in 1981 and has met annually since then, with the venue
rotating among research institutions in the Southeast. The conference continues
SEARCDE's tradition as a forum for discussion and exchange of research ideas and
recent developments in both theoretical and applied differential equations. In
addition to four invited plenary lectures by leading international scholars in
differential equations, there are twenty-minute contributed talks given in
parallel sessions. All participants have the opportunity to present their work
in these contributed talks, which are organized so that talks by established and
senior researchers are interspersed with talks by beginning researchers.
Information about the conference can be found at the website,
http://www.uncg.edu/mat/searcdeconf/2015 .

The principal objective of the SEARCDE conference is to promote research and
education in the field of differential equations by bringing together
established and beginning researchers to exchange ideas and discuss recent
developments. The conference tradition fosters an atmosphere conducive to
networking and the creation of new research collaborations. SEARCDE especially
encourages the participation of beginning researchers, who get the opportunity
to meet and hear renowned plenary speakers and senior researchers from the
region. For over three decades SEARCDE has been the setting for many graduate
students to deliver their first conference lectures. For others it has been
their first opportunity to discuss their research with senior research faculty
outside their graduate institution. Many researchers continue to participate
regularly in the SEARCDE conference throughout their careers. The conference
series provides important opportunities for young researchers, especially those
from underrepresented groups.
