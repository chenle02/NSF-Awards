Over five decades the large scale properties of the solar wind have been
described. These observations have shown that the solar wind flow is turbulent.
This research project will refine the description of the solar wind by
separating the ordered and disordered structures in the solar wind. The proposal
posits that hypothesis that space weather is strongly influenced by the
cumulative effects of many small disturbances. The researchers are interested in
learning if the properties of the turbulent flows in the solar wind are biased
by the presence of small scale "fossil" structures whose source is the Sun. The
team has proposed to develop and use a series of analysis techniques not
currently used in space physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will support
graduate students including training them to use the new techniques. The
characterization of the solar wind will be useful for others in studying space
weather at Earth.
