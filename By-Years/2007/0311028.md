Chemistry (12) This project is integrating plasma emission spectrometry (PES)
into undergraduate analytical and environmental courses. Experiments are being
adapted from previous NSF funded projects to be included in analytical courses
for life sciences majors. The modifications of current experiments found in the
Journal of Chemical Education are also being integrated into a problem based
learning instrumental analysis laboratory, a new course in environmental
chemistry, and undergraduate research. The equipment is being used as part of an
on-going outreach project to chemistry high school students.
