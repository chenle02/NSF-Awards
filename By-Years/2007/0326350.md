STAPL (the Standard Template Adaptive Parallel Library) is a library of ISO
Standard C++ components with interfaces similar to the (sequential) ISO C++
standard library, and encouraging results have been obtained with a shared
memory prototype. This project will extend this library significantly in the
range of systems it can support (notably systems without shared memory), the
range of optimization performed, and the degree to which a program is
automaticall y adapted to its run-time environment and workload. The project
will extend the STAPL library, redesign the STAPL run-time system, and build a
compiler to allow high-level (source-level) optimizations and to generate
information and code needed by the run-time system for adaptive algorithms and
lower-level optimizations. Thus, STAPL will be a framework for highly-
optimizable, adaptable, and portable parallel computations. In addition to the
usual vector-based operations, it will support parallel use of less regular
structures (such as lists and sparse matrices) and ease the evolution of
programs from a serial to a parallel environment. Importantly, this will be done
in ways that take advantage of the huge investment in mainstream programming
environments and tools and make STAPL's parallel computation facilities
accessible to mainstream programmers.&lt;br/&gt;
