BEST (Basic Engineering Software for Teaching) Dynamics, the work of faculty and
students of the Basic Engineering department of the University of Missouri--
Rolla, began in 1992. The work has been favorably received by our students and
by engineering educators. Because of the project's success, UM-Rolla has
continued to support the work, and recently, the BEST project was awarded
funding by the University of Missouri's Institute for Instructional Development
(IID). The project's goals are fourfold: (1) To promote visualization of
dynamics problems; (2) To promote students' problem-solving skills; (3) To
cultivate in students 'expert knowledge,' that is, an appreciation for and a
reliance upon the foundational, unifying concepts of engineering dynamics, and
to be able to apply these with confidence to virtually any problem; (4) To
create a revolutionary teaching/learning product that, instead of being a
classroom supplement, will be a catalyst for change, shifting classes from a
teachercentered lecture format to a student- and team-centered discovery format.
The most distinctive feature of the proposed work is its scope. Not just an add-
on to an existing class reinforcing only a topic or two, this project will
produce a CD containing essentially an entire engineering dynamics course. It
will contain essential theory, including short video segments on key topics;
sixty interesting, creative problems with variable input parameters; step-by-
step problem solution procedures with the exact equations and numbers from
specific student-created cases; guided tours of interesting cases; and
assessment quizzes on both theory and problem- solving, all with an easy to use,
intuitive interface. Because dynamics is a difficult-to-learn class taken by
nearly all engineering students, the impact of this project is expected to be
widespread.
