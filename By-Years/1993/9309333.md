9309333 Rothkopf Standard models of auctions need enrichment in order to be
applied in realistic contexts. Many common but neglected factors invalidate
prescriptions of auction theory and alter the evaluation of the economic
performance of auction markets. This research augments bidding theory in some
realistic directions and explicates the divergence between theoretical
predictions and long-standing practices in many auction markets. One thrust of
the research will examine information transmission from bidders to auctioneer
during the course of an English auction, and how the extent of the interception
of this information by rival bidders affects strategies and equilibrium
outcomes. A second effort will incorporate explicitly several realistic aspects
of cheating and rule bending in auction models. A third effort introduces
serious study of the incentives in franchise bidding for management of natural
resources. The sum of these efforts is intended to play a key role in enhancing
the understanding of actual choices under market exchange rules and bidding
strategies. ***
