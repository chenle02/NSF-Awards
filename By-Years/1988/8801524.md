This three-day conference highlights the connections between analysis and
geometry and will be of interest to those analysts and topologists whose work
exploits such connections. Alan Beardon is the main speaker, with D. Hamilton,
D. Minda, and B. Osgood invited speakers. There is participant support
available, including support for students. This conference is the 1988 version
of the John H. Barrett Memorial Lectures, which have been an annual affair since
1972.
