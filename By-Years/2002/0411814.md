The purpose of our exploratory research is to expand the study of science
inquiry by investigating the potential of immersive simulations. In immersive
simulations, such as the case of a disease outbreak, participants not only act
out roles in a simulation, but through virtual selves, or avatars, are directly
impacted by the simulation. For immersive simulations to be an effective
learning experience, students' inquiry into the simulation needs to be
scaffolded. This study uses a large stratified random sample of about 800
Whyville users accounting for age, gender and level of involvement; and it
develops and refines online tools to support the collaborative investigation of
disease simulations and the development of explanations. The study will examine:
(1) the educational impact of immersive science simulations, (2) the adoption of
established web-based inquiry tools developed in the education community for
multi-user online environments; and (3) the nature of online and offline support
structures for science inquiry in settings such as classrooms, after school
programs, and homes which provide access to places like Whyville.
