Intellectual merit. A comprehensive uranium-series (U-series) isotope study is
proposed to understand the origins of young (&lt;10,000 years, or, 10 kyr)
continental lavas from East Asia. Widely dispersed intraplate volcanism in East
Asia is distinct from large-volume basaltic eruptions at Large Igneous Provinces
by virtue of its greater compositional diversity, lower rate of melt production,
and lack of evidence for deep mantle plumes. Preliminary U-Th disequilibrium
data of the young lavas from East Asia suggest that the young lavas from East
China display significant 230Th excesses whereas the young lavas from SE Tibet
show strong 238U excesses. We propose to analyze U-Th disequilibrium in
additional samples to test the generality of these results. U-Pa and Th-Ra
disequilibria, together with Nd, Sr and Pb isotopic compositions and trace
element concentrations, will also be measured. Modelling of these data will help
constrain process of melt generation and transportation. The proposed research
addresses fundamental questions concerning the mechanisms of melt generation
below continents in diffuse igneous provinces, and specifically the relative
roles of lithosphere and asthenosphere mantle sources in the context of active
geodynamic settings in East China and SE Tibet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
impacts. These include collaborations between UCLA, WHOI, and Chinese Bureau of
Seismology. Secondly, this project will support the research of an early-career
principal investigator, and would foster the educational development of one or
two UCLA undergraduates. Third, quantitative geochemical models developed from
the project are going to be available to the community of petrology and
geochemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
