This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With support from the Chemistry
Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Multiuser program (CRIF:MU), the
Department of Chemistry at Louisiana State University will acquire a Circular
Dichroism spectrometer system. The spectrometer will be housed in the LSU
protein facility and will be used by faculty at LSU and regional institutions to
characterize protein structure. Some of the studies to be carried out include:
(1) protein folding of DNA polymerases; (2) the study of peptides and proteins
for inhibition of protein-protein interactions; (3) the synthesis and
characterization of complex peptides containing post-translationally modified
amino acids; (4) biophysical and structural investigations of glycoproteins; (5)
designed peptides for biology and biomaterials; and (6) the crystallographic
analysis of inhibitors bound to acetyl-CoA carboxylase.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Circular Dichroism spectrometers, like the one purchased
under this award, allow chemists to probe the secondary and higher structures in
large biomolecules. Insight into the structure of these complex molecules helps
scientists to understand the way that these molecules function in living
systems, including humans. Besides the broader scientific impact of the science
enabled by this equipment, the spectrometer will be used to train a very diverse
group of young scientists at Louisiana State University.
