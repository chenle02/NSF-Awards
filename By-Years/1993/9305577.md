The focus of this research is the investigation of the chemical and biochemical
basis for methylation of bacteriochlorophyll-c and -d pigments which enables the
pigments to adapt to low light conditions. The biosynthesis of the two pigments
will also be explored to determine the branch point from chlorophyll-a
biosynthesis. A chemical synthesis of chlorophyll-a and its 4-vinyl analog, the
conversion of the former into the latter, and a biomimetic ring-cleavage of
chlorophyll derivatives to enable the synthesis of photochemically active bilins
will be carried out. Chiral chlorophyll derivatives will facilitate synthesis of
chiral N-alkylporphyrin ferrochelatase inhibitors and the synthesis of a number
of porphyrin derivatives will be attempted. %%% With this Accomplishment Based
Renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr.
Kevin M. Smith of the Department of Chemistry at the University of California,
Davis. Professor Smith will focus his work on a broad-based study of synthesis,
biosynthesis, chemistry and spectroscopy of chlorophylls and
bacteriochlorophylls. Chlorophylls are the catalysts in the vital process of
photosynthesis, and are involved in light gathering and the process of charge
separation.
