This project addresses the uplift of the central Alaska Range using apatite
fission track analysis. The sampling strategy is to collect one vertical
profile, over 4000m in extent off the McKinley massif, as well as samples on a
north-south traverse across the width of the central Alaska Range, placing
particular emphasis on sampling across the McKinley segment of the Denali fault
system that bounds the central Alaska Range to the north. Apatite will be
separated and processed for counting by the external detector method in the
fission track dating laboratory at Arizona State University. Track length
studies will also be performed. The project will determine the time of
initiation of uplift, uplift rates, and whether more than one period of uplift
has occurred. The central Alaska Range lies at the apex of a mega-arc that
stretches across Alaska and British Columbia. It lies south of the Denali fault
system where estimates of vertical offset remain unconstrained. A sampling
transect across this fault system will determine vertical offsets across the
various strands and will place the uplift history of the central Alaska Range in
context with the tectonic development of southern Alaska.
