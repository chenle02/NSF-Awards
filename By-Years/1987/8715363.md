This research is armed at fundamental understanding of identification methods
for high impedance and arcing faults on distribution feeders. The intent of the
research is to fully understand and characterize the nature of these faults and
to explore new detection techniques using advanced concepts of signal processing
and pattern recognition such as spectral analysis, signal detection and
signature classification. It is expected that the use of these concepts with
knowledge based systems and parallel processing hardware can result in the
detection and classification of faults which are currently undetectable.
