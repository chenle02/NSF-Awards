Water shortages in California, Arizona, and Nevada will impact crop yield and
agriculture in the region for years to come. By further advancing farming
innovations in Yuma, Arizona along the Colorado River, the prospects of
sustainable growth, improved research potential, and new infrastructure
collaborations benefit STEM programs, industry, and the community. Yuma is
Arizona’s Salad Bowl. The continued introduction of specialized networking and
collaborations with higher education and K-12 institutions in the area improves
the opportunity to plan and implement broadband and networking aligned with the
science of agriculture. The use of technology to improve crop yields, or
precision agriculture, is a required step forward in the deployment of
cyberinfrastructure in rural communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planning
effort to improve networking, connect science-oriented programs, and experiment
with homework gap services is led by Sun Corridor Network in collaboration with
Yuma’s agricultural research community, community college service and
agricultural programs, Yuma’s largest elementary and high school programs, the
University of Arizona’s experimental farms and regional academic organization,
and the desert agricultural research organization. The Yuma collaboration
planning activities will improve community-based cyberinfrastructure models,
inform the next generation of agricultural infrastructure, and bridge science,
engineering, and technology programs by addressing the complex needs of the
business and science of agriculture. The Yuma Collaboration introduces broadband
and infrastructure planning in support of precision agriculture during a period
of extreme drought and the impacts of water shortages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
