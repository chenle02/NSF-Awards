This award supports a research training group at the University of Georgia in
the areas of Algebra, Algebraic Geometry, and Number Theory. Many aspects of the
program that have been planned by the University of Georgia Algebra and Number
Theory research group will be suitable for and open to all undergraduate and
graduate students in the department. Thus these activities will have a broad
impact on the life of the department. The training proposed will run year-round.
Keeping the undergraduate, graduate students, and postdocs engaged continuously
will help with retention, shorten the time to degree, and boost
productivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Algebra, Algebraic Geometry, and Number
Theory group at the University of Georgia proposes a comprehensive program
designed to recruit, engage, and train students and postdoctoral associates, and
to prepare them for successful careers in the mathematical sciences. The First
Year Undergraduate Seminars will draw UGA students into careers in the
mathematical sciences. The Graduate Student Boot Camp will ensure success for
graduate students in the program. Vertical Research Training Groups (VRTG) will
give students and postdocs the chance to engage early in collaborative research
projects. The computational VRTG will provide online tools for computations in
the three research fields. The Oberseminar will act as educational training tool
for graduate students, catalyst for intra-area discussion, and community builder
for the group.
