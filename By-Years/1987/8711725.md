The stability of recombinant DNA (plasmid) in bacteria used for commercial scale
fermentations is of great concern. Bacillus subtilis is a potentially useful
microorganism for the production of recombinant DNA products. However,
instability of plasmids in B. subtilis has limited its usefulness as an
industrial cloning host. The overall objective of this study is to analyze
genetic, nutritional and environmental factors that affect the stability of
recombinant DNA in B. subtilis. The PIs propose to quantitate the parameters
that govern the kinetics of plasmid loss, i.e., to measure - The frequency with
which segregational events or structural changes in the plasmid occur. - The
growth advantage the modified cells have over parental cells. Chemostat studies
will be employed as a unique tool for delineating the relative effects of
segregational and structural plasmid instabilities. Using state-of-the-art
fermentor monitoring and estimation methodologies, the on-line detection of
revertants in the recombinant culture will be attempted at an early stage to
allow for the application of stabilization strategies in fed-batch and
continuous culture.
