This award provides funds for an REU Site in Economics at the Andrew Young
School of Policy Studies at Georgia State University. The program's main short-
term objective is to provide undergraduate students the opportunity to
participate actively in policy research; the program is also intended to achieve
the longer-term objective of attracting qualified, interested students to
quality Ph.D. programs in economics, public policy, and other social sciences.
This award will provide internships for 10 students each of the next three
summers. Students will intern with an economics faculty member working in one of
the five policy research centers or programs at the institution. Interns will
receive formal and systematic training in a weekly seminar that will provide
basic research skills and that will culminate in a presentation and a paper
related to the research experience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award contributes
to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers
in science through active undergraduate research experiences.
