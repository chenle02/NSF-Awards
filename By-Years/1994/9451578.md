9451578 Ibrahim The instrumentation and control systems experiments and manuals
developed in this project are used to instruct electrical, chemical, mechanical,
industrial, bio-medical, and environmental engineers and engineering
technologists. The laboratory integrates physical systems and instrumentation
with computer software and hardware. The computers are used for simulation, data
logging and analysis, and as controllers for physical systems with their
inherent nonlinearities. The basic software packages used in the laboratory are
Lab View, Matlab/Simulink, CC and Excel. The wide range of laboratory
experiences developed can be readily duplicated or adapted to meet the
curricular goals of other institutions.
