The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation –
Mid Career Advancement (PFI-MCA) project is a new system to improve imaging of
heart (coronary) vessels for the detection and monitoring of coronary artery
disease (CAD). CAD, the most common type of cardiovascular disease, is the
leading cause of death in the U.S. for both men and women and responsible for
&gt;30% of deaths globally. CAD progresses by obstructing blood flow in heart
vessels—coronary arteries. While catheter-based coronary angiography is
considered the gold standard for assessing coronary arteries it is invasive,
requiring insertion of a catheter for intra-arterial contrast agent injection
for X-ray visualization of obstruction to blood flow. Catheter-based coronary
angiography is also a costly ($57,500 per procedure), and over-utilized exam,
with 40% of exams revealing normal arteries. As an alternative, computed
tomography coronary angiography is a low cost and non-invasive imaging approach.
However, computed tomography systems that are widely available in the U.S. must
be effectively controlled to acquire diagnostic-quality scans with low radiation
dose, i.e., image the heart when its motion is minimal. This new system will
ensure safe, diagnostic-quality scans in all patients, providing widespread
access to coronary imaging and eliminate invasive, unnecessary, costly
procedures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project pursues cutting-edge
research in cardiovascular imaging via aggressive technology development of
real-time sensors and hardware. The project will enable real-time prediction of
minimal heat motion (cardiac quiescence) thereby enabling diagnostic-quality
computed tomography imaging of coronary vessels arteries by implementing an
artificial neural network and a real-time hardware prototype. The system will
prospectively predict quiescence based on external heart sounds and motion for
individual patients on a beat-by-beat basis ready for adoption by computed
tomography manufacturers. This will yield a significant advancement over
existing strategies based on the electrocardiogram.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
