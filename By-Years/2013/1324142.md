This award will provide partial support for an AGU Chapman Conference on post-
wildfire runoff and erosion to be held in Estes Park, Colorado in August, 2013.
The conference will bring together a multidisciplinary group of researchers,
students through senior scientists, working in post-wildfire and erosion
response as well as fire-behavior, meso-scale meteorology, soil science,
hydrology, geomorphology, and modeling. The conference will have five sessions:
post-wildfire response domains; precipitation; infiltration; runoff; soil and
sediment erosion and transport. Outcomes from the conference include a pre-
conference review paper of current priority research issues facing the post-
wildfire community; an AGU monograph of invited and submitted papers; and
journal publications on proposed solutions for priority research issues of each
topic session. The conference will have strong participation from students and
early career researchers.
