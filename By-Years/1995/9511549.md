This proposal is an RUI request for the study of, "Electron Impact Excitation of
the Helium 11S-3,41P and Atomic Hydrogen 12S-32P transitions". It is for
electron-photon coincidence measurements to determine the electron impact
differential cross-section for excitation of 11S-3,41P transitions in helium.
The proposal also call for extension of the measurements to hydrogen.
