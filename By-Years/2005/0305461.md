This individual investigator award supports a project that exploits a novel
technique, charge accumulation imaging (CAI) to probe the quantum mechanics of
nanoelectronic systems in GaAs-AlGaAs heterostructures. CAI is a scanning probe
method that permits minute amounts of electrical charge to be resolved with high
spatial resolution (about 50 nm) in a cryogenic environment. By probing the
spatial characteristics of the ground state of the 2D electron system and the
energy levels of coupled quantum dots, nanostructures with confinement in all
three directions, the experiments probe the nature of electron-electron
interactions, and their interplay with defects. In addition to the contributions
to basic science, the graduate and undergraduate students who will perform this
research will receive a valuable education in advanced scanning probe and
surface science techniques. Moreover, we plan to construct an educational
scanning probe microscope to be showcased in the Michigan State University
Science Theatre. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the nature of electrons
confined inside semiconductors to nanometer lengths has become increasingly
essential as integrated circuits continue to rapidly scale down in size.
Advanced microscopic techniques sensitive to the electronic structure will
likely play key roles in developing future nanoelectronic devices. This research
applies such a technique, Charge Accumulation Imaging, to probe nanoscale
electronic systems formed in the semiconductor GaAs. By mapping out the electric
field emanating from the semiconductor's surface, the technique can resolve the
behavior of electrons inside the nanosystem, despite the fact that it is buried
beneath the surface. The goal of the project is to investigate the nature of
interactions between electrons, and their interplay with defects and impurities
within the semiconductor. The research provides a challenging training ground
for graduate and undergraduate students, as they master advanced microscopy and
semiconductor microfabrication techniques. Moreover, we plan to construct an
educational scanning probe microscope to be showcased in the Michigan State
University Science Theatre. This demonstration will literally bring a hands-on
introduction to nanotechnology for students in grades
6-12.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
