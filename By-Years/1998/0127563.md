Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses four perceived problems in
instruction at the introductory level in Chemistry: a need for curriculum
materials that will support an inquiry oriented instructional strategy; the
difficulty students have linking macroscopic, microscopic and symbolic levels of
understanding; a need for computer-based instructional materials that are
simple, dynamic and interactive; a need to identify and address students'
misconceptions. We are developing instructional materials that can be
implemented as an integrated macroscopic (sensory)/microscopic/symbolic inquiry-
oriented laboratory based instructional model. Specifically, we are developing
eight Molecular Level Experiment (MoLE) Simulations: Gas Laws, Gas Phase
Equilibrium, Kinetics, Atomic Structure and Periodicity, Acid-Base Chemistry,
Calorimetry, Electrochemistry and Molecular and Solid State Structure. Each MoLE
Simulation is a powerful, interactive, dynamic computer simulation, and is
accompanied by a guided and open-inquiry laboratory activity. The materials help
students link the macroscopic, microscopic and symbolic worlds together and
allow them to develop a deeper understanding of these chemical phenomena. The
materials also allow faculty and students to identify and address misconceptions
students might have concerning the target concepts in each MoLE Simulation.
Several different colleges and universities are testing and evaluating the
proposed materials with their students under a number of additional
instructional settings, including lecture, lecture supplements, homework
assignment, computer laboratory, as either group or individual activities, and
to introduce or verify concepts.
