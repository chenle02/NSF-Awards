This Connecting Researchers and Public Audiences project will engage diverse
public audiences, especially K-12 students, around the PI's research on arachnid
evolution. This research spans disparate fields of evolutionary biology,
ecology, zoology and neurobiology, among others. The goals of the project are to
elucidate the scientific process and convey challenging scientific concepts to
the target audiences. The project will forge new collaborations between the
University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln Community Learning Centers' After School
Program, the Lincoln Children's Zoo, and the University of Nebraska State
Museum. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project's various components, designed to
achieve the project's overall goals, include: inquiry-based activities developed
for after school programs, an interactive exhibit focused on arachnids for the
zoo, and family-based multiple activities for the Museum's special events. The
evaluation of the project will study the impact that these activities have on
the knowledge, attitudes, and intended career plans of participants.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;This project is expected to strengthen the informal science education
of its local community and strengthen relationships between the institutions
involved. In addition, undergraduate and graduate students participating in
Informal Education with Arachnids will gain important experience in
communicating with public audiences and making their research comprehensible to
the lay public. Resources developed under this grant will be freely available
through the University of California, Berkeley's NSF-funded website
"Understanding Evolution." The summative evaluation report will be posted on
informalscience.org.
