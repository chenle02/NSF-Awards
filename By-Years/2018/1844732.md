The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is improvements
in instrumentation for laparoscopic surgery. During surgery, scope vision may
become impaired, requiring scope removal from the body and economic and medical
disadvantages. Our technology helps mitigate the need of scope removal from the
body by providing a cleaning mechanism. The commercial potential for this
technology appears valid at this stage, with broad opportunity to address an
established market need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project focuses on a
technology that can be pictured as a tube, shaft, or long arm with a squeegee at
its tip. Its main purpose is to serve as a cleaning mechanism for the far end of
an elongated instrument. The intellectual merit of this technology allows for
the exploration of cleaning technology application surrounding elongated
instruments, with particular opportunity in the medical field. At this stage,
proof of concept has been demonstrated with functional prototypes that show
acceptable performance. There is particular use for applications where the
elongated instrument is constrained within a narrow and/or deep
cavity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
