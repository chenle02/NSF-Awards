With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor
Philip P. Garner, of the Department of Chemistry at Case Western Reserve
University, is studying asymmetric synthesis using chiral heteroalkyl radicals.
Professor Garner is both developing a general, iterative polymer-supported
radical synthesis of polyols and extending the use of pyranosidic chiral
auxiliaries to synthetically useful closed-shell processes. The optimal resin-
linker strategy for this iterative approach will be defined and techniques
developed for the quantification of polymer-supported reactions. Methods for
reducing the number of steps required for each iteration of the radical
homologation sequence and paring down the structure of the chiral auxiliary will
also be explored. Pyranosidic chiral auxiliaries will be applied to a variety of
useful closed-shell processes. Concerted cycloadditions, allylboron/enolate
alkylations, and a tandem asymmetric hydroboration/Suzuki coupling sequence will
be examined, both in solution and on polymer supports.

While organic reactions have traditionally been carried out in solution,
allowing intimate mixing of reactants, there are many advantages to finding
reactions in which either a reactant or a reagent is linked to an insoluble
"support." If a spent reagent is attached to such a support, for example, it may
be easily removed from the reaction mixture, while if a desired compound is
attached, impurities may be easily washed away. Professor Philip P. Garner, of
the Department of Chemistry at Case Western Reserve University, is supported by
the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program for his efforts in this area.
Professor Garner is harnessing the reaction chemistry of compounds containing an
unpaired electron ("radicals"), finding ways to control their reactivity so as
to allow precise geometrical control over the products of their reactions.
