The objective of this research is to design and fabricate compact, low-threshold
and narrow-linewidth microcavity-based mid-IR sources and to demonstrate their
application as key components for ultra-sensitive gas detection. The approach is
to use high optical quality (high-Q) Whispering-Gallery Mode (WGM) resonances in
rare-earth-doped fluoride glasses microspheres and microdisks; these will be
optimized to demonstrate narrow-linewidth ?comb-like? mid-IR luminescent sources
and tunable low-noise mid-IR lasers.

Intellectual merit: The convergence of two recently emerging areas in photonics,
i.e. mid-IR rare-earth-doped glasses and high-Q optical microresonators, not
only enables the possibility of demonstrating novel mid-IR laser and sensor
technologies, but also lays the groundwork for further investigation of
different aspects of high-Q mid-IR resonances in areas such as nonlinear and
quantum optical phenomena. Operation in the mid-IR regime and sensing based on
the absorption spectrum of the target molecules will reduce the need for surface
functionalization and affinity-based detection that is currently used in almost
all high-Q WGM optical biosensors.

Broader Impacts: The proposed mid-IR sources have immediate application in basic
research on nonlinear optics, biochemistry, and sensor technology. Low-power,
low-weight, compact, low-cost and high-sensitivity WGM-based mid-IR sources will
benefit society in areas such as biomedical research, environmental control,
medical diagnostics and microfabrication. The multidisciplinary nature of this
project will stimulate collaboration among different departments at the
University of New Mexico. The PIs have also developed plans for collaboration
with minority serving colleges, K-12 and post-secondary teachers and students.
