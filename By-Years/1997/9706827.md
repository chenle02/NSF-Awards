9706827 Stanley Osher This research is concerned with the accurate and efficient
computation of "irregular" solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs).
This includes solutions with discontinuities, singularities, fine scale
structure, or persistent oscillations. The main topics include (1) kinetic
formulations of nonlinear PDE's and applications; (2) interface capturing
through the level set method; (3) discontinuity capturing based on ideas
developed for the numerical solution of conservation laws; and (4) numerical and
analytical study of oscillations and critical threshold phenomena. The proposed
research will impact numerous areas of science and technology. With the advent
of modern computers, formerly intractable problems can be solved accurately.
This, of course, requires accurate and convergent algorithms for these difficult
nonlinear and computationally intense problems. The algorithms formerly
developed by this group are already in wide use throughout the country in
national laboratories and industry. The proposed methods to be developed here
will be useful in a host of applications including combustion, oil recovery,
crystal growth, electromagnetic and acoustic scattering, thin film semiconductor
growth, aircraft design, to name just a few.
