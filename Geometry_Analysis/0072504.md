Abstract

Award: DMS-0072504 Principal Investigator: Eric Zaslow

Zaslow proposes research directed towards a unified understanding of mirror
symmetry. Current ideas -- including ``classical'' mirror symmetry; Kontsevich's
conjecture; the work of Vafa; and the conjecture of Strominger, Yau, and Zaslow
-- are only loosely connected and involve both perturbative and non-perturbative
string reasoning. An understanding of how non-perturbative string theory relates
to the classical mirror symmetry picture and Gromov-Witten invariants will be an
important step towards unification. Five projects are proposed towards achieving
this goal: 1) Developing a mathematical formulation of the new invariants
obtained by Gopakumar and Vafa from BPS state counting. 2) Understanding the
multiple-cover formulas which yield integers from higher-genus Gromov-Witten
invariants. 3) Resolving the holomorphic ambiguity by determining it from the
structure of singularities of Calabi-Yau moduli space. 4) Developing a physical
understanding of Kontsevich's enlargement of Calabi-Yau moduli space to include
A-infinity structures. 5) Defining a geometric Fourier-Mukai-like functor
relating special-Lagrangian cycles of one manifold to Hermitian-Yang-Mills
connections on bundles over the mirror. This functor could lead to a geometric
proof of Kontsevich's formulation of mirror symmetry. All these projects aim to
unify our still disparate approaches to mirror symmetry.

This project is directed towards unifying our mathematical and physical
understanding of the phenomenon of mirror symmetry, discovered by theoretical
physicists working in string theory. String theory is a proposed physical theory
with the promise of incorporating Einstein's understanding of space and gravity
into the quantum theory. Mirror symmetry is a duality symmetry in string theory,
whereby two very different physical theories are actually equivalent. When one
of the theories is easily computable and the other hard, this leads to
predictions of answers to difficult calculations. From the mathematical point of
view, this can lead to conjectures relating parallel structures -- the
structures involved in describing the different, but equivalent, mathematical
models of physical theories. The relationships unearthed by mirror symmetry are
deep and novel. A unified understanding of them may join not only fields of
research but different disciplines -- math and physics -- as well. This award is
partially funded by the program in Mathematical Physics of the Division of
Physics.
