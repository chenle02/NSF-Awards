The research goal of this project is twofold: on the one hand to pursue methods
and ideas developed in recent work in the search for either singularities or
global existence in incompressible fluids with finite energy and on the other to
transfer the techniques to solve long-standing open problems in spectral
geometry and mathematical physics. A key ingredient in its success is to have
accurate numerics, together with a deep understanding of the regularity theory.
Therefore, the interdisciplinary nature of the project, which involves numerical
computations, physics informed neural networks (PINN), computer-assisted proofs,
modern methods in partial differential equations (PDE) and harmonic analysis, is
an essential ingredient for its successful outcome. The recent emergence of
techniques blending mathematical analysis and deep learning offers a new
opportunity for developing new angles of attack and better understanding
classical problems in mathematics. Undergraduate and graduate students,
postdoctoral researchers, and research visitors actively participate in the work
of this project. In particular, undergraduate students from underrepresented
groups in the mathematical sciences are mentored and involved in research
experiences integral to the project, on problems that are rich and suitable for
learning and partial progress, both numerically and analytically.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The project is structured in three blocks, the first one involving
the incompressible Euler equations, as well as other water wave models; the
second on the surface quasi-geostrophic (SQG), the generalized-SQG equations,
and related models; and a third one on applications to spectral geometry and
mathematical physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
