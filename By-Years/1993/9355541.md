Abstract 93-55541 Belleview Public Schools, District #118 Michael Koenig, Jerry
P. Becker Developing Elementary and Middle School Mathematics Professionals This
project is a 3-year teacher enhancement program in mathematics for 300
elementary and middle school teachers. Starting in the first summer, all the
teachers in Belleview, IL will receive teacher enhancement, and successive
groups of teachers from surrounding districts will start in each of the next two
years. For each teacher, the program will have two summer components, 4-weeks
and 2-weeks respectively, with monthly full day seminars during the intervening
school year. Community involvement includes business leaders, parents, and
district administrators. District teachers will be leaders, along with external
specialists, in carrying out the program. The request from NSF is $2,038,699
over the three years with a cost-sharing amount of $521,499.
