This research concentrates on placement and routing problems related to channel
routing, and deals with issues relevant to the design of systems for automatic
layout of integrated circuits. The most commonly arising problem is the channel
routing problem in which two rows of terminals are positioned opposite each
other. The study focuses on the interrelation between placement and routing and
the development of methods for routing in multilayer wiring models.
