Through the acquisition of an educational x-ray system, computers, and a
multichannel analyzer, students are being introduced to the study of x-ray
emission, absorption and diffraction, and gamma ray spectroscopy. The
instruments are being interfaced with computers to give students familiarity
with the use of the computer for data acquisition and analysis. The availability
of these instruments enhances the modern physics and advanced laboratory courses
and provides a greater variety of undergraduate research opportunities for
physics majors at Saint Vincent College.NSF grant funds are being matched with
funds from non-federal sources.
