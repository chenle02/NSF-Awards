Introduction

The purpose of this project is to study the testing and diagnosis of children
who are being considered for an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Since the early
1990s, there has been a huge upsurge in ASD diagnosis. Sociological and
epidemiological studies can account for much of the increased prevalence.
However, little attention has been paid to the concrete ways in which clinicians
and the child are engaged in the examination process. Attention also needs to be
given to what happens after completing the exams with a child; how clinicians
consult with one another about their findings, determine a diagnosis, and
present that diagnosis to parents and other caretakers. Such considerations
should be extended to how family, legal, economic and other factors affect
diagnosis.

Intellectual Merit

There are three parts to our study corresponding to the three sets of concerns
indicated above. The first aim is to do a sociology of testing, understanding
the organized social interactions and collaborative skills by which clinicians
and children engage in examination tasks. The second aim focuses on the
narrations associated with what clinicians have found in testing, the discussion
of those findings and attempts resolve any discrepancies among themselves, and
the presentation of their diagnostic conclusions to family members and other
caretakers such as educators. The third aim is to explore how, in their testing
and diagnostic determinations, clinicians and caretakers may orient to social
contexts surrounding autism diagnosis including family, legal, educational,
administrative, and economic factors.

Potential Broader Impacts

This study of interactions in the testing and diagnostic process potentially
means better understanding of ability/disability and greater inclusion of ASD
individuals in society. It additionally provides for the discovery of
unanticipated avenues and future research into the causes, consequences and
treatment of ASD. Finally, the project also involves the training of graduate
student sociologists as Science and Technology Scholars concerned with ASD.
