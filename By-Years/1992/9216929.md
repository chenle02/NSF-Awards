A high resolution study of linear and non-linear interactions within Equatorial
Pacific carbonate system over the past 4 m.y., using GRAPE as a CaCO3 proxy.
Record of this proxy from ODP Leg 138 and its detailed oxygen-isotopic data will
be used to learn more about the dynamics of the carbonate system. A two year
funding is provided.
