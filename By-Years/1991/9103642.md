The principal investigator will document the chemical, mineralogic, and physical
processes of xenolith disaggregation, and will characterize the mechanisms by
which heterogeneous contaminants are assimilated in adjacent magma. To do so he
will study granodiorite xenoliths in the Watts Point and Monmouth Creek
complexes of southwestern British Columbia. The results will provide geologists
with a better understanding of magma contamination mechanisms in the upper part
of the Earth's crust, and with new insights into contamination processes at
greater depths.
