This is a proposal for funds to purchase a research-grade light microscope for
four projects: (i) a molecular genetic analysis of the Drosophila olfactory
system; (ii) a molecular and developmental analysis of the Drosophila E75 gene,
a model system for analysis of steroid-triggered regulatory hierarchies; (iii) a
molecular, genetic, and developmental analysis of the positional control of leaf
cell differentiation in maize; (iv) an analysis of the developmental regulation
and function of the mammalian transcription factor AP-2. For each of these
projects, a high-quality light microscope facility is crucial.
