AST-0139617&lt;br/&gt;Honeycutt&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Honeycutt is awarded
funds to establish a Research Experiences for Undergraduates site in astronomy
at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana. The site will host six students
per year for three years. Recruitment will target students from small colleges
and state universities without astronomy Ph.D. programs. The focus of the
student projects will be observational stellar astronomy using ground-based
photometric and spectroscopic data. The students will be organized into three
research groups in the areas of variable stars, open cluster color-magnitude
diagrams, and high dispersion spectroscopy. Student activities will include a
week-long trip to Kitt Peak to use the 0.91-m WIYN (Wisconsin-Indiana-Yale-NOAO)
telescope, an internal research symposium in the final week of the program, and
the preparation of abstracts and posters for presentation at a professional
meeting.&lt;br/&gt;
