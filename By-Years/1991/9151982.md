The purpose of this project is to establish a computer numerically controlled
(CNC) machine tool laboratory, which provides the opportunity for students to
study computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) methods. Purchases include a small CNC
milling machine, computer, software, and accessories. Students study machining
methods and computer-aided drafting (CAD). The equipment allows students to
design parts using CAD, transfer that information to the CNC machine, and the
part will then be made by the machine.
