This award is for the acquisition of a suite of instruments to prepare single
crystals of intermetallic compounds by flux growth. Flux growth is a powerful
technique that can produce high-quality single crystals of a wide variety of
both congruently melting and incongruently melting compounds. The instruments
include an arcmelter to alloy metals prior to growth, a tube furnace to grow
crystals at higher temperatures, a box furnace to grow crystals at lower
temperatures, saws and polishers to prepare crystals for measurement, a vacuum
annealing furnace to anneal prepared samples, a microscope with digital camera,
and a precision balance. The resulting crystals will be characterized using
other NSF-funded instruments already at Grinnell College. A powder X-ray
diffractometer provides structural information, while a Quantum Design PPMS-9
Physical Properties Measurement System provides anisotropic dc magnetization, ac
susceptibility, resistivity, magnetoresistivity, and heat capacity data. These
instruments support a long-standing collaborative research effort pursued by the
principal investigator, undergraduates at Grinnell, and investigators at Ames
Laboratory. Examples of collaborative research projects that the single crystal
preparation instrument suite will support include studies of magnetic anisotropy
in rare earth intermetallic single crystals and the design of a strongly
anisotropic spin glass in single crystal form, used as a model system for
testing spin glass theories. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because research is always
blended with teaching at Grinnell, the single crystal preparation instruments
will have broad impact beyond the research projects that they support. Students
will use these instruments in collaborative research with the principal
investigator, faculty-mentored independent student projects, and experiments in
upper-level courses taken by physics majors. Grinnell College has a large,
successful physics program, graduating 10 to16 physics majors per year, over
half of whom go on to graduate school in science or engineering. Grinnell
College has attained national recognition for its successful efforts to increase
the retention of underrepresented groups in science through programs such as the
New Science Project. The single crystal preparation instrument suite will help
to broaden the exposure of these under-represented groups to research-quality
instrumentation in their education and research training. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
