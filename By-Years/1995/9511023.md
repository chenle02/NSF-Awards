This research is the American part of an ongoing project in 22 countries to
collect comparable survey data on key social issues and processes. In the
present study, a national sample of adult respondents will be asked their
feelings about issues related to natiolal identity and their views of the role
of government. Data on national identity will identify some of the subnational
and supranational pressures that threaten the viability of states and test
hypotheses about factors leading to order and stability. Data on the role of
government will provide continuity with earlier studies and will allow the
tracking of changes in the attitudes of citizens toward government. %%%
Participation in the International Social Survey Program represents an important
part of the leadership role that the United States plays in international social
science. This research ensures the continuing availability of high quality
cross-national data otherwise inaccessible to individual researchers. The data
also make an important contribution to teaching by providing graduate students
with materials for theses and undergraduates with experience in analyzing data.
