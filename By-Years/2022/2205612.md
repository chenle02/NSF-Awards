The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP)
through Broadening Participation Research (BPR) in STEM Education projects
supports the development, implementation, and study of new theory-driven models
and innovations related to the participation and success of underrepresented
groups in STEM undergraduate education. It is expected that the award will
further the faculty member's research capability, as well as improve the
recruitment, retention, and success of underrepresented groups in STEM education
and the workforce. This project at Saint Augustineâ€™s University seeks to develop
a career readiness framework and study its impact on HBCU STEM students' career
perspectives. The research team plans to translate empirical results into best
practices that inform the development of STEM curricula, classroom practices,
and extracurricular activities that enhance STEM students' occupational
attainment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research project's objective is to study
the impact of a STEM career development intervention at Saint Augustine's
University. The project team will utilize a non-equivalent group design and non-
parametric statistics to examine the effects of participation in a STEM career
readiness program on vocational perspectives and career training outcomes. The
research team hypothesizes that involvement in workforce preparation activities
will positively enhance career development outcomes among HBCU STEM students.
The quasi-experimental research project aligns with the National Science
Foundation's goals to promote best practices and synthesize empirical evidence
to improve STEM education and employment experiences among underrepresented
populations. It is anticipated that the proposed efforts may enhance the
understanding and facilitate the dismantling of barriers as experience by HBCU
STEM students pursuing STEM career opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
