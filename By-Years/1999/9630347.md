9630347 Dyer The proposed research suggests that grazing animals contain
specific biochemicals in their salivary or digestive systems that regulate plant
growth. In earlier NSF-sponsored research the investigators obtained evidence
that very low concentrations of a specific group of proteins found in
grasshopper regurgitants can increase plant growth, but that large dosages may
cause reductions. In this project they will isolate and identify these specific
plant growth compounds. This work will give new insight about how such novel
growth regulators not found normally in plants may affect the physiology, and
the growth and development of the plant after it has been grazed. New
information about this plant-animal interaction holds promise for a better
understanding of how large animal grazers and pest populations of insects may
influence plant production in grasslands and agricultural crops.
