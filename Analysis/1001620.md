The proposed research centers around extremal problems of finite distortion. The
relevance of these problems comes out of a confirmation that quasiconformal
theory and nonlinear elasticity share compelling mathematical challenges. The
theory of mappings of finite distortion arose from the need to extend the ideas
and applications of the classical theory of quasiconformal mappings to the
degenerate elliptic setting. There are many natural reasons for studying
extremal problems in such a general degenerated setting. We eventually hope to
lay down the analytical foundations for compactifying the moduli spaces. In such
an extremal problem our mappings are not constrained on the boundary; the
boundary does not even exist for compact Riemann surfaces. Annuli are where one
first observes nontrivial conformal invariants. There is a close relationship
between the existence of mappings with smallest mean distortion and the well
known conjecture of Nitsche (1962) on harmonic homeomorphisms between circular
annuli. The Nitsche conjecture was originally motivated by the study of the non-
existence of doubly connected minimal graphs. Very recently, the PI in
collaboration with T. Iwaniec and L. V. Kovalev gave an affirmative answer to
this question. Our approach opens several future directions. There are many new
and unexpected phenomena concerning existence (hammering phenomenon),
uniqueness, regularity and failure of radial symmetry of the extremal mappings;
some already prepared for answers, while others remain long term goals.
Mathematical analysis relies on physical and geometric intuition for its future
development. In recent years, this trend has become more pronounced, leading to
concerted efforts of pure and applied mathematicians to work together. Problems
in the intersection of Geometric Function Theory and Non-linear Elasticity that
the PI proposes here contribute to these efforts. The proposed existence
theorems of hyperelastic deformations might interest not only mathematicians but
also engineers and physicists. The project also involves working with small
colleges located near to Syracuse University with the aim of attracting young
researchers from underrepresented groups to mathematics and also involves
mentoring graduate students.
