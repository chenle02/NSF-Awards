This project aims to investigate a central object in modern algebraic
combinatorics: a class of cluster algebras. These cluster algebras are related
to a wide variety of other mathematical objects arising in algebraic geometry,
representation theory, and other areas, but are also important in particle
physics, where they are related to scattering amplitudes in certain quantum
field theories. Hence a better understanding of cluster algebras is not only
interesting in its own right, but also has significant potential application in
other areas of mathematics and beyond. The project will provide training for
students through involvement in the research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rigid
modules, invariant curves, and knots are fundamental objects in many branches of
mathematics. This project takes a cluster-algebraic approach to studying these
objects. The research goal, largely motivated by homological mirror symmetry, is
to study invariants for indecomposable modules over hereditary algebras, for
quiver Grassmannians, and for alternating knots. The project aims to develop new
combinatorial and geometric objects to reveal more concrete relationships
between cluster algebras and other areas of mathematics. The educational goal of
this project is to train undergraduate and graduate students in topics at the
intersection of algebra, combinatorics, geometry, topology, and representation
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
