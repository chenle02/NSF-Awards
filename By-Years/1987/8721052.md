Although this group has derived excellent 2-D modeling comparisons between
observed and calculated magnetotelluric (MT data) from the EMSLAB experiment,
there are ample reasons to suspect significant 3-D effects. They are evident in
the data and are suspected from the geomorphic - geologic setting, the
distribution of geophysical anomalies (particularly gravity and seismicity), and
volcanic arc segmentation. The importance of the EMSLAB findings demands the
final step of 3-D modeling to confirm or reject the 2-D interpretations which
can be totally incorrect. The PI will first complete a 2-D Backus-Gilbert
inversion, which has tentatively identified the top of the Juan de Fuca plate at
25-30 km depth beneath the Oregon Coast Range. Secondly, he will realistically
evaluate the regional 3-D effects of the Willamette Valley area and of the
segmented Juan de Fuca plate. Smaller 3-D effects due to volcanic intrusives and
topography near to the land EMSLAB MT sites will also be evaluated.
