At the heart of most algorithms for distributed and randomized algorithms is a
Markov chain that 'visits and samples' a subset of the nodes in the graph and
which satisfies the following three properties: the answer derived from walking
the graph converges, the transition probabilities for next state only depend on
locally available information and the convergence is 'fast-mixing' or efficient.
The proposal will develop approaches for improving the mixing time of Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. These approaches are then to be applied as
a building block for algorithms in three distinct areas -- (1) sampling large
graphs (2) wireless multihop scheduling and (3) duty cycling in wireless sensor
networks.

Broader Impact: MCMC-like approaches underly algorithms for a wide range of
socially and economically important problems and that progress in improving the
mixing time will have significant impacts. Additionally, the proposal highlights
student mentorship and interdisciplinary course development.
