This proposal addresses the national problem of finding viable minority
applicants to match with graduate programs/fellowship study opportuni- ties. The
proposal requests funds from The National Science Foundation to design and
establish a nationwide data-base clearinghouse to match funding sources,
graduate programs and minority student applicants. The objectives of the data-
base clearinghouse are: 1) to centralize information on graduate study
opportunities for minority students to facilitate matching
funds/programs/applicants; 2) improve the distri- bution of existing resources;
and, 3) serve a wider range of students to increase the representation of
minority students in graduate programs. The project will result in subscribers -
graduate schools, minority students and fellowship programs - being able to
access the data-base from anywhere in the country through telecommunication
hookups and thus, be able to locate highly qualified minority applicants.
