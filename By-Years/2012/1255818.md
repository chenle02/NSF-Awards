In the semiconductor industry, one way of measuring reliability is the expected
lifetime of a product. As semiconductor manufacturing technologies continue to
advance, ensuring reliability has become one of the major challenges in the
industry. The ability to ensure reliability is essential for the success of a
product line as well as the success of the industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project proposes to develop a first cost-effective solution for screening
unreliable parts before product shipment to the customer. The project proposes
to develop software tools and methodologies for predicting the expected life
time of a part. Further, the project proposes to develop a second cost-effective
solution for continuously monitoring and improving reliability while a part is
being used in the field. Additional software tools and methodologies will be
developed for building models for such continuous monitoring. These monitoring
models are then used for extending the life time of a part by automatic
adjusting the operational parameters such as speed and voltage of the part based
on its current health condition. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The research is
integrated with educational activities to develop course and tutorial materials
for broad impact, a state-of-the-art laboratory for education, and a research
program to attract undergraduate and underrepresented students. The research
strives to achieve a comprehensive understanding of state-of-the-art industrial
practices and to accomplish multidisciplinary studies merging knowledge from
reliability physics, semiconductor testing, and data mining. Knowledge
discovered through this research will provide the industry with a clear
direction on how to cope with the present and future reliability challenges.
