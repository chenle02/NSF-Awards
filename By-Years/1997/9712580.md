The area of research is set theory, especially large cardinals and core models.
Many mathematical principles that have been shown to be independent of ZFC
(Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice). The most famous example
is the Continuum Hypothesis, CH. Goedel showed that ZFC + CH holds in his
Constructible Universe, L. Cohen invented the method of forcing and used it to
show the consistency of ZFC with the failure of CH. It is natural to consider
extensions of ZFC by large cardinal axioms in order to resolve otherwise
independent questions in mathematics. Moreover, the collection of large cardinal
axioms forms a hierarchy in terms of relative consistency. Measuring the
consistency strength of a given principle involves showing that the principle is
equiconsistent with a particular large cardinal axiom. Often, Cohen's forcing
method is used in obtaining upper bounds on consistency strength. In the other
direction, core models are analogs of Goedel's L for theories of the form ZFC +
``large cardinal axiom''. Beginning with the pioneering work of Jensen, core
models have been applied to obtain lower bounds on consistency strength.
Important recent advances, in both the forcing and core model technologies have
led to some equiconsistencies at the level of Woodin cardinals. Schimmerling
will continue his work on pure core model theory, while at the same time
attempting to apply core models to questions in descriptive set theory, cardinal
arithmetic, and infinitary combinatorics, and, also, to solve some closely
related combinatorial problems using forcing.
