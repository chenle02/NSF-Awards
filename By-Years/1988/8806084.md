This award will provide partial support to the National Academy of Sciences
Committee on Risk Perception and Communication to research and develop a report
that would analyze and evaluate approaches for improving the process of
communicating about risk associated with technologies, and for improving public
understanding about related policy questions. The study's conclusions and
recommendations will help improve public understanding of technological hazards
and appropriate responses to them, and will assist decision-makers within and
outside the government as other participants in the process to anticipate
problems and develop adequate responses to them. These results should enable
policy makers to improve the performance, public understanding, and cost-
effectiveness of new programs.
