Host - virus interactions are greatly affected by the exceptionally rapid rate
of virus evolution. Evolution of viruses is frequently driven by genetic
recombination, a process that allows viruses to overcome immunity, to infect new
host species and change disease symptoms in all types of living organisms. Virus
recombination is also a major factor in emergence of new viruses, which is a
continuing threat to our society. &lt;br/&gt;Therefore, studies on the effect of
the host on the viral recombination process are critical to unravel virus
evolution, which is currently poorly understood. This project focuses on a
recently discovered key host factor affecting RNA recombination in Tomato bushy
stunt virus. The host factor is Pmr1p Ca2+/Mn2+ ion-pump, which is a ubiquitous
and conserved protein playing critical roles in human genetic diseases, such as
Hailey-Hailey Disease and Darier Disease. In order to characterize the role of
Pmr1p in viral RNA recombination, the investigator will use advanced genetics
tools available for plant and yeast, which is a model host, in combination with
biochemical approaches. This research is expected to lead to important new
discoveries in viral recombination and contribute key knowledge to the role of
the host in virus evolution and virus-host interactions.&lt;br/&gt;Broader
impact: The research holds promise of benefiting society by leading to
groundbreaking results in the area of virus recombination/evolution, host-virus
interaction and the emergence of new viruses. The major limitation of current
antiviral methods is that they could quickly become ineffective due to rapid
virus evolution. Better understanding of viral RNA recombination will have
tremendous impact on our abilities to develop better, longer lasting antiviral
strategies. Education component: High school and undergraduate students will
actively participate in research in the investigator's laboratory.
