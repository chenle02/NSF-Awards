The HIAPER (High-performance Instrumented Airborne Platform for Environmental
Research) project consists of a highly modified Gulfstream V (GV) aircraft
capable of high altitude, long duration, large payload capability and high speed
flight. The HIAPER aircraft is intended to fill an important niche in the
national fleet of scientific airborne platforms and will readily and regularly
allow higher altitude and longer duration science payload missions than those
generally available to the academic research community.
