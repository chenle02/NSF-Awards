The long-term goal of Dr. Wysocki's research is to understand the distinct
roles of the vomeronasal and the olfactory systems in chemosensory
communication. The vomeronasal system, which independent of the olfactory
system, is of prime importance in the mediation of numerous neuroendocrine and
behavioral responses. Using mice as a model system, Dr. Wysocki has shown that
the vomeronasal organ is responsible for the detection of within species,
biologically relevant odors or pheromones. With the support from a Research
Opportunity Award, the breadth of his research program can now be extended by
adopting a more general comparative approach. Dr. Carr is a Professor from
Beaver College, a small undergraduate teaching institution. He will spend his
sabbatical leave working with Dr. Wysocki at the Monell Chemical Senses Center
in Philadelphia, PA. Dr. Carr will determine whether domestic dogs are capable
of recognizing kin. If successful, the investigators will explore the genetic
and experiential determinants of kin recognition, and, in continued
collaborative work, determine the roles of the olfactory and vomeronasal systems
in canines.
