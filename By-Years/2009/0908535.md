This project covers three areas related to multiply scattered waves: coherence
propagation, focusing, and imaging in cluttered media. Firstly, a comprehensive
and rigorous framework is formulated to analyze the space-frequency coherence
properties of waves in random media. Secondly, the multiply scattered evanescent
waves will be taken into account to enhance the wave focusing in cluttered
media. Thirdly, imaging methods based on the compressed sensing techniques will
be developed to achieve stable, accurate imaging of multiple targets in clutter
with nearly minimal sensing resources.

Multiple scattering is a basic phenomenon in wave physics. It affects how
signals and information are transferred in clutter prevalent in both natural and
urban environments. In addition to fundamental research in wave physics, the
main applications of the project are in remote sensing and near-field imaging.
In particular, the project on detecting intruders hidden in clutter is important
for homeland security and tissue imaging. The project on imaging in the
background of rough surfaces will have impacts on aerial sensing of natural
resources and targets in the terrestrial environment, as well as design of
nanophotonic sensors for detecting biological and chemical agents.
