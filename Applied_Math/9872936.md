The ability to learn to categorize and recognize objects is a key feature of the
visual system of humans and higher animals. Yet, how the representation
underlying these powerful visual abilities is organized and acquired is still
largely unknown. The investigator and his colleagues tackle the problem of how
the visual cortex learns to represent and recognize novel objects and object
classes through a combination of computational, physiological and psychophysical
approaches. The physiological experiments on alert monkeys rely on
multielectrode recordings for which the investigators develop a tool kit of
appropriate data mining techniques, based in part on their own work on learning
and classification algorithms. In particular, the investigators undertake a
multi-disciplinary research project consisting of four interacting components:
i) Computational modeling of inferotemporal (IT) cortical neurons, extending
their previous work on representations of single objects in IT; ii) cortical
physiology using multiple electrodes in awake, behaving monkeys trained on
between- and within-class classification tasks on novel classes of stimuli; iii)
new data mining techniques for processing multiple electrode data, including
classification and learning techniques; iv) visual psychophysics including fMRI
studies in humans and monkeys, allowing to relate the findings from monkey
physiology to object learning in the human brain.

Understanding learning in the human brain means understanding the very core of
intelligence. Not only is this one of the remaining fundamental challenges in
science but it is also one area where even small steps forward will have
significant implications for understanding neurological diseases and disorders,
and also for the future of computing and machine intelligence. However, despite
enormous progress in the last decade or two, science does not yet know what
various areas of the cortex do and how. Because understanding the brain, the
most complex system we know, is a huge endeavor, the present project focuses on
understanding a part of cortex, involved in a key and very difficult task in
everybody's daily life -- even if subjectively very easy: learning to categorize
and recognize visual objects such as faces or cars. Understanding how brain
cells come to represent objects will be a major breakthrough for neuroscience
and also for eventually designing machines capable of achieving human-like
performance. More importantly, any significant progress in the specific problem
of object recognition will have a major impact on the goals of the KDI program,
because it will open the door to understanding broader issues of learning and
intelligence in brains and machines.
