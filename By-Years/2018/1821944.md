This project examines analytically and using computer simulations a novel regime
in which an unprecedented magnetic field, generated in a laser-irradiated solid
density target, enhances acceleration of electrons and, as a result, enables
emission of copious very energetic photons. Light-matter interactions at ultra-
high intensities are the next frontier of the advanced accelerator research with
the potential to enable development of novel accelerators and x-ray sources.
This regime has the potential to disrupt existing paradigms and advance
accelerator science at a fundamental level. The prospect of generating copious
quantities of energetic photons in laser-target interactions is of particular
interest due to its many possible applications, including photo-nuclear
spectroscopy, radiation therapy, and radio surgery. The study is also of
fundamental relevance to astrophysics, as it can pave the way to creation of
matter and antimatter from light, thus providing valuable insights into the
inner workings of the universe. The project will provide essential student
training in accelerator science, plasma physics and high performance
computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The novelty of the regime investigated by this
project is that the extreme magnetic field couples three key aspects of laser-
plasma interactions at high intensities: relativistic transparency, direct laser
acceleration, and synchrotron photon emission. The key questions investigated by
the project cover fundamental aspects of electron acceleration in Megatesla-
level magnetic fields, including energy scaling with plasma and laser pulse
parameters, and the mechanism underpinning generation of such a strong laser-
driven magnetic field in a plasma. The project specifically examines the
interplay between electron acceleration and photon emission. This interplay is
the key feature of this regime, because, while the acceleration enhances the
photon emission, the photon emission itself has a strong feedback on the
microscopic electron motion. In addition to the synchrotron emission, the
project also addresses the role of bremsstrahlung. The bremsstrahlung emission
can become relevant due to high plasma density, but the presence of the
Megatesla magnetic field can have a profound mitigating effect, suppressing
photon emission.
