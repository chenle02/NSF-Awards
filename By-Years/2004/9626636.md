This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,
focusses on the development of advanced sol-gel materials to be used in the
construction of micron dimension analytical biosensors and biosensor arrays.
Biorecognition molecules will be placed in these sol-gel matrices and their
selectivity and reactivity will be characterized. The biosensor devices that are
constructed during this work will be applied to simultaneous multicomponent
analyses in complex matrices. In this work Professor Bright will utilize a broad
range of modern analytical techniques including scanning electron microscopy,
mercury porsimetry, optical microscopy, profilometry, and static and time-
resolved fluorescence and Raman spectroscopies. The goal of this project is to
develop small, reliable, and inexpensive biosensors that can be used in the
quantification of clinically important analytes. These devices will employ
biological molecules as active elements because their reactions are selective
and sensitive. The biological molecules will be held in sol-gel matrices where
they will retain their reactivity within the sensor. Professor Bright will also
take advantage of the fact that sol-gel materials can be fabricated in very
small dimensions thereby enabling analyses in microscopic volumes. The work to
be done by Professor Bright and his students could lead to new and improved
methods for doing important clinical analyses.
