This project conducts research on the design, definition, and implementation of
programming languages, with emphasis on type structure and on bridging the gap
between functional and imperative programming. In studying how to implement the
programming language Forsythe, it investigates better methods of type checking
for intersection types. Considerable improvement is expected from using a top-
down rather than the present bottom- up algorithm. A more flexible approach to
the implementation of procedures is also investigated, where a portion of the
procedure body is compiled into closed code while the rest of the body is
compiled into inline code at each call site. This is expected to substantially
alleviate the overhead associated with call by name. The research seeks to unify
two of the intractable dichotomies that complicate and divide the study of
programming languages. The goal is to unify semantics based on domains, which
permits partial and infinite computations, with semantics based on partial
equivalence relations and intuitionistic type theory, which is limited to
always-terminating computations. Also investigated is the unification of earlier
work on the syntactic control of interference in Algol-like languages with the
more recent development of low-level functional languages based on linear logic.
In particular, this research would connect the concept of passive types with the
modal operators of linear logic.
