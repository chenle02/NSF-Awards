The goal of this project is to investigate the effects of blast-induced
traumatic brain injury (bTBI) using advanced finite element (FE) modeling
techniques. This study will focus on the posterior fossa region of the brain
(brainstem, cerebellum, great vein of Galen and other vasculature). Previous
studies and recent animal model experiments indicate that this important region
of the brain sustains damage in bTBI cases. Further, such injuries are
consistent with symptoms reported by subjects. An anatomically correct,
biomechanically-based, 3-dimensional FE head model will be produced. A detailed
FE submodel of the brainstem and veins will be created, which uses the
stress/strain distribution from the global head model as the boundary conditions
on the separate assembly model. The effects of blast strength and direction will
also be studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is the direct result of the
convergence of several important needs in medicine, engineering, education,
industry, and the military. If successful, the research benefits will be broad
and influence several areas. Early diagnosis and treatment of traumatic brain
injury is critical for long term treatment success and even survival. Both can
be aided by developing treatment modalities and dose/response relationships that
complement the precise injury mechanisms. The work will lay the ground work for
the development of better protective equipment for bomb squads, industrial
firefighters, and soldiers. For example, head models can be augmented with
models of protective equipment or vehicles. Other injury mechanisms (e.g.
impacts, flying shrapnel) could also be incorporated into the models. Making
these models available in the public domain will be a considerable contribution
to the scientific and engineering community. Students and faculty will interact
across traditional disciplines, a synergy highly beneficial. The research
materials and procedures resulting from this project will be adapted for
classroom use.
