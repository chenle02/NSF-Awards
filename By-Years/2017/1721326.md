The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will address two
societal needs. It will enable mass charging infrastructure for electric
vehicles (EVs) at minimal costs, and will enable the provisioning of ancillary
services to help integrate renewable energy sources. This is critical as
electricity generation and transportation consume about 2/3 of all US energy and
emit more than 1/2 of all US greenhouse gases. To drastically reduce greenhouse
gases will therefore require mass adoption of electric vehicles and renewable
generation. CA has a mandate to have 1.5 million zero emission vehicles by 2025
and, currently, half of the nation's EVs are in CA. It has been estimated that
the proposed technology can potentially save CA $144M annually in operating
costs and $1.1B in capital cost when CA reaches its ambitious goal by 2025. By
drastically decreasing the cost of mass EV charging, the proposed technology
will also help reduce 5.5 million US tons of greenhouse gases annually in CA.
This project will therefore make an impact in both clean transportation and
clean energy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) Phase I project will develop theory and algorithms for real-time
distributed optimization and control of smart EV chargers. Multiple parties in
the smart grid ecosystem, from electricity wholesale market operator, to utility
companies, to aggregators, and individual parking facility operators, have their
own individual objectives, and make local decisions based on local information,
yet their decisions interact over the grid through power flows in intricate
ways. The key to an efficient solution is a set of recent mathematical
techniques to decompose the global problem into a set of subproblems, to be
solved by individual parties, that communicate through local message exchanges.
The core challenges this project will overcome pertain to optimization
decomposition, scalability, stability, global optimality, and robustness.
