Kastner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will measure
of Cl concentrations and isotope systematics in subduction-related aqueous
fluids and rocks. The main objectives are to determine Cl concentrations and
isotope compositions in: 1) pore fluids and sediments from the Costa Rica
subduction zone; and 2) serpentine samples from subduction zones and transform
faults. The work would result in an improved understanding of the cycling of
volatiles (Cl, H2O) during tectonic processes and is of broad scientific
interest.&lt;br/&gt;
