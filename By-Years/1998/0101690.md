This Research in Undergraduate Institution project at Western Washington
University, a renewal of an earlier award, is to synthesize and characterize
metal oxide-supported boride and phosphide catalysts to remove sulfur from
organic sulfur compounds by hydrodesulfurization. This interdisciplinary project
is jointly supported by the Advanced Materials and Processing Program in the
Chemistry Division of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and the
Kinetics, Catalysis and Molecular Processes Program in the Division of Chemical
Transport Systems of the Engineering Directorate. Professor Bussell and his
students will prepare novel catalysts based on borides and phosphides of cobalt,
nickel and molybdenum, and they will characterize them to optimize the catalyst
synthesis and to determine the relationship between surface chemistries and
catalytic properties. The research will introduce undergraduate and masters
degree students to state of the art techniques in materials and surface
chemistries, and will provide training to them in synthetic methods to prepare
novel materials for heterogeneous catalysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
will provide fundamental information for the design, synthesis, characterization
and application of novel bimetallic systems for hydrodesulfurization by
heterogeneous catalysis. Metal oxide based borides and phosphides of nickel,
cobalt and molybdenum will be prepared and evaluated for the removal of sulfur
from organosulfur compound for potential application in the removal of sulfur
from crude oil and coal. In addition, the research program will provide a rich
multidisciplinary education and training opportunity to undergraduate and
masters degree students in material and surface chemistries.
