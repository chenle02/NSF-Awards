9601570 Raad The goal of the effort is to enable electronic designers to
simulate thermal effects concurrently with electrical effects in the rapidly
developing field submicron electronics identifying potential problems, and
resolving them early in the design cycle in order to reduce design cycle time
and to ensure device reliability through smart design. The requested equipment
will be used to create (1) a laboratory facility for the measurement of the
measurement of the thermal properties of thin film materials used in high-power,
high-density integrated circuits, and (2) a microwave performance evaluation
facility to perform simultaneous measurements of electrical and thermal
characteristics of microwave monolithic integrated circuits. ***
