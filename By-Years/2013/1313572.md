This award will support student travel to the 2013 New Security Paradigms
Workshop to be held in Banff, Canada, in September 2013. The New Security
Paradigms Workshop (NSPW) provides a stimulating, safe, and highly interactive
forum for innovative approaches to computer security. NSPW encourages graduate
students and junior faculty to examine long-held ideas within computer security.
It also strongly encourages non-computer security experts from economics,
sociology, psychology, and other disciplines to bring their expertise to bear on
computer security paradigms. The support from NSF will be used to sponsor travel
expenses for graduate students to attend the workshop. Supporting student travel
to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of
the NSF. Broader impacts include training the next generation of researchers in
this important research area.
