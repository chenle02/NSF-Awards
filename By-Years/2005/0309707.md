0309707&lt;br/&gt;Nielson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drilling is the only means for
accessing the subsurface to accomplish a variety of scientific goals. These
include the collection of pristine rock and fluid samples and the installation
of subsurface instrumentation for monitoring and modeling dynamic earth
processes. Overriding issues that influence the success of a scientific drilling
project are technical complexity, cost and availability of suitable drilling
equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DOSECC (Drilling, Observation and Sampling of
the Earth's Continental Crust) is a non-profit corporation whose mission is to
provide operational support and specialized equipment for the scientific
drilling community. DOSECC now has 50 member research institutions. This award
provides support for the next five years of DOSECC operations. DOSECC has
clearly supported the needs of the scientific drilling community, providing
valuable technical and drilling support. During the past grant period, DOSECC
has successfully completed a number of projects in lake drilling for
paleoclimate and tectonic studies, deep coring for geologic and geochemical
modeling, installation of instruments for monitoring volcanic hazards, and
sampling on the continental shelves. During the present grant period, DOSECC
will continue to provide specialized drilling systems for drilling on land, on
lakes and in shallow marine settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
