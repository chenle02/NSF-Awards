This P.I. will explore the utility of oxygen isotope systematics in organic P
compounds (d18Oop) as a tool for determining community P utilization rate within
the euphotic zone. The marine biogeochemical cycle of phosphorus (P) is
intricately linked to the atmospheric abundance of CO2 through its role as an
important major nutrient and possibly the ultimate limiting nutrient on
geological time scales. Unlike nitrogen and silica phosphorus has only one
stable isotope and thus isotopic fractionations related to phosphate utilization
has not been applied to this system. This would be done by (1) culture
experiments geared toward determining the environmental factors (temperature,
phosphate concentrations, d18O of growth water and food source, species
composition and growth rate) affecting the d18Oop and, (2) experiments designed
to evaluate potential artifacts associated with the analytical procedure. This
proposal has the potential to provide a unique and powerful tool to investigate
present and past P utilization and cycling, and how this might have changed in
space and time and in relation to global climate change.
