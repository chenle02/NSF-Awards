Support is requested to complete the research for a book dealing with the
Japanese scientific community and the Nobel Prizes during the first half of the
twentieth century. The book will have ten chapters in all, seven case study
chapters of eight Japanese Nobel candidacies (two combined in one chapter) and
additional chapters discussing the social, political, and intellectual context
of the project; Japanese scientists' activities as Nobel nominators; and the
conclusions drawn from the study. The time parameters reflect the Nobel
institution's 50-year rule regarding use of archival materials. Conception of
the project reflects earlier historical work on the creation of a modern
tradition of scientific research in Japan after 1868 but with some attention to
developments in the preceding centuries. It is also informed by the intense
public and professional interest in the Nobel Prizes evident in Japan since
1981. Although the physicist Yukawa Hideki succeeded in winning a Nobel Prize in
1949, several other strong Japanese candidates were unsuccessful in the period.
A number of essays and short books have briefly discussed some of these
candidacies but never with any use of archival materials. These commentaries
often assume that each Japanese candidate was wrongly denied an award, and that
some form of racism was likely responsible. While not denying that racism
existed at the time among some in the international scientific community and
acknowledging that such beliefs could sometimes have influence, this study
broadens the frame of reference and advances several other factors to explain
developments: Japanese factionalism, meddling by Japanese officials, the shift
away from German and French and toward English after World War I, and Japanese
concentration in medicine, a particularly broad, highly competitive research
arena.
