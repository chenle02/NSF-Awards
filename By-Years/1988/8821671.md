This dissertation research project will investigate the issue of ethnic
identity in pluralistic nation-states by studying how migrants from French
Antilles promote their ethnic identity in France. The project investigates how
political legitimacy (in particular, citizenship) relates to defensive claims of
ethnic independence. A student in cultural anthropology will study Antillean
migrants in France for a year, using ethnographic interviews, participant
observation and consulting archives on Antillean and other immigrant cultural
organizations. The interaction of citizenship, race, class and cultural
legitimacy or "Frenchness" will be analyzed as they impact the groups'
activities in defensive ethnic independence activities. The student will also
study the home base of the immigrant organizations through fieldwork in the
Antilles. This research is important because ethnic group immigration is a fact
of life in all countries, and an increasing fact in the Basic social-scientific
understanding of the issues that impels ethnic groups to protest their ethnic-
cultural independence is important if policies are to be formulated that satisfy
legitimate goals.
