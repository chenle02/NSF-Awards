In this project funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the
Chemistry Division, Professor Thomas K. Allison and his research group at Stony
Brook University will develop ultrafast laser techniques for studying the
motions and reactions of molecules in very dilute gas phase samples. The basic
approach involves what is called an optical resonant cavity, which will greatly
increase the sensitivity of the laser based measurements. This new technique
will be applied to understanding the basic photochemistry of how molecules move
when they are excited by light, and how they dispose of this excitation
energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project concerns the development and
implementation of new techniques for performing femtosecond time-resolved
spectroscopy using frequency comb lasers and high-finesse optical resonators. A
large sensitivity improvement over traditional methods extends the capabilities
of all-optical ultrafast spectroscopies, such as broad-band transient absorption
spectroscopy and 2D optical spectroscopy to dilute gas phase samples produced in
molecular beams. This enables the study of ultrafast dynamics of isolated
molecules and small clusters of molecules, including designer molecular systems
produced in cold supersonic expansions in vacuum. Initial studies will focus on
ultrafast internal conversion in isolated gas phase systems with visible
chromophores and also micro-solvated systems (e.g. a cluster containing the
molecule of interest and a few solvent molecules). Extension of the techniques
to the mid-IR to study the vibrational dynamics of small hydrogen bonded
clusters will elucidate cooperative effects in hydrogen-bonded liquids.
