The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will turn on shortly and it is hoped that new
strong interactions will be discovered at these higher energies. Many
phenomenological models incorporating new strong dynamics have been developed in
the last three decades. However, such models make assumptions about the non-
perturbative behavior of these new strong interactions, which may be quite
different from the only example currently observed in nature, namely quantum
chromodynamics (QCD) that describes the strong interaction dynamics at present
collider energies and below quite well. Given the recent successes in Lattice
QCD (LQCD) in accurately determining a wide range of physical observables of
strongly interacting QCD, it is timely to use the lattice regularization to
perform non-perturbative calculations in the strongly interacting field theories
that can emerge at LHC energies. One of the projects will be to understand in
how incorporating Supersymmetry into QCD will affect the dynamics of l Electro-
weak symmetry breaking (EWSB). The proposed research is divided into three
projects: (1) studying the left-right current correlation function in QCD, (2)
finding the conformal window for Yang-Mills theories as a function of numbers of
flavors and colors, and (3) probing ''walking'' Yang-Mills theories to see if
they exist and to understand their properties. The PI has an established record
of incorporating undergraduate students into his research program, with a strong
emphasis on mentoring students from underrepresented groups and from
predominantly undergraduate institutions. Many other scientific fields, e.g.
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, signals processing, share common
challenges in data analysis of exponential time series and will benefit from
this research. &lt;br/&gt;
