When Escherichia coli cells exhaust a nutrient, they cease dividing and enter a
non-growing state. When nutrients are restored, the cells can resume growth
quickly. Even after several weeks of starvation, many cells in a culture retain
this ability to resume growth whn conditions become more favorable. Molecular
analysis of the events that occur upon entry into the stationary phase, during
prolonged starvation, and during the resumption of growth, have revealed some of
the regulatory mechanisms that starved cell utilize in order to survive. This
work continues to expand our understanding of stationary phase physiology. We
will analyze the regulation of transcription form two stationary phase-ducible
promoters. To study the starvation signal transduction pathway, we will isolate
conditional mutations that cause E. coli cells to express starvation-specific
genes during exponential growth. We will also investigate the role of a novel
starvation-specific histone-like protein, VTM, in maintaining the endogenous
metabolic activity of starved cells for resumption of exponential growth
starvation. %%% This work addresses a fundamental question in the physiology of
bacteria: how do bacteria respond to and survive periods of prolonged
starvation.
