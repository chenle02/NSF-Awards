Innovative mobile technologies offer interesting opportunities in many domains,
such as health care, transportation, and commerce. They enable distant
monitoring and permit consideration of parameters such as patient's and
physician's mobility. This makes it possible to develop novel applications, such
as mobile health services for telemedicine and assisted ambient living
(particularly in rural areas) and mobile traffic services. Nevertheless, the
amount of data to be generated and queried is very large and diverse and is
collected from multiple sources. The combination of big data and mobility leads
to a major challenge: how to efficiently process queries from a myriad of mobile
devices on a large amount of data, especially when the data are to be stored in
a novel data management system supplied by several cloud providers with possibly
different pricing models? To solve this challenge, this project develops novel
mobile cloud data management architectures and novel query processing algorithms
that leverage mobile users' storage and computation power and take mobile users'
mobility, disconnection, energy limitation, and cloud service providers' pricing
models into consideration in order to improve query response time, while
reducing the amount of money that must be paid to the cloud service providers.
The research is evaluated using both real and synthetic datasets by means of
prototyping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is an international collaboration
effort between the University of Oklahoma (OU) and Blaise Pascal University in
France. For research, both universities participate in the design, prototype and
evaluation of the architectures and algorithms. For education, via Skype, OU
provides lectures on mobile and big data management for the Big Data Management
course at Blaise Pascal University, while Blaise Pascal University provides
lectures on cloud data management for the Advanced Database Management course at
OU. The students in both courses participate in testing the constructed
prototype as a part of their class assignments. The project makes important
impacts not only on research but also on education as it provides training for
graduate and undergraduate students in the areas of critical national needs:
cloud and mobile database management systems, big data and high-end computing.
The developed architectures, algorithms, prototype, datasets and performance
evaluation results are made available to the public at the Website:
