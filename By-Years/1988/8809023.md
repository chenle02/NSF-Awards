A Center for Computational Electronics (CCE) will be formed at the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and located in the Beckman Institute. The Center
shall promote effective use of large computational resources and shared
experiences for simulations including device modeling, process simulations and
particle Monte Carlo codes, which includes physical details as electronic band-
structure and scattering mechanisms. It will provide a forum for the exchange of
ideas and technical assistance for matters involving device modeling using
supercomputers. The Center will not provide directives for research goals nor
will it interfere with the activities of any research group or individual.
However, it will promote collaboration between investigators with similar
interests and make available basic computer codes. The standardization of
material parameters is the second goal of this Center. The Center shall collect,
organize, and format the data for the device simulation community and make them
available in cooperation with the Center for Compound Semiconductor
Microelectronics (NSF-ERC). The Center will support graduate students in a
cross-disciplinary environment with special emphasis on algorithm development
for solid-state device modeling. Futhermore, the Center will participate in the
on-going Visitor's program of the Beckman Institute and National Center for
Supercomputing Application. The Center will act as an international contact with
research groups overseas, to organize periodic workshops, to publish a
newsletter, and to establish and maintain a strong communication network for the
device simulation researchers.
