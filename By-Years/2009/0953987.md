This CAREER project explores the role of variability as a central concept for
organizing the teaching of statistical thinking to middle school students. The
work addresses three interrelated research questions that frame and guide the
project:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) What understandings of variability can provide
conceptual support for the scheme of ideas that underlie statistical inference--
making claims about a population on the basis of
samples?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(2) What conceptions about variability do students
bring to study of data analysis and statistical reasoning in middle
grades?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(3) How can instruction support students in coming
to develop understanding and skill in reasoning about variability?
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is addressing these questions through content
analysis of the variability concept as it is used in statistical reasoning,
surveys of student thinking about the concept, and a series of design
experiments aimed at enhancing student and teacher understanding of the concept.
The project is producing guidance for design of curricula, instructional
materials, and teaching strategies related to statistics in the middle grades.
