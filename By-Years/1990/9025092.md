This project deals with questions in algebra concerning the theory of Azumaya
algebras on a variety. If X is a variety over an algebraically closed field k,
the Azumaya X-algebras are parametrized up to Brauer equivalence by the Brauer
group B(X). The principal investigator will study B(X) using cohomological
techniques from algebraic geometry. Then he will apply these properties to gain
information about the geometry of the variety X. This research is in the general
area of algebra and is an interesting combination of ring theory, number theory
and algebraic geometry. Given a surface it is possible to associate with it a
coordinate ring and with this ring a group in an effort to determine the
geometry of the surface.
