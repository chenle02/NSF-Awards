CCR-0306607&lt;br/&gt;Matthew B. Dwyer&lt;br/&gt;Kansas State
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Model checking is emerging as a
popular technology for reasoning about behavior properties of a wide variety of
software artifacts including: requirements models, architectural descriptions,
designs, implementations, and process models. The complexity of model checking
is well-known, yet cost-effective analyses have been achieved by exploiting
semantic properties of specific software artifacts. Adapting a model checking
tool to exploit this kind of "domain knowledge" often requires in-depth
knowledge of the tool's implementation. We believe that with appropriate tool
support, domain experts will be able to develop efficient model hecking-based
analyses for a variety of software models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To explore this
hypothesis, our project is developing BOGOR, a model checking framework with an
extensible input language for defining domain-specific constructs and a modular
interface design to ease the optimization of domain-specific state-space
encodings, reductions and search algorithms. We will use BOGOR to investigate
the degree to which customization of model checking algorithms can yield
improved&lt;br/&gt;scalability. Specifically, we will adapt BOGOR to reason
about event-driven component-based design models and to reason about multi-
threaded Java programs. We will evaluate the ease with which&lt;br/&gt;domain
information can be incorporated into the framework and the space/time
improvements that can be achieved by exploiting that information.&lt;br/&gt;
