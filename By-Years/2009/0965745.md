A goal of this project is to attract new students to the Computer Information
Systems (CIS) program at the University of Louisville by providing financial and
academic support. The main objectives are to increase the number of students
entering the CIS program and to recruit students from underrepresented groups
for careers in computer science. The scholars are selected by a committee of
professors and specialists in financial aid, admissions, advising, and
mentoring. The university has in place numerous proactive student support
services such as REACH (REsources for academic ACHievement), Reinhardt Academic
Center, Ulmer Career Management Center, and Disability Resource Center. The
program also offers a one-week pre-college summer workshop highlighting the CIS
program content, including hands on lab activities.
