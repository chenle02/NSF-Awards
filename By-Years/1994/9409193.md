The grant will be used to partially support 15 students (~10% of the audience)
at the Nuclear Chemistry Gordon Research Conference, June 19-24, 1994. This year
the conference will deal with topics in Nuclear Reactions with special emphasis
on giant resonances at finite temperature, nuclear interferometry, positron
emission from heavy systems, astrophysics and world climatic changes. These
topics are all at the forefront of current activity in Nuclear Physics. These
conferences have long played an important role in introducing graduate students
to the forefront of research activities with easy informal contact between
students from US and European institutions with the leaders in the field
presenting early results of their current research. ***
