This three-year project will offer one-week summer institutes organized by the
Woodrow Wilson Foundation to secondary school teachers in Purchase, New York,
and the surrounding area. Each year a total of 105 teachers will participate in
summer institutes in chemistry, physics, and mathematics and in follow-up
activities during the academic year. In addition, four teachers will take part
in an eight-week research experience in an industrial or academic laboratory.
Substantial support is being contributed by the university, participating school
districts, and local business and industry, and cost-sharing amounts to 32% of
the NSF award.
