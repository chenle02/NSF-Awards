This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will integrate materials
processing and will develop a new lightweight and resilient three-dimensional
woven fiber reinforced cellular matrix composite (3DCMC) material. Lightweight
materials will allow fuel efficient and more environmentally friendly vehicles.
The 3DCMC have the potential to significantly surpass the strength, stiffness,
damage tolerance, energy absorption, and characteristics of current composite
materials. Predictive analysis for a detailed characterization and optimization
will be performed.

The commercial potential of this project will be a new class of lightweight 3-D
woven composites with cellular matrix; this will benefit the automotive
industry.
