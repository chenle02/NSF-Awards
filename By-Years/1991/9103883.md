The overall objective of this research is to provide further understanding of
the mechanism controlling renin secretion at the intracellular level. The
relevant techniques for initiating this project have been developed and used in
Dr. Fray's laboratory. Recent evidence suggests that renin granules and plasma
membrane contain key molecules which are regulated in the renin secretory
process. The specific aims of this project are: 1) to isolate juxtaglomerular
cells and determine their renin content; 2) to isolate renin-containing
granules, determine their renin content and compare their renin responsiveness
to several factors which stimulate renin secretion; and 3) to isolate plasma
membrane vesicles from juxtaglomerular cells and compare their storage, release
and transport capabilities in response to several factors known to stimulate
renin secretion. These studies will shed light on the cellular mechanism of
renin release.//
