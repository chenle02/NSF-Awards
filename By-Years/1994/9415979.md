9415979 Merrifield During the TOGA COARE experiment, an extensive set of
observations concentrated in the Intensive Flux Array (IFA) documented the
unexpected occurrence of large amplitude internal wave trains propagating
towards the northwest with a seemingly permanent form. These distinctive
features are associated with near-surface current speeds of about 1m/s and
downward displacements in the thermocline of approximately 50 meters. Much like
solitary waves observed in other locations, these events are closely linked with
the semidiurnal tide; this suggests that barotropic tidal flow over island ridge
topography in the vicinity of the observation site may contribute to their
generation. This project seeks to (1) examine the effects of background
conditions, particularly the strong vertical shear associated with the large-
scale equatorial current systems, on the solitary wave groups; (2) compare
finite-depth wave theory with the observed wave structure, propagation speed,
and attenuation; and, (3) investigate the processes that may lead to wave
generation.
