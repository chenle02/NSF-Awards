9306641 Wolff Results from a 13-year study conducted at the Mountain Lake
Biological Station in the southern Appalachian Mountains suggests a dynamic
interaction between mast production and primary and secondary consumers.
Episodic mast production has resulted in population fluctuations of mice,
chipmunks, and other mast consumers. Carnivores, primarily barred owls, exhibit
a numerical response to rodent densities. Seed survival and germination occurs
only during peak mast production years and seedling mortality is associated with
deer browsing activity. Chipmunks appear to be the major predators on ground
nesting birds, and their densities are inversely correlated with junco fledgling
success. This project will continue the monitoring of the major players in these
trophic levels for two years to determine the direct and indirect effects of
episodic mast production on selected primary and secondary consumers, seed
survival and forest regeneration, and community stability in a southern
Appalachian deciduous forest community. Specifically the project will (1)
determine the role of mast production in regulating population densities of
three seed-eating rodent species, white-footed mice, deer mice, and chipmunks,
(2) determine if and how fluctuating rodent densities affect seed survival and
germination rates, and fledgling success of ground nesting birds, primarily
juncos, (3) test the predator-satiation hypothesis for seed masting in deciduous
oaks, (4) determine the role of deer browsing on survival and growth of
understory vegetation, and (5) provide baseline data on these aspects of the
community structure and dynamics prior to the anticipated invasion of gypsy
moths. %%% Research projects of this type are especially important to the
understanding of the complex interactions of populations comprised by the forest
ecosystem. Results from the work should yield fundamental insights on species
interactions as well s provided information applicable to the be tter management
of forest resources. ***
