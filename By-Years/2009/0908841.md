Dr. Thomas Troland of the University of Kentucky will undertake an extensive
radio survey to measure the strengths of magnetic fields in regions of star
formation. He will explore the role of magnetic fields in the evolution of
molecular clouds, which are cool, relatively dense portions of the interstellar
medium containing dust and molecules of hydrogen, carbon, etc. He will also
investigate how magnetic fields may interact with very dense gaseous clumps, to
see whether these fields may differ when high-mass and low-mass stars are
formed. This work will be performed using radio astronomy facilities in West
Virginia, Puerto Rico, and Spain.

The project will have many implications for the theory of star formation. Dr.
Troland will involve students in all aspects of this program, including
obtaining, analyzing, and disseminating the data. He will also build on his
previous experience in K-12 outreach efforts, and will develop a program to
address core concepts in the science curricula for the state of Kentucky.
