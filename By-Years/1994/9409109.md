CTS-9409109 Prem Saint The California State University in Fullerton will lead
this effort to retrain some of Southern California's laid-off defense engineers
to provide industry with "green" engineers versed in environmentally sound
products and processes. The project will train twenty-five to thirty engineers
each year on environmentally sound products and processes. These engineers will
undergo a six month immersion in environmental seminars followed by six month
"externships" at firms in environmentally sensitive industries that may
eventually hire them.
