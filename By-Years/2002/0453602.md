The Applied Mathematical Sciences Summer Institute (AMSSI) is a seven-week
research experience for undergraduates (REU) in the mathematical sciences,
jointly hosted by California State Polytechnic University-Pomona (Cal Poly
Pomona) and Loyola Marymount University (LMU). Summer 2005 will be the first
year of this summer research program for sixteen undergraduates that will draw
heavily from underrepresented U.S. minorities and women; recruitment will take
place nationwide. AMSSI 2005 will take&lt;br/&gt;place June 25 - August 13,
2005. Applications for AMSSI as well as additional program information are
available at &lt;www.csupomona.edu/~amssi&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AMSSI
students will engage in variety of activities intended to provide a well-rounded
research experience as well as a strong support network in the mathematical
research community, both in academia and industry. Guest speakers will include
Ph.D. mathematicians from select NSF IGERT programs and local
aerospace&lt;br/&gt;industries. The academic content of AMSSI will focus on the
theory and applications of linear algebra, probability, statistics, differential
equations, and difference equations. Students will work in groups and will give
oral and written presentations of their research at the end of the
program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The site is co-funded by the Department of Defense
in partnership with the NSF REU program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
