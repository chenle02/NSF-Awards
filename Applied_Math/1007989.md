Leoni DMS-1007989

The central theme of this project is the application of modern calculus of
variations to materials science, mechanics, and imaging. The principal
investigator emphasizes the following specific topics: - Material Voids in
Elastic Solids with Anisotropic Surface Energies. Here he studies how the
qualitative features of the equilibrium shape of the void depend on the
smoothness and convexity (or lack thereof) of the interfacial energy. -
Evolution by Surface Diffusion. The principal investigator studies the short-
time existence and regularity of solutions of a model of second-phase particles
and material voids in a linearly elastic solid. - Non-Local Operators for Image
Recovery. Here he studies regularity and qualitative features of solutions of a
non-local model for image and signal processing proposed by Gilboa and Osher. He
also takes up problems in water waves and micromagnetics.

The central theme of this project is the application of modern calculus of
variations to materials science, mechanics, and imaging. When an elastic
material is subject to stresses, it can stretch and develop voids within the
material; the shape of the voids affects other properties of the material. The
principal investigator studies how the shape depends on the energy at the
interface between the material and the void. The movement of interfaces by means
of surface diffusion is not well understood when the interfacial energy is
highly anisotropic. The investigator studies this problem, focusing on the
short-time behavior; rigorous results here improve our understanding of various
behaviors of materials. He also considers problems in image processing, water
waves, and micromagnetics. The results and methods developed in the project are
incorporated in new graduate courses, and some are included in a series of books
that the investigator is writing in collaboration with I. Fonseca. Graduate
students are involved in the project.
