The proposal is for purchase of two color Sun workstations and ancillary
equipment to support on the recognition of technical drawings and techniques of
image analysis. The automation of conversion of technical drawings into
computer-readable form will make it possible to capture the vast and growing
archives of manually-produced drawings for subsequent computer processing as
needed. The image analysis work is an extension of the applicability of
regularization techniques to include image discontinuities.
