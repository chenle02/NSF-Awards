9412279 Maxwell The American Mathematical Society requests a grant in the amount
of $25,520 for Wiener Centennial Symposium, to be held in October, 1994. Members
of the Organizing Committee for the Wiener conference are: David Benney (ex-
officio; Head, Dept of Math., MIT) Roger Brockett (Division of Applied Sciences,
Harvard) Donald Burkholder (U of Illinois) David Jerison, Chair (MIT) Henry P.
McKean (Courant Institute, NYU) Daniel Stroock (MIT) Isadore M. Singer (MIT)
Elias M. Stein (Princeton) Rather than organize a commemorative workshop
reviewing Wiener's work, the organizing committee intends to use the occasion of
the centennial of his birth to alert young researchers to the many researchers
to the many opportunities in analysis and its applications in the spirit of
Norbert Wiener. The Organizers plan a weeklong conference in October 1994. The
Conference will take place at M.I.T., and the mathematical portion will be co-
sponsored by the American Mathematical Society and MIT.
