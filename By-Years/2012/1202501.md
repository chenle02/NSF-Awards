Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The research objective is to engage pre-college students in
fundamental and innovative education and research projects during the summer,
using system engineering concepts in solving energy and power system problems.
The approach will include lectures on engineering systems, problem solving,
simulations and hands-on experiments. The priority will be to attract and
nurture these curious students to participate in engineering research projects
of national interest. An external review of activities will include industry
experts and others. Furthermore, to ensure the goals of the program are met, a
professional consultant in engineering educational assessment will provide the
matric for tracking and evaluating the impact of the program in the students and
their careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;Develop an
innovative engineering system research model for evaluating performance and
health of energy and power systems using research fundamental techniques and
creativity. The products developed will form a basis for prototypes of needed
tools for analysis of energy networks. The work will be done using a team based
approach with faculty and graduate student mentors. Case studies to test
innovation of the design and validate its robustness will be undertaken by the
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The education and
research activity will attract underrepresented minority to participate in the
STEM project area. Work done will be posted on the web for other outreach
programs. To ensure the goals of the program are achieved, a tracking of the
students' performance will be in place and the lessons learned and its impact on
the role of youth in the competitive energy economy.
