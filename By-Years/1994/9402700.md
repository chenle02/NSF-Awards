9402700 Fournier This proposal is on research to develop a technique which
maintains a pH gradient across a membrane in order to obtain two pH values in
the same reactor. With this approach, two enzymatically catalyzed reactions can
occur at their own optimal pH by immobilizing one enzyme on one side of the
membrane while the other enzyme reacts in the bulk phase on the other side of
the membrane. ***
