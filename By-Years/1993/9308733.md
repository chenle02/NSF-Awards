The purpose of this project is to develop an analytical framework for analyzing
and better understanding the transition of the centrally planed Eastern Europe
economies to a market oriented system. The adjustment process has been going on
now for three years, and there is a better understanding of the dynamics of
change in Eastern Europe. While many state firms have gone out of business
altogether, others are struggling to remain in operation often clamoring for
state subsidies to keep them afloat. At this point it appears that most state
firms have not been able to begin the kind of restructuring required to make
them efficient and productive enterprises. The proximate cause of this has been
lack of progress on meaningful privatization. As a result unemployment
throughout the region has increased dramatically because privatization has not
proceeded quickly enough to offset declines in public the sector industries.
This project is important because it will develop a much needed analytical
framework for assessing policy options for attaining needed reform.
