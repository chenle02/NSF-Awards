ABSTRACT 0203113 Monteiro, Renato GA Tech Res Corp -GIT

In a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem, a linear function of a symmetric
matrix variable X is minimized subject to linear equality constraints on X and
the essential constraint that X be positive semidefinite. Many mathematical
optimization problems can be cast as SDP problems including linear programs,
convex quadratic problems with convex quadratic inequality constraints, matrix
norm minimization problems, and a variety of maximum and minimum eigenvalue
problems. In addition, SDP has many applications in combinatorial optimization,
engineering, statistics, and robust optimization.

Today, there are numerous algorithms and codes available for solving SDPs, and
these methods can be loosely grouped into two classes: second-order interior-
point (IP) methods and first-order nonlinear programming (NLP) methods. The
choice of which class to use for a particular application is determined
primarily by problem size --- second-order IP methods are more efficient on
small- to medium-scale problems while first-order NLP methods are better for
large-scale problems.
