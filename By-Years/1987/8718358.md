This proposal addresses the evolution of male reproductive behavior in birds.
In general, male vertebrates mate promiscuously and provide little help in
rearing offspring. However, males are usually monogamous and they often provide
care to their young. It has long been assumed that monogamy and parental care
evolved in birds because male care was necessary for the successful rearing of
offspring. Recent research, however, has shown that female birds whose mates
have been taken from them are often able to comensate for mate absence. Other
recent research has examined the hormonal basis of mating and parental care
behaviors in birds. By manipulation of male physiology through testosterone
implants, workers have found that increased testosterone leads to both an
increase in the tendency for males to mate polygynously and a decrease in their
tendency to care for offspring. If females are able to rear young without male
help and if polygyny requires only a relatively small physiological alteration,
then the question arises, why has male care evolved and what constrains males to
monogamy? This proposal is designed to answer this question; it proposes an
alternative explanation for male monogamy and a test of this explanation.
Ketterson and Nolan will treat males with testosterone and attempt to quantify
any effect of testosterone-altered behavior on male survivorship. They will then
observe the responses of females toward males, in particular any tendencies to
mate initially with altered males and to maintain or not to maintain the
association over the course of the full breeding season. Their results should
contribute to our general understanding of the evolution of behavior by
permitting a quantitative estimate of costs and benefits associated with
alternative reproductive physiologies. One potential applied aspect of this work
is the greater insight into the evolution and regulation of human parenting
behavior it may provide. Divorce is common in our society and the costs to
children are high. Human males differ from most other mammals in the extent to
which they provide parental care to their young; their behavior more closely
resembles that of birds than the most commonly studied mammal, the rat. Although
it is always risky to draw comparisons between human behavior and that of other
animals, it is also true that an increased understanding of the physiological
and ecological basis for mating and parental behavior may help society take a
more objective look at its own behavior. Because of the scarcity of mammal
models for male parental care, birds may provide the best alternative.
