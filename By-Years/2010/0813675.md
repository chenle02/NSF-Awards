ABSTRACT. The Principal Investigator (PI) aims to study complex dynamical
systems in holomorphic families. The questions are centered on the notions of
stability within families, bifurcations, and degenerations. More specifically,
the PI will pursue (1) questions about the compactification of the moduli space
of rational maps, where it remains open to construct a natural boundary which
captures the information of dynamical degeneration, and to describe precisely
which stable families are bounded in the moduli space; (2) characterizations of
stability for families of higher-dimensional dynamical systems, where the
techniques from one-dimensional dynamics do not generalize, but there has been
recent progress using pluripotential theory; (3) an investigation of families of
polynomials in one variable and the associated space of trees with dynamics,
which provides a continuous combinatorial model for polynomials in all degrees,
and should model the structure of the escape locus in the moduli space of
polynomials; and (4) properties of the transfinite diameter in connection with
families of polynomials in all dimensions, where the discussion involves a
combination of analytic and arithmetic methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A more
general overview:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many open questions around the
long-term effects of perturbations of a dynamical system. The PI studies the
iteration of rational functions of one variable, one of the simplest examples of
a non-invertible system with non-trivial dynamics. In this project, she aims to
answer questions of a global nature: what is the structure of the stable regime
in a complex-analytic family of rational functions? Or, what type of
degenerations can take place and what do they tell us about the bifurcation
locus? The motivation for studying these particular families comes from
interesting connections with hyperbolic geometry, algebraic and arithmetic
geometry, and potential theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
