This project introduces microcomputers into the elementary physics and
intermediate optics labs at the institute. Interactive sessions using digital
movie analysis, sound input and output, and the production of moving graphs are
being used to teach fundamental concepts in mechanics, wave motion, and optics
in a way impossible using traditional methods of instruction. The main objective
of the project is to give undergraduate students a greater conceptual
understanding of these basic principles of physics. Aside from the planned
interactive sessions, the computers are being used throughout the academic year
for routine data analysis and plotting. A shift in emphasis from greater topical
coverage to a more in-depth, exploration-based treatment accompanies the
introduction of computers into the curriculum. Unique aspects of the project
include the incorporation of digitized video clips made during the laboratory
session, and the use of the high-end, fully scriptable data analysis and
graphing program Igor Pro for other interactive sessions.
