This proposal proposes to commercialize the technology, Light Modulated Acoustic
Devices (LMAD) to translate basic research on photonic materials from the
laboratory to the market place. Controlling sound actively using light is
challenging and is considered to be one of the holy grail of acoustics
technology due to the fundamental differences in the nature of the acoustic and
electromagnetic waves. The PI and his team propose to commercialize the
technology to photo-actively control phononic properties remotely using the
novel dielectric properties of nanoparticles embedded in phononic crystals.
Since phononics deals with vibrations, acoustic or otherwise, potential
applications range from active, non-contact vibration dampening for vehicles and
devices, to smart, high resolution ultrasound technology, to environmental
technologies to actively reduce noise pollution. LMADs are part of the
subcategory of technology of photonics, phononics.

Greater dynamic flexibility in existing focused-sound technologies will be
achieved via this technology. Active selective-filtering element for vibration
dampening can be used to filter out selected unwanted vibration modes. Typical
customers would consist of manufacturers of ultrasonic equipment for either
hyperthermic biomedical, imaging, or structural characterization applications.
