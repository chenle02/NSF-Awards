The National Science Foundation (NSF) established the Engineering Research
Centers (ERC) program to advance collaborative, interdisciplinary, and
innovative engineering research and education. The ERC program brings together
academia, industry, and government in a partnership to jointly conduct research
that will lead to transformative engineering systems that address and create
solutions to 21st-centurysocietal needs. Increasingly, NSF aims to support ERCs
in considering not only the needs and perspectives of potential users and
potential buyers—as is standard in the translation and commercialization
process—but the perspectives of other stakeholders potentially affected by new
innovations as well. Continuous framing of the value of the research to a
comprehensive stakeholder&lt;br/&gt;community from its initiation and throughout
the innovation process will help researchers more richly imagine its
consequences. In support of this aim, VentureWell proposes to organize and
facilitate two half-day workshops with ERC leaders, a virtual event in the
Spring/Summer of 2022 followed by an in-person gathering in September 2022. The
purpose of these workshops is to explore whether a Stakeholder Working Group is
needed and if so, to define a charter for the working
group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
