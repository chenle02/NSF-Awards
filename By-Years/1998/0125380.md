This award is to Michigan Technological University (Lead Institution) to support
the activity described below for 36 months. The proposal was submitted in
response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF 0179).

Partners The partners for this award include Michigan Technological University,
North Carolina State University, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, NASA,
Michigan Economic Development Corporation, Upstate Alliance for Innovation (NY),
and North Carolina Technological Development Authority.

Proposed Activities The award will support the following activities: (1)
coupling technology transfer and sponsored research programs in the academic
institutions, (2) create an inventory of knowledge assets at the academic
institutions via an on-line data base, (3) managing and sharing knowledge assets
among the partners via internal collaborative relationships among the partners,
and any new partners.

Proposed Innovation When completed the integrated knowledge management
infrastructure will support university to university as well as university to
industry knowledge sharing. The new system will facilitate the recognition and
management of the full range of academia's knowledge assets with a sharp focus
on identifying, implementing and managing partnership opportunities. The
knowledge management infrastructure will be easily replicated by other academic
institutions and their partners. The innovation is the research to identify
which knowledge an academic institution has that has potential for
commercialization plus development of the information technology needed to
inventory and manage it. Included in this research is the development of
methodology to identify the knowledge of interest to the various private sector
partners, both current and future.

Potential Economic Impact The methodologies should be invaluable to academia to
recognize the value of its intellectual property and to target potential private
sector and government partners needed for commercialization more effectively.

Potential Societal Impact General economic wellbeing that results from new
sustainable businesses will be of benefit to the citizens of the affected
regions. The results will be easily replicated by other academic institutions
and their regions.
