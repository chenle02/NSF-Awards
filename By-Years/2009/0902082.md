This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A request is made to fund additional
and back-up instrumentation for the &lt;br/&gt;R/V Cape Hatteras, a 136-ft long
research vessel owned by the National Science Foundation and operated by the
Duke/UNC Oceanographic Consortium as part of the University-National
Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. The request includes one
item:&lt;br/&gt; 1) Flow-through Fluorometer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts: The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use
instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab
access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost
of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers. The addition
of this underway seawater sampling instrument will enhance the ability of R/V
Cape Hatteras to produce meaningful Coastal water analysis.
