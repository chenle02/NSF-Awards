The purpose of the proposed research is further to elucidate the role of insect
lectins in the defense response against pathogens. A galactose binding lectin
from Spodoptera exigua (beet armyworm) will be used in these studies. This
lectin is easily extracted from larval hemolymph and has been shown to opsonize
potential fungal pathogens which have surface galactose residues. Monoclonal
antibodies against the lectin will be prepared in order to localize the molecule
in insect tissues. Light and electron microscopy will be used for these studies
and in experiments using direct probes to localize lectin receptors on cell
walls of selected microorganisms. Antimicrobial properties of the lectin will be
assessed as well as the fate of opsonized microbes phagocytosed by host
granulocytes. Viability of ingested cells will be determined by conventional
plating methods and by use of a methylene blue staining assay. Finally, the
distribution of lectin receptors on both immunocompetent and immunosuppressed
granulocytes will be examined. Lectins are specific sugar-binding proteins that
have been detected in the body fluids of numerous animal species. Although
little is known about the function of these molecules, it has been suggested on
the basis of a variety of sketchy evidence that in insects they may function in
defense against bacteria or fungi by coating the microorganisms and promoting
their removal by scavenger cells in the insect's blood. This research will
examine this hypothesis more thoroughly and should elucidate the role(s) of
lectins in an insect's defense against invading microorganisms.
