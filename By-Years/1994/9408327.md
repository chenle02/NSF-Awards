9408327 Smolker ABSTRACT Dolphins are notorious for the wide variety of sounds
they produce, described picturesquely as whistles, squeaks, squeals, grunts,
growls, etc. They are also exceptional among animals in that they show evidence
of both the ability to accurately mimic different types of whistles and also to
learn vocalizations. These skills are shared with humans, but otherwise occur
only among some songbirds and parrots. Although there has been much conjecture
about the possibility of a dolphin "language", almost nothing is known about
most of the sounds dolphins use, in part because the sounds are difficult to
analyze. Dr. Smolker project will use a new technique to analyze dolphin "burst-
pulse" sounds and how they are used by wild dolphins in Shark Bay, Western
Australia.
