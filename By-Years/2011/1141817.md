With this award, researchers at Dartmouth College and Stanford University will
be addressing outstanding scientific questions regarding the energy transfer in
the Earth's radiation belts and auroral plasma physics. Energetic plasma
interacting with the geomagnetic field in the near-Earth space (geospace)
environment emits electromagnetic waves across the radio spectrum, and ground-
based measurements of these waves are used as diagnostic tools to investigate
various processes in geospace. This investigation takes advantage of an existing
network of radio receivers located in Antarctica from -70 to -85 degrees of
invariant geomagnetic latitude and operating in the frequency range from extra
low to high frequencies (ELF ~300 Hz to HF ~5 MHz). The Antarctic continent is
ideally suited for these types of natural radio wave experiments since it is
largely devoid of anthropogenic electromagnetic interference such as power line
harmonics and radio frequency broadcast transmissions. The project will focus on
studies of three geophysically important plasma waves. The first, chorus wave is
believed to be a major driver of radiation belt electron acceleration and loss.
The other two waves, auroral hiss and auroral kilometric radiation (AKR), are
generated in the auroral acceleration region and have the potential to be used
for remote sensing of this complex and poorly understood near-Earth region. The
proposed studies are motivated by a recent, exciting detection of AKR on the
Earth?s surface which was unexpected since the currently accepted theory for
these waves generation predicts beaming of the radiation only outward away from
Earth. This research also contributes to the training and education of both the
young scientists and undergraduate students.
