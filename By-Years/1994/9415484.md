9415484 Chapman This study will extend ideas from previous investigations based
on a linear unstratified model. The previous study revealed a new mechanism by
which mesoscale features can be generated when the slope current is entirely
stable. This new mechanism results from the scattering of coastally trapped
waves (CTWs) by variations in the topography and coastline in the presence of a
stable, narrow mean current over the continental slope. The extended work will
be based on more realistic situations through the use of a primitive equation
model. The main processes to be studied are: (1) adjustment of the slope current
to the scattering topography; (2) interaction between changes in the current
structure with the CTWs; and, (3) importance of instabilities in the mean
current on the generation of mesoscale flow.
