Dr. Hayes proposes to apply stable carbon isotopic techniques to organic
biomarker compounds to investigate two problems using a single suite of
Holocene-to-Pleiostocene hemipelagic sediment samples. The first problem is to
use carbon isotopic evidence to resolve the controversy about the source(s)
(terrestrial and/or marine) of 24-ethylcholest-5-en-3B-ol (or B- sitosterol) to
marine sediments. Isotopic compositions of sedimentary sterols will be compared
to those of the same compound derived from known marine (coccolithophorid
culture) and terrestrial (land plant) sources. The second problem is to test a
method to determine the atmospheric partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) for the
Pleistocene-to-Holocene by measuring the carbon isotopic differences between
each of two organic biomarker classes (tetrapyrroles and long chain alkenones)
and coeval foraminiferal shells. The validity of this technique will be checked
by comparing these results against the 40,000 yr pCO2 record measured in
Antarctic and Greenland ice cores.//
