A new technique, the Controlled Flux Technique (CFT) will be used to study
parameterization of air-sea gas exchange in wind- wave tunnel experiments and in
the open ocean. Laboratory studies will be carried in collaboration with
scientists in the Netherlands at the wind-wave facility in Delft. The principal
goals are to quantify the wind speed and wave field dependence of air-sea gas
exchange, and to study the relation of scatterometer backscatter to the gas
exchange rate. A long- term goal is to determine a global map of the temporal
and spatial variability of gas exchange using the satellite- mounted
scatterometer.
