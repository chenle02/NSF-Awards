This project involves basic research in the mathematical sciences, focusing on
understanding a class of geometric objects using novel techniques from related
areas of mathematics (such as complex analysis). At its core, the project
studies moduli spaces---objects that describe all of the possible shapes or
configurations of a geometric or mechanical system. Such spaces are fundamental
to many parts of mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer science,
including both theoretical and applied areas. The basic research in this project
will bring new insights in the use of complex analysis to study moduli spaces of
geometric structures. The project's mathematical visualization elements will
provide striking images and animations that can be used to illustrate the
results of mathematical research to a broad audience. Through its undergraduate
research components, the project will also aid in the development of a
mathematically-skilled workforce and a stronger applicant pool for graduate
education in the mathematical sciences.

The space of marked compact hyperbolic surfaces of a given genus can be
identified with a connected component of the space of representations of a
surface group into the Lie group SL(2,R). The class of Anosov representations of
a discrete group into a semisimple Lie group has received much attention in
recent years as a potential generalization of the SL(2,R)-representations
arising from hyperbolic geometry. While it has already proved to be quite rich,
this higher-rank story remains incomplete. This project will focus on
foundational work on the complex-analytic side of this so-called "higher
Teichmueller theory". Focusing specifically on the complex-analytic aspects
allows the use of additional methods (e.g. pluripotential theory) and the
incorporation of new ideas (e.g. opers), and is expected to enable more progress
than would be possible when considering arbitrary semisimple groups. The project
will incorporate undergraduate research supervision as a significant component.
The PI will also develop mathematical visualizations and software tools for
research and expository purposes.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
