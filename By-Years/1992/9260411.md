This research suggests a new technique for fabricating high speed steel by
dispersing nanosized oxide particles instead of carbide precipitates within the
iron-based matrix. Due to the chemical stability and smaller size of the oxide
dispersoids, the proposed material should exhibit high strength well above 600
degrees C, unlike conventional high speed steels. The processes involved in the
manufacture will be studied here, including firstly the production of iron
powder with the uniformly dispersed oxides and secondly the consolidation of the
powder by casting or standard powder metallurgy. Other benefits of the proposed
material may be improved grindability and fracture toughness, due to the very
small size and greater homogeneity of the oxide dispersoids within the iron-
based matrix. Some of the high costs of conventional alloying would also be
avoided. The research method therefore offers an attractive alternative to
producing superior high speed tooling material.
