9501792 Brinson This CAREER grant is to support research in advanced materials
characterization and modeling in two areas: shape memory alloy materials and
polymer matrix composites. The shape memory alloys of special interest are those
that are potentially of the "self healing" type which are useful in damage
tolerant structures. The coupled effects of physical aging, temperature and
moisture in the polymeric composites will be studied from both the experimental
and theoretical viewpoints. The educational plan involves attempts at motivating
undergraduates and getting graduate students to better understand the process of
learning. ***
