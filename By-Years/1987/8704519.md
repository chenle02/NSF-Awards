This research concerns an experimental analysis of amphibian community
organization. Experiments in natural and artificial ponds will integrate the
effects of habitat selection, disturbance, priority effects, and interphyletic
competition with previously studied impacts of intra- and interspecific
competition and predation on the growth, survival, and species composition of
anurans from the New Jersey Pine Barrens. Field experiments will explore how
habitat selection, priority effects, and disturbance interact to set initial
anuran guild composition. Ancillary studies of resource abundance will identify
mechanisms of interaction. Experiments in artificial ponds will measure the
intensity of diffuse interphyletic competition from aquatic insects relative to
intra- and interspecific competition among anurans. These experiments will also
separate the effects of vertebrate and invertebrate predation on interphyletic
competition among tadpoles and insects.
