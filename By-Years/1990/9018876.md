The hormone responsive glue genes of Drosophila are expressed at high levels in
the salivary glands of late third instar larvae. Unlike the other glue genes,
Sgs-4 is expressed at early times in development and in a second tissue, the
proventriculus. Dr. Beckendorf proposes to use footprinting, in vitro
mutatgenesis, and germ line transformation to establish which cis acting
sequences govern this unique expression pattern. Because the Sgs- 4 enhancer is
made up of multiple, partially interchangeable elements, the interactions of
these elements and the differences in their regulatory functions will be
examined. To isolate trans- regulators of Sgs-4, a monoclonal antibody library
directed against salivary gland DNA binding proteins will be constructed in
phage lambda. Monoclonal antibodies will be isolated after screening with
enhancer DNa-protein complexes. These monoclonals will then be used to screen a
cDNA library. Isolated cDNA clones and the antibodies used to isolate them will
then be used to characterize the regulation and expression patterns of the new
genes and the DNA-binding activities of the proteins.
