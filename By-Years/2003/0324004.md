This project is providing engineering scholarships to academically talented
students who have financial need. The scholarship program is contributing to
eighty percent of the entering students continuing their studies to complete the
two-year engineering technology program. Many of the students being served by
the program are from low-income rural families and Native American communities.
Approximately seventy percent are first generation college attendees. The
establishment of Learning Communities and extensive faculty mentoring are major
components of the overall educational experience.
