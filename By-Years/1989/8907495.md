Dr. Laurence E. Fried has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Fried's doctoral degree was from Cornell University under the
supervision of Gregory Ezra. Dr. Fried intends to continue research at the
University of Rochester under the sponsorship of Professor Shaul Mukamel. Dr.
Fried's area of postdoctoral research will be nonlinear pump-probe spectroscopy
in condensed phases with particular emphasis on solvent response. The
Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important
infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new
Ph.D's and attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical
research and teaching.
