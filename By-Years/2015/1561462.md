The rise in availability and size of clinical data presents rich opportunities
to develop and apply machine learning methods to solve problems faced by
clinicians and usher in new forms of medical practice (such as personalized
medicine) that would otherwise be infeasible. This workshop, focused on machine
learning for healthcare, will be co-located with the annual Neural Information
Processing Systems (NIPS) conference in Montreal, the foremost international
meeting for machine learning research. The workshop will i) help build the
community of machine learning researchers focused on solutions to healthcare
problems, and ii) foster discussions between machine learning and clinical
researchers to leverage machine learning in service of healthcare. The workshop
includes industry and academic participants. It includes a "healthcare
challenges" session in which clinical researchers will bring new problems to the
statistical machine learning community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports
Ph.D student attendance at the workshop, and hence will influence the future
workforce in applications of statistical learning to healthcare. The students
will be introduced to key open questions and interact with established machine
learning and clinical researchers, thus encouraging their investment into this
emerging domain.
