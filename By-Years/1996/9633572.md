This project will work up the data collected during the ALVIN dive cruise that
responded to the eruption on the COAxial segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge in
June 1993. This study involves construction of geological maps, shore-based
chemical analyses of gas-tight samples, reduction of data from the instruments
left on the site for nearly one year, and continued work on microbiological
samples. A significant goal of the program will be to characterize the
relationship between diking, volatile flux, and biological activity.
