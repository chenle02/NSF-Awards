This grant supports the investigator and his group in theoretical investigations
of physical processes in condensed matter astrophysics. The properties studied
include: (1) magnetic buoyancy, superfluid oscillations, and pulsar modulation
in neutron stars; (2) mass-loss effects and phase separation in hot and cool
white dwarfs; and (3) the evolution of and phase separation in brown dwarf
stars. All of these areas are direct extensions of a current research effort.
