Abstract

Award: DMS-0072241 Principal Investigator: Elizabeth Werner

The PI's research deals with questions in affine geometry and geometric
probability of convex bodies as well as with applications. A tool of
considerable importance in the area of isoperimetric inequalities is the affine
surface area from affine differential geometry whose classical definition goes
back to Blaschke and involves the curvature function of a smooth convex body. An
important problem in convex geometry was to extend the notion of affine surface
area to all convex bodies. The solution of this problem has only been completed
within the last decade. At present, many extensions of the affine surface area
exist, several of them discovered by the PI. The new techniques and ideas
developed in the process of these extensions should be beneficial for other
problems, and the PI proposes to apply these techniques to problems of
approximation of convex bodies by polytopes. These approximation problems have
been studied extensively and find application in many areas of mathematics and
computer science. In one paper, for instance, the PI and her collaborator proved
the surprising result that random approximation by polytopes (choosing the
vertices of the approximating polytope randomly on the boundary of the body) is
as good as best approximation. The Gaussian correlation conjecture in
probability and statistics asserts that origin-symmetric convex sets are
positively correlated under the standard Gaussian measure. In spite of several
partial results obtained by many researchers within the last years, including
the PI, the conjecture remains undecided. Optimal estimates for the tail of the
Gaussian distribution obtained in this context by the PI and her collaborators
are also relevant for problems in mathematical physics (see e.g.Differential
Equations and Mathematical Physics, International Press 2000, p.43-51).

The PI wants to get an understanding of the structure of convex sets. To do so
she uses techniques from different areas of mathematics: analysis, differential
geometry, convexity theory. One wants to understand the structure of such sets
as they appear naturally not only in other branches of mathematics and
mathematical physics, but also in applied areas, like tomography and image
analysis, and computer sciences. The PI and her collaborators plan to continue
working on problems where convexity and other areas of more applied mathematics
interact. Currently she is involved in a project related to quantum computing
which uses -among other things- tools from convexity theory.
