This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project in Information-Based
Technology will develop a user-friendly yet powerful software package that
enables users to import marine or fresh water optical data in commonly used
formats; process the data with a variety of ecological and radiative transfer
inversion models to derive essential physical, chemical, and biological
descriptions of the water column; and view/export the resulting information in
convenient digital and graphical formats. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This software
will be the tool that connects commercial optical instrumentation and recently
developed radiative transfer models with the large communities of
oceanographers, ocean color remote sensing researchers, and water-quality and
aquatic-resource managers.
