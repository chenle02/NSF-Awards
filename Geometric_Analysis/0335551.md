The Workshop aims to bring together the community of researchers, from all over
the world, directly interested in the subject of partially hyperbolic dynamical
systems, and related topics. It may be considered a follow-up to the
International Conference held at Northwestern University in May 2001, and the
possibility to turn this into a periodic series, with the next edition held in
Dijon, France, in 2005, is under serious consideration.

The 2003 workshop is organized by three of the best Brazilian mathematical
research centers, IMPA, the Catholic University, and the Federal University of
Rio de Janeiro, and will be attended by some 80 mathematicians, about half of
them graduate students or recent PhDs. NSF support, combined with support from
the organizers, has made possible a very substantial US participation, of more
than 20 graduate students and both young and senior mathematicians.

The topic of partial hyperbolicity emerged in the early seventies as one main
direction in which the theory of complicated ("chaotic") dynamical systems has
been developing and extending much beyond the classical setting of hyperbolic
dynamics, driven by the realization that many practical applications of
dynamical systems to experimental phenomena do require a much broader theory.

The whole subject went through particularly remarkable progress over the last
decade or so, to become one of the most active research areas in dynamics
nowadays, as certified by its strong presence in scientific meetings around the
globe and, in particular, in the program of the last International Congresses of
Mathematicians.
