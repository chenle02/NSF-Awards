9314567 Patterson Our understanding of the orbital evolution, rotation,
photometric waves and emission line behavior in cataclysmic binary stars hinges
on observations of periodic variations in their brightnesses and spectra.
Unfortunately, there has been little systematic effort made to measure these
periodicities and link the photometric behavior with the spectroscopic behavior.
The PI will collaborate with J. Thorstensen of Dartmouth College to address this
shortcoming. The PI will obtain large amounts of photometric data while
Thorstensen will collect spectra for many cataclysmic binaries. ***
