The principal investigators have been developing tilt meters for long-term
monitoring of mid-ocean ridge deformation. This proposal is to construct
additional instruments and deploy them on the South Cleft segment of the Juan de
Fuca ridge in a pilot experiment to ascertain that the instruments will collect
usable data.
