AST-0115612&lt;br/&gt;Adelman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A low-cost spectrophotometer
for use with a new 0.5 meter telescope at the Etelman Observatory of the
University of the Virgin Islands will be designed, fabricated, tested, aligned,
calibrated. It will be integrated with CCD detector and will have a spectral
resolution of 6.5 and 13 angstroms over the spectral range between 3,300 and
9,000 micrometers wavelength. The science proposed will compare stellar fluxes
measured with this instrument with model atmospheres to improve determination of
effective temperatures and to study chemically peculiar stars. This small non-
PhD granting institution has a large education program that will engage many
students in the use of this telescope both for teaching and for undergraduate
research.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
