9311988 Perlis All reasoning, whether by human or machine, is situated in the
physical world and thus subject to time constraints. However, much of the formal
study of reasoning agents ignores this, assuming an agent is able to reason
forever in a timeless present as if the world had stopped for the agent's
benefit. The early work by one of the PIs and his student involved the
development of a family of logics--called "step-logics"--for this purpose. More
recently the PIs have begun to generalize and modify this work, renaming the
formalisms as "active logics". The proposed research would seek to broaden and
deepen the existing results of the PIs in time-situated reasoning, specifically
in the areas of deadline-coupled planning and acting; language-change;
interactive focal points; multi-agent reasoning; and graceful recognition and
resolution of contradictions. All five of these areas are ones in which keeping
track of changing time during the course of reasoning is useful.
