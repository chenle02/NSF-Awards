This scanning probe microscope will have both tunneling and scanning force
heads and will be used for nanometer scale characterization of materials
including solids, fractured materials, solid-fluid and solid-solid interfaces.
The goal of the research projects for which it will be used is to measure both
structure and electronic properties on the nanometer scale. This project is part
of a research effort in the Washington State University Center for Materials
Research which is focusing on the microstructural and microchemical properties
of materials. Researchers from the departments of chemistry, physics, and
mechanical and materials engineering departments will make use of this
instrument. Initial experiments include (a) determination of nanostructure of
thin films of metal nitrides, carbides, ferroelectric oxides, grown by ion beam
enhanced techniques and by laser ablation; (b) observation of fracture and
deformation induced features and structures, particularly in insulating
materials, on an atomic scale -- including dislocation arrangements and the
structure of interfaces; (c) studies of laser ablation of solid surfaces; and
(d) determination of electronic properties of heterogeneous surface structures
using scanning tunneling spectroscopy.
