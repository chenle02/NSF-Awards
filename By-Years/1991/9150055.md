The State of Montana proposes a Statewide Systemic Initiative, "Challenge 2001:
The SIMM Project", designed to restructure mathematics education in Montana.
Building on momentum already underway in Montana in the K-8 mathematics program,
this project proposes to: develop an integrated mathematics curriculum for
grades 9-12; develop curriculum materials; incorporate the use of technology;
increase the number of females and Native Americans involved in science and
mathematics; establish new certification and re-certification standards;
redesign teacher preparation programs; develop an inservice program; develop a
support structure for implementation of the new programs. Cost sharing: 161%.
