This proposal is a request for support of a three-year program of research in
theoretical nuclear physics at the W. K. Kellogg Radiation Laboratory of the
California Institute of Technology for the period from July 1, 1997 to June 30,
2000. The research focuses on novel methods for treating diverse quantum many-
body systems and on phenomenological and fundamental descriptions of nuclear
phenomena in laboratory and astrophysical situations. This theoretical work is
an integral part of the research in nuclear physics and nuclear astrophysics in
the W. K. Kellogg Radiation Laboratory and enjoys a mutually beneficial
relationship with the group's experimental activities. The training of graduate
students and postdoctoral researchers broadly in phenomenological and
computational physics is an important element of this program.
