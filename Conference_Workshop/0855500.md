This award will support a conference on the Topology of Algebraic Varieties at
the University of Zaragoza in Spain. The subject of this conference grew out of
Oscar Zariski's work from the early part of the 20th century. Zariski's original
questions concerning low-dimensional complex varieties, their singularities, and
moduli continue to hold interest today, as more light is shed on them by
continued advances in low-dimensional topology. Topics included in this
conference are braid monodromy, fundamental groups, Alexander invariants, local
systems, mirror symmetry, toric geometry, characteristic classes and Hodge
Theory.

Solutions to polynomial equations, from low degree hypersurfaces studied by the
ancient Greeks to models used in string theory and quantum field theory today,
form a rich class of objects. Reasons to investigate algebraic varieties from a
topological point of view are 2-fold: constraints imposed by the algebraic
structure lead to constraints on topology on the one hand, and on the other hand
topological information can lead to algebreo-geometric information about the
moduli of varieties, and about the nature of singularities. The topology of
algebraic varieties intersects a wide range of research topics including
singularity theory and Hodge theory.
