This award supports the participation of U.S.-based researchers in the program
"Minimal surfaces and geometric flows,'' co-organized by the principal
investigator, to be held January 18-29, 2021 at the Matrix Institute, located on
the University of Melbourne's Creswick campus, Victoria, Australia. The first
week of the event offers two minicourses in the style of a winter school aimed
at junior researchers. The second week is focused on research seminars in the
style of a conference, with junior and senior researchers presenting their
research. An emphasis is put on the interaction between experts in the area and
training opportunities for young researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program
aims to bring together mathematicians from different countries that are
currently working on classical and nonlocal geometric problems, with special
interest in the study of classification and regularity results for classical and
nonlocal minimal surfaces, problems related to spectral analysis of elliptic
problems of geometric interest, maximum principles, oscillation theorems, and
existence and qualitative properties of solutions to classical and nonlocal
geometric flows. The first week consists of minicourses in which junior
participants receive a state-of-the-art introduction to this emerging field,
with an emphasis on interaction and discussion. During the second week, senior
and junior participants will present the latest developments in these areas of
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;https://www.matrix-inst.org.au/events/pminimal-

been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
