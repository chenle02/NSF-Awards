An International Workshop on Copepod Genomics will be held in Thailand in 2008
in conjunction with the meeting of the World Association of Copepodologists.
Funds from this award will partially or fully support at least 12 scientists at
various stages in their careers (from students to senior investigators) from a
diverse set of backgrounds and institutions. The goal of this workshop is to
engage researchers in the development of strategies that will lead to the
development of genomics resources for copepods, a group of plankton which
comprise the most abundant multicellular organisms in the oceans. As primary and
secondary consumers, they form major links in the food web which support many
commercially and ecologically important fish. Copepods are economically
important parasites of wild and cultured invertebrates and fish. Some are
vectors for diseases such as cholera and others are effective in reducing
mosquito borne diseases. Aquatic environments are under increasing threat due to
human activities, including large-scale changes in the global climate. The
ability to accurately assess and/or predict the complex effects of such changes
on the aquatic environment can be improved by the application of genomics,
proteomics and other advanced technologies. Improving the availability of
sequence information for copepods is a required first step towards the
development of new tools and the application of advanced technologies to address
basic and applied questions about this ecologically and economically important
group.
