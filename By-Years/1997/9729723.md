The Upper Bucks Technical School, located in Perkasie, PA is provides both
degree and certificate programs to a student body of about 800. This grant will
help fund Internet access for the institution by supporting the acquisition of a
leased line, connection equipment, installation services and service provider
fees. The students and faculty of the Upper Bucks Technical School need the
Internet connections to be able to access information resources throughout the
state, the nation and the world. The connection will benefit the faculty, staff
students of this institution as well as the community in general. The award
provides partial support of the project for two years.
