9625392 Smyth This project lies in the area of differential geometry and
submanifold theory. The investigator plans to pursue the Caratheodory conjecture
(a sphere in 3-space must have at least two umbilics), the stability conjecture
for continuously differentiable maps in two variables, and function theoretic
aspects of minimal surfaces. In addition, they will examine principal curvatures
of hypersurfaces. Submanifold theory deals with various properties - metric,
topological, global and local - of curves and (hyper-) surfaces lying in
Euclidean and sometimes more general spaces. An important consideration in
submanifold theory is to understand how extrinsic properties of a submanifold
interact with its intrinsic properties. This project contains two of the
outstanding conjectures in this area; attempts to interface with other areas of
mathematics such as dynamical systems theory and algebraic geometry.
