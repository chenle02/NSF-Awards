One approach to understanding the causes of the differences between males and
females as well as the implications of such differences for social interactions
between them, is to perform detailed studies of organisms in which the
"traditional" sex role are reversed. Such species exist, although they are few
in number. This research will involve a detailed behavioral study of Jacanas
jacana a species of Shorebird. In this species males perform all of the
"parental" care of the eggs and young. Females compete among themselves to
obtain access to males. By individually marking all members of a population, the
researchers will detail social interactions and reproductive outcome. The study
offers opportunities to gain insights into the evolution of sex-role reversal
and the origins of exclusive male parental care. It should also lead to a better
understanding of the dynamics of reproductive conflict between the sexes. The
study will provide information of use in assessing tropical biodiversity since
this species is one of the most ubiquitous indicator species inhabiting aquatic
habitats throughout the would's tropics.
