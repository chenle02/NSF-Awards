9354809 Stearns Faculty in the sciences and engineering in cooperation with the
Teacher Preparation program at Princeton University are developing teaching
field experiences for undergraduates. Students, working with University faculty,
prepare a teaching unit related to science, technology, or mathematics, then
teach the unit to students in public schools. Students in three courses in
technology, physics, and engineering and environmental geology work with their
professors to develop mini-units for presentation in pre-college classrooms in
lieu of writing a research paper. The staff of Princeton's Teacher Preparation
Program supervise the field experience and instruct the undergraduates in
appropriate pedagogy. This project brings undergraduates' skills acquired at the
University into classrooms with young students and also provides a bridge
between the university and the pre-college classroom by offering school children
access to lessons on science and technology that enrich their academic
experience. It offers undergraduates direct experience with teaching, a career
path many do not now consider but might with early encouragement and satisfying
encounters with young students. The teaching experience enhances the
undergraduates' learning by having to present the material to others. This field
experience is a new component in the Princeton curriculum, affording
undergraduates the opportunity to hone their communication skills and apply
their studies to a significant area of social concern, upgrading the science and
technology content of the pre-college curriculum. ***y
