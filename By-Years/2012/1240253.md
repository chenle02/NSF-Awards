This engineering education research initiation grant supports an inter-
disciplinary research collaboration between engineers and cognitive scientists
to understand development of creativity in undergraduate engineering students.
The study focuses on electrical engineering students, and uses a series of
validated measures to understand the development of creativity in the junior and
senior years. Data will be acquired using mobile "apps" that will be developed
during the project.

The broader significance and importance of this project will be to help
engineering faculty and course designers better understand how to develop and
enhance engineering students' creativity. The project, if successful, has the
potential to inform efforts to create a more innovative workforce. This project
overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through
preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.
Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by supporting the
development of innovative learning systems.
