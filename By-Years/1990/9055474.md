The Buffalo Society of Natural Sciences plans to conduct a 5 year project to
train 150 mentor teachers (30 teachers/year) and their principals, who will then
train the remaining 1100 elementary teachers in the Buffalo Public School
System. The training would include two 5-week summer sessions (in a Magnet
school that is physically incorporated into the Buffalo Museum of Science) and 4
in-service workshops during the academic years following each of the summer
workshops. This innovative leadership project is a collaborative effort between
the Buffalo Society of Natural Sciences (including both education and
curatorial/science staff persons) the Buffalo Public Schools, and individuals
from local colleges and universities. The setting of the project is enhanced by
a Science and Math Magnet School which is housed within the museum, and by the
school/museum's location in a largely inner city environment with easy
accessibility to minority persons. The project is designed to provide mentor
teachers with a strong science background in pedagogy and content over a two-
year period of summer and academic-year workshops, and to prepare and support
these mentors as they inservice their colleagues. Project staff from the museum,
public schools, and the academic community will provide strong support through
academic-year workshops, site visits and telecommunications networking.
Principals will be appropriately involved, and will work with mentors to develop
a science inservice program tailored to meet the needs of their individual
schools; as a consequence, virtually all of the 1100 K-6 classroom teachers of
science in the Buffalo Public Schools will have been prepared to teach
investigative, hands-on science to their students. Non-NSF cost sharing is
approximately 27.9% of the amount requested from NSF.
