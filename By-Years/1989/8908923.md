The purpose of this proposal is to: 1) provide children and adults with mental
or physical disabilities with an improved educational experience and a more
self-sufficient capability. 2) provide superlative training for the engineering
student who designs, builds and implements a device to help a person in need;
this "real world" experience will certainly generate great motivation and foster
an engineering education with a unique sense of purpose and pride. 3) provide
the engineering school with an opportunity to perform a unique service to the
community. 4) provide the bioengineering academic community an opportunity to
build infrastructure within the university.
