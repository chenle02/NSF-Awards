Indiana University will establish a multi-purpose lab for undergraduate training
in human-computer interface design. The lab will be used as a facility for
computer science students to work in teams on the design of special graphics and
realtime tools for use by selected groups outside the department. The objective
is to provide a controlled environment where students can learn how to apply
advanced computer science ideas to building tools to solve problems that are
important to other sciences and the arts.
