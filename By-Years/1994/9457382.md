Under this National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award, Thomas J.
Curtiss will explore the chemical dynamics of gas/surface collisions. High
purity, high intensity neutral radical beams (for example, OH or CFx where x is
1, 2, or 3) are generated using electric field focussing methods. Charge
transfer interaction mechanisms are investigated using state-selective laser
detection methods to probe vibrational state populations of inelastically and
reactively scattered products. %%% The chemistry of gas phase atoms and radicals
with semiconductor and metal surfaces is central to modern processing methods of
thin films, namely plasma activated etching and plasma activated chemical vapor
deposition. This is particularly true in the microelectronics and coatings
industries. To date, optimization of thin film processing methods has been done
empirically, by adjusting feedgas composition, pressure and temperature. This
study is an attempt to study the surface chemistry more systematically.
