The project is targeted at undergraduate students taking introductory courses in
geotechnical engineering where stability of slopes, retaining structures and
foundations are studied. Digital image acquisition is used to monitor and
analyze deformations of earth models in the instructional centrifuge. Several
didactic units help the students to use the image processing software to obtain
data from the experiments. A manual with detailed instructions on how to build
and use the instructional centrifuge and how to perform the experiments is
available to both students and faculty. A workshop is being organized in which
the developed educational methodology will be presented to educators from other
universities and the material offered for adoption in their
courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the project results are adopted in
undergraduate education the students have the opportunity to get involved in
research like activities with hands-on experience in performing experiments,
data collection and analysis. The project integrates and teaches the effective
use of technology in solving engineering problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project has a broader impact on the education of future civil engineers as it
brings a high tech component into an engineering discipline that is generally
considered to be low tech. By demonstrating to undergraduate students that
Geotechnical Engineering still provides a significant intellectual challenge we
hope to motivate some of the talented candidates to choose it as their career
path.&lt;br/&gt;
