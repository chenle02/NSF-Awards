This award supports a planning visit to the National Cheng Kung University in
Tainan, Taiwan, by Prof. Pierre Larochelle of the Florida Institute of
Technology. The purpose of the trip is to develop a collaborative research
project on a new generation of automated assembly and manufacturing technologies
by applying so-called screw theory to the automation of machine movement in
multiple dimensions or degrees of freedom. This planning visit will be the basis
for preparation of a full-scale collaborative-research
proposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This activity is aimed to develop innovative and
more efficient manufacturing techniques that can make positive economic
contributions in both countries. Such techniques can make the US more
competitive on the global market. Participation in this project will also
prepare US engineering students to be engaged globally.
