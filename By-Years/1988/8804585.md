This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research Equipment for the
Mathematical Sciences program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences. It is
for the purchase of special purpose equipment dedicated to the support of
research in the mathematical sciences. In general, this equipment is required by
several research projects, and would be difficult to justify for one project
alone. Support from the National Science Foundation is coupled with discounts
and contributions from manufacturers, and with substantial cost-sharing from the
institution submitting the proposal. This is an instance of university,
industrial, and government cooperation in the support of basic research in the
mathematical sciences. The equipment in this project will be used by the
Department of Mathematical Sciences at Northern Illinois University to support
research in four projects: A Study of Free Objects in Varieties of Semigroups; A
Variety of Problems in Computational and Combinatorial Number Theory; The
Implementation and Analysis of Superfast Toeplitz Solvers; and Empirical
Investigations of Weighted Least Squares Statistics for testing Log-linear
Hypotheses in Categorical Data.
