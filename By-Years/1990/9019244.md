The program in the McCormick School of Engineering at Northwestern University is
to support seven fellowships for PhD students. Efforts will be directed toward
recruiting students who are women, minorities and/or persons with disabilities;
emphasis will be on selecting those students who would not pursue this degree on
their own. Special efforts will be directed toward motivating and recruiting
well-qualified undergraduate students with undergraduate training in
engineering, the physical sciences or mathematics to undertake PhD studies in
the engineering disciplines. The special resources of the engineering school
will be combined with focused recruiting and support activities to accomplish
the goals of the program.
