This project is developing a program to incorporate modern applications of
separation science in the undergraduate curriculum. This includes the
acquisition of new capillary electrophoresis (CE) instrumentation and new liquid
chromatography (HPLC) capabilities, to continue the upgrade of analytical
instrumentation in the teaching program. New experiments are being developed,
along the following lines, for students at the junior and senior levels: (a) CE
separation and quantitation of biologically significant molecules of high
molecular weight (the instrumentation also provides students with their first
exposure to analysis with nanogram sample quantities); (b) separation and
quantitation of pharmaceutical compounds by liquid chromatography (photodiode
array detection allows students to carry out peak purity analysis); and (c)
optimization of solvent composition and flow rate in LC to determine the C60/C70
ratio in locally produced fullerene samples. This program allows for the
continued development of new experiments, designed to target the fastest growing
segment of our student population the life sciences oriented students.
