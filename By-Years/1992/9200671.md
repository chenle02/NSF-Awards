Superfluid helium-3 has been identified as a p-wave pairing system, possessing
an isotropic energy gap reminiscent of a superconductor. The theoretical picture
remains clouded, however. It is proposed to measure the pair-breaking energy,
using ultrasound at a temperature well below the phase transition, and from that
obtain a value for the energy gap. The entire pressure range from saturation
vapor pressure to melting pressure will be investigated. Other experiments are
planned on heavy-fermion systems and one- dimensional Heisenberg
antiferromagnets. This research aims to clarify some of the puzzles surrounding
the quantum-mechanical properties of bulk matter at temperatures close to
absolute zero.
