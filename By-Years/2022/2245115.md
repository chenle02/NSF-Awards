Enforcing security policies such as secrecy or integrity is crucial for software
systems that handle large volumes of usersâ€™ sensitive information, where even a
short transient violation of these policies may result in leaking or damaging
highly sensitive information, compromising safety, or interruption of vital
public or social services. Runtime monitoring and enforcement of security
policies remains one of the foundational techniques for securing software
systems. Many important security policies such as information-flow policies
cannot be expressed as properties of individual executions, but can be expressed
as properties on multiple execution traces, which are called hyperproperties.
Motivated by a rich set of real-world applications, the overarching objective of
this project is to develop effective runtime enforcement techniques for
hyperproperties that enable strong protection of systems against various types
of cyberattacks and information leaks.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project will
bring about a paradigm shift in systematic runtime enforcement of information-
flow properties, organized within three research thrusts that will develop novel
monitor designs, open-source tools, and perform rigorous evaluation. The first
thrust will develop black-box and grey-box predictive monitors for enforcing
hyperproperties. This thrust will also investigate different input models, in
particular, closed systems where the monitor can manipulate the input to the
system to enforce a hyperproperty and reactive systems where the monitor cannot
interfere with the input, as it is generated by an uncontrollable environment.
The second thrust will focus on developing runtime monitors that are
compositional. The project will design a composed monitor infrastructure where
parts of the system are guarded by different monitors, as modern systems are
composed of heterogeneous components from mutually distrusting sources. The
third research thrust is dedicated to rigorous evaluation by delving into
applications of the researchers' theoretical findings. This effort will apply
results from the first two thrusts to implement monitors to enforce information
flow properties and nonmalleable information flow on real world applications.
The results of this project are expected to have several advantages as compared
to the existing methods: they will be more general, as they can deal with a rich
fragment of the temporal logic HyperLTL and will be transferable, compositional,
and low-overhead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
