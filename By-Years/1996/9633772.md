Stanley 9633772 This proposal seeks funding for production of a document that
will offer recommendations for an NSF initiative in the field of paleontology
under the title Geobiology of Critical Intervals. The intervals in question,
representing a broad range of temporal and spatial scales, include times of
unusual environmental conditions, such as global warmth or widespread oceanic
anoxia. They also include important biotic transitions, such as biogeographic
shifts and episodes of evolutionary turnover. The initiative should generate
studies that provide valuable insights relating to possible future changes in
the ecosystems of our planet. It should accomplish its goals in part by
promoting interactions between researchers who would not otherwise collaborate
with one another-- geobiologists of various types and researchers in such areas
as geochronology, physical stratigraphy, paleoceanography, paleoclimatology,
geochemistry. Funding is sought for a workshop to be held in Washington, D.C. in
the spring of 1996. A diverse group of participants will review a variety of
relevant topics, extract general themes, and assemble an outline for a document.
A subset of the participants will then write the document after seeking input
from the general research community, and experts will review a draft before the
final documentation is assembled.
