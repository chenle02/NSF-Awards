We have known for some time that there is a relationship between life events and
physical health, specifically that negative life events that stress an
individual predict negative changes in that person's health. Recently, there has
been a puzzling research predict a decline in health. This investigator has
found that this occurs when individuals have low self esteem. This suggests that
an accumulation of life events that are inconsistent with the self concept may
result in illness. These ides form the basis of Brown's identity- disruption
model of stress. This research will further test the identity-disruption model
of stress by exploring the difference between prominent or salient identities
and more peripheral identities in relation to life events. We will then have a
better understanding of the complex relationships among life events, self
identity, and physical health.
