Description: This award supports US-India Cooperative Research: Application of
Carbon Nanotubes in Composites -Alignment and Adhesion Problems. US PI John
Fischer, University of Pennsylvania and Rakesh B. Mathur, National Physical
Laboratory (NPL), New Delhi will conduct research on critical problemsthat need
solutions before nanotubes can be successfully used in high strength composites.
The objective is to exploit the exceptional mechanical strength of carbon
nanotubes for the fabrication of advanced composite materials.

Scope: The research groups compliment one another and each group has highly
qualified senior researchers with established research records. Their
collaboration is expected to produce advances that increase scientific
understanding and enhance prospects for technological use of nanotube
composites. The project has clear mutual benefits for the US and India, as well
as potential for industrial application.
