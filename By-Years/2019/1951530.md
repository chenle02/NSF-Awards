The 2020 Summer School on Random Matrices will take place at the University of
Michigan during June 15-26, 2020 period. This two-week summer school is intended
for graduate students and junior postdocs who started working in the area of
random matrix theory and related fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several
non-overlapping techniques in random matrix theory. The goal is to provide an
opportunity for the participants to learn new techniques different from their
own background. Four experts will deliver lectures series and there will be
intensive group problem sessions. The Principal Investigators had organized the
summer school in 2016 and 2018, and they plan to establish the summer school as
a biannual event. The website for the summer school is

evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
