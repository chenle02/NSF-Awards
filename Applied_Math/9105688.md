The principal investigator will study stability problems for viscous flows in
the limit of very large Reynolds numbers (small viscosities) using techniques
from dynamo theory. In particular, he will apply asymptotic methods of the WKB-
Maslov type to problems in vorticity generation. Such methods have proved useful
in studying analogous problems related to the "fast" dynamo effect. The basic
idea is to calculate the Lagrangian trajectories responsible for the vorticity
generation in much the same way that one calculates the Lyapunov exponents
responsible for the generation of magnetic fields in electrically conducting
fluids. A technique that is used often in science may be called "reasoning by
analogy". In this project the principal investigator will use analogies between
the properties of vortex lines in viscous fluids and magnetic lines in
electrically conducting fluids to study the generation and propagation of fast
vortices in slightly viscous fluids by making use of ideas from dynamo (magnetic
field generation) theory. The research has relevance to phenomena that occur
inside the earth, in the atmosphere and in outer space.
