This award provides support for the fifteenth edition of the "Mathematical
Results in Quantum Physics" (QMATH) conference, to take place at the University
of California-Davis in September 2022. QMATH is the largest international
conference on the mathematical theory of quantum physics and occurs once in
three years. Conference attendees will have unique opportunities to participate
in a cross-disciplinary exchange of ideas between the mathematical physics,
quantum information and theoretical physics communities. The award will support
the participation of junior researchers from US institutions, members from
underrepresented groups in the mathematical sciences, and participants who have
no other federal support. By supporting broad participation of junior US based
researchers in this event, the project aims to (1) accelerate progress in the
mathematical foundations and techniques of emerging new directions in quantum
science and technology, (2) attract young talent to this exciting endeavor, and
(3) better equip them for successful research in this area. In this way, this
project will contribute to realizing the 'The Quantum Leap: Leading the Next
Quantum Revolution', one of NSF's 10 Big Ideas.

The broad aim of the QMATH conference is discussion of recent mathematical
results in quantum physics. The conference will feature plenary talks and six
sessions: Spectral Theory, Quantum Information, Many-body Quantum Physics,
Semiclassical Approximation and Dynamical Systems, Disordered systems and random
matrices, New Topics in Mathematical Physics. The session 'New Topics in
Mathematical Physics' will focus on novel mathematical problems emerging from
cutting edge physics. The session 'Quantum Information' aims to facilitate
connections between the mathematical physics and quantum information
communities. For more information about the conference, see

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
