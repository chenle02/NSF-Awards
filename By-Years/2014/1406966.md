workshop held in Japan in December 2013. The field of nanotechnology is very
promising and holds considerable potential for societal impact. Early career US
academic scientists will have an opportunity to participate in a conference held
in Japan. This conference will lead to exchange of ideas and will allow US
scientists to bring home new ideas for projects. Such exchange of ideas will
