A model for size distribution and properties of surfactant aggregations is to be
extended to mixed systems. Extensive comparisons with data for the dependence of
the behavior with variations in state, amphiphile chain, head group, and solvent
type will be made. Molecular dynamics calculation will be extended to mixed
surfactant and solubilization cases to describe conformational effects,
geometric variations of mixed systems, and positional options of solutes.
