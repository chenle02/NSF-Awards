This RUI experimental research program is aimed at a study of the interactions
of photons with negative ions in two series of experiments. Electron correlation
effects bind the extra electron in a negative ion predominantly and therefore
negative ions provide a fertile testing ground for state of-the-art atomic
physics calculations regarding these multi-body interactions. A crossed kilovolt
ion beam/tunable laser system will be used to measure high precision
photodetachment cross sections near the ground state thresholds of lanthanide
negative ions for the first time. The second series of complementary experiments
will investigate inner-shell photodetachment from selenium, lithium, and carbon
negative ions using high-energy photons at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) at
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. These experiments continue a series of
studies by the PIs to investigate the effects of the outer-shell electrons on
the detaching inner electron's wavefunction. The broader impact of the program
focuses on the eduation of undergraduate students through the RUI mechanism.
