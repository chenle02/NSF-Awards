The Hecke algebra and its generalizations are central objects in modern
representation theory. They naturally appear in number theory, representation
theory, algebraic geometry, and even low-dimensional topology. A
categorification of the Hecke algebra was used to define a new topological
invariant of knots and links, known as HOMFLY-PT homology. However, it is
extremely difficult to compute this invariant from the definition. The project
is focused on understanding the algebraic, geometric, and combinatorial
structure of link homology and categorified Hecke algebras, with the goal of
unifying, deepening, and clarifying connections between these concepts.

Recent progress strongly indicates a connection between the HOMFLY-PT homology
and algebraic geometry of the Hilbert scheme of points on the plane, a central
object in modern algebraic geometry and geometric representation theory. In this
collaborative project, the investigators plan to compare and unify different
approaches to the study of this connection and to develop the fundamental
understanding of the relation between the category of Soergel bimodules and the
Hilbert scheme. They also plan to provide an algebro-geometric construction of
HOMFLY-PT homology and to understand its relation to the combinatorics of
Macdonald polynomials.
