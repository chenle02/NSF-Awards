The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP)
through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and
study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the
preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue
STEM graduate programs and/or careers. Elizabeth City State University will
strengthen the plant science curriculum by integrating Course-Based
Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) into two courses required by all
biology majors. Minority and underrepresented students will be exposed to career
opportunities in plant science and the application of bioinformatics.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of the STEM Pipeline for Plant Sciences
initiative is to establish a pathway for undergraduate minority students to
enter plant science careers. A comprehensive approach is used to expose and
engage students and faculty in research-based projects and learning strategies
that are particularly relatable to students living in a rural and economically
disadvantaged region of northeastern North Carolina. This project will serve as
a foundation for curricula improvements in plant sciences. The project
objectives are to increase faculty expertise in plant science research and
pedagogical techniques through professional development activities, improve
student competence and confidence in plant science, enhancing co-curricular and
research activities and increase awareness of plant science throughout the ECSU
community. The project outcomes generate knowledge on the impact of CUREs on
STEM student performance and psychosocial factors within the HBCU
environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
