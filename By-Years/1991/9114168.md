Chua Nonlinearity is an essential component in almost all natural (from ocean
waves to heart rhythms) and man made (from clocks to lasers) systems, but it is
often shunned by engineers in view of its intractability. The goal of this
research is to exploit the use of nonlinearity in engineering, and to develop
mathematical techniques and numerical tools for analyzing complicated nonlinear
phenomena, including bifurcation and failure boundaries, chaos, and the dynamics
of sigma-delta modulation. Among several application areas involving
nonlinearity, the focus is on the design of cellular neural networks for image
processing such as handwritten character recognition (e.g., ZIP codes), motion
detection, and early vision capabilities (e.g., robotic vision). To enhance the
future engineer's ability to derive and validate nonlinear device models, and to
analyze and design practical nonlinear circuits and systems, user friendly
software and hardware tool kits are being developed which implement the most
advanced mathematical theories and recently-developed techniques from nonlinear
dynamics.
