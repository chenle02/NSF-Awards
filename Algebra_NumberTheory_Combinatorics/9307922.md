This awards supports the research of Professor W. Fulton, M. Nori and post-
doctoral associate B. Totaro to work in algebraic geometry. Topics to be studied
include Toric varieties, algebraic cycles, cohomology of arithmetic groups and
K-Theory and relations between algebraic geometry and combinatorics. The
research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the oldest parts of
modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to the point where it has, in the
past 10 years, solved problems that have stood for centuries. Originally, it
treated figures defined in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely
polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not only from algebra, but also from
analysis and topology, and conversely it is extensively used in those fields.
Moreover it has proved itself useful in fields as diverse as physics,
theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.
