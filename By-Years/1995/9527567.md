9527567 Crowe This project is to evaluate the efficacy of the ion microprobe to
precisely and accurately determine 18O/18O ratios in non-conducting silicate
phases, in particular garnet. Used primarily for heavy isotope measurement, ion
probes have recently been used to measure light stable isotope ratios, although
precision limits have typically been poor due to counting statistics and a lack
of properly characterized standards to correct for solid solution-dependent
matrix effects. The PI's have developed a set of isotopically homogeneous, well
characterized grossular and andradite ion probe standards that significantly
improve both the precision and accuracy of results. New, high precision ion
probe data generated by the PI's demonstrate the potential of the technique, and
funding is to continue and further this work.
