This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial biology for
FY2004. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Regulation of heterochromatin by
non-coding RNAs in Tetrahymena." In the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila, a
process called DNA elimination occurs, which allows for the formation of a
somatic macronucleus (transcriptionally active) from a germ line micronucleus.
During this process approximately 15% of DNA sequences, called internally
eliminated sequences (IES) will be eliminated from the newly forming
macronucleus. Although the precise biological function of programmed DNA
elimination is unclear, heterochromatin formation and small RNAs are undoubtedly
involved in regulating this process. The goal of this study is to identify the
complexity of proteins and RNAs that are responsible for targeting DNA
elimination.
