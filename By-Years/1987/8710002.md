Professor Beatty will make a series of measurements of upland deciduous forest
floor species composition resulting from seed fall, overland movement of seeds,
and other dispersion mechanisms. The measurements will be made in a variety of
forest environments including old fields, floodplain forests, successional
forests, and conifer forests. Local relief will also be considered. The project
is designed to determine whether seed dispersal is the controlling factor in
species colonization or whether environmental conditions are more important. The
project will yield a deeper understanding of the determinants of vegetational
change and succession, and contribute thereby to basic and applied biogeography.
The findings will also contribute to our understanding of successional processes
of a spatial nature among other phenomena at larger scales of analysis.
