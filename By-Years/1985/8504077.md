This research will investigate a variety of topics in discrete optimization. The
models derive from integer programming problems of broad applicability in
operations research, computer science, and many areas of the natural,
engineering, mathematical, and social sciences. The apparent computational
intractibility of the most general such models is well known; thus, highly
structured combinatorial optimization models are the focus of the proposed
research. The models to be studied are frequently directly applicable to real-
world problems and in other instances serve as components in solution
methodology for more general models. Algorithmic insight gained from study of
such highly structured models is often a useful guide in the design of heuristic
solution procedures of general applicability. Two major research projects are
proposed. First, a classification scheme for combinatorial packing and covering
models is proposed as a means to guide further research on problems related to
supply-demand networks, production scheduling, stock cutting, two-terminal cut
packing, branchings, and vertex packing. Second, a linear duality model is
proposed as a unifying framework for investigating duality properties of linear
subspaces, polyhedral cones, rational geometric lattices, and certain classes of
integer programming problems.
