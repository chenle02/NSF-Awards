This proposal covers a project to design and fabricate normal-incidence multiple
quantum well infrared detectors (QWIPs) in a collaborative effort between ETDL
and Cornell University. QWIPs have been investigated as potential components of
high performance, two-dimensional imaging arrays. At ETDL, research on the QWIPs
use electrons as carriers, with detectivities competitive with II-VI detectors
commercially available. However, because of the selection rule for an electron
to undergo an intersubband transition normal incidence illumination of a an
array of detectors is not possible. In response to this, QWIPs using hole
intersubband transitions have recently been investigated.
