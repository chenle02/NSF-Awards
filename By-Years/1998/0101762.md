This award will provide partial support for the second National Innovation
Summit to be held at the University of California, San Diego, on April 5-6,
2001. The Summit will serve as a forum for over 150 public and private sector
leaders to discuss issues pertinent to the nation's economic competitiveness and
technological innovation. The core components of the agenda, which highlight
NSF's research and education goals, include winning the skills race, sustaining
American leadership at the frontiers of discovery and research, and
strengthening regional innovation capabilities. In each of these areas, leaders
will define strategic challenges, illuminate them with policy research, and
develop broadly supported policy recommendations advancing the national
interest. Consequently the Summit will raise awareness of the close connection
between innovation and competitiveness in the global economy.
