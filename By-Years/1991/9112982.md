Attitudes toward racial minorities can have powerful effects on the voting
behavior of Americans. This is true even in the great majority of campaigns
where candidates avoid explicit references to race or direct appeals to racial
attitudes. This doctoral dissertation research explores the psychological
processes through which race can influence the voters' evaluations of candidates
in the absence of explicit racial messages. Specifically this study draws upon
theories from cognitive psychology to develop and test a psychologically
realistic model both of the process by which voters draw inferences about the
racial positions of candidates and of the effects these inferences have on
support for candidates. A series of laboratory experiments involving fictitious
candidates and campaigns will be conducted in which the effects of various
campaign slogans are assessed. When completed this study will increase our
understanding of the continuing effects of race on political attitudes and
behavior in the United States.
