of establishing a specialized educational news service aimed at both commercial
and noncommercial news programs. During this planning phase they will: {SYMBOL

project. This committee will examine such issues as what types of information
should be included in such a news service, how stories will be selected and by
whom, how accuracy and balance of each story will be determined, and how to
assess the effectiveness of the effort in terms of impact on viewers interests,
knowledge, and action; {SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h} conduct market research
to ascertain the receptiveness of the television news markets to an information
product of this type, {SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h} analyze the methods by
which stories could be effectively and economically distributed, and {SYMBOL 183

scope.
