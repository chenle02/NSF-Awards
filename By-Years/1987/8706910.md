The primary objectives of this project are to numerically solve the problem of
soliton generation by ships moving in restricted water, and to compare the
predictions directly with available experimental data. Two different nonlinear
and unsteady shallow-water wave equations will be solved for the case of a ship
moving in a channel. The equations will be approximated by a finite difference
method. All the rigid boundary conditions, including the body boundary
condition, will be exactly satisfied.
