The investigator proposes to study a number of interrelated topics having to do
with representation theory and harmonic analysis for reductive groups over local
fields. There are four general topics, some of which are divided up further. The
first topic concerns bad reduction of Shimura varieties and related matters
involving crystals and isocrystals. The second topic concerns transfer factors
in various settings: inner forms, Shimura varieties, descent for twisted
transfer factors. The third topic concerns the boundary terms in the Lefschetz
formula for Shimura varieties modulo~$p$. The fourth topic concerns geometric
methods of studying orbital integrals for groups over local fields of finite
characteristic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In less technical language the
investigator proposes to study a number of topics that belong to the theory of
automorphic forms, a beautiful area of mathematics with ties to all three main
branches of mathematics: algebra, analysis and geometry. The last several
decades have been exciting times for workers in this area, one of the highlights
being the essential use of automorphic forms in Wiles's spectacular proof of
Fermat's Last Theorem, another being the work of Lafforgue for which he received
a Fields Medal at the last International Congress of Mathematicians. The coming
decades promise many further exciting developments, and the investigator hopes
to contribute to these directly, by solving some of the questions raised in the
proposal, as well as indirectly, by helping to train young workers in this
technically demanding field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
