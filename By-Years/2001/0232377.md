This Small Business Innovation and Research Phase I project will design and
develop an innovative technology that enables those at the edge of the Internet
to easily and efficiently become Web publishers. The solution is a compatible
enhancement to the existing Web that counters the notion that all Web content be
published in a hub and spoke fashion from central servers. The primary
distinction between Web server and client thus becomes one of chosen roles, not
physical location in a fixed topology. The project addresses the special needs
of lightweight Web publishing, including intermittent connections (dial-up and
wireless), location independence (roaming, dynamic DNS/IP address), modest
resources (handheld devices), and limited bandwidth. The solution builds upon
Creare's RBNB DataTurbine middleware, which provides asynchronous access to
cached sequential information, a proven technology for peer-to-peer data
distribution at educational and government research facilities. The project
adapts and applies RBNB as a Web solution (WebTurbine), and, in Phase I, will
demonstrate it by establishing a wireless Web publisher and publishing live
video images to the Internet (viewable by our NSF sponsors).

Commercialization Prospects: Millions of new publishers, now inhibited by cost
and technical hurdles, will publish to the Internet. The unique capabilities of
RBNB will enable the scientific and educational community to collaborate in a
manner far more time-sensitive and flexible than is now possible. Our solution
creates new commercial opportunities for seamless streaming media, a new
approach to virtual private networks, and a micro payment pay-per-transaction
model.
