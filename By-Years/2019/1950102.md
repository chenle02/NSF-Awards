Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) in Mathematical Analysis and
Applications is an eight-week program at the University of Michigan Dearborn to
take place in Summer 2020, 2021, and 2022. The program will host eight
undergraduate students from a diverse background. The main objective of the
program is to contribute to the mathematical infrastructure by recruiting and
training younger generations of researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
undergraduate research program at University of Michigan Dearborn will bring
together eight undergraduate students and five faculty members to work on
research projects for eight weeks in the summer of 2020, 2021, and 2022. The
goal of this summer program is to provide students a rich intellectual
environment in order to practice employing mathematical ideas in solving real
life problems. Participants will have unique interaction with experienced
faculty mentors on projects including complex analysis, real analysis, harmonic
analysis, stochastic analysis, probability theory, algebraic music theory,
algebraic geometry, inverse problems. Additionally, students will learn more
about the graduate school application process and career opportunities in
academia and in industry. The program will be designed to recruit students from
underrepresented groups, women, and first generation college students. Students
will experiment, conjecture, provide rigorous solutions and present results in
different formats. The program will introduce participants to a big network of
mentors and peers, which will assist them in career planning and in commitment
to the scientific community. Additionally, the program organizers will help
students finding appropriate venues to present and publish their
results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
