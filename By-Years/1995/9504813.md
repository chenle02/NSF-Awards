Chang, Fang-Ru C. EAR-9504813 The Fellow will study mechanisms of trace metal
adsorption and desorption by clay minerals in the presence of competing cations
and chelating agents. Synchrotron radiation based X-ray absorption spectroscopic
studies will be used to investigate the interactions between surface functional
groups of clay minerals and aqueous species in the interfacial region. Results
of this study will improve our understanding of biogeochemical weathering and
dissolution of clay minerals. The study will provide molecular level information
that will be useful for refining solute transport models, and it may also shed
new light on phytoremediation techniques. The application of XAS to characterize
metal adsorption sites on clays is an important application of this new
technique; the more common empirical models of adsorption/desorption are no
substitute of solid structural information. This opportunity allows the Fellow
to master a new technique, combine it with her established strength in clay
chemistry, and make solid contributions to a societally relevant problem.
