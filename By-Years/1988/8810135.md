This grant is to allow the principal investigator and the University of Iowa to
purchase a modern general purpose materials testing machine to replace the
1960's vintage machine now in use. The new machine will be dedicated to research
on the mechanical properties of ice. The University of Iowa has one of the
foremost laboratories in ice mechanics among American universities but the rapid
evolution in testing technology has left them with equipment not capable of
performing the types of tests now being performed in leading research
institutions. This equipment will allow them to begin work in new and important
areas involving physical properties of ice.
