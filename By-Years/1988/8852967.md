This project updates the curriculum in psychology involving computer
applications linked to scientific equipment. It serves instructional and
research needs of the psychology department. The new equipment replaces outdated
and non-operational existing equipment. It enables classroom instruction and
student research in psychophysiology, with the new four channel recorder of
psychophysiological data. Undergraduate education is further enhanced by
incorporating the application of computer technology with modern
psychophysiological recording techniques. The award will be matched by an equal
sum from the grantee.
