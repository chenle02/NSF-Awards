Over the past century scholars have commented on the incursion of organized
political interests into the judicial process. Based on this work, we have
accumulated a good deal of descriptive data about the type and frequency of
interest group participation in judicial proceedings. Most of the existing
research, however, is not theoretically informed but rather largely descriptive
and idiographic. The largest barrier to the development of theoretically-
oriented work is the lack of uniform, systematic, and comprehensive data, a
failing this project intends to remedy. This collaborative project will create a
multi-user database on the participation of organized interests as amici curiae
("friends of the court") in federal appellate courts and in state courts of last
resort. For all cases containing at least one amicus curiae brief, the database
will house information on the identity of the amici, their reasons for
participating, and the position they urged the court to adopt. This database
will be linked to existing databases including, the NSF-supported U.S. Supreme
Court and the U.S. Courts of Appeals Databases. The database will be updated
annually by the investigators.
