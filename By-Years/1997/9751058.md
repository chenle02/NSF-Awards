The college has had two problems with its laboratory science courses, both open
to a single solution. One problem is that, as a result of 6 years of no state
equipment funding, most of the courses (many of which are new) have only minimal
equipment to support instruction and laboratory activities. This equipment is
too scanty when science is proliferating and student knowledge and interest are
declining. The other problem is that providing equal educational access to
residents of six outlying counties requires delivering courses through distance-
learning teleclassrooms. Off-campus students, however, lack access to science
laboratories for laboratory experiments and procedures. The college seeks to
develop the IDEALS system, which uses a combination of computers, internet,
software, and broadcast technology to enrich each laboratory science course
while providing off-campus students with fully effective laboratory experiences.
The system matches computer software, Internet websites, and other resources
with each learning objective and laboratory activity in 11 science courses.
Content learning is enriched by graded assignments using these resources. Off-
campus students use these resources to effectively emulate live laboratory
activities. All students have the same laboratory reports, learning activities,
and tests. Four biology and astronomy courses can be converted during the first
2 years, with the remaining seven courses converted during the following 18
months. Ten evaluative activities will answer three questions: the magnitude and
the quality of these new learning activities and their impact on student
learning. *
