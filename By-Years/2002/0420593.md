Many ecosystems, including caves, oceanic islands, streams and rivers, ponds,
reservoirs,&lt;br/&gt;and estuaries rely on allochthonous inputs (i.e., inputs
from outside the system per se). The emergence of periodical cicadas constitutes
a large and infrequent allochthonous nutrient and energy subsidy into small
ponds and streams. This project will be the first to measure the importance of
fluxes of carbon and nutrients to aquatic systems via cicada carcasses in an
attempt to quantify their importance to aquatic ecosystems. The approach will
quantify the impacts of this subsidy on aquatic ecosystems using large outdoor
mesocosm experiments in which experimental food webs will be studied that
receive different amounts of cicada subsidy. Field surveys of cicada flux rates
to aquatic systems, mathematical modeling of food web dynamics, and small,
mechanistic experiments will also be performed. This research would also provide
a one-time opportunity for undergraduates to experience a very infrequent,
important ecological event, and would take advantage of Miami University's REU
Program. &lt;br/&gt;
