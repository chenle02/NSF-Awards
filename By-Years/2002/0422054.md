Each year, for four years, this project provides scholarships to 25 academically
talented, financially needy, Bennett College students majoring in CSEM
disciplines. Scholarship recipients should either receive a baccalaureate degree
in mathematics or computer science in four years, or transfer after 3 years to
an engineering school to earn an engineering degree within 2 years. Recruitment,
retention and academic support are critical components of this project. In
conjunction with Bennett College's Office of Enrollment Services, an aggressive
recruitment campaign is used to attract CSEM majors to Bennett College. For
retention, Bennett College provides a quality curriculum, excellent teaching,
mentoring, academic enrichment experiences, and exceptional academic support.
Bennett College works closely with their Center for Teaching, Learning, and
Technology (CTLT) to ensure that students are provided necessary counseling,
tutoring, and skills building sessions. Bennett College also collaborates with
academic and industry partners on cutting-edge curriculum enhancements, career
planning and placement, and student internship opportunities.
&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit Statement: Infrastructure enhancements for
research and education are realized through the industry and academic
partnerships. In addition to career planning and curriculum review, the industry
partnerships lead to future support through scholarships, internships,
recruitment and capital campaign involvement. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts
Statement: PASS scholarship recipients are Bennett College students, mostly
African American women from across the USA. The participation of
underrepresented groups is broadened in terms of gender, ethnicity, and
geography. Societal benefits include the production of highly qualified high
tech professionals and leaders; and, through the inclusion of minorities and
women, a more diverse and nationally representative workforce. &lt;br/&gt;
