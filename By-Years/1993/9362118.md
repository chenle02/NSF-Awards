ABSTRACT -- III-9362118 PI: GREENWALD Evaluations of the use of laser diode
arrays focused directly onto the work piece for rapid heating of materials was
proposed. Laser diode arrays are much smaller and more efficient than flash
lamps or other electrically powered laser, such as CO2. An instrument the size
of a hot air blower could deliver over ten kilowatts of light energy for
hardening the surface of alloys in structures such as boats or planes, or a
smaller instrument could be run over the surface of an intricate piece without
the elaborate set up now required on large laser systems. In Phase I the use of
waveguide focusing will be used to bring the 1 MW/cm2 light intensity available
at the output of each laser in the array to a common homogenous beam. A small,
mobile instrument will be fabricated to apply the light beam so generated to
altering polymer surface properties, hardening tool steels and ceramics used for
cutting, improving wear of bearings and biomedical implants, and oxide reflow on
semiconductor circuits. In Phase II the wavelength and array size will be
optimized to match specific applications which appear feasible from Phase I
tests.
