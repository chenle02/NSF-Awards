This US-Poland Marie Sklodowska-Curie Joint Fund Research project between Dr.
Natalia Sobczak of the Foundry Research Institute, Krakow, and Dr. P. Rohatgi of
the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee is on "Complex Investigations of the
Interfacial Phenomena of the Liquid Metals in the Contact with Solid Bases."
This is an important topic in metals research relevant to processing metal
alloys and composites. Experts need more and improved data on this subject. This
research would by necessity go beyond routine data generation to improve
techniques for taking these measurements. Much of the proposal aims to improve
measuring techniques. This project in metallurgy fulfills the program objective
of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in Poland and the
United States to combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas of
strong mutual interest and competence.
