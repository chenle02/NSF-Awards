This is a planning grant for a Trial of Time exhibit at the Grand Canyon, which
will be the centerpiece of an effort to provide a unique and dynamic interaction
of scientists, educators, the National Park Service and geoscience students of
every level and age. The Trail may be integrated with the "Heritage Education
Center", a concept that is evolving at the Park. Once the scientific and
information technologies infrastructure exists, the PIs will develop geoscience
education components at three separate educational levels: a college-level
curriculum component, a K-12 component, and an informal education component. The
spectacular and varied geology of the Grand Canyon and the Trail of Time present
an unparalleled educational opportunity at all these levels.
