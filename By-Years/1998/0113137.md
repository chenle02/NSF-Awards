EIA-0113137&lt;br/&gt;Yanhua Shih&lt;br/&gt;University of Maryland Baltimore
County&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: ITR: Quantum Entanglement, Information and
Computation&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project consists of a series of
experimental and theoretical investigations on multi-photon entangled states and
their fundamental role in quantum information and quantum computing. Major
efforts underway include experimental and theoretical investigations on N-photon
(N&gt;2 entangled states) and on "partial entanglement" in quantum information
and quantum computation theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theoretical
characterization of entanglement in mixed states is at the core of this project.
The experimental investigations focus on two projects. The first one is the
realization of source of three-photon entangled states. These may lead to
experimental generation of GHz states. The second experimental project is
quantum teleportation based on the improvement on the realization of Bell-state
detection.&lt;br/&gt;
