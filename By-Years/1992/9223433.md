Dr. Wayne L. Gladfelter of the Chemistry Department, University of Minnesota,
will investigate the mechanisms of metal-catalyzed carbonylations of organic
compounds. Support for this Environmentally Benign Chemical Synthesis and
Processing project will be provided by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
Organometallic Chemistry program. Gladfelter will collaborate with Dr. John
Grate of Catalytica. In situ IR and NMR methods will be used to monitor
carbonylation reactions of nitroaromatics to form isocyanates. The catalyst
precursors will be Ru3(CO)12 and various ruthenium carbonyls having phosphine
and phosphite ligands. The pertinence of the work to Environmentally Benign
Synthesis is that the reactions afford a method to bypass the use of phosgene (a
hazardous intermediate) in the synthesis of isocyanates. Additional studies will
focus on the use of these and related catalysts in asymmetric synthesis and
hydrogenation of polar compounds. %%% Polyurethanes are produced in great
quantity in the chemical industry, especially in the production of insulation.
The present route to polyurethanes entails the conversion of nitroaromatic to
isocyanate compounds with a highly toxic species, phosgene, being used in great
amounts during this conversion. A new catalytic method that bypasses the use of
phosgene is to be studied. At present the method shows great promise, but much
needs to be learned about how it functions. Catalytica is a California-based
company that creates and commercializes economic and environmentally
advantageous catalytic technologies for the petroleum refining, energy, and
chemical industries.
