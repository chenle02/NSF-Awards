Serological techniques are examined to improve the geometric characterization
of fracture surfaces and microstructural features in three dimensions. This
research is based on a solid foundation developed in past research by the
principal investigators in the areas of experimental measurements, computer
simulations, and theoretical stereology. Emphasis is placed on techniques to
estimate spatial distribution of microstructural features in three-dimensions
from measurements on plane sections; quantification of anisotropy of fracture
surfaces and microstructural features from plane section measurements; and
quantification of fractal characteristics and surface roughness of fracture
surfaces from fracture surface profiles. Although the research centers on 4340
steel, copper, and a metal-matrix composite, the science applies to all
materials.
