This grant provides funding for exploring the development of a novel fiber optic
acoustic system for high-frequency bandwidth measurements. The novelty of the
sensor system will be derived from the inclusion of extrinsic sensing
capabilities based on a Fabry-Perot cavity, an integrated optical circuit based
phase modulator, a high-speed photo detector, and a digital demodulation scheme
based on a new multi-step phase stepping algorithm. The Fabry-Perot cavity will
be located between the fiber tip and the diaphragm structure of the sensor, and
the Mach-Zehnder interferometer in the phase modulator will be path matched with
the Fabry-Perot arrangement to act as a read-out interferometer. Both
experimental efforts and analytical efforts will be pursued for developing the
sensor and understanding the sensor mechanics.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;A potential
risk involved in the development of this sensor system is that it may not be
amenable to multiplexing as the other fiber-optic sensors. If successful, the
development of this sensor system will have a tremendous impact on integrated
active control systems for sound and vibration transmission problems where
currently multiplexable sensors for high-frequency bandwidth applications are
not readily available. Furthermore, if the sensor system is adapted, it can be
used for high-frequency bandwidth pressure measurements in underwater flows. The
sensor system may also have applications in the automotive industry such as
ignition chambers&lt;br/&gt;
