Over the past century, algebraic topology has developed many sophisticated
methods and tools to study geometric "shapes". Motivic homotopy theory, provides
a framework to apply tools from algebraic topology, to the study of algebraic
varieties and to important algebro-geometric invariants such as vector bundles,
quadratic forms, algebraic cycles, and rational points. This project will study
structural and computational aspects of homotopy theory for algebraic varieties
with an emphasis on geometric applications. Broader impacts of this project
include work with incarcerated individuals, as well as work with undergraduate
and graduate students.

In this project, the PI will combine equivariant and higher categorical
techniques to study ramifications of recent developments within motivic homotopy
theory. In the first part of the project, the PI proposes to further develop
tools to study normed motivic spectra, with a focus on orientations. In the
second part, the PI proposes to focus on computations of equivariant motivic
invariants and slice spectral sequences. In the third the PI proposes to develop
a theory of equivariant framed correspondences and apply this to the study of
equivariant motivic loop spaces.
