Expectations set forth by the mathematics professionals in the AMATYC
standards, and by business and industry leaders in the SCANS Report, recommend
that students entering the workforce be prepared to (1) gather, display, and
analyze real-world data and then communicate their findings; (2) understand how
to integrate concepts in math with science or engineering or liberal arts
through data gathering and problem-solving experiences; and (3) be able to use
new technologies and recognize them as valuable instructional tools. This
project uses TI-92 calculators in conjunction with the Calculator-Based
Laboratories (CBLs) for its three comprehensive instructional sites in order to
address workforce expectations and help students become active learners in
mathematics. With this equipment, students can engage in class or small group
projects that solve realistic problems. CAS software has not been available for
classroom use in precalculus or calculus, science, or engineering technology
courses. Faculty who have used graphing calculators can attend a CAS Short
Course. Faculty, upon return, can train their colleagues in developing classroom
activities using the TI-92 in combination with the CBL in mathematics and
science classes. The faculty training and development of classroom activities
can be shared via a World Wide Web site on the Internet and at state and
national professional meetings.
