Nelson & Gaunt 96-13674 The Borror Laboratory of Bioacoustics (BLB) is a unit
within the Department of Zoology of The Ohio State University, and is located in
the College of Biological Sciences' Museum of Biological Diversity. The BLB
houses one of the largest collections of recorded animal sounds in the world,
containing approximately 23,200 recordings of over 1000 species of animals. A
current catalog is available for browsing by Internet. The BLB is also a center
of active research by faculty, staff, and students on animal sounds. This
project will copy the entire collection to digital compact disc (CD-R), and
restore and duplicate (if necessary) analog tapes of animal sounds; these copies
will then be stored in the University archive. Having the sounds in the new
digital format will enable Internet transmission of the sounds, make possible
the integration of audio and text data in a common file structure, and assist
with rapid retrieval of requested sounds, as well as assuring permanence of the
collection by enabling cloning of the data into newer digital formats as these
become available. The OSU is partnering with the NSF in funding this project by
purchasing a number of equipment items needed for the work being funded by this
award.
