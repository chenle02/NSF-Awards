The purpose of this cooperative project between Dr. Israel E. Wachs of Leigh
University and Dr. Jerzy Haber of the Institute of Catalysis and Surface
Chemistry of the Polish Academy of sciences is to establish a unified,
scientific understanding of metal oxide interactions at interfaces and the
influences of these interactions upon catalysis. The two research groups have
thus far pursed parallel, complementary approaches which, when combined, will
contribute to more rapid advancement in our fundamental understanding of these
phenomena. Supported vanadium oxide and molybdenum oxide catalysis are chosen as
the focus of the project because of the importance of these catalytic materials
and the prior research efforts of both investigators with these materials. The
project fulfills the NSF U.S.-Eastern Europe Cooperative Science Program's
objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the
United States and eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool
resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
