Improvements in microscopic data collection and analysis are needed for research
activities of the faculty in the biological sciences. To replace obsolete
facilities, improve instrumental resolution, and increase operating efficiency,
the PIs propose to purchase a new scanning electron microscope and to equip the
existing transmission electron microscope with an image acquisition system. The
latter will allow the PIs to link the transmission electron microscope/image
acquisition system to the University's computer network, including the Cray YMP
supercomputer in Columbus, to facilitate work on the three- dimensional
organization of large structures. The proposed acquisition will enhance the
research potential of several investigators and allow others to work on problems
that cannot currently be addressed at all. These purchases will complete the
process of upgrading the University's central microscopy resources and will
enhance all the research programs that employ microscopy as an essential tool.
