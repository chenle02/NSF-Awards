This research project examines the invariant subspace structure of
multiplication operators on Hilbert spaces of analytic functions. Research will
involve multiple pathologies that arise on a space of the mean-square closure of
the polynomials with respect to measures on the unit disk; invariant subspaces
in Bergman spaces which arise from multiple boundary points; the discovery of
metric criterion for the space of polynomial approximants; and the
generalization of asymptotic kernel function estimates of T. Trent to general
Bergman spaces. This research is in the general mathematical area called 'modern
analysis'. Much of modern analysis concerns the study of the spaces of functions
or the analytic operators on a specified space. Modern analysis has many
applications for physics and geometry.
