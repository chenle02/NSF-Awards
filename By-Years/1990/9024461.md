A study of the spin-casting process is to continued under a renewal grant. The
research consists of both modeling and casting experiments. Modeling is focused
on the interplay between melt flow, temperature, and solidification. The
experiments are aimed at further defining optimal operating parameters for the
production of smoothly textured thin sheets of specialized materials. This
research will advance the ability to cast rapidly quenched materials with
controlled nanostructures. Examples are permanent magnet materials, high
temperature alloys, and also superconducting microcomposites.
