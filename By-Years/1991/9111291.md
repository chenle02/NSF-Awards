The objective of this research planning effort is to develop an integrated
research program to facilitate process and product development. The effort will
focus on the development of a Statistical Process Control (SPC) decision support
system for process improvement. The system will contain knowledge and expertise
in SPC and neural network process modeling methods. Industry interaction will be
fostered through the participation of forest products industries. The long term
goal is to develop and implement engineering techniques to improve forest
products manufacturing and the extension of these techniques to other non-
traditional manufacturing areas.
