The research uses different light scattering techniques to characterize
semiconductor heterostructure interfaces and to study the physical properties of
these interfaces. Raman scattering by optical and acoustic phonons will be used
to investigate the interface morphology. Light scattering by electrons in
quantum wells will be used to study the fundamental electronic property of the
interface, i.e., the lineup of the energy bands of the two heterostructure
materials. The experimental effort focuses on understanding and improving
epitaxial growth procedures, with special emphasis on novel systems such as
strained layer superlattices and amorphous multi layers grown by plasma enhanced
vapor deposition.
