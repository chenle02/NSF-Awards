9630881 Mukherjee This grant provides fundamental understanding of superplastic
behavior in nanocrystalline materials. Ultrafine-grained nanocrystalline
materials contain a very large density of interfaces and, therefore, offer
unique opportunities for studying the structural state of grain boundaries and
their role on grain boundary sliding during superplasticity. Combining methods
for synthesis as well as consolidation of nanopowders, the experimental program
examines superplastic deformation behavior of nanometals, nanointermetallics,
and nanocomposites with nanoscale oxides dispersed in the nanoscale metallic
matrix. The scientific goal is to correlate in the context of theoretical models
of superplasticity new microstructural information with mechanical data obtained
from nanoscale materials. Special emphasis is given to the difficulty of
intragranular dislocation generation inside the matrix in truly nanoscale
structure and its consequences to slip accommodation in current models of
superplasticity. The nanostructure before and after deformation is investigated
using transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and internal friction
methods. %%% The research could lead to new processing techniques for
deformation processing of nanocrystalline materials and could impact future
metal alloy processing in the metal forming industries. ***
