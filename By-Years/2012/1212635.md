This award funds the research activities of Professors Adam Leibovich and Ayres
Frietas at the University of Pittsburgh. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) is currently taking the data at a remarkable rate. This data will
allow particle physicists to probe the "Standard Model", which is the best
current understanding of the fundamental interactions and building blocks of
matter. Since the LHC is taking data at a higher energy than has previously been
explored, it is possible that physics beyond the Standard Model will be
discovered. This project will in part focus on signatures for beyond-the-
Standard-Model physics that can be probed at the LHC. The goal is to find ways
to determine properties of new non-Standard Model particles, such as mass and
spin, even if we do not know what the new physics happens to be. This project
will also focus on theoretical techniques to improve calculations of various
particle-physics signals, including calculating higher-order perturbative
corrections, summing infinite series of corrections, and pursuing path-integral
techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is also envisioned to have
significant broader impacts. The proposed project is well suited for the
participation of students at different levels, allowing them to acquire
knowledge and skills in theoretical physics, mathematical methods, computer
programming and data analysis. This project also has important connections to
experimental high-energy physics and cosmology, thus strengthening synergistic
effects between these different fields of specialization. Finally, the
calculational techniques studied here also have applications in other fields of
physics, such as general relativity and fluid dynamics.
