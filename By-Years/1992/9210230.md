The goals of this project are to: (1) study multiresolution approximations of
nonstationary stochastic processes; (2) establish a novel framework for studying
nonstationary signals, and (3) develop new analytic tools for addressing the
related challenging problems of time-varying filtering, estimation, and coding.
An optimal scaling function is proposed for "best" (in the mean- square sense)
low-resolution approximation of a given process. Such an approximation is
expected to improve the performance of filter banks used in subband coding for
the efficient transmission of image or voice data. It will also lead to optimal
feature extraction procedures in pattern recognition problems, appearing in
underwater and remote sensing applications.
