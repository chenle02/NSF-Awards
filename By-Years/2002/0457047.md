This experimental research program has a goal to magnetically trap, cool, and
study a wide range of atoms, among them nitrogen, nickel, bismuth, samarium,
neodymium, praseodymium, and dysprosium. These atoms include Fermionic species,
atoms with high magnetic moments, heavy atoms, and atoms with non-zero orbital
angular momentum and non-trivial shell structure (i.e. with collapsed orbitals).
The collisional interactions of these new species will be studied, furthering
the understanding of cold collision physics. The creation of atomic Fermi and
Bose degenerate gases with high magnetic moment will be sought. The broader
impact of the program may involve the development of new electronic materials or
the creation of a quantum computer.
