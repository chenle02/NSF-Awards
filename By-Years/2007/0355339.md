There is a growing interest in developing technologies which use silicon and
other electronic materials as mechanical materials. Using standard processes of
the integrated circuit industry, researchers have successfully fabricated
miniature mechanical components, or micromachines. The integration of
miniaturized mechanical components with microelectronic components has spawned a
new technology, known as microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). It promises to
extend the benefits of microelectronic fabrication to sensing and actuating
functions. However, given the dimensions of micromachines, surface phenomena
such as adhesion, friction, and wear are principal source of yield and
reliability concerns plaguing MEMS industry. These issues will persist, indeed
escalate, as microsystems technologies begin to transition into the nanoscale.
Recent research by us and others has successfully addressed the issue of
adhesion (often termed stiction in this context). The present proposal aims to
understand and overcome the problem of wear in MEMS. The proposed research is
expected to result in wear-resistant processes that are compatible with the
release-antistiction technology we have recently developed, to achieve the
ultimate goal of robust, manufacturable, low cost MEMS devices.

The impact of achieving anti-stiction, self-lubricating, wear resistant coatings
in MEMS is manifold. (i) Economically, it would lead to increased lifetime, and
reliability of manufactured microparts and micromachines; (ii) From the
manufacturing point of view, it would lead to simplified design of micromachines
with moving parts; (iii) It would also have an environmental impact via the
elimination of liquid lubricants. (iv) The project will provide core training
for a graduate student.
