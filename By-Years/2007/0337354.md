The Fort Worth Museum of Science and Technology will partner with The
Exploratorium and with three smaller science museums that have strong
connections to rural and Spanish-speaking populations in Texas: Discovery
Science Place, Loredo Children's Museum, and Science Spectrum to develop TexNET,
a four-year project modeled on the Exploratorium Network for Exhibit-based
Teaching (ExNET). TexNET builds on lessons learned from past exhibit outreach
models and addresses the needs of small, rural partners for exhibits and
capacity-building workshops. Each small museum partner will host a set of ten
exhibits for one year. Exhibit topics are 1)motion, 2)weather and 3)sound.
Workshops focus on inquiry learning techniques, science content, programming and
workshop design, as well as the institutional needs of each partner. Inverness
Research Associates will conduct the project evaluation. They will examine the
success of this project by looking at the effectiveness of the TexNET model, the
success of the individual exhibit elements to engage rural communities, the
effectiveness with which this project has enhanced the abilities of local rural
communities to sustain their own educational improvements and the effectiveness
of the training components in increasing the capabilities of the local museums
to serve their rural audiences.
