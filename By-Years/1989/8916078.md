The objective of the research described in this grant is to understand the
transcriptional process for genes encoded on mitochondrial DNA in yeast. A yeast
mutant defective in transcription of subunit II of cytochrome c oxidase has been
isolated. Subunit II DNA of the mutant contains a single nucleotide change in
the transcriptional promoter. The mutation apparently interferes with
recognition of the sequence as a transcriptional promoter. We have isolated nine
revertants of the mutant which have recovered the ability to respire. Some of
these revertants have not recovered normal growth rates so recovery of function
cannot be the consequence of restoration of the normal sequence but must involve
compensatory changes. Classical genetic techniques will be used to determine if
the compensatory changes are found on nuclear or mitochondrial DNA. For
mitochondrial revertants, genetic mapping experiments will localize the specific
region of mitochondrial DNA carrying the compensatory change. The region will be
sequenced and compared to the normal region to identify the specific alteration.
For nuclear revertants, the altered genes responsible for recovery of function
will be identified by fragmenting DNA from the revertant strains, cloning those
fragments and introducing the clones into the original mutant. Clones which
restore respiration must contain the altered gene and will be molecularly
characterized to understand how restoration of function occurred. Analysis of
the revertants will provide information about other sequences able to function
as promoters of yeast mitochondrial transcription and about other gene products
required for the process.
