The principle aims of this project on "Information Processing for Arabidopsis
cDNA sequencing" are to design and implement enabling informatics mechanisms for
genetic sequence data and to provide an automated environment (for similarity
searching) for the genetic sequence data produced by the molecular biologists
for the Arabidopsis cDNA sequencing project at Michigan State University. This
system will assist molecular biologists in managing raw sequence data,
annotations to it and results from sequence comparisons. This system will allow
the scientists to organize and manipulate their sequence data in private local
databases and also automatically submit selected sequences to the public
databases of the research community. The system will be based on a object-
oriented database management system. The investigators will make available to
the community all raw and derived data, software and documentation that they
develop. This project is also being supported by the Directorate for Biological
Sciences Reserve for the Arabidopsis Initiative.
