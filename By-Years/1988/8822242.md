Infrared and tunnelling measurements on films of high temperature
superconductors will elucidate dependences of order parameter and pairbreaking
rate on temperature and Tc. An important experimental technique of modulating
the order parameter with an externally applied supercurrent will distinguish
between superconducting and normal state effects. SIN tunneling studies of UBe13
films will probe the pairbreaking processes and anisotropic pairing.
