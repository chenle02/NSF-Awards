ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0346982&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: Programming Languages Techniques
for Enhancing Software Quality&lt;br/&gt;Jeffrey S. Foster&lt;br/&gt;University
of Maryland - College Park&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to
develop tools and techniques for improving the quality of software, with a focus
on methods that analyze source code. There are two main objectives. The first is
to develop the equivalent of type systems for high-level designs in software.
Currently, even with careful planning it is all too easy
to&lt;br/&gt;accidentally violate design invariants as software projects develop
and thereby introduce errors into programs. Having an automatic system for
checking the consistency of source code with the high-level&lt;br/&gt;design
decisions behind it will help programmers avoid these mistakes. The second
objective of this research is to develop techniques for checking the correctness
of programs written in multiple languages.&lt;br/&gt;Current program analysis
technology focuses on programs written in one language, yet modern software is
often written in a mix of different languages. By developing analysis techniques
that can span multiple&lt;br/&gt;languages and check conditions at the interface
between the languages, programmers will be given new tools to help them ensure
that multi-language systems are correct. Ultimately, the results of this
research are expected have long-term benefits in the improvement of software
quality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
