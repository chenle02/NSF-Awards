In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program,
Professor Charles B. Harris of the University of California, Berkeley and his
research group will develop novel two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) techniques
for the study of transition states in solution. The reactions for study include
ligand fluxionality, photoinduced ligand dissociation, and intramolecular
electron transfer in mixed-valence complexes. The compounds under study are
model systems with well characterized structures and chemistry, but whose
molecular dynamics are not well known. The experiments in this project involve
the development of new spectroscopic tools that can reveal unprecedented
information that will have a fundamental impact on our understanding of chemical
reaction dynamics in solution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, this research
will benefit from a multi-faceted approach involving not only experimental
molecular spectroscopy but also synthesis and theory. Students (both graduate
and undergraduate) as well as postdoctoral scholars will benefit from this
multi-disciplinary research environment. Finally, the Harris group is engaged in
a variety of community outreach activities that promote a broader public
understanding and appreciation for chemistry and science in general.
