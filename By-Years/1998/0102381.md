The investigators will examine processes structuring microplankton communities
and linking them with populations of Neocalanus spp., the dominant particle-
grazing copepods in the coastal Gulf of Alaska. Collectively, three species of
Neocalanus contribute substantially to total spring and summer mesozooplankton
biomass in the coastal Gulf of Alaksa. Neocalanus are capable of consuming both
phytoplankton and microzooplankton, though factors dictating this diet
partitioning are not well understood. Further, these copepods have been shown to
alter individual body size, population biomass, and life cycle timing in
response to variations in ocean conditions. Finally, the size and abundance of
Neocalanus make them an important potential prey for pink salmon fry and other
coastal fish species. Thus, the microplankton - Neocalanus food web is a
potential locus for the translation of environmental variation into higher
trophic level responses. Specific measurements to be made include: microplankton
abundance and composition, rates of microzooplankton herbivory, and rates of
Neocalanus spp. grazing on microzooplankton and phytoplankton.
