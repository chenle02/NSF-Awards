9504959 Chao In this project, the PIs will carry out a modeling study to
simulate dynamical processes in the South China Sea, and to examine their
dependence on annual and interannual variations of the monsoon winds and the
hydrographic conditions in the Kuroshio. Focus will be on the surface
circulation, deep circulation, deep- water renewal, and the formation of the
South China Sea Warm current and a cold-water tongue in response to relaxation
of monsoon winds. An existing model will be modified by substantially increasing
its resolution to account for mesoscale processes. Realistic wind, current, and
thermodynamic forcing will be used. ***
