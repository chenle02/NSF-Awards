This proposal outlines an approach to developing a comprehensive modeling
language and supporting computer environment that will permit managers and
others with limited experience to build and use decision models. This is clearly
an ambitious undertaking, but reviewers of the proposal expressed confidence in
the principal investigator and in his ability to make significant progress on
the topic. The proposed effort would extend earlier work of the investigator by
developing a set of educational tools that will introduce users to structured
modeling approaches. These tools then will be tested on small groups of users
and the results of these experiments will form an empirical basis for evaluating
a prototype modeling environment. This direct involvement of user groups is
considered to be critical to determining the usefulness of structured modeling
approaches and their feasibility as an assessible tool for developing decision
models. The results of this project are expected to add significantly to the
understanding of structured modeling environments and to what is known regarding
how rapidly and how extensively structured modeling is likely to be adopted by
managers as a decision.aiding tool.
