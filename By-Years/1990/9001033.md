The research objective is to improve the fabrication of optical fibers
(waveguides), by using aerosol doping. The proposed method involves the
transport and evaporation of an aerosol of solution droplets in the MCVD
(Modified Chemical Vapor Deposition) and OVD (Outside Vapor Deposition)
techniques. The focus of this research is on the experimental fluid mechanics
and heat transfer aspects. The novelty of the proposal consists in the way in
which the mist is created by an ultrasonic nebulizer and transported to the
deposition surface. This work will be done in collaboration with the modelling
effort carried out at Northeastern University. The new techniques for the doping
of non-volatile dopants into optical fibers have particular relevance to the
fabrication of fiber laser amplifiers for telecommunications purposes. Two
graduate students will be prepared in this area with a shortage of specialists.
