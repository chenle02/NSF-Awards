This award supports a conference entitled: "A Conference on Quantum Topology".
The conference will be held from 24 to 28 March 1993, on the campus of Kansas
State University, in Manhattan, Kansas. The conference will be concerned with
interactions between low-dimensional topology (especially conformal field
theory, topological field theory and quantum gravity), quantum field theory,
statistical mechanics, and the theory of quantum groups. The conference will
feature two series of lectures, by two eminent mathematicians, with additional
invited speakers and contributed talks.
