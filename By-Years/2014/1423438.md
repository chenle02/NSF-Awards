The MidSouth Computational Biology and Bioinformatics Society (MCBIOS) is a
nonprofit organization to promote research and education in bioinformatics and
computational biology and address the need for the next generation of scientists
who will work at the interface between computational and life sciences. This
conference plays a special role in the region, providing a quality research-
focused environment, serving as an arm for the international community of
scientists in bioinformatics and computational biology. A major purpose of the
MCBIOS annual conference is to foster collaborative research in bioinformatics
and computational biology by providing a forum for scientists of various
backgrounds and disciplines to interact to solve biological, health and/or
biomedical problems by developing or using computational tools. The broader
impacts of the project will be met through initiating future collaborations by
the ensuing discussions of open problems, providing strong support to graduate
and undergraduate students and a platform for new researchers to the field. The
meeting also includes industry participants, which will provide students with
knowledge of various types of employment opportunities and needed skill sets for
those opportunities and provides for the publication of the proceedings in BMC
Bioinformatics, a high impact factor journal.
