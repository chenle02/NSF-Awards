A key property of the equations governing atmospheric motion is their
instability relative to small perturbations. Fields which are arbitrarily close
to each other at some initial time evolve during an integration to the point
where the difference between them (or the "error") is as large as the difference
between two randomly chosen states of the system. In numerical weather
prediction, uncertainty in the initial state grows as the forecast proceeds
until details of the forecasted weather are no more valid than weather patterns
for an arbitrarily chosen day. The objective of this research is to determine
the sensitivity of a realistic atmospheric model to localized errors in the
initial conditions. There are two main areas of investigation: (1) identifying
the locations in which the errors grow most quickly in short and long range
forecasts and (2) determining the extent to which a reduction in the initial
error can extend predictability (the period for which a forecast is useful). The
principal investigator will employ a simplified version of a global numerical
model, developed by the National Meteorological Center, to study the
relationships among the processes of instability, nonlinearity, and latent heat
release during the course of the forecast. In addition, concepts from dynamical
systems theory will be employed in an effort to understand the role of scale
interactions.
