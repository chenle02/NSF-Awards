Project Summary The District Eleven Weather Study Program (DEWS) is a
successful science education project in the Bronx New York school system. ATM
provided assistance in starting this project. The project demonstrates that when
fifth-grade students are given the opportunity to participate in highly-
motivational activities in weather study, they will acquire skills in basic
scientific procedures, positive attitudes towards the study of science, and a
greater awareness of career opportunities in sciences, especially in
meteorology. Increased costs associated with the project that could not be
accommodated in this year's Bronx school system budget threaten the continued
existence of the project. NSF support will enable the purchase of a new
facsimile machine require as a result of recent changes in the National Weather
Services (NWS) policy. Also, funding will support anticipated increased costs
associated with receiving satellite- imagery and weather-graphics transmissions.
