This proposal supports a project designed to improve the demonstration and
laboratory course of the Introduction to Photonics course at a community college
located near military and industrial areas. It is designed for technicians, and
not for future scholars. The proposer states "the project is significant in that
it is a model program of curricular design which can aid the military and
industry by supplying personnel who can design and operate equipment in the
emerging fields of photonics." I concur with his statement. //
