The goal of this U.S.-Croatian cooperative research project between Renming Song
of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and Zoran Vondracek of the
University of Zagreb is to strengthen the potential theory of Markov processes
with jumps. This will be accomplished by bringing together U.S. and Croatian
mathematicians to examine five types of problems: 1) potential theory for
subordinate killed Brownian motion in a domain; 2) Harnack inequality for Markov
processes with jumps; 3) fine properties of the mixture of a Brownian motion and
a rotationally invariant stable process; 4) potential theory of non-symmetric
stable processes; and 5) Hardy and potential inequalities. Results are expected
to lead to a refined theoretical framework for determining mathematical
probability. Success would enhance modeling and analysis of various stochastic
processes in fields such as physics, operations research, queuing theory,
mathematical finance and insurance mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
mathematics project fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and South Central Europe to
combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong
mutual interest and competence. Broader impacts include the introduction of U.S.
and Croatian graduate students to the international mathematics community
through work at partner institutions and direct access to advanced work on jump
processes.
