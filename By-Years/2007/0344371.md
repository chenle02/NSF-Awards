Cells must adapt to the changing conditions in their environment by sensing
external conditions and signaling these conditions to alter expression of genes
whose products permit growth or survival under the new conditions. In general,
transcription factors are the recipients of the signals and their activity is
increased or decreased dependent upon conditions. Transcription factors, in
turn, bind to specific DNA sites and recruit components of the transcriptional
machinery including the general transcription factors, coactivators, chromatin
remodeling complexes and RNA polymerase II. Frequently, gene expression depends
upon multiple activators functioning in a combinatorial manner to specifically
stimulate transcription. The ADE genes of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are
a system the principal investigator has been studying to determine how a purine
limitation signal is detected and transmitted to the activators Bas1 and Bas2.
Expression of the ADE genes is inherently combinatorial as both activators are
required. However, the individual roles that these factors play in activation
function are unknown. In this project, the roles that the activators Bas1 and
Bas2 play during transcription of the ADE genes and how they receive the
intracellular regulatory signal will be studied to understand the underlying
mechanisms that permit these activators to respond to a purine limitation signal
and to promote transcription. While the focus of this research is on ADE gene
regulation by Bas1 and Bas2, these studies will add to our understanding of
combinatorial mechanisms for transcription regulation as well as providing
insights into adenylate regulation in eukaryotes. The research conducted by the
principal investigator has provided training opportunities to a large number of
undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral trainees, and will continue to do so
through this project.
