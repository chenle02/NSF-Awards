Several related investigations in high energy atomic physics will be
undertaken. These phenomena all occur under conditions in which electron
correlation effects are unimportant. In contrast, relativistic, retardation and
higher multipole effects are more prominent than the more usual regimes of
atomic physics. Specific studies include Compton scattering of photons from
bound atomic electrons, relativistic atomic bremsstrahlung radiation from target
structure in ion- atom collisions, the anomalous scattering regime of Rayleigh
scattering and the structure of radiation transition multipole moments. Longer
range projects include the triply differential cross section for electron-atom
bremsstrahlung, extension of current computer codes to incorporate a more
realistic treatment of exchange and correlations and an independent particle
calculation of Delbruck scattering. Both numerical and analytical methods will
be utilized. Training of students and international cooperative activities are
integral parts of all of the research activities.
