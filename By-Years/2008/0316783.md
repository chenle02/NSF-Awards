The long-term research objective for this investigator is to use a combined
approach of molecular biology, biochemistry, and structural biology to
understand the structural basis for the catalytic mechanism of splicing. The
current project is aimed at understanding how RNA interactions nucleate the
assembly of the catalytic apparatus within the group II introns to undertake
splicing. Because domain 5 (D5) is the most phylogenetically conserved region of
this intron RNA enzyme (ribozyme) and is absolutely required for any reaction
catalyzed by group II introns or its derivatives, this project focuses on D5.
The following two specific aims are designed to fully illuminate how D5 recruits
components of the catalytic machinery through specific RNA-RNA and RNA-ion
interactions to form essential active-site structures. Aim 1-To determine the
structure of the catalytically essential D5-PL of group II introns; Aim 2-To
test the hypothesis that D5-PL undergoes localized conformational changes on
binding domains 1-3 to set up the active site geometry for catalysis. This study
is expected to provide detailed molecular understanding of the role of D5 in
group II intron catalysis. The resulting deeper understanding of the nature of
catalysis within the group II introns might suggest novel approaches to
developing group II introns as potential ribozyme therapeutics. Correspondingly,
the educational activities connected with this research are designed to
demonstrate the versatile and diverse roles RNA molecules play in cellular
metabolism, and the project provides an excellent avenue for the
interdisciplinary training, tutoring and mentoring of graduate and postdoctoral
students in RNA biochemistry and NMR structural biophysics.
