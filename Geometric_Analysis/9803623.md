Abstract Proposal: DMS 9803623 Principal Investigator: Anatoly Libgober This
project concerns mirror symmetry. It aims to clarify the mathematical meaning
and the scope of mirror correspondence and to find applications of mirror
symmetry. While from mathematical viewpoint, the original discovery of mirror
symmetry predicted a relation between the enumerative geometry of manifolds from
the class of (Calabi-Yau) manifolds (i.e. the numerology of lines, quadrics,
twisted cubics etc) and differential equations or more precisely the variation
of the Hodge structure on another (Calabi-Yau) manifold, more recent
developments, mainly in physics literature, suggest numerous additional
properties of mirror correspondence. Mirror symmetry in the physical sense is a
rather imposing condition on manifolds, defined as a certain isomorphism of
conformal field theories associated with the manifolds and one would like to
understand its exact mathematical meaning. The investigator is planning to
search for additional topological and geometric properties of manifolds which
will allow us to identify mirror partners, such as behavior of their
characteristic classes, elliptic genera, or other properties which may
facilitate identifying mirror partners in special situations, e.g. for manifolds
with automorphisms. Another aspect of the proposed study is the investigation of
algebraic structures associated with objects involved in the mirror symmetry
such as differential equations for the periods of the families of Calabi-Yau
manifolds. As part of the study of these differential equations the investigator
plans to relate issues arising in mirror symmetry to previous work on the
fundamental groups of the complements, the monodromy groups and the cohomology
of local systems on certain quasiprojective varieties. Overall, the goal of the
project is to attempt to bridge the gap between physical and mathematical
understanding found in the early 1990's of the phenomenon of mirror sym metry.
This will lead to better understanding of issues which have been the focus of
mathematicians since the middle of 19th century, such as enumeration of
geometric objects, using ideas from string theory, and we hope also to bring
additional mathematical ideas to the understanding of mirror symmetry in
physics.
