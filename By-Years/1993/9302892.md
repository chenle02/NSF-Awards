9302892 Heydt The project concerns electric power quality, i.e. the distortion
of the ideal sinusoidal voltage and current voltage and current waveshapes in a
power system because of the presence of electronic devices (rectifiers,
adjustable speed machine drives, light dimmers, power conditioners, etc.). In
order to analyze the impact of these load types on a power systems, it is
generally necessary to solve a set of differential equations at each load.
Computational savings would result if the transient part of the solution could
be skipped and only the steady-state periodic solution found. Computationally
efficient solution methods are being sought. ***
