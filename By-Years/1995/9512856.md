9512856 Ying A U.S.-Brazil collaborative research effort will be carried out by
See-Chen Ying, John Kosterlitz, and Tapio Ala-Nissila of Brown University and
Enzo Granato of the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais in Sao Paulo to
study the transport properties of adsorbed layers and superconducting Josephson-
junction arrays, considering both linear and nonlinear regimes. The
investigators will apply a two- dimensional version of the Frenkel-Kontorova
model to understand sliding friction of an adsorbed layer under a steady
external force in the plane. In addition, they will use numerical simulations to
study the effect of pinning in the melting of Abrikosov vortex lattices in the
context of a Josephson-junction array in a magnetic field. The work will deepen
our understanding of one of the growing fields of condensed matter science. The
U.S team brings an excellent record of research in surface diffusion and
Josephson-junction arrays, while the Brazilians contribute considerable
expertise in numerical simulations. The international collaboration, supported
in Brazil by CNPq, will benefit both sides as well as the field in general. ****
