This research project will provide new and innovative ways to analyze decisions
to accept or decline job offers. Job search models are widely used in labor
economics to address fundamental questions related to labor supply in a changing
environment. The key to these models is that it takes time and effort for
individuals to find a job. Even though these models are popular, it is often
difficult to know if all important characteristics of the model can be recovered
from data on labor market transitions and accepted wages. This project will
develop a new and innovative framework that allows the researcher to learn about
these characteristics from labor market data; the models are also considerably
much simpler for empirical analysis than previous models. This simpler
estimation method will make these models accessible to a broader set of
empirical researchers. The project will then apply the proposed method to a rich
longitudinal data set from the Hungarian labor market to analyze job search
behavior over the course of the unemployment spell. The results of this research
project will provide better understanding of people’s decisions to accept or not
accept job offers and therefore provide guidance into policies to improve the
functional of labor markets. It therefore contributes to US economic
growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project adapts the conditional choice
probability (CCP) estimation method to a continuous-time job search environment.
The proposed framework incorporates preference shocks into the search framework,
resulting in a tight connection between value functions and conditional choice
probabilities. This approach makes it possible to establish constructive
identification of all model parameters, which in turn translates into a simple
and tractable estimation procedure. This model is applied to a rich longitudinal
data set from the Hungarian labor market. The proposed application will provide
new insights on the extent to which the job offer arrival rates as well as the
utility of unemployment vary over the course of unemployment. It will also make
it possible to evaluate the role played by search effort adjustment in these
variations over the course of unemployment. The results of this research project
will provide better understanding of people’s decisions to accept or not accept
job offers and therefore provide guidance into policies to improve the
functional of labor markets and increase economic
growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
