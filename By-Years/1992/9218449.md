This project will add a long-slit spectroscopic capability to an NSF supported
infrared imaging system for the 1.8m Lowell Observatory telescope. The
spectroscopic option will provide three complimentary capabilities: o A low
resolution (lamda/delta lamda = 550) long slit (6.8') mode, which will disperse
one of the J, H, or K atmospheric windows across the detector array in its
entirety. o A cross-dispersed mode that allows observations at a resolution of
550 of the entire useful wavelength range from 1.18 to 2.45 (mu)m with a 30"
long slit or from 0.96 to 2.45 (mu)m for a point source. o A higher resolution
(lamda/delta lamda = 1500) mode with a more restricted slit length (2.6'); a
positionable grating mount will allow the selection of wavelengths in this mode.
All the options, including the changeover from imaging to spectroscopic
observing, will be remotely controlled and rapidly selectable. There are two
projects that the spectrometer will be directed towards: studies of the stellar
content of galaxies and of the evolutionary status of young stellar objects. //
