This is a post-doctoral travel grant to allow a professional meeting and
consultation between Adam Fudickar (PI) and Dr. Marilyn Ramenofsky at the
University of California, Davis. During the meeting, Dr. Fudickar and Dr.
Ramenofsky will discuss the structure of a potential proposal to address the
potential response of arctic breeding migratory birds to climate change. The
visit will also provide the opportunity for Mr. Fudickar to visit the research
facilities at UC Davis and discuss the project proposal with other researchers
in the Department of Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior.
