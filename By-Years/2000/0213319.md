Residential Mobility and Adolescent Risk Behavior

This research seeks to explain why a family's residential mobility tends to have
a negative impact on their adolescent children. Changing schools is correlated
with a variety of risky adolescent behaviors and negative outcomes such as
delinquency, sexual activity, suicide, and poor academic achievement. This study
attempts to identify the mechanisms that explain these outcomes. Peer social
networks may be especially important since low status, often deviant, peer
groups may be more receptive to new, entering students. The analysis will use
new longitudinal data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health
(Add Health) that include measures of both outcomes and peer networks. The
project holds promise for developing theories of social control and social
networks, and for informing parents and school officials as they deal with the
stresses experienced by adolescents when they move to new communities and
schools.
