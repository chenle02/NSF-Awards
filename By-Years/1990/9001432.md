This proposal provides funds for a three year program leading to the
implementation of an enhanced incoherent scatter data acquisition system at the
Millstone Hill I.S. Radar Facility. Some funding has been previously provided by
the NSF for the construction of a state-of-the-art data acquisition system known
as MIDAS (Millstone Ionospheric Data Acquisition System). Hardware for a second
such system has been provided by the Office of Naval Research (ONR). This
proposal calls for constructing a second MIDAS systems.***//
