The research will focus on using a state transition formalism that is
mathematically rigorous, yet easily accessible to the average engineer for the
analysis and synthesis of network protocols. Building on past work in which the
principal investigator has developed rudiments of a theory for communication
network protocols, this research will develop a broad theoretical foundation,
investigate sound and efficient methods for protocol analysis and synthesis, and
apply these methods to the design of protocols. The analysis of protocols will
address two kinds of concerns: logical properties and quantitative performance.
Logical properties have to do with the functional requirements of a protocol and
are determined by the reachable states and "allowed behaviors" of the protocol.
The concerns formalized as logical properties include safety, progress, and
real-time progress. Concerns that still need to be formalized included secrecy,
authenticity, anonymity, privacy, and accessibility. Quantitative performance
has to do with the throughput and response time characteristics of a protocol.
Quantitative measures such as probability distributions or time bounds will be
introduced into the state transition formalism. In addition, the research will
include the development of methods for protocol construction by refinement and
composition techniques for deriving protocol converters and adapters, as well as
for maintaining and modifying network protocols in a changing environment.
