Imhoff In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global Learning and
Observations to Benefit the Environment Program (GLOBE) this project is designed
to meet the GLOBE goals and objectives of linking scientists and schoolchildren
in a global information network with the ultimate goal of better understanding
the Earth's environment and changes that take place within it. The specific
goals of this project are to introduce students in grades K-12 to the concept of
soils as a basic building block of terrestrial ecosystems and the concept of
ecosystem services that support human life. The teaching and learning
environment will be integrated with actual baseline data gathering efforts being
carried out for global change modeling projects supported by NASA as part of
Mission to Planet Earth. The use of satellite and aircraft based remote sensing
technology will be a significant part of the program. A primary task of the
proposed effort will be the creation of a new set of education packages through
integration of satellite remote sensing and geographic information system
technology with already existing K-12 soil science education models. The new
packages will take on the viewpoint of soils being part of an inter-dependent
network of Earth system functions and an important provider of ecosystem
services.
