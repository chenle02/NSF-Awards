Narrative: Disruption of the cell envelope is one of the first steps in the
recovery of materials contained within microbial cells. Conventional techniques
typically involve high shear, heat generation, and multiple stage processing,
all factors which can lead to degradation of the desired product. Furthermore,
these techniques often lead to the creation of small cell wall fragments which
adds to the burden of downstream purification. The present proposal suggests a
method of cell disruption which may avoid these difficulties, improve product
yields, and prove more economical as well. The method, a modified form of
explosive decompression, is based on the large specific volume changes which may
be rapidly effected upon depressurization of a supercritical fluid or low-
boiling liquid. Any process requiring microbial cell disruption may benefit
significantly from the proposed explosive disruption method.
