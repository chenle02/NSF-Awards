This project studies probabilistic aspects of computational geometry. Particular
emphasis is being placed on: -extending known results on the expected running
times of algorithms for constructing convex hulls and Voronoi diagrams of random
point sets in higher dimensions, -implementing and animating algorithms for
Voronoi diagrams, minimum spanning trees, and other geometric problems, and
carrying out empirical studies of their performance and their output,
-investigating running times of other geometric algorithms on random point sets,
-applying methods of integral geometry to define realistic and analyzable
distributions of more complex geometric inputs such as sets of line segments and
polygon, and -investigating connections to problems in the theory of random
graphs and in the theory of data structures.
