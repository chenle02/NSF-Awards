This award will fund the R&amp;D needed for future lepton collider detector and
in particular the SiD detector concept. It has been designed to address
fundamental questions of particle physics, including the mechanism responsible
for electroweak symmetry breaking and the generation of mass, the unification of
forces, and the structure of space-time at small distances, including possible
evidence for extra dimensions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SiD makes extensive use of
silicon detectors, which are well-matched to the challenges of ILC physics and
the machine environment. They are fast, robust against machine-induced
background, and capable of very fine segmentation. SiD is based on silicon
tracking and silicon-tungsten sampling calorimetry, complemented by powerful
pixel vertex detection, and outer hadronic calorimetry and muon detection. This
award will fund the development of a process for modeling of silicon pixel
detector technology using commercial 3D software tools. To make a decision
between the many proposed sensor and readout technologies, and to optimize
parameters such as size and charge collection efficiency, the proposal will
develop precise 3D modeling of various candidate technologies.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is expected to have impact in education and
outreach. There are ongoing activities at the participating universities are
aimed at K-12 students an effective ways to reach students is through their
teachers. New education and outreach efforts are centering on the ILC.
