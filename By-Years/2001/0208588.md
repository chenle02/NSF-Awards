This project sets out an agenda to study in detail three key operators designed
for adaptivity in query processing: Eddies serve to do continuous, adaptive
reordering of operators in query plans in the face of changing data statistics
and system behavior. SteMs expose the state management inherent in query
processing as a first class operator in a physical algebra, allowing for
adaptive competition and hybridization among query processing alternatives.
FLuXen provide adaptive load balancing and fault tolerance across parallel
machines. Using the Telegraph system infrastructure, this proposal's agenda is
to investigate mechanisms and policies for efficient, robust eddies, SteMs and
FluXen in the context of traditional and new query processing challenges. The
end goal is to provide a parallel query processing architecture that can run
nearly as well in perfect circumstances as a traditiona architecture, and --
more importantly -- that can automatically adapt to run efficiently and robustly
when faced with the kinds of imperfections and variations commonly seen in
large-scale environments.
