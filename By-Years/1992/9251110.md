TechniquesOakland University is expanding existing student facilities for
robotics and manufacturing to create a laboratory for Artificial Intelligence
(AI) in Manufacturing. Specific hardware acquisitions include a computer
workstation with two terminals to support AI development, and two PC-based
stations with appropriate data acquisition and control hardware to support AI
delivery. Software acquisitions include AI tools for knowledge representation
and expert systems (largely contributed by The Carnegie Group, Inc.), object-
oriented modeling software for a wide range of manufacturing problems, and
necessary support software. These additions permit students to examine the
intelligent use and integration of current equipment including a CNC mill, a CNC
lathe, a vision system, a robotic manipulator and a CAD/CAM system.This
laboratory primarily supports a new course entitled Improving Manufacturing with
Artificial Intelligence Techniques but the improvements also benefit existing
courses including Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Robotics. Students
will learn: 1) to use expert system shells to build diagnostic expert systems
for maintaining the lab's devices; 2) to implement neural network algorithms to
control machines; 3) to extract features that control a manufacturing device or
cell using various learning algorithms; 4) to build hypertext procedure
descriptions for the use of manufacturing systems; and 5) to use object-oriented
models of manufactured goods, and to apply other AI techniques to the problems
of manufacturing. The lab will be one of the first designed to train students in
the use of AI techniques to improve existing manufacturing technologies and help
generate new ones.
