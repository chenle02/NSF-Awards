This proposal is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) request to
conduct a 2 day workshop examining the role of cost-benefit analysis (CBA) in
informing public policy decisions. Cost-benefit analysis is widely regarded as
an appropriate tool for judging the merits of public policy initiatives. At the
same time, however, there is great deal of controversy regarding which methods
for establishing costs and benefits are most accurate and, more fundamentally,
whether CBA is able to capture relevant values irrespective of the specific
methods used. There are also questions regarding the application of CBA that are
unique to specific policy contexts (e.g., energy, environment, or urban policy).
The planned workshop will bring together a large number of experts on CBA.
Individuals included come from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds. Some are
primarily theoreticians while others are practioners. Some are in academia while
others are in government. The objectives of the workshop are to discuss both the
general and specific issues associated with the use of CBA, to establish
potentially fruitful avenues and topics for future research on CBA, and to
establish a network among researchers and practioners interested in CBA.
