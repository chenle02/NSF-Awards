This proposal provides funds to obtain a Michelson interferometer which
operates in the infrared and place it at the optical facility collocated with
the incoherent scatter radar at Sondre Stromfjord, Greenland. It will
investigate auroral processes: (1) the investigation of the optical signature
for non-linear effects that are similar to the spectrum observed in laboratory
beam plasma discharge, and (2) the examination of the optical signature for
effects of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium.***//
