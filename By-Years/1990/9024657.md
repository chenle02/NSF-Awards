With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program of the
Chemistry Division, Professor Friesner will continue his development of highly
efficient numerical techniques, called pseudospectral methods, for the
prediction of microscopic properties of molecules. Improvements of the Hartree-
Fock and Generalized Valence Bond methods will be carried out, as will
extensions to analytic first and second derivatives of these wave functions with
respect to the geometric positions. Two pseudospectral algorithms for treating
short range electron correlation, second order Moller-Plesset perturbation
theory and variational Monte Carlo methods, will be explored. Subsequent work
will include the exploration of a wide range of alternative correlation methods.
