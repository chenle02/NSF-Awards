Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is providing the
community with an inexpensive and easy-to-use laboratory environment for
teaching computer networking. The TinkerNet environment consists of an array of
nodes and a controller. Using a modified OSKit, students implement OS kernels
containing pieces of the network protocol stack. Students boot their kernel on
an available node and then execute and test their network implementations.
TinkerNet differs from other projects because it uses inexpensive commodity
hardware (200MHz PCs suffice) and readily-available software (OSKit, Linux, and
GNU). Its intellectual merit lies in filling a need that was articulated in the
SIGCOMM Workshop on Teaching Computer Networking for an inexpensive, easy-to-
use, and easy-to-maintain laboratory environment for teaching computer
networking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this project lies in the
effectiveness of this project in the classroom, as demonstrated by the
experience of the University of California Riverside (UCR), a MSI. Student
course evaluations at UCR were very positive about the additional understanding
obtained through the TinkerNet laboratory experiments. There is considerable
interest from other institutions in using this environment. In addition, this
project includes a more detailed assessment of student learning.
