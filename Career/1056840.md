The Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE) introduced by Oded Schramm in 1999 has been
used with great success to prove many outstanding conjectures and predictions
from Statistical Physics. The PI has been working on SLE for a number of years,
and has made some important contributions to this area. The proposed project
focuses on studying the geometric properties of the SLE curves of various kinds.
To do this project, the PI will use the stochastic coupling technique he
developed earlier. This technique is used to construct more than one SLE curve
in single domain in such a way that the curves commute with each other. It was
applied to prove the Duplantier's duality conjecture, the reversibility of
chordal SLE and whole-plane SLE (for some parameters), and that it is possible
to erase loops on a planar Brownian motion to get an SLE curve. In the proposed
project, the PI will continue the application of the coupling technique. This
includes constructing simple SLE loops on the Riemann sphere, proving the
reversibility of the natural parametrization of SLE, and studying the behavior
of SLE in multiply connected domains.

The proposed research plan will give people better understanding of the behavior
of the SLE curves growing in simply and multiply connected domains. This will
then increase understanding of a number of two-dimensional Statistical Physics
lattice models (e.g. critical percolation, critical Ising model, Gaussian free
field, and loop-erased random walk) in different kinds of domains since SLE have
been identified as the scaling limits of these models. The project will also
have significant impacts on Conformal Field Theory. A significant part of this
proposal is its educational component. The PI will develop undergraduate courses
on Probability and Complex Analysis at Michigan State University to include the
newest development of the PI's research area. He will also teach specialized
graduate courses on SLE, and involve graduate students in working under his
supervision.
