This project involves research on nonlinear dynamical systems exhibiting wave
phenomena. It has two main goals: (1) to understand to what extent the chaotic
behavior in partial differential equations is finite dimensional; (2) to study a
variety of propagation phenomena. Under goal (1) the investigations will focus
on two kinds of systems described by partial differential equations: nearly
integrable systems described by forced damped nonlinear Schrodinger equation and
by sine-Gordon equation. They are natural extensions into PDE's of forced damped
pendulum, a problem used as a prototype for studying chaos in ordinary
differential equations. These equations have a natural choice of a basis, with
which the notion of a nonlinear power spectrum can be described explicitly for
the first time. The near integrability of these equations provides sufficient
analytical control to yield precise, detailed theoretical information about the
qualitative behavior. The far from integrable systems include flows in finite
geometries, turbulent wakes and boundary layers. Here the issue is to find an
optimal decomposition of the flow field for which the dimension of the subspace
of modes which dominate the dynamics is minimal. Under goal (2), the propagation
of nonlinear waves will be studied in a variety of contexts, trying to answer
questions such as the existence of Anderson localization in nonlinear waves
propagating in a random medium, theoretical foundations of nonlinear optics, and
mathematical theory of singularities of envelope equations. This research is
part of a larger effort in the nonlinear analysis of dynamical systems which has
been developed in this country in the last ten years. Studies like this are
important for a deep understanding of a number of nonlinear phenomena in the
existing dynamical systems encountered in technology.
