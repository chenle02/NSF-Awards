100 word abstract by Gautam Dasgupta, Columbia University

After a productive International Conference on Theoretical, Applied,
Computational and Experimental Mechanics efforts are made to invite US
researchers from Civil, Mechanical, Aerospace, Bio and Environmental Engineering
at the ICTACEM 12/01 and post conference symposia in IIT Madras and Delhi. The
focus is on new technology, mechanics education/research and future joint NSF
proposals with Indian researchers. Only 50% air fare is requested for three
female and seven male participants: four chair professors, two full professors,
two associateprofessors, and two PhD students. A modest sum to disseminate
proceedings (printed/CD and free web download) is included.
