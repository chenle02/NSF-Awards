An international conference on the Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) Concept and its
application to Regional Marine Resource Management will be convened in October,
1990. Its is supported jointly by NOAA, NSF, IOC AND ICSEM. LMEs are large
regions of the world ocean which are highly productive and subject to the forces
of pollution and fishing as well as natural physical and biological pressures.
The conference will seek ways to better predict the consequences of these forces
with the goal of being able to manage their continued productivity effectively.
