The Ann Arbor Hands-On Museum proposes to design and construct a traveling
exhibit on energy. The proposed exhibit will have two goals: one, to produce an
imaginative exhibit that will stimulate interest and cognitive growth in
understanding about geometry; two, to develop a related education program that
will reach out to underserved audiences in Michigan and beyond, including
minorities, children and citizens who live far from science centers, and
audiences of small- and medium-sized science centers and children's museums in
the state.
