This project connects the Iowa Valley Community College District to the
Internet over a T1 line. The district consists of two community colleges.
Faculty and students at the schools benefit from access to the resources of the
Internet, including libraries and supercomputers. In addition, they are able to
communicate and collaborate with colleagues at other institutions in pursuit of
research and educational projects. The award provides partial support of the
project for two years.
