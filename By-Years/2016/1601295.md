Jobs in lasers, precision optics, camera systems, photonics, and other technical
areas that employ the science of light are essential aspects of our nation's
technical competitiveness. The results of a recent national survey of photonics
industries in the US conducted by the Advanced Technological Education (ATE)
National Center, OP-TEC, showed that, in the Western US, companies currently
employ nearly 5000 photonics technicians, and projected a need for over 1100
additional technicians over the five-year period following the survey. Irvine
Valley College (IVC) is leveraging an NSF award in photonics that has led to the
development of for-credit courses and an Associates' Degree program in Laser and
Photonics Technology to recruit both additional industry and educational
partners. Together the partners will develop a plan for a Regional Center in
Photonics in the western US to respond to industry need for photonics
technicians.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This planning effort brings together industry
and educational partners from the states of California, Oregon, Washington,
Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Montana and Wyoming to develop a comprehensive
plan for a Regional Center in Optics and Photonics that would prepare students
for entry-level technical positions in the industry. IVC will continue to work
with the ATE National Center, OP-TEC, during the planning process.
