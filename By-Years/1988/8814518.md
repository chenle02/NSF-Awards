Polar regions play an important role in the globally linked climate system.
Observations of antarctic stratospheric ozone depletion provide ample evidence
of the uniqueness of polar atmospheric chemistry owing to extreme cold and
prolonged darkness. During the winter and spring months, the arctic troposphere
contains elevated concentrations of aerosols and gases which are transported
from lower latitudes. Little is known about the chemical processing and removal
of the gas phase constituents. The nitrogen oxides are a primary factor in
controlling the tropospheric level of ozone. Tropospheric ozone, in turn, is
believed to be increasing in the northern hemisphere. Consequently,
understanding the chemistry of the reactive nitrogen species is important. This
project will measure the abundance of several gaseous nitrogen species including
nitric oxide, nitric acid, total reactive odd nitrogen, and peroxyacetyl
nitrate. These measurements will be complemented with determination of nitrate
concentrations in aerosols, rain, snow, and snowpack. Three primary questions
will be addressed: (1) What are the concentrations of various nitrogen oxide
species with respect to meteorological and temporal variations in central
Alaska? (2) What is the chemical processing of these species and how is it
related to ozone concentrations? and (3) How important is wet and dry deposition
as a removal mechanism for these species in central Alaska?
