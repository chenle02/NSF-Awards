Machine-learning algorithms enable pattern recognition from data that are too
complex to model analytically. This pattern recognition is of fundamental
importance in diverse domains. These algorithms are becoming an essential part
of embedded systems that find use in infrastructure, environmental monitoring,
personal health monitoring, energy management, food supply chain, assembly
lines, etc. This research has the potential to enable significant advances in
such systems by enabling highly energy-efficient on-sensor inference to be
performed. With its plans for involving students from underrepresented groups,
industrial engagement, outreach to the broader public, and online distribution
of tools, it is expected to have a broad impact.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The aim
of the proposed work is to explore the energy savings achievable by embedded
signal-processing inference systems through random projections. Random
projections have previously been employed in the context of compressive sensing
to reduce system energy. We have found that when random projections are used to
compress Nyquist signals, the compression mechanism is far more robust, while
offering the possibility of two orders of magnitude system energy savings. We
term this mechanism compressed signal processing. We propose work on bringing
this concept to fruition through new methodologies and signal-processing
architectures. In addition, we propose the use of genetic programming and error-
aware inference to tackle the nonlinear signal-processing problem. We plan
extensive evaluations of the system-level energy-accuracy tradeoffs the proposed
mechanisms offer.
