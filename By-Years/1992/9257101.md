Motivated by the need for robust polymers optically superior to polyamides yet
suitable for cointegration of optical interconnection waveguides directly with
the active CMOS interconnection substrate of advanced multi-chip modules (MCMs),
the research seeks to fabricate the first optical waveguides with
polyphenylsilsesquioxane (PPSQ), a spin castable, low temperature processed
silicon ladder polymer used as a thin and thick film dielectric for
microelectronics. This material potentially offers the low loss obtainable with
less stable optical polymers while offering thermal stability and process
latitude (patterning, wet, dry etching) exceeding that of polyamide. This
research assesses the suitability of PPSQ together with planarizing and
superstrate polymer layers for providing a multilayer system supporting
fabrication of high density waveguide arrays directly over the Si devices of
emerging active MCM substrate.
