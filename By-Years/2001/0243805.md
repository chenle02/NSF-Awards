This award provides support for research on a novel fabrication method for
structures with nanoscale features which extend in three spatial dimensions. The
bioinspired nanofabrication technique funded under this grant is comprised of
two steps. First, features are defined on a large membrane-like surface using
state-of-the-art nanolithography. Then the nanostructured membrane is folded in
a prescribed way to yield the three-dimensional functional system. The research
will address fundamental questions relating to the design of the foldable
nanostructures, including material selection, alignment, interconnection and
packaging schemes. Theoretical modeling will be complemented by development and
characterization of experimental prototypes.

If successful, the results of this research will deliver low cost, high yield
and high throughput fabrication methods for miniature devices and systems
serving numerous applications. The third dimension promises to extend the pace
of ever faster processors and higher-capacity memories long after the feature
sizes of planar electronics reach their minimum practical limit. Beyond
electronics, the need to expand to the third dimension is even more urgent.
Examples are drug delivery by miniaturized microfluidic implants, nanocomposite
materials, nanomechanical energy storage elements, miniature chemical and
biochemical reactors and diffractive optics for advanced imaging. Hybrid systems
containing several of these components will be useful in homeland security,
environmental monitoring, and industrial quality control. Moreover, this
research will contribute to the education of nanoscale Engineers who can think
in three dimensions and accelerate the development of products and businesses
based on nanotechnology.
