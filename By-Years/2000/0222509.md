The proposal plans to develop middleware that will allow individuals or groups
using differing collaboration infrastructures to participate in an Access Grid-
based session without the need for human intervention. This will be done by
developing a web services model that will allow components to be updated as they
become available without requiring the whole framework to be reworded. The
proposal will develop three new modules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Network
Services Engine which acts as the principal point of contact between the users
and resolution engine&lt;br/&gt;2. Resolution Engine which matches user
capabilities to the services available; it will also function as a Service
Registry and,&lt;br/&gt;3. Network Services User Interface which provides the
user's view into the network services framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work
will build on the extensive expereince base of the Access Grid
developers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These modules will enable users to maximize
their use of the Access Grid. The Network Services User Interface funnels user
requests for resources to the Network Services Registry, and the Resolution
Engine uses the Network Services Interface to interact with the user in the
event that manual resolution tasks need to be performed. The work will be
beneficial to the collaboration community beyond that of the Access Grid. The
proposal also includes technical guidance, training and evaluation of the Access
Grid space and advice on changes and improvements at University of Chicago and
the NSF Access nodes.
