The team will use a new facility, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA), to measure the motions of gas close to supermassive black holes at
the centers of galaxies. The gas motions will be modeled to obtain precise black
hole masses. Such precision is needed to test puzzling hints that black holes
grow in lock step with their host galaxies. The precise masses will also anchor
inventories of black holes in the local universe. The team will also study the
properties of the gas. Senior team members will mentor junior members drawn from
underrepresented groups; undergraduate students from California State
Universities and Community Colleges will have research opportunities beyond
those available in their own institutions.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The team will
use ALMA's exquisite angular resolution to study molecular gas disks deep in the
potential well of supermassive black holes. Their goals are to (1) use initial
ALMA observations to identify target systems with high-velocity rotation and (2)
use follow-up ALMA observations to constrain the masses of the black holes and
the properties of their cold, circumnuclear disks.
