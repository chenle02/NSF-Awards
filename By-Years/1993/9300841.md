This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program provides
continued support for research on the nature of metal-metal bonding by Dr.
Dennis L. Lichtenberger of the Chemistry Department, University of Arizona.
Using photoelectron spectroscopy, Lichtenberger is able to characterize the
electronic structure of metal-metal interactions as affected by changes in
chemical environment. The strength of the metal-metal bonds under investigation
ranges from quadruple and triple bonds to those with only weak associations. The
metals used most commonly are chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, rhodium,
ruthenium, and iron. Ligands will also vary, and in some cases the metals will
be bridged. Plans are also in place to study some terminal metal-oxo, metal-
nitrido, and metal-alkyne systems, in which multiple bonding between a metal and
a heteroatom occurs. Lichtenberger will also continue to improve the high
precision X-ray core photoelectron spectroscopy instrumentation in his
laboratory for study of both gas phase and condensed species, including thin
films of metallic materials. %%% The structure, stability and reactivity of
metal-metal bonds influences many chemical, catalytic, and materials processes.
By developing methods to study a wide variety of multi-metal systems and
cataloging fundamental information about their electronic behavior, Dr. Dennis
L. Lichtenberger of the University of Arizona will contribute to both the
theoretical and practical understanding of systems that are important in the
chemical and electronic industries.
