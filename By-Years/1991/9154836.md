This proposal is designed to establish a Science Institute for elementary
teachers at the University of California, Davis, and is based on a similar NSF-
funded project at U.C. San Diego. The Institute will invite 75 elementary school
teachers identified as leaders to participate in a program spanning a three-year
period, beginning in July, 1993. Teams of 2-3 teachers from each participating
school will participate each year in a 4-wk summer Institute followed by monthly
Saturday seminars (8) during the academic year. During the summer institutes,
participants will attend lectures and labs on biological science (Yr 1), earth
and space science (Yr 2), and physical science (Yr 3); during the Saturday
sessions of the academic year, teachers will work on integration of these
disciplines into themes suggested by the California Science Framework.
Outstanding UCD scientist-educators will emphasize major concepts and principles
in an interactive setting that utilizes demonstrations and small and large group
discussion, and master teachers and science educators will work with
participants in adapting exemplary curricular materials to correlate with the
California Model Curriculum Guide and the California Science Framework.
Districts will be expected to provide support in the form of release time, space
and materials. Participants will be expected to act as resources to their
schools and districts and to provide inservice workshops for other classroom
teachers, reaching at least 2325 teachers in all. This project is appropriate
for the Teacher Enhancement Program because it will greatly enhance the science
knowledge and teaching of lead teachers, and is designed to reach a large number
of their colleagues as well. The cost-sharing amount is approximately 16% of the
amount requested from NSF.
