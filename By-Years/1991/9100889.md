Elemental analyses of carbon and nitrogen in oceanographic research crosses the
disciplines of biology, chemistry, and geology and involves a diverse array of
sample types including laboratory-grown microbial (e.g. bacteria, phytoplankton,
protozoa) and zooplankton biomass, water column particulates, sediment trap
material, surface microlayer samples, and benthic core samples. For scientists
at WHOI such measurements play pivotal roles in studies on phytoplankton and
bacterial nutrient dynamics, primary production, water column nutrient cycling,
microbial food chain dynamics, water column particulate transformations and
fluxes, hydrothermal vent biology and chemistry, petroleum geochemistry, air-sea
exchange processes, and benthic-water column interactions. We are requesting a
new CHN elemental analyzer that will be shared by a diverse group of WHOI
scientists from 4 different departments.
