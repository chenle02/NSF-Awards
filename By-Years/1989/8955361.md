The Science Museum of Minnesota plans to design, construct and circulate a
five-thousand square-foot multidisciplinary exhibit whose purpose is to
stimulate public interest in Antarctica and to increase understanding on the
continent--its physical history, characteristics and geographies, and the
approaches and tools that scientists use to help decipher and understand it.
Because of the importance of Antarctica in relation to global environmental
systems the exhibit will explore the physical connections between the continent
and the rest of the world, as well as some of the scientific, political and
economic issues and choices that will affect its future and ours as well. The
exhibit will contain traditional displays of geological, biological and other
museums specimens, historical and contemporary photographs, models, dioramas and
descriptive text, as well as interactive displays and video. The museum will
develop the exhibit in association with the Science Museum Exhibit
Collaborative, among whose eight members the exhibit will circulate beginning in
the spring of 1991.
