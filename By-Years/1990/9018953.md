This award is for completion of the completion of the complex apparatus for
shear anelasticity measurements on olivine. The PIs have developed an active
water cooling system to remove waste heat from the furnace, and will soon have
the apparatus working at high temperatures. The oxygen fugacity control
developed using remotely conditioned argon gas is operational, and will be
incorporated into the system.
