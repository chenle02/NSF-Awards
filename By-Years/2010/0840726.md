The four phase project builds on the successful outcomes of previous Gordon
Conferences on Visualization in Science and Education. It brings together
roughly 130 leading international researchers and science educators for: two
workshops on assessment and design; a Gordon Conference on Visualization in
Science and Education; five collaborative Visionary Mini-Grants for exploratory
research across interdisciplinary communities; and a post-conference interim
workshop for evaluation and planning. The conference has been re-organized in
the current proposal to bridge science practice with science education. The
sessions are organized around conceptual themes rather than scientific
disciplines in order to explore the connections between visualization and
understanding. Many of the invited speakers and all of the proposed activities
surrounding the conference will be heavily focused on the learning and cognitive
aspects of revealing nature and of generating insight.
