9402360 Perfit The PIs collected samples by rock coring and Alvin dives
(Adventure I & II Cruises) on the ridge crest and flanks from EPR 9N area. In
this project, they will obtain U-Th dates and geochemical analyses of these
samples, and combine them with their photo interpretation to check their 3-D
model of the magmatic system beneath fast- spreading ridge. Their goal is to
determine magma residence times and magma residence times and magma generation
and fractionation processes.
