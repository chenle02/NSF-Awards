This project explores the role of centennial to millennial-scale climate
variability, particularly wet and dry extremes, in governing the tempo, rate,
and spatial pattern of invasion and expansion of three economically and
ecologically important tree species (yellow birch, hemlock, beech) near their
northwestern range limits in the western Great Lakes region. Geographic ranges
and population sizes of these species have expanded episodically in the last
5000 years, and preliminary evidence indicates that these expansions were paced
by climate variability. We will use paleoecological methods (analysis of pollen,
macrofossils, and stomates from lake and peatland sediments) to delineate the
spatial and temporal patterns of these expansions, and paleoclimatological
methods (analyses of paleontological and geochemical indicators from peatland
sediments) to develop detailed, independent records of spatial and temporal
patterns of climate variability. Comparison of the paleoecological and
paleoclimatological data will link the ecological responses to climate
variations across a range of timescales. Understanding ecological and climatic
dynamics of the past will contribute to our ability to predict ecological
responses to ongoing and future climatic change.
