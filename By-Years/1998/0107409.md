EIA-0107409&lt;br/&gt; Aspray, William&lt;br/&gt;Computing Research
Association&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Special Projects: The Recruitment and
Retention of Faculty and Graduates Students in Computer Science and
Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award to the Computing Research
Association (CRA) provides funds to support a significant study of the current
problems of recruitment and retention of graduate students and faculty in
computing research fields. The project is collecting and analyzing data and
information on the subject, will develop suggested actions for interested
agencies and other organizations to take, and will establish means to collect
the data and information on an ongoing basis so that it will be on hand as
problems arise in the future. The study group consists of twelve to fifteen
qualified individuals selected from various areas of the computing research
community.&lt;br/&gt;
