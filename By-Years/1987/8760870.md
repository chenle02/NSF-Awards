This Phase I SBIR project proposes to synthesize fluorescent probes as a novel
approach to monitoring dopamine receptor mobility in brain membranes.
Fluorescent compounds will be coupled to dopamine agonists (therapeutic drugs
for Parkinson's disease) and antagonists (therapeutic agents for schizophrenia).
The P.I. will test the affinity and selectivity of these compounds for dopamine
receptors. Neural membranes at various levels of tissue organization will
consequently be exposed to the fluorescent probe, photobleached by laser beam,
and the recovery of fluorescence will be monitored by fluorescent microscopy.
These compounds will provide much needed information on the mobility of dopamine
receptors occupied by therapeutic drugs.
