This proposal will be awarded using funds made available by the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law
111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is aimed at exploring the development
of a highly scalable software framework for global algorithms in three
dimensions, such as Fast Fourier Transforms(3D FFT) and other analogous
algorithms, tuned for massively parallel petascale architectures.
