The Pathways to Graduate School and Careers in the Mathematical Sciences project
will increase the number of trained scholars ready to enter the STEM workforce.
Scholarship support will be offered to students in South Texas Rio Grande Valley
pursuing professional careers in fields requiring a significant background in
Mathematics. The effort's broader impacts lie in the creation of infrastructure
for a necessary and permanent South Texas bridge to graduate school and
professional careers in the mathematical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Pathways project will mentor University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV)
undergraduates through the vital period from their freshman year to the
completion of a Masters degree. Financial and academic support will be provided
to 22 students within UTRGV's 5-year BS/MS degree in mathematics. The objective
of the project is to prepare students for careers in mathematics, statistics,
and related fields through a close support network, early involvement in
research, and an emphasis on graduate degree attainment. The recruitment,
retention, mentoring, development, and academic support installed through this
coordinated approach will provide a solid foundation for future STEM scholars in
the Rio Grande Valley. Program assessment and data collected will provide
evidence to inform strategies for increasing the success of mathematics
mentoring programs at other Minority Serving Institutions.
