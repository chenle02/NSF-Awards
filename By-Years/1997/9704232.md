The goal of this research is to stretch the computational limits of Bayesian
inference with focus on embedded, real-time problems. Bayesian probability, as
both a theoretical framework and as a representational and computational method,
is having a profound impact on artificial intelligence research and practice.
However, limitations is available computational methods still hamper widespread
application, especially in real- time and embedded systems. This research builds
from a core focus on search-based approximation methods, using real-time
decision evaluation as its experimental tool, and extends to scaling issues
including compilation (including reinforcement-learning) and control of
communication in distributed systems. Results of this research will include
improved methods for real-time monitoring and assessment for industrial, medical
and consumer applications.
