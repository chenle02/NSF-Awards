DMS-950993 CUNY-Baruch - Arthur Apter The Mid Atlantic Mathematical Logic
Seminar (MAMLS) was formed in 1982. Since then it has been supporting three or
four regional meetings in logic per year, each of 1-2 days' length. The hosting
of the meetings is shared among several institutions, with additional support
for the seminar from the host institution in most cases. The topics cover a
broad spectrum of topics from mathematical logic, with program constructed by
the host organizers. NSF support is provided for some of the expenses of the
speakers and the attendees from the region, in particular of the graduate
students who attend.
