This Small Business Innovation Research project will apply recent advances in
ground probing radar (GPR) technology to the aerial reconnaissance of
underground facilities (UGF). Ground probing radar is a proven technology for
investigating subsurface targets and structures. Its application to subsurface
monitoring from airborne platforms, however, has been limited due to clutter and
signal strength problems. The project seeks to overcome these problems by the
use of a beamsteered antenna array that provides increased signal power and
increased angular resolution. The system will ultimately be suspended from an
airborne platform to facilitate rapid coverage of a region of interest (ROI).
The narrow transmit array beam scans the ROI, and at the correct angle of
incidence a strong reflection from the UGF is received. The phase I project
comprises three main tasks: first, simulating the proposed system; second, using
the results of simulations to refine existing array control algorithms, and;
third, testing the hardware prototype. A large part of the effort lies in
software development in simulations and algorithm refinement. The results of
Phase I will be used to develop and test a commercially marketable GPR system
during the phase II effort. If the technology can be successfully developed, it
will make airborne detection of near-surface UGFs in realistic environments
feasible. The system is designed to enhance existing commercial GPR systems and
will greatly reduce the cost of data acquisition of areal targets while
enhancing data quality. The dynamic monitoring aspect of the instrumentation is
unique and has application from the standpoint of characterizing extensive
hazardous waste sites numbering in the thousands across the United States. This
option will provide a low-cost alternative to invasive monitoring techniques.
