This project is designed to implement a program suitable for large universities
in which the students in the calculus and applied mathematics courses can carry
out the experimentation part of their course work in a computing laboratory. The
computer is being used as a tool for experimentation in the context of an actual
laboratory. Many members of the faculty are working to develop the necessary
tools for these courses and see the tremendous advantage that this brings to the
overall teaching and learning experience. A laboratory manual consisting of 28
modules has been written and is being class tested in all sections of vector
calculus offered at the university.
