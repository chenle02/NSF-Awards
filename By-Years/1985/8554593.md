This project is a partnership among San Diego County school districts, the
University of California-San Diego, and industry to improve the quality of
teaching at the middle/junior high school and senior high school levels. Year
one will address the needs of participants from the middle/junior high schools.
Year two will address the needs of participants from the high school. The target
population will include teachers of science courses with background deficiencies
in science as well as those with science backgrounds but who lack sufficient
training in teaching methodology. Fifty teachers from the San Diego County
schools will be selected each year. The summer phase will be a six-week program
consisting of intensive subject area seminars, methodology workshops, and some
internships in laboratory setting. School year activities will include the
initiation of a hot-line to the San Diego County Office of Education, follow-up
visits to the participants' schools, and a monthly colloquium.
