This award supports an exploratory visit to the islands of Sao Tome &amp;
Principe and Annobon in the Gulf of Guinea for the purposes of evaluating the
possibility of using massive corals from these localities for paleoclimatic
reconstructions of the Subsahara and Northern Africa. Corals will be analyzed to
assess whether these localities reveal know histories of drought and excess rain
fall in the subsahara. The nature of this research is exploratory because it is
contingent upon there being corals of the suitable size and age.
