The Third International Symposium on Cold Regions Heat Transfer will be held
June 12-14, 1991, at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks. The overall purpose of
the symposium is to bring together international researchers and engineers who
are active in the areas of phase change in porous media, icing phenomena and
frost formation, heat transfer in structures, mechanical systems for cold
climates, and ground freezing and thawing. The forum will provide an environment
for the review and dissemination of recent scientific and technical information
related to all aspects of heat transfer in cold climates.
