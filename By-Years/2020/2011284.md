The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP)
through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and
study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the
preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue
science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or
careers. The project at Jackson State University will enhance undergraduate
education in the departments of computer science, emergency management
technology, meteorology, and psychology so that students underrepresented in
STEM, but particularly women students, are prepared to successfully enter
graduate programs or careers in STEM, specifically in the areas emergency
management and/or disaster preparedness. This project will reach into the
community by hosting classes and outreach events that promote safety and
preparedness in vulnerable areas. It will engage the community to provide the
tools they need to remain safe before, during and after a natural
disaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the project are to: improve the
retention and persistence of undergraduate underrepresented students,
particularly women, in the fields of computer science, emergency management
technology, meteorology and psychology through a deliberate mentoring program;
increase studentsâ€™ knowledge base, research skills, and awareness of emergency
management and/or disaster preparedness by implementing a set evidence-based
activities culminating in a research symposium; advance the STEM curriculum by
creating a course on disaster preparedness and resilience; and establish a
disaster preparedness and resilience teaching and research laboratory. The
project is guided by an external evaluation team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
