University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Events, Patterns, and Analysis: Forecasting
International Conflict in the Twenty-First Century&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This
grant will support work on international conflict prediction using techniques
such as data mining, statistical machine learning, and stochastic modeling. News
data from such sources as Reuters, AP, cnn.com, and UPI will be used to extract
data about political events. Each event will code with a time, list of
participants and other standardized characteristics to support the analysis and
forecasting.&lt;br/&gt;
