The planning for the Advanced Biotechnology Education Center represents a
collaborative effort between California Community Colleges, the California State
University system, the University of California system, national laboratories,
California secondary school districts and biotechnology industries. Providing
50% of the biotechnology industry and 17% of higher education opportunities,
California recognizes the imperative to plan a Center that addresses the needs
of industry and the needs for basic science education and science literacy. This
project will develop a complete and comprehensive plan to target needs for all
students in biotechnology and basic science courses, especially those from under
represented populations, and provide a national model for curriculum improvement
and development at each stage in the educational/occupational continuum in
biotechnology. California Biotechnology Consortium membership and a Center
Steering Committee will provide leadership for planning curriculum, faculty
enhancement, equipment needs, evaluation and dissemination. Five leaders in
education have been selected for the roles of lead principal investigator and
co-principal investigators. Conferences, electronic networking and
teleconferences will provide the means to develop written reports and a detailed
proposal for an Advanced Biotechnology Education Center.
