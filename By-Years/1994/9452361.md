9452361 Peroni This proposal requests $42,325 for the purchase of MacIntosh
computers, software and accessory equipment to outfit a computer facility for
introductory biology. The computers are necessary for the addition of
investigative modules to the three course introductory series for biology
majors. Computers have not been previously integrated into introductory courses
at Davidson, except on a very limited basis. Computer facilities appropriate to
introductory biology laboratory exercises are not currently available on campus.
The research-based modules will be integrated into all three introductory
courses. All students passing through these courses will then have exposure to:
1) exploring theoretical concepts using computer simulations; 2) design and
execution of small group research projects; 3) critical thinking and writing
exercises. This introductory curriculum will prepare students for a more in-
depth exposure to investigative courses at the junior and senior level, as well
as to prepare them for independent research projects and graduate school. The
computer facility will be used by all introductory students. The introductory
courses will seat approximately 384-448 students each year. Multiple sections of
each course are offered each semester.
