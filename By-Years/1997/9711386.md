Tabled resolution for general logic programs has been shown to be effective in
declaratively solving complex applications, including program verification
through model checking, and program analysis for optimizing compilers. Efficient
implementations of the above applications have been built using the XSB tabled
logic programming system, which perform at least as well as existing
implementations consisting of much larger programs written in lower level
languages. The project is aimed at improving the expressiveness, efficiency and
ease of use of tabled logic programming systems. The main goals of this project
are: (a) To study the interaction of constraint solving with tabled resolution,
a combination that considerably increases the expressiveness of tabled logic
programming systems. (b)To design techniques for optimizing tabled constraint
logic programming systems by extending traditional factoring and indexing to
constraints, and by selective tabling. (c) To construct tools for high-level
debugging of tabled logic programs. Tabling and constraints have both separately
introduced a new level of declarativeness to traditional logic programming
systems. The combination of tabling and constraints enables encoding of problems
that cannot be solved declaratively using either individual paradigm. Tabled
constraint logic programming thus promises to be a significant step towards
realizing the ideal of declarative programming.
