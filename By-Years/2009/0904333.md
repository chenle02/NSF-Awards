In weak states, the central government, if there is one, lacks an effective
monopoly over the use of force. Opposing factions bargain over political power
and economic resources in the shadow of the threat of force. Any faction
dissatisfied with a negotiated outcome can resort to force to try to impose a
more favorable outcome. Some agreements negotiated in the shadow of power - be
they truces, treaties, power-sharing agreements, or constitutions - hold while
others do not. This project examines why some agreements hold and others do not
and explores the the implications of this analysis for state formation and
consolidation. This project shows that persistent fighting may result from the
interaction of two features of the consolidation process. First, consolidation
typically creates a commitment problem as the faction in control of the
government cannot commit itself to not exploiting the stronger bargaining
position it will have once the state consolidates. Second, fighting often
impedes or forestalls the consolidation process and associated shifts in the
distribution of power. The research links the observed pattern of fighting to
the way the distribution of power shifts during the consolidation process.
Factions cut deals and avoid fighting when the underlying distribution of power
is stable or shifting slowly. Rapid shifts lead to fighting.
