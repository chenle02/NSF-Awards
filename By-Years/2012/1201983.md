The North Star STEM Alliance, Minnesota?s Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority
Participation, proposes to advance to a mid-level alliance with the goal of
doubling the number of graduates from 272 to 544 by May,
2017.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new Bridge to the Baccalaureate program
strengthens and enriches relationships with community colleges, creating smooth
transitions for students before, during, and after transferring into
baccalaureate programs. The North Star STEM Alliance, extending the successes of
its initial five-year partnership, implements best practices in engaging and
retaining URMs studying STEM on 15 Minnesota campuses. Undergraduate research, a
featured best practice in retention, will engage more than 375 students,
contributing to discovery and innovation across the spectrum of STEM
disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By May, 2017, the more than 3,200 URM STEM
graduates influenced and supported by the North Star STEM Alliance will enter
the work force or graduate school, diversifying the academy, corporations, and
professional organizations. Many of the Alliance alumni remain in Minnesota,
contributing to a stronger Minnesota economy and the nation?s competitiveness in
the global economy.
