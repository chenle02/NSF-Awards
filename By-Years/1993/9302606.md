Coupled temporal changes in water chemistry and biological community structure
at newly-formed hydrothermal vents on the EPR crest This is a study of the
coupled evolution of fluid chemistry and biological community structure on a
fine scale (9 degree 49.6' - 9 degree 50.6'N) with the abundant diffuse flow
which supports complex animal communities as the principal focus. The work is
coupled with a funded biology program on the East Pacific Rise between 9-10 N to
study the coevolution of the chemistry and biological communities in newly
formed hydrothermal systems. The Alvin program in April 1991 documentated to
within days the occurence of a seafloor volcanic eruption. In 1992 Alvin dives
to this site documented significant changes in both the chemistry of the vents
and the biological communities surrounding them. As this is the only portion of
the mid-ocean ridge system defining "time zero" for an eruptive event and the
formation of a new hydrothermal system, this site offers an unprecedented
opportunity to follow temporal changes in vent chemistry and associated
biological community structure.
