This project will involve the analysis of solitary waves, multi- solitons, and
related phenomena in the theory of nonlinear dispersive systems without
dissipation. Several questions in the analysis of solitary waves will be
examined, including their existence, uniqueness, and stability. Numerical
investigations will supplement theoretical analysis. In addition, the validity
of various approximate equations and certain rigorous properties of nonlinear
dispersive systems of partial differential or integro-differential equations
will be considered. The tools of nonlinear analysis will be supplemented by some
numerical simulation and the special methods of inverse scattering theory.
Solitary waves are localized, nonlinear, progressing waves that subsist on a
balance struck between nonlinear and dispersive effects. They arise in many
physical settings. Rigorous analysis is often quite difficult since the problem
is nonlinear from the outset. Nonlinear model equations have been developed that
predict the presence of solitary waves and capture their qualitative features.
The systems to be studied arise in many areas of nonlinear science including
fluid mechanics, nonlinear optics, solid state physics, oceanography, and
meteorology.
