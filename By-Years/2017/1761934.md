Does exposure to ethnic violence generate effects that persist for decades? Are
victims of violence, including forcibly displaced persons, more or less likely
to participate in politics and are they more likely to hold negative attitudes
toward out-groups? Are recurrences of conflict more likely to trigger negative
reactions among people who have experienced violence in the past? We propose to
study these questions in a "frozen" conflict in Cyprus, where ethnic violence
more than 40 years ago created a de facto partition of the island. We build on
research conducted during the summer of 2016 to explore consequences of violence
exposure in the context of a recently terminated (failed) peace process. Via a
second wave of a nationally-representative survey, we can measure changes in
attitudes as a function of the recent failure of an internationally-mediated
peacemaking process. Our survey covers Greek Cypriots' experiences with
violence, social backgrounds, social and political values, perceptions of and
attitudes toward different ethnic groups, opinions on the reunification of
Cyprus, and participation in civic and political life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In
the aftermath of the failure of reunification talks, we are in the unique
position to do a second round (panel) survey of Greek Cypriots. Our study will
be the first social-scientific analysis of determinants of Greek Cypriot
attitudes toward each other andtoward Turkish Cypriots, testing hypotheses about
how the failure of peace talks and the violence of 1974 affect their political
views and their proclivity to support reunification. Combined with the data
previously collected, these data could help us to better understand how social
preferences respond to ethnic antagonism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
