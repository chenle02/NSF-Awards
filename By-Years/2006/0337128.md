Independent Broadcasting Associates, Inc., is producing a series of twelve radio
features for National Public newsmagazines about the Ganges river basin in South
Asia. The purpose of this series is to examine the relationships between science
and culture as they converge and diverge over issues concerning the Ganga:
through (a) examination of the ecology of the river in two key areas; and (b)
study of the relationships between scientific and religious attitudes applied to
the environmental issues raised in both reaches of the river. The radio series
is complemented by a Web site and extensive educational outreach through 11
state Geographic Alliances, an AP Environmental Science module and a pilot
Virtual River program developed and tested in collaboration with the Museum of
Science in Boston. &lt;br/&gt;
