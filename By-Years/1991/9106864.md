It has always been assumed that pollen characters are determined by the
genotype of the plant (from the classic nature- versus-nurture argument, pollen
traits are assumed to be totally determined by 'nature'). However, recent
experiments have shown that the environment can have important effects on pollen
characters. For instance, work with wild radish demonstrated that pollen from
plants grown under nutrient-limiting conditions sired fewer seeds than pollen
from control plants. This proposal is centered around measuring the genetic and
environmental contributions to variation in pollen traits in Silene alba, white
campion, a common weed in the eastern United States. The pollen traits are
pollen number per flower, pollen size, percent of pollen that has aborted, and
the ability of pollen to sire seeds. Most of the work will consist of
documenting how much natural variation in these traits exists in fields around
New Jersey and, through transplant experiments, how the same genotype performs
in different environments. The result will a precise measurement of the genetic
and environmental contributions to a variety of pollen traits, and perhaps to
paternity itself.
