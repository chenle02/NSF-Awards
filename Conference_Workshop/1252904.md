This proposal provides support for the Young Mathematicians Conference (YMC) to
be held at Ohio State University each year for three years, with the first
conference scheduled to be held on August 9-11, 2013. The YMC showcases
undergraduate research in mathematics at the national level, providing a venue
for up to 70 undergraduate students to present their results in an authentic
research conference experience and discuss mathematics with their peers and with
senior researchers. Invitations to YMC are selective, and applications are
evaluated by a panel of faculty referees. Each conference has three plenary
talks given by world class researchers on diverse topics of high impact and
innovative research of current interest.

The Young Mathematicians Conference is a national opportunity for bright
undergraduates to present their research, to gather new ideas and insights. The
conference aims to support the undergraduate research community in mathematics
on the national level, serve as a focal point for research groups, to inspire
and sustain the enthusiasm and momentum necessary for students to seek and
pursue challenging graduate programs in mathematics. Involvement of mentors into
discussions about generating research projects and supervising students provides
support and stimulation for new directions in undergraduate research. The
plenary talks are engaging, and are disseminated via online video streams,
introducing students, researchers, and the general public into exciting and
original areas of mathematical research.
