PI: Chen, Yu &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:1542063 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI
proposes to develop advanced methods for characterizing an important category of
minimally-invasive diagnostic medical devices. It aims to develop 3D-printed
biomimetic phantoms for the performance testing of near-infrared spectroscopy
systems (NIRS). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Minimally-invasive technologies constitute
a major thrust in the modern medical device universe. Rigorously characterized
phantoms are essential for the design and evaluation of advanced medical imaging
modalities (e.g., CT, MRI). To date no well-established phantom-based test
methods exist for evaluating such key technology areas as NIRS oximetry devices
or hematoma detection systems. This proposal would clear the way for efficient
development and regulatory approval of this highly promising diagnostic
technology. Plans are presented for educational, mentoring, and outreach
activities to advance the proposed cross-disciplinary research program.
