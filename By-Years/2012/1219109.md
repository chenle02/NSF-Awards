Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology provides a means of boosting
network capacity without requiring additional spectrum by exploiting spatially
multiplexing, interference suppression, and spatial diversity. It has received
widespread attention over the past decade from both industry and academic
researchers, now forming a key component of nearly all emerging wireless
standards. Despite the huge promise and considerable attention, a rigorous
algorithm-theoretic framework for maximizing network capacity in multihop
wireless MIMO networks is missing in the state of the art. This project
establishes both the computational hardness and approximation hardness of
maximizing network capacity in multihop wireless MIMO networks, and develops
practical approximation algorithms with provably good performance. A polyhedral
approach is taken by the project to construct various polynomial approximate
capacity subregions of multihop wireless MIMO networks. These approximate
capacity subregions not only are the algorithmic foundation of maximizing
network capacity in multihop wireless MIMO networks, but also serve as a basis
for interesting future projects on cross-layer design and optimizations in
multihop wireless MIMO networks. They are also of independent interest to the
theoretical computer science community and communications community at large.
This project provides scholarships to graduate students and offers research
topics for strong dissertation works on multihop wireless networks. The outcome
of this project will not only be disseminated to the professional researchers
through journals and conference proceedings, but also be integrated into the
lecture notes targeted for senior undergraduate students and graduate students.
