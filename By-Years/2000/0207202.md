0207202&lt;br/&gt;de Pamphillis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project is
designed to accomplish two aims: Aim 1: To construct and array high-quality BAC
libraries to provide a genomic resource on a wide range of species. Aim 2: To
enable researchers working with green algae, non-seed land plants, and seed
plants (including flowering plants) to identify genes critical for understanding
plant form and function and how land plants arose and diversified. This project
will enable progress toward an understanding of the genetic basis for the
transitions that mark the most fundamentally important steps in green plant
evolution. The Deep Green community
(http://ucjeps.herb.berkeley.edu/bryolab/deepgene/index.html) will help to
provide an infrastructure for ongoing scientific exchange. Bioinformatics and a
web site will be provided to the community to access these resources
(http://www.genome.clemson.edu/). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Selected Species:
Desired coverage is given in parentheses. Where two coverage values are listed,
two libraries using different restriction enzymes will be
made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Green algae: &lt;br/&gt;Volvox carteri (5x, 5x)
