A two semester sophomore engineering laboratory, "Introduction to
Experimentation", is computer integrated. Each of 24 experimental stations will
be equipped with a network computer and integrated word processor, spreadsheet,
database, and graphics software. The computer is interfaced to a digital
multimeter. Current experiments are performed by the student using the
spreadsheet and the word processor for all data analysis, graphics, and lab
report production. The campus network provides data transfer and printing on a
local laser print server. In addition, data acquisition of electrical signals
are computerized, using the multimeters and digital oscilloscopes. This lab
improvement update is an important addition to the curriculum because the
computer engineering and technology tools that are currently used professionally
must be included in a modern curriculum. In addition to being a significant
advance toward that goal, the laboratory improvement provides a platform for
further implementation of computer assisted experimentation. This lab is taken
by all engineering and science sophomores, so that it has the widest possible
exposure, and in addition, it supplies a base of student expertise that can be
built upon in the following two years.
