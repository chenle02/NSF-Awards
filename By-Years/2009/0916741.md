Interfaces are used to specify and verify the interaction between components of
a system in a wide variety of programming languages and distributed systems.
Stateful interfaces add expressive power by allowing the possible interactions
to change over time. The goals of this project are to develop a foundational
framework for stateful interfaces, and to apply the framework in two domains:
(a) typesafe, generic components for efficient XML stream processing, with
application to web services and related distributed system components; (b)
memory consistency specifications, with application to reliable shared-memory
programs that take advantage of increasingly common multi-processor systems.
This project integrates session types for communication centered programming and
typestates for object protocols by providing a common foundational framework
that includes the following key features: (a) polymorphism, allowing reuse of
typed code; (b) copyable, non-linear use of objects and channels, allowing
several clients to share a single reference to a server; (c) expressive
quantificiation, allowing the specification of memory-consistency guarantees
that are ubiquitous in shared-memory programming. The research will advance
foundations that will help improve software development and debugging of shared
memory multi-core programming.
