Shaw/Abstract The objective of this research is large-eddy simulation (LES) of
the atmospheric surface layer in which the lowest portion of the three-
dimensional computational domain represents a plant copy such as a forest. The
vegetation is represented by a foliage element are density, a drag coefficient,
and a sensible heat and water vapor source or sink at each grid point within the
canopy. In the LES, scales of motion resolved by the grid network are computed
directly in time-dependent form, while sub-grid-scale processes are
parameterized. Our plan is to use the simulations to study the nature of
turbulence in the vicinity of plant canopies, and to apply the technique to more
realistic (such as inhomogeneous) situations. We will perform in-depth studies
of coherent structures created within the computed flow fields and follow them
from inception to dissipation (an impossible task in the field). Structures will
initially be detected using wavelet and other related techniques, complemented
by computer animation. It is our aim to obtain as complete a picture as possible
of coherent structures developing at the interface between the lower atmosphere
and a plant canopy. The method of proper orthogonal decomposition will also be
applied to computed LES fields. A complete thermal energy balance of the
vegetation and of the underlying soil will be incorporated into the model to
more correctly introduce soil evaporation, transpiration, and heat storage in
both soil and biomass. The influence of aeroelastic properties of the vegetation
will also be introduced and a study made of the phenomenon of honami. As a
demonstration of our interests in this regard, we have begun an examination of
the windbreak problem. All computation will be performed on the Cray Y-MP at the
National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).
