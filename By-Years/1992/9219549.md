The Norumbega Fault Zone in Maine is a major feature long considered to be a
dextral strike-slip fault system. Preliminary observations suggest however that
the NE-SW striking fault zone represents a partial crustal profile of a major
transcurrent boundary, with significantly different crustal levels exposed along
strike. This project is aimed at taking advantage of this feature to
characterize the styles of metamorphism and deformation processes with
increasing depth in the crust. It will employ detailed mapping, petrology and
Ar/Ar geochronology to constrain timing of deformation events, along four areas
or transects along strike. Results will elucidate the tectonic significance of
this fault zone in the development of the Appalachian orogen.
