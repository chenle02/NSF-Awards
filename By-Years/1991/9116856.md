This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative research project
between Professor Yuki-Kazu Iwasa, Department of Mechanical Engineering,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Professor Kaoru Yamafuji, Department
of Electronics, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan. Other U.S. investigators
involved in the project are from the University of Wisconsin, Oak Ridge National
Laboratory, the National Institute for Standards and Technology, and Brookhaven
National Laboratory. Other Japanese investigators are from Osaka University,
Yokohama National University, Iwate University, and Nihon University. The
project will focus on three important areas of research on superconducting
magnet technology: (1) engineering issues on high-Tc superconductor magnet
technology, emphasizing and incorporating the requirements of fabricability,
windability, stability, protection, and operating temperature; (2) thermal
stability and protection for high-Tc magnet systems; and (3) AC losses in high-
Tc superconductors. The U.S. and Japanese research groups will share their
unique facilities to collaborate in both experimental and analytical studies in
these important areas.
