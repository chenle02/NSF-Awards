9400032 Newton The project focuses on the development of multi-scale singular
perturbation techniques and nonlinear WKB methods to study the interaction of
high frequency oscillations with nonlinear dispersive waves. A particular
emphasis will be placed on rapidly forced amplitude equations arising in
hydrodynamic stability theory. A general goal will be to construct explicit
approximate solutions showing interactions of high and low frequency waves in
the form of asymptotic expansions. Specifically, we will study a rapidly forced
Ginzburg-Landau model of relevance to transition to turbulence problems, and the
Zakharov system, a hyperbolic- dispersive system modeling the interaction of
fast acoustic waves with a dispersive plasma. A main goal of the work described
in the proposal is to understand how higher order terms in an amplitude equation
hierarchy can affect lower order dynamical wave interactions. In general, the
higher order terms can feed high frequency oscillations into the lower order
system creating important long time effects akin to the secular behavior well
known in the context of celestial mechanics. The methods to be developed will
give a useful way of tracking the influence of externally generated high
frequency oscillations on evolving nonlinear dispersive waves.
