This project will deliver in-service training to teachers of geography. Thirty
teachers, grades 6-10, will be selected from Minnesota and Western Wisconsin.
During the program the participants will take two graduate courses, Advanced
Regional Geography and Curriculum Development Workshop. Each participant will
produce six modules for use in world-regional and North American geography
courses. Preference for admission into the program will be given to teams made
up of both elementary and secondary school teachers. Such teams will be expected
to be involved in improving geographic education at all levels in their
district's curriculum. The participants will attend a three-week Workshop during
the summer of 1986 and our all-day follow-up sessions during the academic year.
In addition to the main components of the program, co-curricular activities will
be arranged so that the participants can meet their peers from Japan who will be
at Macalester attending an institute for teachers of English.
