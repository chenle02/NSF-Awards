This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will design,
build, and test a hybrid Raman analyzer suitable for "on-demand" or continuous
process monitoring. The Phase I project demonstrated feasibility by designing
and testing a unique combination of components that yielded greater than 100
times improvement in sensitivity (defined as the signal-to-noise ratio) compared
to traditional Raman analyzers. The novel design also demonstrated high
resolution (1 cm -1), invariant wavelength stability, and freedom from
fluorescence interference; which are critical requirements for autonomous
chemical process monitoring or rapid raw-material identification. The Phase II
project will further improve sensitivity, as well as demonstrate long-term
temperature and vibrational immunity, and fast "turn-on" time. Complete internal
analyzer diagnostics will allow greater than 1000 hours of unattended operation.
As such, the analyzer will be rugged, compact and portable (10"x 12" footprint),
low-maintenance, require minimum power, and suitable for numerous industrial
applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial applications will be directed
toward the chemical manufacturing industries. The Phase II prototype will be
used to develop specific applications with customers during Phase
III.&lt;br/&gt;
