Extracting information from stationary and/or dynamic data is an important task
in many scientific and industrial problems; including but not limited to,
machine learning, data mining, image processing, and automated analysis of
scientific data. This project focuses on learning the underlying process that
generates observational data, in a sense, "reverse-engineering" models from
data. These models are often used to gain insights on the data (for example,
determining mathematical principles from experimental observations) or to make
data-enabled decisions (for example, trend prediction). This is a challenging
mathematical and computational problem, since one often has limited information
on the process beforehand and real data is often noisy and/or incomplete. The
research objective is to construct efficient computational methods for learning
generating functions. This will involve a variety of mathematical techniques
centered around optimization and sampling theory. The educational objective is
to provide advanced training to undergraduate and graduate students in order to
prepare them for the U.S. STEM workforce. In particular, students will be
mentored and trained through mathematical and computational research projects,
collaborative summer programs, working groups, and advanced courses that
integrate education and research.

The goal is to develop computational methods for model learning, data analysis,
and other machine learning tasks. The overall objectives include: (i) the
construction of optimization models that use sparsity, smoothness, and
randomness to supplement the learning, (ii) the design of efficient and provably
convergent numerical methods, (iii) the development of methods that are robust
to sample size and outliers, and (iv) the creation and implementation of
activities for undergraduate and graduate students that integrate education and
research.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
