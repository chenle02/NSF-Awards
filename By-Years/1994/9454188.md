9454188 Stefanich This project is conducting a two-day conference (March 21-22,
1995) prior to the National Science Teachers Association Convention in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The conference will include invited papers, panels,
and working groups evaluating the current practices and future directions in
science education for students with disabilities. The purpose of the conference
is to educate science teacher educators, science teachers, and professionals
providing services and/or equipment to persons with disabilities as to what
resources and strategies are effective for quality science education for
students with disabilities. General goals of the conference are: 1. To model
instructional strategies and provide specific suggestions which can enhance and
contribute to the learning and participation of students with disabilities in
the science classroom and laboratory. 2. To increase awareness of technological
and educational advancements which can enhance and contribute to the learning
and participation of students with disabilities. Participants will be provided
with opportunities to actually experience effective instructional practice for
persons with disabilities while receiving guidance and direction from an
educator and a scientists, with the disability, in each of four disability areas
along with a science educator and special educator with expertise in the area of
cognitive impairments. Recommendations for improved practice will be shared and
responded to by participants. Information in areas of career concerns, teacher
education, methods, materials/programs, dissemination, evaluation and
assessment, and educational organizations and agencies will be compiled and
prepared into a document for conference participants. The proceedings will be
completed following the conference, and become available to interested
individuals and agencies at a nominal cost. ***
