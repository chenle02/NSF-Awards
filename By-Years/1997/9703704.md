The 1997 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory will be held in Ulm
Germany June 29 - July 4, 1997. Papers presented will address new results in the
following areas: applications of information theory, image and speech coding,
coded modulation, communication systems, multi-user information theory,
cryptography and security, neural networks, data compression, optical
communications, data networks, pattern recognition, detection and estimation,
Shannon theory, distributed information processing, signal processing, error-
control coding, source coding, and stochastic processes. This symposium is a
premiere meeting in the field of Information theory. Travel through this grant
will provide travel support for U.S. Participants, particularly graduate
students and new faculty whose papers have been selected for presentation at the
symposium, but who lack the travel funds to the conference site.
