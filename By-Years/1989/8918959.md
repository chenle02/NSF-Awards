Professor Dennis Lichtenberger is funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry
program of the NSF. His work includes studies on new metal compounds of gas
samples as well as thin films by irradiation of samples with high energy light
and the observation of the thin film samples by electron microscopy. This work
by Professor Lichtenberger focuses on the features of metal-metal interactions
in a wide range of chemical environments such as strongly bound ligands, weakly
bound molecules and coordinated surfaces. Knowledge of these interactions
contributes to the understanding of important fundamental chemical, catalytic
and physical processes involving metals. One of the primary goals of this work
is to come to a better comprehension of chemical bond making and breaking. The
longer range goals of the project include an understanding of the relationship
between the structure, bonding and reactivity of transition metal compounds.
