The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will acquire several items of
oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared use equipment.
This equipment is maintained for use on or in association with the three
research vessels the institution operates. A substantial part of the ships'
operating schedule during 1989 is in support of NSF-sponsored research projects.
The instrumentation will also increase the capabilities of the ships and of the
institution to support research and engineering activities. The instrumentation
includes: -Precision Integrated Navigational system for continuously monitoring
the research vessel's position from a variety of navigational aids, -High purity
water system for producing reagent quality water for shipboard analytical
systems, -Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler spares for insuring continuous
measurements of subsurface circulation features, -Rosette sampler for collecting
discrete seawater samples at specific water depths, -Survey quality LORAN
radionavigation receiver, -CTD maintenance and upgrade for obtaining detailed
profiles of seawater conductivity and temperature as a function of depth,
-Plotter for display of seafloor profiles, -Optical disk drive system and other
equipment for increasing shared-use, sea-going computing capabilities, and
-Precision salinometer and titroprocessor for determining the salinity of
seawater. The instrumentation described above will increase the capability of
the Institution to support NSF-sponsored research and engineering projects.
