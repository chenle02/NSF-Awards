They will continue a joint theoretical and expermental approach to the study of
defects in materials. Much of the effort will be directed towards NMR in
amorphous semiconductors, in disordered metallic alloys, and in very small
sample materials at high pressures and in superlattice arrays. Their principal
goal is to examine the role of hydrogen rearrangements in amorphous
semiconductors and metallic alloys.
