This award is for the partial support of a conference in the field of Theory of
Special Functions. The main emphasis of the conference will be on application of
special functions in Number Theory, Quantum Groups, Mathematical Physics,
Combinatorics and Computer Algebra. Such a multidisciplinary character of the
conference makes it a significant event in the development of the field itself
and its applications. The conference will be held in conjunction with the
session of the Advanced Study Institute funded by NATO and will attract leading
researchers in the field from many different countries and many young
investigators. The conference will be jointly supported with the Division of
International Programs.
