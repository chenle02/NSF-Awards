This award supports research in Elementary Particle Physics by Dr. Peter T.
Timbie, a Presidential Young Investigator, Brown University. The aim of the
research is to develop and employ new types of sensitive cryogenic detectors of
infrared and microwave background radiation, the relic from the Big Bang. This
radiation tells us the temperature and distribution of matter in the early phase
of the universe. Both bolometer detectors cooled at very low temperature and
superconducting tunnel junction will be used to build a small array for the
observation of this microwave background radiation. These detectors will also be
used to detect particles that interact only weakly with matter, such as the
particle which may form the "dark matter" of the universe or neutrinos.
