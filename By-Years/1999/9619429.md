AST-9619429 Studies of Interstellar Processes. Dr. Bruce Draine's research
focuses on improving the microphysical basis for modeling interstellar
processes. With this award he will carry out theoretical investigations into the
alignment of interstellar grains, grain optics, photodissociation regions, and
magnetohydrodynamic shock waves in diffuse interstellar clouds.
