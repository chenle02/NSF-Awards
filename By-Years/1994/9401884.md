9401884 Trost This award from the Office of Secial Projects of the Division of
Chemistry and the Eastern Europe Program of the International Division will
enable the participation of thirteen American chemists and thirteen chemists
from the Former Soviet Union (FSU) in a Bilateral National Science
Foundation/FSU Workshop on Organic Synthesis being held at Stanford University
in Palo Alto, California, on March 9-12, 1994. The workshop will also be
attended by six leading research leaders from industry. The goal of the Workshop
is to stimulate future contacts between American and Russian chemists and to
help define the academic/industrial interface in chemistry. FSU participants
will attend the National Meeting of the American Chemical Society following the
Workshop to further their contacts with U.S. chemists and to gain a more
intimate understanding of the chemical sciences in the United States. ***
