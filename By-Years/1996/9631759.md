OCE-9631759 This project will examine variations in ocean circulation and
climate in the subpolar North Atlantic on timescales of 1000-10,000 years
(suborbital). Three time slices, each covering a single glacial/interglacial
cycle, will be studied, each chosen to represent climate states under different
conditions of solar forcing: Stage 11/12 (the 100K world during an extreme warm
climate) Stage 33/34 (typical 41K world), and the mid-Pliocene (extreme warm
pre-glacial world). Analyses will include planktic and benthic isotopes, SST
estimates from planktic forams, and abundance of ice-rafted detritus, all at
250-yr intervals.
