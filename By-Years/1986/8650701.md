This project will make a significant contribution to the undergraduate chemistry
program at Mills College by providing a 60-MHz NMR spectrometer with a variable-
temperature accessory and sophisticated computer interfacing. Acquisition of
this instrument is part of the on- going curriculum development in the
department. The computer-interfaced NMR will be used by students in organic
chemistry, instrumental analysis, biochemistry, physical chemistry, and
undergraduate research. In addition, new experiments for undergraduate
laboratories will be developed to investigate temperature-dependent phenomena
and the application of NMR techniques to biochemical problems. This project will
help Mills College continue to make a significant contribution to preparing
women for careers in science.
