Understanding the mechanisms responsible for the development and maintenance of
widespread severe convective windstorms (derechos), that are responsible for
numerous casualties and significant property damage each year, remains an
important research focus. These mechanisms have been examined with idealized
simulations of strong, line-oriented convection (squall lines) of which derecho-
producing convective systems are a subset. These past studies emphasize the
importance of environmental wind shear in controlling the strength and longevity
of squall lines. While recent studies describing observed derecho environments
suggest that low-level shear is not as dominant a factor as some numerical
simulations have suggested, the lack of a detailed observational baseline
describing derecho environments has hindered the comparison of these ideas to
observations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address these issues three main
objectives have been defined: 1) collect and analyze a large set of proximity
soundings from derechos and determine the distribution of wind shear and other
parameters associated with these events; 2) produce a set of idealized numerical
simulations to examine the sensitivity of line-oriented convection to the range
of environments identified in the observational portion of this project; 3)
examine the forces responsible for maintaining the strong updrafts and the
strong near-surface winds within the numerical modeling experiments.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will produce a detailed classification of the
observed wind and thermodynamics profiles in derecho environments and will
increase our knowledge of the physical mechanisms responsible for the
development and maintenance of the line-oriented convection and the strong
surface winds within these types of weather systems. Results potentially will
lead to better forecasts of these destructive wind storms.
