The study of the location of firms has been influenced recently by new
developments in two different fields. In spatial economics, Hotelling-type
spatial competition models have been developed to describe how firms determine
the price and location of sites through multistage games in which they do not
cooperate with one another. The parallel development of discrete-choice models
has shed new light on the ways in which consumer and firm behavior are based on
the concept of random utility. This research project will synthesize insights
from these two theoretical traditions and will develop a new discrete-choice
model of firm location. The model will be developed by systematically examining
the impacts of a number of factors on probabilistic preference models of firm
locational behavior. Inclusion of these factors will enable the model to more
realistically reflect the actual conditions under which firms operate. The final
stage of analysis will consist of development of a simulation program that would
enable users to readily examine the impacts of different conditions on the
locational behavior of firms. This research will bring together two significant
lines of inquiry in the theoretical examination of the geographic behavior of
economic units and will enhance our understanding of the processes and criteria
that lead firms to locate in some places and not in others. This work will also
provide an improved basis by which the actual behavior of firms may be
empirically analyzed.
