Thin film passive waveguide are key elements of integrated optical circuits. If
the benefits of optical fiber communication are to widely available, thin film
waveguides must be manufactured rapidly, reliably and cheaply. This cannot be
done now. In Phase I we used our proprietary, environmentally sound Jet Vapor
Deposition (JVD) process to make an unusual starting material: a ceramic host
film doped with an organic dye guest; this was then photo- patterned, producing
a working thin film waveguide. JVD followed by photo-patterning has the
potential for high throughput, inexpensive production. JVD ceramic-organic host-
guest films, produced at high rate, in unlimited variety, and at room
temperature, have excellent optical, chemical and mechanical properties for
integrated optics. Accordingly, the JVD + photo-patterning strategy can i)
provide a new class of materials useful for integrated optics and compatible
with electronic ICs and ii) open the way to high volume manufacture of
integrated optic circuits. In Phase II we will investigate the optical
properties of JVD dye- doped ceramic films, fabricate devices from them, e.g.,
directional couplers and filters, demonstrate JVD linking of an optical fiber to
a thin film waveguide, and implement laser photo-patterning . Our Phase II
research will provide both fundamental advances in photonic materials and new
approaches to integrated optics manufacturing. **
