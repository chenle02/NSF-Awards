9415505 Leventhal This three-year award will support student participation in
U.S.- Italy cooperative research in chaos in atomic systems between Jacob
Leventhal of the University of Missouri - Saint Louis, and Professors Maria
Allegrini and Ennio Arimondo at the University of Pisa, Italy. The focus of the
research will be on examining the responses of specially prepared atoms, Rydberg
atoms, to alternating electric fields from the perspective of modern conceptions
of transitions of physical systems from ordered to chaotic motion. The U.S. side
of the collaboration brings expertise in experimental methods focusing on
exploitation of the unique properties of Rydberg atoms in a variety of
applications. This is complemented by the Italian collaborators' studies of
transitions to chaotic behavior and their expertise in experimental atomic
physics. They have worked with infrared lasers, and have designed the line
selectable carbon dioxide laser crucial to the method of these experiments. ***
