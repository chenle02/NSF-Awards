9453666 Richardson The Baltimore Urban Systemic Initiative (BUSI) has as its
core a vision that seeks to provide the mathematics and science fundamentals
which will permit all students to participate fully in a technological society
and enable a significantly greater number of Baltimore students to pursue
careers in mathematics, science, engineering, and technology. The BUSI features
five major components: (1) a new standards-based, K-12 science, mathematics and
technology (SMT) curriculum which includes increased science and mathematics
content and hands on, student-centered pedagogy; (2) extensive professional
development for teachers to support the new curriculum; (3) a variety of
academic enrichment and support services offered directly to students and
teachers; (4) policy changes that "enable" systemic change; and (5) the use of
the "Efficacy Model" to alter the belief systems of students and school
personnel as to the ability of all students to perform at a high level and
succeed in obtaining a quality SMT education. The Initiative will be implemented
in partnership with Morgan State University (MSU). Professional development for
teachers will be offered through MSU and other local universities and informal
science organizations. MSU's successful Comprehensive Regional Center for
Minorities will be an integral component of the BUSI plan, with particular
responsibility for providing student enrichment activities.
