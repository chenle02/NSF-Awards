This award provides partial support for US-based participants in the
international conference “Algebraic and topological interplay of algebraic
varieties” to be held at the Jaca campus of the University of Zaragoza (Spain),
during the period June 12-17, 2023. The event will bring together early-career
and senior researchers as well as students. Along with research presentations
intended to disseminate recent developments, it will also include introductory
lectures in the form of mini-courses at a level accessible to graduate students.
There will also be discussion and poster sessions, to better strengthen
connections among the various research groups represented and to provide
accessibility for early-career researchers and graduate students. Furthermore,
videos of lectures, provided by the conference site, and a conference
proceedings volume of refereed articles by lecturers and participants will aid
in bringing the results of the conference to a large audience.

The scientific focus of the conference is on the topological study of complex
algebraic and analytic varieties. The program includes the following main
topics, each driven by recent and fundamental advances: (1) Topology of
singularities and related fields; (2) Lipschitz geometry of singularities; (3)
Monodromy groups, Mapping class groups; and (4) Zeta functions and the monodromy
conjecture. The proposed topics intersect a broad range of research endeavors in
fields ranging from pure mathematics to more applied areas, thus conference
participants will reflect a broad cross-section of mathematical disciplines. In
recent decades, the basic tools involved in the study of singularities have
branched out into a myriad of mathematical territories, and it increasingly
becomes important to provide an opportunity such as this conference for experts,
as well as beginners, in the various related specializations to interact. For
