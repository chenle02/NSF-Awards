Mathematical REU site at the University of Tennessee Selected Topics in Pure and
Applied Math Abstract This proposal is for a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates program for eight weeks in the summers of 1997-1999 at the
University of Tennessee. Ten undergraduate mathematics majors will work on
research projects with faculty members and will participate in two short courses
and one seminar. Two of the ten students will work with researchers from Oak
Ridge National Laboratory.
