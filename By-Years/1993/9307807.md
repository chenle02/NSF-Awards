This US-Hungary Joint Fund research project on "Photon Driven Processes at
Adsorbate Metal Interfaces" will be conducted by Dr. Frigyes Solymosi at the
University of Szeged and Dr. John M. White, University of Texas at Austin. The
researchers will investigate photo-induced reactions including oxidation of
alkyl radicals and activation of unsaturated hydrocarbons. Their experiments
will be carried out under ultra-high vacuum conditions at low temperature, where
the thermal effects can be minimized. Adsorbed species will be characterized,
before and after irradiation, by a number of surface sensitive techniques. The
researchers will also characterize supported noble metals which play important
roles in many catalytic processes. This research in chemistry fulfills the US-
Hungary Joint Fund's objective of advancing science by enabling leading experts
in the United States and Hungary to combine complementary talents and pool
research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
