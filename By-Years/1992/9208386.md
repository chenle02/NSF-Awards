Theoretical research in elementary particle physics and astrophysics will focus
on such problems as the role of quarks with unusual properties in the behavior
of matter and the effects of intense astrophysical magnetic fields on the
spectroscopy of the strongly-interacting elementary particles. Quarks with
unusual properties are always a possibility, so it is important to know what
effects they would have. Intense magnetic fields may be associated with certain
astrophysical phenomena, and their effects on elementary particle spectroscopy
may help us to detect them.
