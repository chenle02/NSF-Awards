This effort by the Center for Policy Research of the National Governors
Association (NGA) will provide technical assistance to states seeking to
implement the recommendations contained in the NGA studies, Increasing the
Supply of Women and Minority Engineers: An Agenda for State Action.
Specifically, NGA will select five states to receive small matching grants to be
used in implementing one or more of the recommendations in the report. NGA will
provide technical assistance and support to these states, monitor their
progress, and disseminate information on policies and programs they implement.
The project will be completed over an 18 month period.
