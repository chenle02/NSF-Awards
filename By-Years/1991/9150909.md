The project develops a novel one semester non-calculus based physics survey
course "The Early Universe", designed to expose students, particularly first-
year Barnard women contemplating a possible major in the natural sciences or
mathematics, to the most exciting developments in 20th century physics. This
course represents an effort by the Barnard physics department to secure the
pipeline against potential losses of talented women physicists. The essential
subject matter is physics of the early universe, with the bulk of the course
spent on cosmological and modern theories of elementary particles. The final
third of the course concentrates on Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity. No
knowledge of calculus is necessary nor any previous study in physics, only a
willingness to employ algebra, geometry and trigonometry to assist one's
critical thinking about subtle scientific questions. The laboratory component of
the course is devoted to measuring the fundamental constants of Nature,
including the speed of light, Newton's gravitational constant, the mass and
charge of the electron, and Planck's constant.NSF funds for personnel support,
in the form of stipends for advanced Barnard undergraduates assisting in the
course development during summer 1991 and equipment support, in the form of a
small-scale computer physics lab of Mathematica-equipped Macintosh computers,
permit a much expanded computational component to the Early Universe course that
manifests itself in innovative laboratory, homework, and learning assignments.
NSF funds for equipment are matched with funds from non-federal sources.
