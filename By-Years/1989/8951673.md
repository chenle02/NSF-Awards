Electronic materials (including thin film metallization, semiconductors, and
high temperature superconductors) will continue to play a dominant role in our
nation's technological development for the foreseeable future. Dartmouth
graduates have played leading roles in these developments in the past. These
improvements will ensure our students have the superior training needed to
continue to command leadership positions. Measurement of electronic materials
will be enhanced first by purchase of an ellipso-meter to characterize thin
films fabricated in the materials laboratories. Second, existing capacitance-
voltage measurement capability will be upgraded to a cost-effective, state-of-
the-art system. Third, development of a new course in optical properties of
materials will be enhanced by construction of a photon measurement system with
high sensitivity and spectrographic capability. Finally, teaching of the
electronic and mechanical properties of materials will be improved by a pilot
enhancement to our existing workstation-based computer laboratory, Project
NORTHSTAR. A Silicon Graphics workstation will be used to develop pilot software
to display the energy band structure or mechanical stress properties of a
material, based on a user-supplied solid-state crystal structure and user-
selected physical models.
