This research examines victims' assessments of procedural justice at the
International Criminal Court (ICC). Created by the Rome Treaty in 1998, the ICC
has been hailed as a new type of international court, one that promotes
restorative justice for victims as well as accountability for grave
international crimes. One of its innovations is to provide expansive procedural
rights to victims, including the right for victims to present their concerns at
different stages of the proceedings, subject to the discretion of judges. Yet no
studies have examined how victims view their participation.

Drawing on in-depth interviews with more than 600 victims in Uganda, Democratic
Republic of Congo, Kenya, and Cote d?Ivoire, we assess whether or not
respondents 1) feel they havea voice in ICC proceedings; 2) view the ICC as a
neutral arbitrator; 3) feel respected by Court staff; 4) trust the ICC; and 5)
feel safe being associated with the Court. The study contributes to a growing
literature on the importance of procedural justice for the legitimacy of
judicial institutions, and provides important insights into victims' subjective
assessments of the effectiveness of international criminal interventions after
mass violence. By documenting for the first time the lived experiences of
victims participating in ICC trials, the study provides insight into the social-
psychological dynamics of victim participation and strengthens the functioning
of international criminal justice.
