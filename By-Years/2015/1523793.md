This action funds an NSF National Plant Genome Initiative Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Biology for FY 2015. The fellowship supports a research and
training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to
broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan
for this fellowship to Michael S. Campbell is "Of Rice and Men: Graph-Based
Tools and Resources for Advancing Genome Assisted Crop Improvement " The host
institutions for the fellowship are Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories and EMBL-EBI
and the sponsoring scientists are Dr. Doreen Ware and Dr. Paul Kersey.

Humans have been domesticating crop plants to increase yield and productivity
ever since agriculture began over 10,000 years ago. Genome sequencing in the
last decade now provides unprecedented resources for mining crops for new traits
and for advancing breeding methods. These DNA sequences can now be used to guide
the future of plant breeding through a process called genome assisted crop
improvement. Central to genome assisted crop improvement is the use of a single
consensus, or 'reference' DNA sequence to represent the genome of an entire
species. Unfortunately, these reference sequences do not capture sequence
variation characteristic of every population. Breeding is therefore hampered
without full access to the diversity of gene variants. Recently, the human
genomics community has begun to experiment with a promising solution to this
problem called a 'Variant Graph', wherein a graph structure is used to represent
sequence variation that is lost with the reference-genome approach. In this
project, Variant Graphs will be developed for rice as a model crop plant, will
help to identify new trait variants and will ultimately be applicable to any
crop species. The outcomes will provide essential information to plant breeders
and therefore significantly impact the speed and performance of crop improvement
efforts, helping to ensure a secure and constant food supply.

This project will develop methods for, and explore the utility of, a Variant
Graph approach to create a pan-genome reference and structural annotation
resource for rice, starting with the genomes of three diverse rice strains and
then expanding to 3,000. The bioinformatics and statistically based approach to
genome representation and annotation will give a population level view of the
variant material available to plant breeders and will provide a clear picture of
the genome of each individual accession. The research efforts are directed
towards rice genomes, but the tools and techniques developed are relevant to all
agricultural plants and animals. The infrastructure to replicate this resource
for other agricultural plants will be established and made available through the
iPlant Collaborative (iplantcollaborative.org). The rice resources will be
publicly available through the Gramene website (gramene.org).
