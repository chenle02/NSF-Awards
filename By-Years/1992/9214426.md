The Center for Biological Timing consists of 20 laboratories, 17 of which are
at the University of Virginia. This award will renovate laboratory space for
five center investigators as well as core facility research and research
training space for all investigators. The renovated laboratory space will be
located in the Department of Biology and in the multistory building of the
Health Science Center. The total amount of renovated space is approximately
12,000 gross square feet and will be used for the latest molecular bio-
technology applied to biological timing. The improvement of the laboratory space
will greatly enhance the research productivity and research training
opportunities in the Center laboratories.
