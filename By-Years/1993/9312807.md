9312807 Basar This proposal aims at developing a comprehensive time-domain based
theory for the analysis and synthesis of performance-robust minimax controllers
for linear and nonlinear systems subject to deterministic and/or partially
stochastic disturbances. Performance-robustness is a property that is imposed on
top of minimaxity, which requires the selected controller to be least sensitive
to modeling inaccuracies due to neglected fast dynamics and/or weak coupling of
subsystems. Emphasis in this research program will be placed on nonlinear
models, nonquadratic performance indices, decentralized measurement schemes, and
multiple objectives. The general approach to be adopted is that of dynamic or
differential game theory, which provides the most natural setting for these
worst-case design problems. Research efforts along the lines described in the
proposal should lead to major advances in the methodology and design of
performance-robust worst-case controllers for various types of systems, as well
as to some new fundamental results in the theory of dynamic games. They should
also contribute toward making the theory and the emerging design tools more
accessible to undergraduate and first-year graduate students in an engineering
curriculum. ***
