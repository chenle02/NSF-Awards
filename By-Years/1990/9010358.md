The performance of sequential computers in its rapidly expanding fields of image
processing and vision has been found to be inadequate since most applications
require processing of the image frames in real time. With the rapid growth in
VLSI technology and advances made in parallel processing, the obvious solution
is to design parallel algorithms and architectures that can be implemented using
VLSI and WSI technology. The focus of this research is on the design and testing
of VLSI architectures and chips for a set of very important image processing and
vision problems. The problems being investigated are: 1) scale space
computation; 2) edge and corner detection; 3) connected component labeling; 4)
dynamic scene analysis and 5) image compression.
