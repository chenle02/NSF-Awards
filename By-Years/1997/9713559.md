This research will pursue developments in the boundary element method (BEM) for
the analysis of stress and fracture mechanics problems dealing with anisotropic
rock masses, including efficient techniques to model the role played by material
anisotropy, rock fabric, and rock layering (heterogeneity) in rock engineering
problems. Focus will be on 2-D and 3-D elastostatic problems where the medium is
either a continuum, a continuum with one or several interfaces, or a continuum
with potentially propagating discrete cracks. While the development will be
generally applicable to any kind of body forces for which particular solutions
can be derived, concentration will be on the body force of gravity. For fracture
problems, focus will be on the 2-D problem, and laboratory tests on natural and
artificial rocks will also be conducted to determine experimentally the stress
field and crack growth path in anisotropic and layered systems. This research
will provide new methods of engineering analysis that are currently lacking,
providing a state-of-the-art methodology that can be easily implemented into
computer codes and readily used by a wide range of engineers, designers, and
researchers. Completion of this project will greatly enhance the range of
applications of the BEM to rock mechanics and fracture problems involving
anisotropic and layered systems including fault mechanics and earthquake-induced
displacement and stresses, hydraulic fracturing, hydraulic jacking, borehole
breakout, and in-situ stress determination, rock cutting and drilling, and the
design and stability of underground excavation and rock slopes.
