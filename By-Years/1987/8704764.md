The rapidly growing interest in multiprocessors for concurrent, or parallel,
computation has created a need for the training of graduate student of computer
science and postdoctoral researchers in this field. There is also a need to
interest outstanding undergraduate students in this emerging field. The field is
so new, and developing so rapidly that many programs in computer science do not
cover it adequately. The proposed workshop addresses this need. The two-week
program of the Workshop will give participants an opportunity to learn about
parallel computation from lectures offered by a number of experts in the field
and workshop sessions in which they will use several different kinds of
commercially available multiprocessors. The proposal has been submitted to help
train and familiarize the research community involved in computational science
with the important nuances of parallel processing. Parallel processing is
recognized as a rapidly growing field of computational science which promise
large increases in computational speed and computer power. This workshop will
introduce and train scientists on programming techniques and difference in
machine architectures of various problem-solving opportunities.
