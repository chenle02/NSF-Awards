Arctic and Antarctic sea ice exhibit some important differences. Almost all
Antarctic sea-ice is seasonal, disappearing in summer. Antarctic sea-ice is
usually thinner, more broken, rougher and more easily moved by the wind and
waves than the multiyear Arctic pack. Arctic ice extent has been notably rapidly
depleting over recent years, while Antarctic ice has been, if anything,
expanding. Snow plays an important role but poorly documented role in Antarctic
sea ice mass balance, sea ice surface properties and sea ice ecosystem dynamics.
Precipitation over the Southern Ocean is predicted to increase as a consequence
of atmospheric warming, but the role such a precipitation increase might play in
sea ice mass balance is unclear. Recent work suggests that patterns of snow
distribution on sea ice owes more to wind transport and re-deposition of snow
than to precipitation. Also more than half of all snowfall may be lost to open
leads. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A combination of field measurements made from
aboard two international Antarctic research cruises will set out with a number
of questions in mind:&lt;br/&gt;1) What are the spatial relationships between
snow depth distribution and ice surface morphology?&lt;br/&gt;2) Can a
statistical description of the snow depth distribution be developed as a
function of ice type or morphology?&lt;br/&gt;3) What factors control the mass
flux of blowing snow?&lt;br/&gt;4) How does surface roughness and topography
control blowing snow transport and deposition into deformed ice and
leads?&lt;br/&gt;5) Can snow accumulation and distribution on sea ice be
quantified as a function of precipitation and ice conditions?&lt;br/&gt;These
questions are central to informing our knowledge of Antarctic sea-ice properties
and their representation in climate models is of wide interest.
