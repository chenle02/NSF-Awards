Research diving over the last two decades has yielded important insights into
the ecological importance of giant (&gt;1 mm) Foraminifera in McMurdo Sound,
Antarctica. Unfortunately, due to logistics constraints the in-situ behavior of
these single-celled organisms and their interactions within the food web can be
observed only in 'snapshots' during summer dives, when algal production is at a
maximum in conditions of 24-hour light. Much would be learned by observing
Foraminifera over extended periods of time, to study mobility, response to food
availability, and other directed behaviors. It would be very valuable to be able
to extend observations to the winter months, in order to study these organisms
under dark conditions with no algal production, and to experimentally manipulate
in situ conditions and observe the behavioral response. Research diving requires
costly support and cannot provide extended observation of individual organisms.
Currently, logistical requirements, costs, complexities, and risks of winter
diving at remote locations in Antarctica are prohibitive. However, manned diving
is not required in order to make long-term in-situ observations. Technology and
communications have advanced to the point where it is feasible and practical to
install video macro- and micro-view cameras in a submersible enclosure,
transmitting both live and sequential time-lapse images over the Internet to a
remote user throughout the year. Such an instrumentation platform could then be
used for experimental manipulation of the environment. The objective of this
proposal is to develop a submersible, remotely-operable underwater observatory
for the study of Foraminifera and associated benthic fauna. This observatory
would be connected to a shoreline unit by fiber-optic cable and linked by radio
to the Internet for year-round access. The design and operation of this
observatory will function as a technology template to meet other year-round
Antarctic research requirements by means of telescience rather than personnel
deployment.
