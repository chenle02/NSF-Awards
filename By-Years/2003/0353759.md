The REU Site at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC) offers an
unparalleled opportunity to bring together undergraduate students with
internationally acclaimed scientists to explore important ecological questions.
Increasing knowledge of the biological and physical processes that sustain life
on earth is the overall mission of the SERC, a 1,300 ha facility of the
Smithsonian Institution located on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay.
Educating future generations of scientists is one of SERC's primary objectives,
and since 1971 our highly successful undergraduate internship program has
accomplished this task. The REU program provides financial support for 10 summer
interns and 5 part-time academic year interns. Interns accepted into the REU
program will select a mentor and spend four days in that laboratory, and one day
a week during their first three weeks rotating through other terrestrial or
aquatic laboratories. After settling into an independent research project,
interns will be immersed continually in scientific culture and a cohesive
curriculum. They will take a series of short courses and will participate in
graduate-level discussion groups. They also will attend SERC's weekly and
evening seminar series and take field trips to affiliated research institutions.
At the end of their internship, interested and motivated students will be
encouraged to continue their research through the academic year and accompany
their SERC mentors to a national scientific meeting to present their research
findings. Details about the program can be found at

our fellowship coordinator, Ms. Kimberly Sproat (443-482-2217 or
sproatk@si.edu).
