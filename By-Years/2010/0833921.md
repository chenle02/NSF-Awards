This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will focus on further
development of a model of upper atmospheric phenomena known as Blue Jets, Blue
Starters, and Gigantic Blue Jets. Blue Jets are narrow cones of blue light that
propagate upward from the top of a thundercloud and were discovered during an
aircraft campaign. Also discovered during the campaigns were short-lived upward
jets which propagate only a few km and terminate below 26 km, dubbed blue
starters (BS), as well as gigantic blue jets (GBJ) which propagate into the
mesosphere and lower ionosphere. In addition, intense flashes in the spectral
range 300-400 nm were detected by an ultra-violet (UV) sensor on board the
Russian student microsatellite 'Tatiana'. Their duration and radiated energy are
in the same range as those generated by blue jets. These flashes, like the GBJ,
were located over oceans and shores where the rate of lightning flashes is low,
which suggests that the ultraviolet flashes may be associated with the GBJ.
Despite substantial progress in the theoretical understanding of this complex
phenomenon, significant puzzles remain. This project will develop a model based
on first principles, unlike existing models which include some arbitrary
parameters. The model will be developed by using a combined analytical and
computational approach. The predictions of the model will be validated by the
optical, UV, and ELF (Extremely Low Frequency) data obtained by the ground based
and satellite-borne detectors. Understanding the physics of these features could
provide elucidation of a mechanism for direct transient coupling between the
ionosphere and stratosphere with implication to the global electric circuit. The
broader impact of the activity includes application of the model to laboratory
experiments of streamer and leader breakdown, which in turn are important for
material processing. This program will support the education and training at
graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Maryland; it also
involves a broad international collaboration with scientists from Russia and
Taiwan.
