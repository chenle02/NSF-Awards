This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) will assist the
Department of Chemistry at University of Utah to acquire a tandem mass
spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
including the following: (1) RNA-binding polyamides via encoded combinatorial
synthesis, (2) phosphorus-containing molecules based on 2'-deoxynucleosides, (3)
analysis of RNA-binding proteins and peptides, (4) DNA mismatch recognition and
repair by metalloenzyme MutY, and oxidative alkylation and degradation of
guanine in DNA and RNA structures. Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to
probe intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a
vast array of organic, bioorganic, and organometallic molecules. The addition of
the technique of electrospray extends the range of MS to proteins and nucleic
acid molecular weights far beyond any other technique. The use of electrospray
ionization in combination with high resolution provides the latest techniques
available in mass spectrometry. It affords the chemist one of the most powerful
tools available for the characterization of compounds. The acquisition of this
capability in mass spectrometry is essential for the prosecution of frontier
research in many fields of chemistry.
