The proposed research on the influence of leaf surface wetness on
photosynthetic CO2 exchange and transpirational water loss will provide a
ground-breaking study of a widespread phenomenon in nature. Because a water-film
will curtail CO2 uptake dramatically, terrestrial plants must repel water from
leaf surfaces. This is despite the frequent occurrence of natural leaf wetting
events such as rain, dewfall, ground fog, cloudmist and spray deposition.
Preliminary evidence suggests that leaves of numerous species have evolved
extreme water- repelling characteristics to prevent stomatal pores from being
covered with a water film. This water-repelling capability appears to have co-
evolved with structural and orientation features that interact to strongly
influence water retention. In some cases, a high water repellency in the form of
water bead formation coincides with a high retention. This combination may
result in water use efficiencies much higher than previously reported, as will
as enhanced CO2 uptake due to higher humidity and, thus, greater stomatal
opening. The above results for native plant species may also have substantial
applied significance for production in agricultural species. For example, the
common practice of spray irrigation during midday to prevent stomatal closure
may only be effective for species with non-wettable leaf surfaces. The specific
effects of spray-type irrigation on CO2 uptake and yields has not been
investigated for crop species. A more fundamental understanding of leaf wetness
effects on CO2 exchange in native plants, and corresponding adaptations could
lead to a more strategic system of matching irrigation systems to species-
specific traits for leaf water-repellency, or artificial selection for certain
leaf traits that could enhance water use efficiency as well as carbon gain. **//
