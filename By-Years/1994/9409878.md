9409878 Li This Research Equipment Grant will make it possible for the
Department of Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering in the College of
Engineering and Applied Sciences at Western Michigan University to develop an
in-plane strain measurement shear strain and two normal strains over small gage
lengths at stress concentrations of the surfaces of notched specimens subjected
to both axial and torsional loadings. This new strain measuring system will
extend current strain measurement techniques to allow measurement of three
stains at surfaces. Such a system is highly desirable in order to develop a
valuable multi-purpose stain measuring technique that will lead to improved
mechanical testing capabilities. ***
