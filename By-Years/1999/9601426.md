9601426 Wiescher This proposal requests NSF support, to partially cover costs
for student support for the fourth international symposium on "Nuclei in the
Cosmos" to be held at the University of Notre Dame on June 20-27, 1996. This
symposium continues the tradition of the meetings held previously at Baden bei
Wien, Austria (1990), Karlsruhe, Germany (1992), and Assergi at the Gran Sasso,
Italy (1994). The 1996 meeting will be the first in the United States. This
symposium is widely recognized as the main forum for experimentalists,
theorists, and observers to evaluate the current status as well as the future
directions in the field of Nuclear Astrophysics. ***
