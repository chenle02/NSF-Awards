This award provides partial support for the participation of graduate students
and postdocs in the upcoming topical conference, "Opportunities in Biology for
Physicists, II", sponsored by the American Physical Society in San Diego from
January 30 to February 1, 2004. The conference is aimed predominantly at
graduate students and postdocs in physics who are considering applying the
methods of physics to biological topics. Physicists and biologists who are
leaders in their fields will be asked to give broad overviews of five broad
areas at the interface between physics and biology. In addition, there will be a
panel of young researchers who will discuss their careers and in particular how
they moved their research field from physics to the biology/physics interface.
Funds for the support are provided by the Divisions of Physics and Materials
Research in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and by the
Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Biosciences Directorate.
