A mechanism for the detailed atmospheric oxidation pathways of alkanes will be
developed based on kinetic and mechanistic data determined from carefully
designed laboratory chamber studies. Estimates of partitioning of product
species between the gas and condensed phases will be made using an existing
numerical module. The numerical predictions will be compared with the chamber
studies to test parameters that must necessarily be estimated in the numerical
modeling exercises. Once a satisfactory numerical mechanism has been developed,
appropriate simplifications will be made to allow it to be implemented within a
three-dimensional modeling framework. The latter will be applied to a number of
real world situations including the South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) in southern
California, New England, the San Joaquin Valley, and St. Louis. A particular
aspect of these simulations will be the ability of the model to reproduce the
observed levels of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) generated. In each case a
number of simulations will be generated to evaluate the hydrocarbon lumping
schemes utilized, the impacts of alkane chemistry on SOA formation, and the
specific molecular species present in the aerosol phase. Sensitivity to
environmental variables such as temperature and humidity will also be examined.
It is envisioned that the numerical modeling product of this research can also
be used to help design future laboratory studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
work will lead to improved numerical representations of atmospheric chemical
processes which will eventually contribute to better predictions of the impacts
of chemical species on air quality. Through better mechanistic understanding of
atmospheric chemical processes, more reliable control strategies are possible.
Educational aspects of this project include research experiences for
undergraduate students and involvement of a female research scientist.
