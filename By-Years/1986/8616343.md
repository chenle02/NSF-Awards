This research, in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, consists of
two areas of focus, (1) steroid and terpene synthesis which mainly is concerned
in the application of biomimetic polyene cyclization methodology and (2)
asymmetric syntheses mediated by chiral templates. Dr. Johson's prior research
resulted in eleven technical publications. An interesting result was the
development of pyrethroid insecticides that were highly active against the
common housefly.
