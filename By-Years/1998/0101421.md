This project develops certificate and associate degree programs in computer
integrated manufacturing. It provides a seamless educational pathway from high
school through the two year associate degree on to a baccalaureate engineering
degree and career placement. It involves a regional partnership focused on
recruiting and training women and non-traditional students to meet the
technology workforce needs of the region. It builds on and adapts a site-based
learning approach employed in a prior ATE project implemented in the regional
high schools. The major activities include establishing computer integrated
manufacturing options in existing courses and curricula, integration of
technical experiences across the curriculum, establishing a center and lab to
simulate projects prior to the site-based learning experience, outreach and
recruitment, summer orientation and internships and a host of other support
services. A compendium of all instructional materials is to be made available to
others interested in developing similar programs in computer integrated
manufacturing.
