SRS 96-16497 Ailes The objective of this project is to conduct a cross-national
comparative study of the strategic planning process for science and technology
(S&T) and its outcomes in seven countries. Among the outcomes to be studied
would be the relative efficacy of strategic planning processes in each country
in incorporating S&T resources and outputs into its respective innovation
system. The project will result in a model, including proposed quantitative
indicators, that could be used to assess and monitor strategic planning for S&T
and S&T capabilities, not only in the seven selected countries, but in other
countries as well--including the United States. ***
