The objectives of this project are to model, simulate and experimentally verify
the proposed starting and position orientation algorithms for permanent magnet
synchronous motor variable speed drive without a position sensor. Doing away
with the position sensor makes the motor packaging compact, less expensive and
mechanically rugged and robust thus increasing its reliability of operation
under all circumstances. These advantages are critical in applications such as
robotic drives, aerospace actuators, machine tool spindle drives and electric
drives used in many defense applications. Position sensor- less permanent magnet
synchronous motor drives are ideal for use in appliance, automotive and hand-
tool industries because of their low cost. It is anticipated that the results of
this research would free the control of permanent magnet synchronous motor
variable speed drives from position information obtained from the position
sensors thus making the system open to large scale use in high performance
applications as well as cost sensitive low performance applications described
above.
