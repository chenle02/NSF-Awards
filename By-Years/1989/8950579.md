This grant supports the development of a digital signal processing laboratory.
The laboratory and the accompanying lecture course investigates the design of
digital filters and the wide range of applications for digital signal
processors. The equipment represents the basic scientific tools needed fora
digital signal processing laboratory. At the heart of each workstation is the
TMS 320C25 Texas Instruments' high speed digital signal processor chip. The
laboratory consists of six experiments and a special project which allows each
students to go into farther depth. The institution is providing matching funds
in an amount equal to or greater than the funds provided by the Foundation.
