This starter grant award to the University of Colorado at Boulder supports the
research of Professor Deborah S. Wuttke. The research focusses on the mechanism
by which unstructured polypeptides fold into protein structures. The technique
of time-resolved nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is employed for study
in real time of the pathways of folding and unfolding in ribonuclease A. Through
site-specifically, isotopically labeled residues in the N-terminal region of
ribonuclease A, the study takes advantage of the ability of 1D nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy to provide information on specific sites in a protein
during the course of folding and circumvents the difficulties of assignment and
resolution. Each species is well-resolved, allowing the chemical shift and
crosspeak lineshapes, as indicators of local structural environment and
dynamical properties, to be followed throughout the entire kinetic process. The
research is important in the fundamental understanding of protein folding and
the mechanism of formation of ribonuclease A, the protein that catalyzes the
cleavage of single-stranded ribonucleic acid in the course of life-sustaining
genetic processes.
