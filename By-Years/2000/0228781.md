0228781&lt;br/&gt;Aitken&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides support for a workshop to
discuss the desirability and feasibility of creating a broadly representative
and inclusive professional organization for the environmental engineering
profession. Specific objectives are to (1) build concensus towards broadly
recognizing the need for a professional society for environmental engineers that
is not based on restricted membership, (2) identify approaches to fulfilling
such a need and (3) begin working towards fulfilling such a need in a manner
that minimizes animosity and compteition, engages as diverse a cross-section of
the environmental engineering community as possible and best serves the needs of
society. The workshop will be held at the University of Toronto in August 2002
in conjunction with the joint conference on Education and Research in
Environmental Engineering and Science sponsored by the Association of
Environmental Engineering and Science Professors and the American Academy of
Environmental Engineers.
