The Centre de Recherches Mathematiques (CRM) will mount an intensive 13 months
program on "Probabilistic Methods in Mathematical Physics" during the period
June 1, 2008 - June 30, 2009. The program has been approved by the CRM
Scientific Advisory Panel to receive funding $484,000 CAD. A large number of
researchers and postdoctoral fellows will be in residence at CRM during this
period, and more will visit the program's 10 workshops. Two preparatory schools
relating to the themes of the workshops are planned, aimed at graduate students
and junior researchers. There will also be three Aisenstadt Chair lecture
series, coordinated with the workshops. The Aisenstadt Chair lecture series will
be given by Andrei Okounkov (Princeton), Wendelin Werner (Paris VI), and Craig
Tracy (UC Davis). This application seeks funding of $60,000 US from the NSF to
support participation of young American researchers in six out of ten workshops
of the program. The support will substantially increase the number of young
American researchers gaining access to and participating in this program. To
support young American researchers in the other four workshops, with a more
pronounced physics orientation, another grant application is being submitted to
the Program in Mathematical Physics of the Division of Physics. This program is
meant to represent the state of the art in a number of currently active areas of
research in mathematical physics, with special emphasis on those in which
probability theory plays a central role. Besides providing a vehicle for
communicating the most significant new research results in these domains, the
principal objectives include: 1) giving an opportunity for cross-fertilization
between the different domains represented, 2) stimulating new ideas through such
cross-fertilization and 3) providing an environment in which young researchers
may learn about and be encouraged to contribute to the exciting new developments
in these domains.
