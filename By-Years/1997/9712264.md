9712264 Shatz The PI plans to learn more about several models of inner ear
function. The aim of this research is to provide the PI with background in
current models of the electromotive effects in cochlear mechanics, including the
Traveling Wave amplifier (TWAmp) Dallos/Evans and finite element (FEM) models.
The TW Amp models the cochlear via two coupled transmission lines. This model
simulates a large range of experimental observations but needs a physiological
equivalent. The FEM model fails to represent the electrical properties of the
cochlear; if only models its mechanical properties. The Dallos/Evans theory
purposes a mechanism by which the outer hair cells, the main transducting
components of the inner ear, are stimulated via the organ of Corti. None of
these models individually serves as a comprehensive representation of human
cochlear function. The applicant therefore intends to study all three, with
longer term goals of using the TWAmp model to test the Dallos/Evans theory,
improving the FEM model to incorporate electrical mechanisms, and developing an
understanding of the physiological equivalent of the TWAmp. ***
