The Division of Chemistry supports Justin Sambur of Cornell University as an
American Competitiveness in Chemistry Fellow. Dr. Sambur will work on studying
the catalytic activity of single nanoparticles using a variety of microscopy
methods. The PI will collaborate with scientists at Argonne National Laboratory.
The ultimate goal of this research is to develop efficient, photoelectrolytic
cells for solar water splitting. For his plan for broadening participation, Dr.
Sambur will engage high-school students and teachers in solar energy research
using the SHArK (Solar Hydrogen Activity Research Kit) project.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research like that of Dr. Sambur is aimed at developing
improved photoelectrochemical cells for solar water splitting - to enable the
generation of chemical fuel from water and sunlight. The results of research
like this can help society come up with energy alternatives to fossil fuels. The
efforts at broadening participation being pursued by Dr. Sambur are aimed at
giving young scientists and the public exposure to the potential for positive
societal impact from the results of basic chemical research.
