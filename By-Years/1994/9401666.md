9401666 Tang This award is under the International Junior Investigator and
Postdoctoral Fellows Program, which enables U.S. scientists and engineers to
conduct three to twelve months of research abroad at research centers of proven
excellence. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and
the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
conditions abroad. This award will support a three months postdoctoral research
visit by Dr. Jinke Tang of the University of New Orleans to work with Dr. Qiang
Su of Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry in Changchun, Jilin, PRC. This
project involves the study of the magnetoresistance and related properties of a
nanocomposite material consisting of magnetic particles of oxide, y-Fe2O3,
dispersed in copper matrix. Also they will investigate the magnetotransport
properties of a nanocomposite in which magnetic nanoparticles of rare earth
metals are dispersed in copper matrix. ***
