The establishment of a new Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
(I/UCRC) at the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Arizona State
University focuses on Telecommunication Circuits and Systems for the advancement
of the next generation of telecommunication systems. The objective of the Center
is to establish a cooperative research center for Arizona State University
researchers and industry partners to work together on the advancement of
integrated circuits and systems for telecommunication by identifying new
technologies that will enable "system-on-a-chip" communication
devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The I/UCRC will comprise three major initiatives:
Research, Internship, and Curriculum development. Research initiatives will
provide consortium partners a complete spectrum of expertise in
Telecommunications, RF Design, Wireless and Wireline communications, optical
electronics, and analog/digital integrated circuits. The research roadmap of the
center will be conceived and executed by the Center industrial Partners and will
be monitored and evaluated by the Industrial Advisory Board.&lt;br/&gt;
