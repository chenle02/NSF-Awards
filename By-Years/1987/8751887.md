During the last several years the educational community and the general public
have become increasingly aware of the lack of geographic knowledge of students.
The World Regional Geography Concepts Project, a cooperative project involving
the Memphis City Schools System and Memphis State University is a response to
this situation. The focus during the first two years of a three-year program
will be on upgrading the geographic knowledge of secondary (year one) and
elementary (year two) teachers. Each year thirty teachers from the Memphis City
Schools System will receive an intensive (seven hours a day) six weeks (summer)
content course in geography, including map skills. Throughout this same time
period, these teachers will modify locally and commercially produced geography
materials and activities to coincide with the local geography curriculum. The
Memphis City Schools System has agreed to incorporate these supplementary
activities into the ongoing geography curriculum. During each academic year,
University personnel, school system curriculum supervisors, and summer teacher
participants, will conduct in-service training for geography teachers. The
activities will be field tested and evaluated in all geography courses. Based on
responses by the teachers, the materials will be modified as necessary. Year
three will consist of final evaluation and revision of both elementary and
secondary level materials as well as continued in-service and assistance from
University personnel, school system curriculum supervisors, and summer
participant teachers. The Memphis City Schools System and Memphis State
University have contributed an amount equal to 48% of the National Science
Foundation award.
