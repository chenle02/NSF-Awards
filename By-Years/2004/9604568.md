9604568 Chazin The Holliday junction (HJ) is a four-arm, four-strand DNA
crossover structure formed as a requisite intermediate for genetic recombination
and many repair processes in the cell. The structure and flexibility of these
DNA crossovers appears to be critical to their recognition and processing into
parental or recombinant products. The principle goals of this research program
are to determine the three-dimensional structure and dynamics of Holliday
junctions, to establish the influence of sequence, and ultimately, to understand
how the cellular recombination machinery distinguishes HJs of different
sequence. The Time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (tr-FRET) and
NMR spectroscopy will be used to the study of 32 base pair model HJs.
Computation and molecular graphics will be used to assist in interpretation and
analysis of results. The combination of NMR and fluorescence spectroscopies is
particularly powerful because these techniques yield information on different
distance and time regimes. NMR establishes the details of local geometry while
FRET is used to elucidate the overall spatial arrangement of the four helical
arms. The experimental methodologies and structural principles developed in the
course of these studies will be generally applicable to other nucleic acid
systems. Genetic recombination is a fundamental process of biology leading to
the variation and diversity that is essential to life. Most mechanisms propose
for recombination involve the four-arm branched DNA intermediate termed the
Holliday junction (HJ), which is cleaved by enzymes to generate either parental
or recombinant products. A significant body of evidence has accumulated
indicating that the structure of the HJ has a central role in determining the
outcome of the recombination event. The objective of this research is to
understand the molecular basis of genetic recombination from detailed knowledge
of the structure of the HJ, and ultimately, of the nature of the interactions
wit h enzymes critical to HJ recognition and processing.
