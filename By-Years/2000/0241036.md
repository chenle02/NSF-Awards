ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0241036&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nonlinear
interactions between jets and mesoscale eddies will be studied in order to
improve the conceptual understanding of the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence Zone. In
particular, the role of Agulhas eddies in causing the drift of the Confluence
Zone and also in the detachment of intrusion eddies will be examined. Analytical
and numerical techniques will be used in process-oriented studies. The research
will be guided and compared to observations, regional numerical models and with
laboratory experiments. This study will have important implications for our
understanding of interbasin exchanges of energy, heat and momentum and the
ocean's role in the meridional transport of heat. It therefore will aid our
understanding of the climate system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
