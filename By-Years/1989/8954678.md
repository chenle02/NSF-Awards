The purpose of the work is to create models of children's construction of the
rational numbers of arithmetic that are useful in scientific and educational
endeavors. In the context of working with children in logo microworlds in a
constructivist teaching experiment, the psychological goal of the investigators
is to create a model of children: construction of the operations that generate
the rational numbers of arithmetic, along with a scientific language that
specifies the mathematics of children in this contentual domain. The educational
goal is to elaborate components of possible learning environments for children
based on computer microworlds and to include (1) a specification of possible
learning periods along with the goals and intentions within these periods, (2)
the mathematical concepts and operations of the involved students within the
learning period and itineraries of construction, (3) problem situations that
served in the establishment and modification of learning environments by the
involved students within the learning periods, (4) critical decisions we made in
posing the problems to the students, and (5) examples of operating that carried
them to new and more powerful concepts. To facilitate this work, the principal
investigators will establish a working group on the rational numbers of
arithmetic and will conduct a scientific and an educational workshop.
