Dr. David VanVranken has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. VanVranken's doctoral degree was from Stanford University under
the supervision of Professor Barry Trost. Dr. VanVranken intends to continue his
research at the University of California at Berkeley under the sponsorship of
Professor Peter Schultz. The postdoctoral experience will train him in antibody
catalysis, protein modification via site-directed mutagenesis, and protein and
antibody structure and modification. Longer term, he plans to develop antibody
catalysts for the cleavage and transfer of phosphate esters. %%% The
Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important
infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new
PH.D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical
research and teaching.
