9414083 Bai This project develops a new and unified econometric theory for the
testing and estimation of multiple structural changes in a variety of
econometric models where changes in the parameters of the model occur at unknown
times. Recent developments in economic theory as well as in empirical
applications have shown the need for an econometric theory of multiple
structural changes. Although the case of a single structural change has received
considerable attention, research on the subject of multiple structural changes
is scant. The goal of this research is to develop on a coherent basis the
econometric theory of multiple structural changes by extending previous work of
the principle investigator in this area. This project answers a number of
questions pertaining to multiple structural changes. Among the issues addressed
are: 1) Determination of the changes of regimes (periods during which the
parameters of a model do not change) in a given data set; 2) Testing the
hypothesis of no structural shift versus that of multiple structural shifts,
And, more generally, testing k shifts versus k+l shifts; 3) Determination of
critical values and construction of standard reference tables; 4) Estimation of
models with multiple structural changes and determination of the criteria for
estimating the shift points; 5) Solving the computational problem for multiple-
shift estimation; and 6) Deriving the statistical properties of the resulting
estimators and the estimated shift points.
