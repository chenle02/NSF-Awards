9619644 Kamin The goal of this project is to promote technology transfer from
the functional programming community into the wider programming community, by
concentrating on special-purpose functional languages. The proposed work focuses
on the design and implementation of a functional language for ASCII file
processing, tentatively called FPERL. This addresses the goal in two mutually-
reinforcing ways. First, FPERL is to be a functional alternative to languages
like AWK and PERL; its development will shed light on this domain and will, it
is hoped, garner a user community of new functional programmers. Second, the
construction of the FPERL processor will be based on a unique class of special-
purpose languages: meta-programming languages (also called program generators).
The components of the processor - lexical analyzer, parser, de-sugarer, and so
on - will each be written in a functional meta-programming language specially
designed for that type of component. These meta-programming languages will be
developed as extensions to FPERL, resulting in an unusual boot- strapping
process. This research will produce new knowledge about a variety of special-
purpose language domains - file processing, parsing, and so on; about meta-
programming as a generally applicable programming methodology; and about the
design of languages to support meta-programming. ***
