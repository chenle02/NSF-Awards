Most efforts to enable concurrent engineering to date have focused on
developing the tools and techniques for designing completely new products.
Design in many industries is volutionary, consisting primarily of incremental
changes to existing products. This category of design is the target of direct
engineering, which is concerned with giving engineers direct access to complete
knowledge about the design and manufacture of a part as the part is being
designed. Direct engineering differs from concurrent engineering in that this
knowledge is not generated at design time, but is retrieved from an engineering
database which completely documents existing designs. The project focuses on
developing the key enabling component of direct engineering, the engineering
design component for a specific product, and an automobile crankshaft. During a
summer internship at a major automobile manufacturer, the principal investigator
will work with the co-investigator and other key personnel to identify the
critical crankshaft design variables and their relationships to functional
issues, manufacturing, prototyping, fixture design, tooling, dunnage, etc. After
completely documenting these relationships for the crankshaft, an appropriate
constraint-based product representation will be developed. The second stage of
the work will result in a prototype computer implementation of the product model
to illustrate the concept of direct engineering for automotive crankshafts.
