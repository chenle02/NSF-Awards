A critical part of doing science is communicating results to the general public
in an effective manner. However, scientists often do not have opportunities for
training in how to connect with the public and they are often unfamiliar with
the range of methods that they could use to reach them. The purpose of the
International Conference on Linguistics Communication is to bring together
language scientists, their students, and expert science communicators with two
core goals in mind: (1) To improve the public engagement skills of the
scientists and (2) To connect academic scientists with a network of
communication experts who have a proven interest in promoting language science.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference is held completely online to keep the event
cost-effective and to allow easy participation from scientists and communicators
from around the globe. The scientists come from every level of seniority, from
highly distinguished scholars to very junior students; moreover, they conduct
research on a wide variety of language related topics. The professional
communicators engage the public in many different ways, including writing
magazine articles, running podcasts, creating video content, and doing in-person
events at festivals and museums. The conference provides opportunities for the
scientists to learn key skills involved in communicating with the public in
different ways. It also provides networking opportunities to help scientists and
professional communicators work together. In general, the conference aims to
inspire scientists to value public communication, to encourage scientists to
forge ties beyond their usual academic environments, and to expand the ways that
language science results reach the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
