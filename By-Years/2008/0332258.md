The proposed research involves exploring novel connections between cosmology and
the new physics beyond the Standard Model. The PI plans to use the Cosmic
Microwave Background as a probe of the new physics near the scale of inflation
that could leave a small, but detectable, imprint in the CMB anisotropy. The PI
proposes a new explanation for the Type IA supernovae observations, which are
postulated to be fainter because of dynamical conversion of photons into axions,
without cosmic acceleration. The PI proposes that a new particle, the ultralight
axion might be another interpretation of recent data which would replace the
need for dark energy in the universe. The PI also proposes to investigate
whether the dynamics of extra dimensions can generate the primordial seed for
extra-galactic magnetic fields.
