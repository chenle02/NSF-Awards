This project will contribute to establish Hopf algebraic combinatorics as a
major component within the wider context of algebraic combinatorics, by
developing new results that unify and generalize important constructions in
combinatorics. The same Hopf algebras that are at the basis of these
constructions also have deep connections with other areas of mathematics and
physics such as the theory of operads, renormalization theory, and
representation theory. Thus, this project will also deal with abstract
constructions in the theory of associativity breaking and the corresponding
types of algebras, the investigation of the Hopf algebras of trees of quantum
electrodynamics, and the investigation of various objects closely related to the
algebra of symmetric functions, such as quasi-symmetric and non-commutative
symmetric functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combinatorial questions study various
ways of counting. In this proposal methods from algebra &lt;br/&gt;will be used
to about new insight into some of these counting questions. In addition the PI
will introduce graduate students to this area of research and make international
contacts and collaborations in Latin America and Europe. &lt;br/&gt;
