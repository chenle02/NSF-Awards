A Group of physicists consisting of three faculty, two research associates and
five graduate students is performing experiments to study the details of the
strong interactions among elementary particles. The program consists of three
major components: 1. Experiment E776 at the Brookhaven Alternating Gradient
Synchrotron. A large sample of about one billion events produced through the
interaction protons with protons and neutrons with protons is being studied. A
variety of important physics topics is being investigated in a detail never
before possible. 2. A new approach to massive computation and on-line data
acquisition. To achieve the sensitivity required, the group has developed and is
now implementing a hardware computational system that acts in consort with the
data acquisition. The system has achieved 41 gigaoperations per second (compared
to 1 giga=operation per second for a Cray X-MP) and data bandwidths of 32
gigabytes per second. This performance has been achieved at about 2% of the cost
of a Cray X-MP. 3. Experiment E609 at the Fermilab Tevatron. Much of the
apparatus from the Brookhaven experiment has been moved to Fermilab where the
program will continue at higher energy. The full power of the hardware will be
used to investigate rare phenomena.
