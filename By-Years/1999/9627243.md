The National Academy of Engineering has initiated a series of annual symposia
called "Frontiers of Engineering". The meetings are designed to bring together a
select group of the nation's best young engineers from industry, academe, and
government laboratories to discuss pioneering technical work and leading edge
research in various engineering fields and industry sectors. The goal of the
symposia is to introduce the nation's outstanding young engineers to each other,
and through this interaction facilitate collaboration in engineering and the
transfer of new techniques and approaches across fields. The First Annual
Symposium on Frontiers of Engineering was held September 12-23, 1995 at the
Academies' Beckman Center in Irvine, California, being sponsored jointly by the
National Science Foundation, the Department of Defense, the National Institute
of Standards and Technology, and the Engineering Foundation.
