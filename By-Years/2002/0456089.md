The Summer Undergraduate Mathematical Sciences Research Institute is designed to
address the shortage of minorities and women in mathematical sciences research.
The primary goal of the Institute is to provide approximately 15 nationally
selected students with an intensive research experience augmented by formal and
informal information sessions. SUMSRI is interested in, but not limited to,
African Americans and other underrepresented minorities and women. To accomplish
its goals, SUMSRI will run seven weeks on Miami University's campus in Oxford,
Ohio. During these seven weeks, students will participate in research seminars
in mathematics and statistics. The Institute will also include a technical
writing seminar, a GRE preparation workshop, two short courses on algebra and
real analysis, and colloquium talks given by well known mathematical scientists.
The combination of information, educational experiences and ongoing support is
designed to encourage these talented mathematics and statistics students to
continue and thrive in the mathematical research environment and thereby
eventually increase the number of African Americans and other underrepresented
minorities with doctoral degrees in the mathematical sciences.
