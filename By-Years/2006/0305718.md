This research addresses design technologies for Systems on Chips
and&lt;br/&gt;proposes a paradigm shift in their design, by focusing on a
communication-centric approach that accepts and tolerates electrical-level
errors within on-chip communication. The challenges of providing a fast,
reliable and energy-efficient communication means on chip are addressed by
designing SoCs as micro-networks of components and exploiting network technology
to satisfy quality of service requirements (e.g., reliability, performance and
energy bounds) under the limitation of unreliable signal transmission and non-
negligible communication delays on wires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In particular,
this research addresses the design of tools to support synthesis of control
protocols for micro-networks, with particular emphasis on encoding (for error
detection and correction), data packetization, switching and routing issues. The
merits of the proposed research relate to demonstrating how networking
techniques can solve on-chip communication problems, in view of the use of
advanced fabrication technologies with &lt;br/&gt;large spread of physical
parameters, unpredictable physical layouts and on-chip information
traffic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
