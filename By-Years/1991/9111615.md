This research will investigate the question of whether it is better to pay
attention to potentially unpleasant physical sensations or to try to distract
from them. Two basic questions will be investigated: (1) what are the possible
costs of avoidant strategies? and (2) what are the benefits of monitoring
strategies? This study has both theoretical and practical importance. Research
on somatic interpretation has implications for both basic psychological
processes such as attention, selfregulation and bio-psychological interactions,
and for clinical problems of medical care-seeking, compliance, and
rehabilitation.
