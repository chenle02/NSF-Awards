The oceanographic instrumentation program supports requests to acquire
instrumentation for the collection, processing and analysis of oceanographic
data. Support for instrumentation acquisition requests is predicated on share-
use by many NSF- funded researchers. This proposal from the Duke University
Marine Laboratory requests funding for equipment that will be used to support
NSF-funded research cruises aboard the R/V CAPE HATTERAS, a 135 foot vessel that
is owned by NSF and operated by the University.
