9402315 Somerville The powdery mildew disease of barley, caused by the obligate
fungal pathogen Erysiphe graminis f. sp. hordei, offers several advantages for
the study of host genes mediating resistance. This disease has been studied
intensively for more that 50 years; thus, there is an extensive base of
physiological data and genetic materials available that is unmatched by most
other host/pathogen systems. The barley Ml-a locus is of particular interest in
that more that 30 resistance alleles have been identified at this locus. By
screening 118,000 M2 seedlings, I have isolated 41 partially or fully
susceptible mutants. Complementation analysis of these new alleles will be used
to determine the genetic structure of the Ml-a locus, which may represent either
a complex locus or cluster of tightly linked genes. Also, the mutants will be
exploited in subtractive hybridization experiments to isolated Ml-a cDNA clones.
No such disease resistance gene has been cloned form any plant. %%% Analysis of
the Ml-a clones will provide information about the nature of the allelic
variation at the Ml-a locus and about the biochemical role of the Ml-a gene
product in mediating disease resistance. ***
