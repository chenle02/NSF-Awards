Metcalf This proposal is for continuation of research in laser cooling and
trapping with extension to the use of Stark spectra to provide a link between
laboratory electric fields and atomic constants. The laser cooling work attempts
to provide a unified picture of the various cooling mechanism based on Raman
resonances. The picture would be applicable in the limit where atomic motion is
no longer classical but must be described quantum mechanically. Monte-Carlo wave
function simulations are being developed to arrive at a complete quantum theory
of laser cooling whose physical picture is intuitively satisfying. A second
major area of research is directed to providing a direct high-accuracy link
between laboratory electric fields and atomic constants using interference
narrowing of Stark spectra. ***
