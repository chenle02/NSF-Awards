9312438 Edil Technical Narrative: This U.S.-Turkey collaborative research
project involving civil engineers from the University of Wisconsin at Madison
and Yildez University in Istanbul, Turkey will address a fundamental
infrastructural problem, that is, prediction and mitigation of excessive
settlement resulting from construction and rehabilitation of earth structures
founded on soft ground. Long-term field settlement data are very and difficult
to collect and consequently are very scarce. Such data have been collected in
connection with the construction of Alibey Dam in Turkey since 1969. The
objective of this project is to use the Alibey Dam data in analyzing long-term
settlement of soft ground. Project funding will enable Dr. K. Ozaydin and Mr. S.
Ozcoban of Yildiz University to work with Dr. T. Edil at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison. Additionally, Dr. Edil will visit Dr. Ozaydin's laboratory
and work with his team at the dam site. Successful completion of this effort is
expected to verify the validity of certain new concepts of soft ground
compression and contribute to the world literature on the subject. This project
in civil engineering fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Turkey to combine
complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence. ***
