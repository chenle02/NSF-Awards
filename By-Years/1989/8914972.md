This proposal, submitted to the National Science Foundation Directorate for
Computer Information and Science Engineering, involves the development and
execution of a workshop for very large scale integrated (VLSI)circuit design.
The focus of the workshop is directed towards minority academic institutions-
namely HBCU's -obtaining the skills necessary to teach and conduct research in
VLSI CAD areas at the advanced undergraduate and graduate levels. North Carolina
A&amp;T State University will serve as the HUB school, where they can assist
other HBCU institutions towards implementing a course and research activities.
The targeted outreach schools are: Southern University, Tuskegee University,
Tennessee State University, Howard University, Hampton University and Prairie
View University. Selected faculty members from the departments of electrical
engineering and/or computer science will attend a one week workshop where the
fundamentals of Mead and Conway VLSI design methodology will be presented. The
workshop will include: i) an overview of VLSI CAD methodology, ii) principles of
MOS transistor technology, ii) an introduction to VLSI CAD workstations, and iv)
laboratory exercises illustrating VLSI CAD techniques.
