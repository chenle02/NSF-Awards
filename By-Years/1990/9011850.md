This award supports the research of Professor V. Rodl to work in the theory of
hereditary classes and Euclidean Ramsey theory. Rodl will work on structural
Ramsey type theorems on set systems, vector spaces and their combinatorial
analogues such as parameter words and lattices. He will also work on the
quantitative aspects by attempting to evaluate the size and numbers of the
corresponding objects The research falls into the general area of combinatorics.
This is at the same time one of the oldest yet one of the most active areas of
mathematics. Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how
discrete collections of objects can be organized. And, so it is extremely
important to modern communications.
