The proposed project is designed to investigate the range of approaches used by
multinational organizations to handle cultural diversity and their relationship
to employee productivity, job satisfaction, and intergroup attitudes. Foreign
subsidiaries of U.S. companies, U.S. subsidiaries of Japanese companies, and
similarly sized domestic units of U.S. corporations will be assessed in terms of
their approaches to cultural diversity at the organizational level. Using
methods derived from organizational diagnosis and organizational culture
perspectives, as well as newly developed questionnaires for key organization
members, data will be gathered about programs, procedures and policies related
to organizational awareness of multicultural issues and organizational handling
of cultural differences. To investigate the implications of different
organizational policies and practices regarding cultural diversity on individual
employees, a subset of organizations representing the range of approaches will
be studied in greater depth. At these sites, additional surveys of approaches
will be studied in greater depth. At these sites, additional surveys of
employees at different levels will assess variables such as job satisfaction,
work related behavior, and individual perspectives on cultural diversity.
Comparisons of these variables among organizations will permit making inferences
about the relationships between organizational and individual level variables.
