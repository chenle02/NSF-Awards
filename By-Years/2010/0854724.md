&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act
of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides continuing
support for a program of research for the Elementary Particle Physics group at
New York University(NYU). Formerly on MILAGRO and RSVP, the NYU group joined
ATLAS in 2006 and has transitioned totally to this experiment. It has developed
a comprehensive program spanning detector commissioning and operation, physics
analyses, and upgrade efforts. This includes continued responsibility for the
Missing Transverse Energy component of the High Level Trigger, work toward a
high luminosity upgrade of the ATLAS tracking detectors, continued development
of the ATLAS Analysis Architecture, and analysis efforts aimed at the detection
of the Higgs boson decaying to tau leptons, measurement of top quark production,
and new approaches for early determination of possible SUSY particle masses.
Broader impact focuses on the involvement of undergraduates in the research
program, and bringing the excitement of particle physics, which will likely also
be prominent in the media in the next few years, to New York City (NYC) middle-
school teachers and students through an ongoing collaboration with the NYU
Steinhardt School of Education and Brookhaven National Laboratory. In addition,
there are plans to expand the current ATLAS EVO CERN-U.S. web-conferencing to
NYC middle schools.&lt;br/&gt;
