This research is designed to make an important contribution toward the
development of an intelligent general purpose robotic system capable of object
location, identification, and manipulation through the judicious use of non-
visual sensing modalities. Currently, robotic applications in manufacturing
require a highly structured environment so that position control of the robot is
sufficient for the task. In relatively unstructured environments sensors are
required to provide information for feedback control of the robot. This research
will seek to prove the feasibility of incorporating a robust, multi- purpose
proximity sensing capability into an existing tactile sensor design with minimal
modification. With the capability of close range proximity sensors located on
the fingers and/or palm of the robot end effector, proper grasp rendezvous with
objects in an unstructured environment can be assured. After contact is made,
the high resolution tactile sensing capability of the integrated sensor system
will verify the grasp and will provide feedback information for manipulation
activities.
