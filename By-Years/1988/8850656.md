This model project was developed by the National Center on Deafness at
California State University, Northridge. During the first year, learning
experiences are being provided for elementary, junior high and senior high
students to stimulate their interest in science and technology by providing deaf
students with enhanced access to existing programs through the provision of
interpreting sersvices. The emphasis on existing programs is to minimize
redundancy while providing deaf students with access to mainstream programs.
Plans for the second year and beyond will focus on reducing the attrition among
deaf students at the postsecondary level. This will be accomplished by providing
more intensive interpreting, notetaking and tutorial services for deaf students
at California State University, Northridge. Additional services, provided in the
form of specialized training for interpreters, will be made available to
regional junior colleges. This will facilitate access to science and technology
for deaf students on those campuses.
