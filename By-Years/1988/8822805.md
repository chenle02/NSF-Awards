This project is developing techniques for fabricating large-area integrated
circuits (IC) on standard IC fabrication lines. The circuits under consideration
are 10 to 50 times the area of current circuits. The researchers are
characterizing manufacturing defects on integrated circuits, and analyzing these
to predict chip yields. From these predictions they can select among various
techniques for on-chip reconfiguration for defect tolerance.
