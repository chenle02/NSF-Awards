DMS-0101121 Paul G. Goerss

This award provides partial funding for the 2001-2002 Emphasis Year in Algebraic
Topology at Northwestern University. The main goal of this special year is to
develop some of the new connections between homotopy theory and other areas of
mathematics, including algebraic geometry, cohomology of groups, algebraic
K-theory, and A(1) homotopy theory. During the year there will be a series of
short term visits by experts in these areas and a smaller number of longer term
visitors. A mini-conference on algebraic topology and its connections with group
cohomology and representation theory will be held in the Fall of 2001, and an
international conference on Homotopy Theory and its Applications will be held in
March of 2002. Both will be at Northwestern University. Further information
about the Emphasis Year and the associated conferences, including invited
speakers, schedule of talks, and housing information, will be available at
http://www.math.northwestern/~pgoerss/emphasis.
