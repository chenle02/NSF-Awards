The Department of Chemistry is developing a series of experiments which are
being incorporated into an instrumental analysis laboratory manual which
emphasizes bioanalytical determinations, includes standard laboratory practices,
and incorporates an ordering of experiments that is related to actual steps in
problem-solving. The project centers around improving the instruction which is
involved in instrumental and physical measurements courses which are usually
offered in the third or fourth year of study. The problems common to such
courses which this project is working to overcome include insufficient emphasis
on bioanalytical experiments, an order of topics covered that is based on the
complexity of a technique rather than the steps followed in problem-solving, and
pedagogy that is overly biased toward illustration of a measurement concept at
the expense of standard laboratory practices.
