The research focuses on developing queueing theories of multi-media traffic
integration in high speed networks. Multi-media traffic has great diversity of
traffic characteristics and service requirements. Because of the lack of
analytical tools for the evaluation of multi-media traffic queues, most
analytical issues of network control and service management are basically
untouched. This research addresses these issues and includes: o characterizing
the diversity of multi-media traffic o formulating a multi-dimensional discrete
Markov queueing process o developing analytical solution techniques o analyzing
and decoupling the interconnected multi-media queues The research also involves
finding simple effective tools for analysis of network resource allocation and
call management issues. The researcher will first concentrate on developing a
simple closed form solution for the approximate average delay of multi-media
traffic queues. The tail distribution of the queues will also be characterized
in a simple geometric form, to capture the packet loss behavior of finite buffer
systems. Finally the researcher will study the feasibility of decomposing the
analysis of interconnected multi-media traffic queues.
