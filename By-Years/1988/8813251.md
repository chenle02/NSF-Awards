The research project will organize a research program to address topics in the
repair and strengthening of structures for the purpose of reducing seismic
hazards. There is a need for information to be available to the design
profession regarding design procedures and construction techniques for repairing
damaged structures and strengthening inadequate structures. To organize this
program, an executive coordinating committee will be established to develop a
work plan, to identify possible participants in the research effort, and to
establish priorities and schedule for a coordinated program. The final product
of the research program includes specific projects to be conducted within a
systematic multi-year program aimed at mitigating seismic hazards.
