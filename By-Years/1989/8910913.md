The main research goal of this project is to develop computational methods for
testing robust stability and designing robust stabilizing controllers for linear
systems with uncertain parameters and time delays. This is one of the main open
problems in control theory today since the presence of time delays in the
feedback loop affects heavily the robustness of a control system. The following
particular objects are in focus: 1) Characterization of those classes of time
delay systems for which the Kharitonov type results hold. 2) Derivation of
efficient computational tools for testing robust stability of delay systems with
the polytope structure in space of uncertain parameters. 3) Development of the
theory of robust stabilization of delay systems with possible implications for
the general methodology of robust controller design.
