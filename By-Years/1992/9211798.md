The application of molecular biology and biotechnology to marine organisms is
beginning, and "marine biotechnology" for commercial, environmental, and
national security applications is emerging rapidly. A number of exciting
fundamental research discoveries in marine biology were made during the last
decade and more are being made as research advances in a number of areas. There
is also now a need to address technological and policy issues arising from these
fundamental discoveries. Marine biotechnology is at a critical juncture in the
United States. The proposed effort includes forming a committee to examine the
importance of marine biotechnology and key research and development policy
issues.
