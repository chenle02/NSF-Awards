PI: Yu, Jaehyuk Proposal #: 0950850 Title: Regulation of sporogenesis in
Aspergillus

Fungi are of great importance to humankind as pathogens, environmental
recyclers, industrial producers, and agricultural aids. A large number of fungi
produce spores as the main means of dissemination and survival. Spores are also
the primary agent for infecting hosts for many pathogenic fungi. Moreover, in
some fungi spore formation is intimately related with production of toxic
secondary metabolites called mycotoxins that cause adverse health effects to
humans, animals and plants. Despite its fundamental importance in both basic and
applied aspects, the mechanism underlying spore formation in molds is largely
unknown. This project investigates functions of two newly identified velvet
genes that play a key role in regulating sporulation and production of
mycotoxins in molds. These two velvet genes are hypothesized to control
expression of other genes associated with spore and toxin formation via binding
to DNA and acting as transcriptional regulators. This project employs recently
developed genetic and molecular tools that facilitate the understanding of gene
function in fungi. Expected results include better understanding the functions
of these novel regulators, identification of groups of genes that are controlled
by the two genes, and defining the genetic networks regulating spore formation
and toxin production in molds. Understanding the mechanisms governing
sporulation and secondary metabolism in molds will provide new insights into
controlling both beneficial and detrimental activities of other industrially,
medically, and agriculturally important fungi. In broader impacts, this project
will provide opportunities to promote excellence in science education and
rigorous training of graduate and undergraduate students in the disciplines of
microbiology, genetics and genomics.
