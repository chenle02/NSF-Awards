The proposed project is to develop a method to directly measure the nanometer-
scale fluid velocity in order to characterize the flow field in the vicinity of
cell-surface mechanoreceptors. The method is based on use of the atomic force
microscopy (AFM) to access the small scale regions on the cell surface. The AFM
cantilever tip is modified by placing nanocarbon bundles with a single
nanocarbon tube protruding into the flow field. The force on the nanocarbon tube
will be correlated to the flow filed to extract the flow velocity information.
