9510008 Chang The development and evolution of cyclones and anticyclones
control, to a large extent, the weather in the mid-latitudes. These weather
systems occur in preferred regions termed the storm tracks. It is important to
understand the processes that can lead to the formation of these systems and
their evolution. Recent observational and modelling studies have revealed that
cyclones and anticyclones occur predominantly within localized wave packets.
Preliminary studies suggest that the structure, evolution, and development of
these systems within localized wave packets can be quite different from those
suggested by traditional theories of baroclinic instability. Dr. Chang intends
to explore in depth the evolution of these systems within the localized wave
packets by diagnosing observational analyses from the European Centre for Medium
Range Prediction and the National Center for Environmental Prediction and by
conducting numerical experiments with a primitive equation model with simplified
model physics. The results of this research will have important implications for
medium range weather prediction (on the order of one to two weeks). *** ??
