9512190 Jupina This proposal request characterization and CAD tools for the
design of Microwave Monolithic Integrated Circuits (MMICs), which find
application in radar systems and miniature, mobile wireless personal
communications. There is a planned future (1997) engineering laboratory building
at Villanova which will have dedicated space for this equipment in a new
anechoic chamber test facility. The specific request is for a microwave probe
station, a high-end network analyzer and computer workstations to provide
shielded' 4-port test capability overs an extended temperature range. ***
