This twelve-month project of the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) will
establish a Prognostic Testing Network. The testing will use college-level
placement tests to predict deficiencies in high school juniors. With the
knowledge of these deficiencies, high school students that plan to go on to
college can, during their senior year, remediate their deficiencies so that upon
entering college they are more likely to be placed in college level courses.
Prognostic testing programs have been either started or established in eight
states and at least six states are known to be interested in prognostic testing.
The MAA Prognostic Testing Network will organize these efforts and provide a
network by which information can be exchanged and additional states could obtain
help in starting their own programs. The project will sponsor a two-day
conference to discuss and disseminate the prognostic testing model and to
organize the MAA Prognostic Testing Network. The cost sharing for this project
will be thirty-eight percent.
