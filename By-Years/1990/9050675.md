This project modernizes the current digital hardware laboratory in terms of
both equipment and pedagogy. It supports a redesigned hardware development
system and redesigned laboratory projects. The concept of a large student
project that extends over a six month period is retained and the construction of
a fully functional minicomputer from basic integrated circuit components is
still required. New student projects will emphasize programmable logic devices
in addition to hardwired circuits, and will incorporate modern simulation and
logic minimization tools. In the microprogrammed-control phase of the project,
the new equipment will offer greatly enhanced interactive design and debugging
capabilities. This project is significant because it provides a laboratory in
which undergraduate students can build designs using programmable logic devices
as well as modern simulation and logic minimization tools.
