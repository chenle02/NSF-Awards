The investigators will determine what role cell lineage plays in the
specification of cell fate during vertebrate neuronal development. They will
study the early embryo of the zebrafish, in which they can mark individual
cells, transplant them, and follow them as they develop in living embryos. They
have shown previously that gastrula cells generate clones restricted to single
tissues, yet if the cells are transplanted, they produce new lineages. The early
cells, therefore, may express position- specific developmental programs that
determine their early behavior, but do not restrict their potential. To further
our understanding of the developmental roles of cell lineage, the investigators
will study in vivo the lineages that normally arise from singly marked cells,
learning the patterns of division, movements, and lineage relationships of a
variety of cell types, including identified neurons. To investigate cellular
commitments and clues provided by the environment, they will examine lineages
and fates of cells transplanted individually between embryos.
