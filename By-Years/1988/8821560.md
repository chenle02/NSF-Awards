It has been shown that interactions exist between sequential enzymes of the
Krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle and that these enzymes also bind to proteins in
the inner mitochondrial membrane. There still remain, however, several Krebs
tricarboxylic acid cycle interactions that are not demonstrated and several
which need to be better characterized. It is possible that these supramolecular
complexes have not only a metabolic role but also a structural role in the
mitochondria. An unresolved problem concerning mitochondrial structure is the
molecular basis for the form of cristae, which show great variability within the
same mitochondrion. This project will: 1) isolate and characterize the binding
proteins for the inner membrane; and 2) investigate the molecular basis of
cristae form. Cells are not simply "bags" of enzymes. Organization of the
elements of cells, as well as cells themselves, allows efficient and economical
use of the components of life. At the molecular level, an organized array of the
enzymes of a metabolic sequence allows the attainment of higher fluxes with
lower concentrations of each of the intermediates. A second benefit is that such
organization does not tax the limited solvent capacity of cells. There seems to
have been some evolutionary pressure for organization since some metabolic
pathways exist as separate enzymes in organisms believed to represent early
evolutionary conditions and exist as multifunctional enzymes in cells which are
believed to have arisen later in evolution. This project will provide
information in the role of multi-enzyme complexes in the formation of cell
membranes.***//
