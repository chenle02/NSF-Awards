The focus of this work will be the study of monotonicity and symmetry
properties of solutions of partial differential equations. Equations of interest
include those arising in modeling vibrations and in nonlinear Schrodinger
equations. They fall into the classes known as fully nonlinear elliptic and
parabolic equations. One is interested in understanding solutions where the
minimal period is prescribed or the nature of the singularity where a solution
ceases to exist (blow up). Progress in the first case has been made; the major
obstacle to be overcome rests with the complexity of the infinite dimensional
kernel of the wave operator. Development in the study of blow up of solutions of
the Schrodinger equation have advanced considerably in the past decade. It has
been shown that when the spatial domain is star-shaped, solutions do blow up in
finite time. Work will continue in this vein to understand better the nature of
the singularity and to obtain sharper estimates regarding the time at which the
blow up can be expected. Currently, many related estimates are very crude. The
onset of blow up is not yet known to have physical significance because the
minimal possible time may be exponentially large. Other work will investigate
the existence, uniqueness and spatial decay properties of solutions of traveling
waves arising from dynamics and combustion problems.
