The investigator and his colleagues will organize and conduct a Summer Research
Conference (SRC) in statistics and biostatistics at Montgomery Bell State Park,
Tennessee June 2-5, 2013. The SRC is an annual conference sponsored by the
Southern Regional Council on Statistics (SRCOS). Its purpose is to encourage the
interchange and mutual understanding of current research ideas in statistics and
biostatistics, and to give motivation and direction to further research
progress. The project will focus on young researchers, placing them in close
proximity to leaders in the field for person-to-person interactions in a manner
not possible at most other meetings. Speakers will present formal research talks
with adequate time allowed for clarification, amplification, and further
informal discussions in small groups. Under the travel support provided by this
award students will attend and present their research in posters to be reviewed
by more experienced researchers.

The Southern Regional Council on Statistics is a consortium of statistics and
biostatistics programs in the South, stretching as far west as Texas and as far
north as Maryland. It currently has member programs at 39 universities in 16
states in the region. This project will fund student participation in the 2013
Summer Research Conference (SRC) sponsored by SRCOS. The meeting is particularly
valuable for students and faculty from smaller regional schools at drivable
distances, affording them the opportunity to participate and interact closely
with internationally-known leaders in the field without the cost of travel to
distant national or international venues. It will strengthen the research of the
statistics and biostatistics community as a whole, and particularly in the
relatively underdeveloped southern region. For all details, go to the conference
