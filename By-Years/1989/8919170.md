The combustion of model chlorinated hydrocarbon compounds is being studied in a
flat flame burner and flow reactor in an effort to develop detailed chemical
kinetic mechanisms. Stable intermediate species profiles within chloro-benzene
and chloro-toluene/methane flames are measured using gas chromatography and mass
spectrometry; laser photolysis is utilized to generate chloromethyl and
chlorovinyl radicals in the flow reactor, with an on-line mass spectromer used
to measure the products of decomposition/reaction in the presence of oxygen. The
research will lead to the establishment of a better understanding of the
combustion of chlorinated hydrocarbons, expressed in the form of a detailed
chemical kinetic mechanism. The mechanism can be used as a rational starting
point for understanding the role chlorine plays in the formation of pollutants
such as chlorinated aromatics, di- benzo furans, and di-benzo dioxins in
incinerators.
