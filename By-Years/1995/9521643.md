A workshop to consider future directions of research in theoretical computer
science was held June 1-2, 1995 in Las Vegas, Nevada immediately following the
STOC`95 Conference. Researchers representing a cross-section of the theory of
computing community were invited to participate. The workshop focused on: (1)
the direction of future research; (2) fostering communication within the area
and with other areas; and (3) broadening the educational experiences of
theoretical computer science students. The results of this meeting are
summarized in a report prepared by the PI and Co-PI, in consultation with the
workshop participants.
