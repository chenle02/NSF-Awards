This project deals with certain dynamical systems of algebraic origin and their
applications to number theory. A dynamical system here stands for an abstract
set of points together with an evolution law that governs the way points move
over time. Such abstract dynamical systems form the basis for models of a wide
range of important phenomena in science and engineering. It turns out that many
questions in mathematics concerning simultaneous approximation of real numbers
by rational numbers can be understood in terms of the behavior of dynamical
systems. Furthermore, systems that arise in this context are of algebraic
nature, which makes it possible to use a wide variety of sophisticated tools for
their investigation. This research project aims to advance the framework of
algebraic dynamical systems in approximation theory, develop new methods, and
obtain far-reaching generalizations of results in the field. Graduate and
undergraduate students will be involved in the project and introduced to new
methods and techniques in number theory and dynamics. These students will also
supervise research projects within the framework of the PRIMES program, an
after-school research program for high school students.

During recent years there have been important developments concerning
connections between Diophantine approximation and dynamical systems. This
research project continues the study of phenomena in both dynamics and number
theory related to asymptotic and uniform approximations. Among the mathematical
tools to be employed are: Schmidt games and their modifications, integral
inequalities of Eskin-Margulis-Mozes, effective mixing and equidistribution
properties, Siegel-Rogers moment formulas, and parametric geometry of numbers.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
