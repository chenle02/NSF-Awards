The focus of this research will be on metal-mediated Diels Alder chemistry. As
one goal, the preparation of 2-main group element-substituted 1,3-dienes
followed by tandem Diels-Alder/cross-coupling reactions will be carried out.
Another goal will be to develop methodology to facilitate the tandem
transmetallation/Diels-Alder reactions and sequential transmetallation/Diels-
Alder/cross- coupling reactions of main group substituted-dienes. Also, using
the Diels Alder approach, the core structures in the cis-clerodane terpenes,
compounds having interesting biological properties, will be synthesized. With
this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the
research of Dr. Mark E. Welker in the Department of Chemistry at Wake Forest
University. Professor Welker will focus his work on the development of Diels
Alder methodology using main group substituted-dienes. When this methodology is
employed in combination with transmetallation and cross-coupling reactions,
products that are core structures for natural product synthesis result. The work
has potential for broader impact in the pharmaceutical and agricultural
industries and the project serves as an excellent venue for the training of
undergraduates and graduate students.
