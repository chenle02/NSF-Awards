9407308 Appel The highly variable activity of plant chemical tannins in
ecological interactions has led to considerable controversy about their
ecological significance. It appears that this variation and controversy arise
from a failure to realize the importance of oxidation in activating these
molecules. That is, chemicals in the plant accept electrons from tannins and
this in turn facilitates the action of tannins as anti-viral agents in the
insect gut. In this study the importance of electron donation and chemical
bonding will be investigated by demonstrating the importance of oxidation to
tannin action by assaying the antiviral activity of tannins in the presence and
absence of plant oxidants and by demonstrating that these oxidized tannins bind
chemically to viral proteins in the model gut system of the Gypsy Moth. ***
