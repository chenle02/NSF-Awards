This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative research project
between Dr. David Furth, Department of Entomology, Museum of Comparative
Zoology, Harvard University, and Professor Kunio Suzuki, Department of Biology,
Toyama University, Japan. The project involves joint study of the insect
specimens housed in Japan, focusing on the collections of chrysomelids,
including especially the so-called "flea beetles" of subfamily Alticinae. The
investigators will undertake to upgrade the basic taxonomy of the group by
describing the reliable morphological characters for distinguishing species and
genera. Dr. Furth and Professor Suzuki are experts on chrysomelid morphology and
systematics, especially with the characters to be used in this character
congruence study. Dr. Furth will spend three months travelling in Japan with
Professor Suzuki to study the Asian flea beetle genera available in collections
in Japan. This study will demonstrate the usefulness of correlation of
characters (congruence) to phylogenetic research in systematic biology and will
eluicdate the Galerucinae/Alticinae relationship and provide the foundation for
creating a tribal system in the Alticinae.
