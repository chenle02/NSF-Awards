Most of the PI's research will be motivated by the development of free
probability theory and of its applications, and will deal especially with
acquiring new analytic tools and with extensions of the framework of free
probability. One main theme will be the noncommutative analogue of the Riemann
sphere constructed by the PI and the fully matricial analytic functions on it.
Work on this analytic machinery will aim at preparing it for use in operator-
valued free probability and its applications to operator algebras, random
multimatrix systems and some of the problems arising in connection with the
analogue of entropy. Another theme will be the continuing phenomenon of new
extensions of free probability parallling classical situations, like free
extreme values and connections to free quantum groups.

Free probability theory is a noncommutative probability framework, where
independence is modelled on free products instead of tensor products, which
makes it suitable for dealing with variables with the highest degree of
noncommutativity. The free analogue of the Riemann sphere in the proposal aims
at giving to a basic complex analysis object the same highest degree of
noncommutativity to be adapted to uses in free probability. In free probability
theory the role of the Gauss law is held by the Wigner semicircle law and the
framework is particularly well suited for dealing with the asymptotics of
systems of random matrices as their size increases. Via random matrices free
probability has applications to multi-user telecommunication systems in
engineering and to certain mathematical models in physics.
