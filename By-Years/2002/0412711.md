0412711 Arp This proposal is focused on an important problem in microbial
systems used for wastewater treatment. The model organism selected for study is
the only ammonia-oxidizing bacterium with a sequenced genome. Transcriptional
responses would be evaluated for both planktonic and biofilm cultures. Reporter
strains of this organism would also be generated for potential use in wastewater
treatment plants as biosensors of potentially deleterious conditions. The
proposed research would use the nitrifying bacterium N. europaea as a model for
the effects of environmental stress on gene expression. This would be enabled by
the complete genome sequence and the subsequent availability of whole genome
microarrays. The goal is to identify genes that would serve as markers of stress
in wastewater systems. If successful, this approach could be applied to other
environmental systems.

The educational plan is well developed, including interdisciplinary training of
graduate students and involving high school students. Workshops are to be
developed and offered to high school and community college teachers.
