Many chemical transformations rely on catalysts to enhance the rate of a
reaction or to favor formation of a desired product over an undesired product.
The manufacturing costs of chemicals, polymers, and materials can be
significantly reduced by employing efficient catalytic processes. A significant
challenge in designing new catalysts, however, is that many catalysts have
complicated structures and are difficult to synthesize. The Macromolecular,
Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry supports
Professor Michael Pluth of the University of Oregon to develop novel approaches
to preparing catalysts of complex structures via self-assembly of simple
subunits and to investigate how the activities of these catalysts can be
modulated. This research aims to provide new insights into how catalysts can be
activated or deactivated on-demand. Complementing the scientific goals of this
research, the project helps to prepare a workforce for industry and academia by
providing research training to graduate students. It also promotes STEM
education by facilitating research experiences for undergraduate students and by
expanding outreach activities with local middle- and high schools.

Prof. Pluth's research group designs and synthesizes ligands that can self-
assemble into active catalysts after binding a "guest" molecule. His research
aims to provide new basic knowledge on how guest molecules can transmit
information to the catalyst upon binding and enable allosteric regulation of
supramolecular catalysis. Of particular interest is the investigation of
chirality transfer between guest and host to uncover new insights into chiral
induction through non-covalent interactions. To demonstrate chirality transfer
between guest and the catalyst, his research group uses chiral guests as chiral
co-factors to enable enantioselective self-assembled catalysts and studies the
impact of binding on the rate and selectivity of platinum- and rhodium-catalyzed
hydroformylation reactions.
