Workshop?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;US-Japan Research Ethics Education
Workshop&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As research, practice, and education in science
and engineering become increasingly global so must efforts to address their
ethical dimensions. This workshop will bring together Japanese counterparts ?
researchers, administrators, government representatives ? to discuss the
critical issues of misconduct in science and approaches toward education and
training which may mitigate some of the circumstances leading to such
misconduct. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will facilitate future
collaborative interactions with Japanese science and education agencies and
researchers. It is the first US-Japan collaboration on this topic and holds the
promise of building new collaborations that will be highly relevant to both
sides.
