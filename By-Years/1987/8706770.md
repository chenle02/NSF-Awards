Hormonal mechanisms that control the expression of reproductive behavior are
complex. In the female, estradiol and progesterone are the predominant gonadal
steriods which stimulate behavior. Some species, such as the musk shrew, also
require adrenal hormone to activate behavior. The mechanisms involved for these
behavioral responses are unclear. Moreover, the role of the adrenal hormones in
the stimulation of reproductive behavior as opposed to aggressive behavior
present a fascinating question. The present proposal contains carefully designed
experiments in which the musk shrew's behavioral responses are described and
then altered by pharmacological manipulations. Current methodologies will be
used to monitor adrenal and gonadal hormones. An elegant technique will be used
to sample the animal without disturbing the individual; thereby enabling a
"true" measure of the interactions between behavioral and physiological
responses. These investigations will significantly advance the field of the
hormonal basis of behavior.
