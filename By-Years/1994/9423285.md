Abstract 9423285 Rosen This research involves the application of two
observational methods for the study of Polar Stratospheric Clouds (PSCs) and
ozone in the Arctic winter vortex. The first method uses balloon borne aerosol
and particle instrumentation floating with a fixed air mass for many days as
PSCs begin to form and evolve while at the same time ozone concentrations will
be measured. The second approach involves making normal balloon soundings with
similar equipment at several Arctic stations which, in contrast to the first
method, will provide information on the evolution of PSCs over a fixed location.
This project is a continuation and refinement of an ongoing successful
international (U.S., Russia, Germany, Denmark and Finland) effort and represents
a new approach to identifying and quantifying ozone loss in the Arctic
Stratosphere. ***
