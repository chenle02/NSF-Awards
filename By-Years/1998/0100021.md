ABSTRACT: This project concerns two main topics: harmonic analysis on noncompact
semisimple Lie groups and symmetric spaces, and unique continuation problems and
absence of positive eigenvalues of Schrodinger operators on Euclidean spaces.
The author's goal is to develop real-variable methods that could be used to
study boundedness properties of certain natural operators on noncompact
semisimple Lie groups and symmetric spaces. Some of the problems to be
investigated are the following: sharp estimates related to the Kunze-Stein
phenomenon, behaviour of the solution of the wave equation on symmetric spaces
at large time, singular integral operators on symmetric spaces, transference
principles for operators defined by Fourier multipliers on symmetric spaces, and
maximal operators and applications in ergodic theory. The author made progress
on these problems in certain special cases, mostly on Lie groups and symmetric
spaces of real rank one. The second part of the project is aimed at
understanding the absence of positive eigenvalues for Schrodinger operators with
potentials in appropriate Lebesgue spaces and with certain decay properties at
infinity.

The problem of eliminating the possibility of positive eigenvalues for the
Schrodinger operator associated to one or many particles comes from mathematical
physics. One expects on physical grounds that such positive energy "bound
states" cannot exist. This is indeed the case for a large class of Schrodinger
operators associated to potentials which satisfy certain uniform decay
conditions, such as the Coulomb potential. These potentials were studied in the
60's by T. Kato, S. Agmon, J. Weidman, B. Simon, and others. In the last twenty
years there has been growing interest in extending these classical results to
more general potentials in various Lebesgue spaces.
