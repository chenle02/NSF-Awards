Reasoning for Machine Understanding of Solid Models This is the first year
funding of a three-year research project with the objectives of studying and
developing geometric reasoning mechanisms and knowledge representation methods
for modeling and recognition of semantic shape features that will be useful in
industrial design and manufacturing. A person or a machine that is going to
perceive objects in order to interact with them in any way must do more than see
the objects; it is necessary to recognize them as what they are, to attach a
meaning to them. Actually seeing the objects as individual items with particular
shapes and features is part of perception, and involves geometric reasoning.
Attaching meaning to the objects means that there must be an internalknowledge
representation for what is significant about them. A mapping from a set of
geometric features to a meaning in terms of the knowledge representation is
called semantics, after the analogous mapping in language. As the product life
cycles become shorter and product variety increases, it is crucial to minimize
the lag period between the start of a product's design and the time it is
produced. This project includes applying the developed geometric reasoning
models and mechanisms to solve important issues in machine understanding of
designs, automated generation of process planning strategies, and automated
visual inspection based on solid models. Initial promising results have been
obtained on these problems. Further investigation will be performed
systematically to develop the concepts and the mechanisms. In addition, the
application of the concepts and mechanisms to the development of information
driven intelligent integrated environments for flexible design and production
will be studied.
