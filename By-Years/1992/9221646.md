This award is the starter grant increment of Dr. McCarley's Postdoctoral
Fellowship in Chemistry. Scanning tunneling (STM) and atomic force (ATM)
microscopy studies will be carried out on thin metal films formed upon organic
monolayers containing pendant metal binding sites. Surface diffusion of adatoms
should be controllable by varying the tail group thus allowing better control
over metal film properties. ATM and STM will be used to monitor the morphology
of metals formed on these modified surfaces. Metal films produced by vacuum
evaporation will be investigated in order to note differences in nucleation
events. %%% This research will study methods which can lead to the preparation
of thin metal films. These materials are of considerable commercial importance
to the electronics industry.
