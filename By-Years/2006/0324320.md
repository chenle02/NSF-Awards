The 2003 EPSCoR conference, sponsored jointly by the Department of Energy and
the National Science Foundation, will be co-hosted by Sandia National Labs and
Los Alamos Lab. New Mexico EPSCoR is providing an opportunity for researchers,
faculty, and students from EPSCoR jurisdictions to establish collaborations with
the labs in state-of-the-art science and technology. The conference, to be held
in early June, focuses on the following questions: What are the laboratory,
university, and national needs for research, talent, and strategic
collaborations? How does one meet those needs by increasing the diversity and
quality of university/lab/state collaborations? What are the successful methods
of developing and maintaining university/lab collaborations? A formal evaluation
of the conference will provide both immediate feedback and a follow-up phase to
explore the nature of lab contacts and any linkages to the work of the
conference.
