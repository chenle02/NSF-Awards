The proposed project focuses on the detection of lightning flashes above
mesoscale convective systems routinely observed during the summer in the high
plains of the Midwest. The investigation entails the use of radio wave
diagnostics to examine the production of ionization patches (if any) in the
stratosphere and mesosphere. A three-week campaign is proposed for summer 1995;
the experimentation period will be timed to take advantage of ground- based
optical diagnostics that will be in place for the detection of sprites and blue
jets. If the proposed observing strategy is effective, more complex diagnostic
systems can be implemented to precisely define the atmospheric physics involved
in the optical sightings.
