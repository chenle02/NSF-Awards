Professor Knapp will make systematic use of intertwining operators into and out
of reducible and irreducible representations of semisimple Lie groups in order
to understand the representations better. Two specific areas of investigation
are the relationship of algebraic and analytic forms of representations and the
introduction of a more direct approach to harmonic analysis on semisimple
symmetric spaces. The postdoctoral associate supported by this award will use
micro-local analysis to gain a better understanding of the dual of a semisimple
Lie group. The research supported by this award is in the area of the
representation theory of groups. Groups usually arise as transformations which
preserve the structure of some system. For example, the group of rotations about
the center preserves the sphere. In applications the abstract group is not all
that is needed but in addition a concrete realization of this group, called a
representation. This project will study the representations which arise from a
family of smooth groups called Lie groups.
