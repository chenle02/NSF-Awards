The objective of this research is to establish a science base for the design
and operation of assembly systems. Specific objectives are: (1) state-of-the-art
branch and bound approach to prescribe minimum cost design and operating
decisions, (2) strong cutting plane methods to prescribe minimum cost solutions
for large-scale assembly systems, (3) computational evaluation, and (4)
interaction with industry to assure research relevancy. Research significance is
two-fold. First, it will improve competitiveness of assembly systems, reducing
costs and promoting on-time delivery. Second, it represents an innovative
contribution to integer programming methods and entails basic research to lay a
foundation for numerous engineering applications.
