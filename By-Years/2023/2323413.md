Many essential products, e.g., glass, paper, plastics, and rubbers, are made of
polymers. Polymers are highly attractive due to their versatility, low-cost and
processability, but their functionality is limited. To enhance the functionality
and strength of polymers, it is proposed to incorporate nanoparticles. However,
most nanoparticles are often incompatible with polymer matrices, resulting in
agglomeration and deterioration in mechanical properties. To control the
dispersion of nanoparticles in polymer matrices, chemically grafted polymers on
the surface of nanoparticles, known as hairy nanoparticles, is proposed. This
award seeks to understand how hairy nanoparticles affect the functionality and
properties of the polymers. By controlling the grafted polymer chain length,
density, and chemical nature on well-dispersed nanoparticles of different
shapes, the research can impact how polymers are manufactured, processed, and
utilized for many engineering applications. The proposed research is accompanied
by a series of educational and outreach efforts such as involving undergraduate
researchers, educational programs for teachers, and releasing open-source codes,
to broaden its impact.

The rheology of polymer matrices containing hairy nanoparticles cannot be
explained by known theories, e.g., Einstein’s or Bachelor’s, which
underestimates the relative viscosity by over 10 million folds. The objective of
this award, therefore, is to (1) experimentally investigate the rheology of
nanocomposites with different shapes of hairy nanoparticles; (2) develop and
validate computational tools to simulate such suspensions; and (3) investigate
the main reasons for their deviation from the theory, thereby pave the way to
improve theoretical/simplified models for advanced manufacturing needs. The
proposed study intends to prepare designed 0D,1D, and 2D nanoparticles grafted
by poly(methylmethacrylate) or other miscible molecules with different chain
lengths and graft densities for dispersion in poly(methylmethacrylate) matrix.
Particle-resolved simulations will be performed by handling the moving particles
using a sharp-interface immersed boundary method, capable of simulating
arbitrary-shaped particles interacting with the fluid. The hairy grafts on the
particles will be modeled as a porous medium over the interaction zone derived
from experiments. The simulations and experiments will provide sufficient
correlation to test several hypotheses on the effect of geometric parameters on
rheology, thereby enabling the development of empirical formulas based on these
parameters.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
