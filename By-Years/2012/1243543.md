Climate change and global population growth demand creative, low-energy, multi-
disciplinary, and multi-benefit approaches to sustaining water resources. This
PIRE will catalyze, through research and education, the development and
deployment of low-energy options for improving water productivity while
protecting human and ecosystem health. The project links five different
universities in two water-stressed regions of the world (southwest U.S. and
southeast Australia) with unique and complementary expertise in the development
and deployment of rainwater tanks, biofilters, and waste stabilization ponds for
potable substitution and watershed protection. Research will: (1) improve the
removal of pathogens and micropollutants in storm water runoff by harnessing
solar energy and incorporating into biofilter design the plant and animal
communities native to local seasonal wetlands; (2) investigate the risks and
benefits of distributed adoption of these technologies on public health, energy
consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions; (3) identify social, economic, and
policy barriers to their adoption, quantify their unpriced benefits and propose
economic instruments, regulations, and public education measures to foster their
adoption; and (4) quantify the impact of distributed adoption of these
technologies on urban stream hydrology, water quality, and ecology. Broader
impacts include green technology for treating runoff and gray water at the
household scale; dissemination of research results to managers and engineers; a
diverse workforce in sustainability science; an electronic textbook (E-book) on
Water Sustainability; K-12 teaching modules with research-integrated summer
activities, including BioFilter Frenzy Week; and education programs targeting
Native American high school students and science teachers throughout the U.S..
The project is funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering
(OISE) through its PIRE program.
