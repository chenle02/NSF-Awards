This research project led by the Exploratorium will use a combination of
tracking and timing, cluster analysis, and focus groups to seek to answer the
research question: To what extent and in what ways do female-responsive designs
more effectively engage girls at STEM exhibits? This project addresses the need
for more research in this area by pioneering the study of potential female-
responsive design (FRD) principles for exhibits across a wide variety of STEM
topics and exhibit types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project includes four phases
that will build from the work of the PI that developed an initial Female-
Responsive Design (FRD) Framework regarding female engagement and learning in
STEM -- based on extensive literature review and practitioner interviews. This
project will expand on and validate this FRD Framework, with the ultimate goal
of having a set of criteria for female-responsive designs (FRD) that effectively
engage girls at STEM exhibits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The four phases of the
research project are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase 1: Track whole museum visits to
identify, which exhibits engage boys and girls equally, and which are less
engaging for girls. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase 2: A panel of experts and girl
advisors identify additional female-responsive design principles, expanding on
those identified to date in literature and practice. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase
3: Combining results from the first two phases, the third phase employs
statistical analyses to reveal the most effective combinations of design
principles for engaging girls across STEM topics and exhibit types.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase 4: This qualitative phase conducts focus groups with
girls to explore how the final FRD Framework works to better engage them, and
how their learning differs at exhibits that exemplify the principles in the
Framework.
