Founded in 1941, the Society for Applied Anthropology promotes the investigation
of the principles of human behavior and the application of these principles to
contemporary issues and problems. The Society has over 2,000 members and
sponsors two major journals. The Society provides a critical professional space
for anthropologists focused on basic scientific questions with use-inspired
research objectives, as well as the development of innovative new methodologies
in anthropological science. This project broadens the participation of groups
historically underrepresented in science. In keeping with the 2024 annual
meetingâ€™s thematic focus on transformation, the project also includes clear
dissemination plans for the communication of science to the public.
Opportunities are afforded through this project to train graduate and
undergraduate students and early career professionals in scientific methods.

This project convenes scholars working in areas of use-inspired anthropological
science at the 2024 Annual Meetings of the Society for Applied Anthropology in
Sante Fe, New Mexico. The project supports funding for travel and accommodations
for students, scholars, practitioners, and community members who belong to one
or more of the following groups: (1) historically underrepresented in
anthropological sciences and/or (2) disproportionately affected by critical
issues in the 2024 Annual Meeting program (which includes issues related to
environmental variability, water scarcity, and disaster risk and preparedness).
In addition to instituting anthropological applications of the science of
broadening participation to optimize the quality of anthropological science,
project outcomes advance anthropological science in a range of specific
subfields, including environmental change and water scarcity, culture and
medicine, disaster preparedness, disability studies, and Indigenous knowledge.
