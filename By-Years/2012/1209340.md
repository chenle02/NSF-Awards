Much of the biodiversity of flowering plants is due to their coevolutionary
relationships with animal pollinators. Each species of pollinator is attracted
to a particular flower because of the flower's color, size, shape, nectar
reward, or scent. Little is known about the role of specific genes that cause
changes in scent that then affect pollinator behavior. The genus Mimulus
(monkeyflowers) contains two species that are separated only by the preferences
of their pollinators (hummingbirds and bumblebees). The two Mimulus species have
marked differences in their floral scents. This proposal focuses on two
questions: 1) What are the genes that underlie these scent differences in
Mimulus?; and, 2) How will plants that differ in these genetic traits affect the
response of hummingbird and bumblebee pollinators in nature? The work proposed
here addresses broader evolutionary principles that underlie species diversity.
Additionally, since insect pollination is responsible for $225 billion per year
in service to agriculture, understanding the genetic and evolutionary basis of
plant-pollinator interactions has important implications for food security.
