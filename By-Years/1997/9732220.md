The methodologies of computational geometry will be applied to design, analyze,
implement, and test algorithms for problems that arise in application areas such
as manufacturing, computer-aided design, graphics and visualization, robotics,
cartography, and air traffic control. An important aspect of the work is to
conduct technology dissemination to industry, helping to transfer algorithms
into practice. This will be done through pursuit of new industrial
collaborations, while building on the several industrial partnerships that have
already been developed. In order to find applications of computational geometry
to meet the needs of industry, companies will be visited in order to discuss
their geometric computing needs, and formulate their most critical problems as
instances of algorithmic questions. Further, as solutions are proposed and
developed, the industrial partners will be assisted with the implementation and
integration phases of the projects. The specific repertoire of problems
includes: (a) manufacturing process planning (NC verification, tool path
generation, deposition, cutting, bending) and virtual manufacturing (collision
detection, assembly planning); (b) computer graphics and visualization
(rendering large polygonal models, volume visualization, visibility
preprocessing, texture mapping); (c) Geographic Information Systems (GIS),
including map generalization and optimal route planning in geometric
environments under a variety of constraints and objectives (air traffic
management, transshipment, mobile robotics, military mission planning).
