A new approach to teaching undergraduate organic chemistry lab is to carry out
the experiments on 1/100th to 1/1000th the scale previously used. In this way
student exposure to sub- stances which are toxic, flammable, corrosive,
carcinogenic, teratagenic, and mutagenic is reduced by a corresponding amount
and there are concomittant savings in the disposal of laboratory waste and the
purchase of reagents and solvents. Since the apparatus and techniques differ
from those used in the past, faculty need some guidance before embarking on this
way of teaching the undergraduate organic laboratory. To this end three week-
long workshops on teaching microscale organic experiments will be conducted at
Mount Holyoke College in June of l988. Participants will have an opportunity to
carry out microscale experiments under the guidance of the project director, the
author of a recent laboratory manual in microscale organic chemistry, assisted
by undergraduates who have helped develop these experiments. In addition to NSF
funds, participants' institutions will contribute about 40% in travel costs
toward the cost of the project.
