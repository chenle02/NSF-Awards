This award supports the participation of US-based researchers in the "Quasiworld
Workshop", a mathematics conference held August 14-18, 2023 at the University of
Helsinki, Finland. The event provides an excellent opportunity for the
participants, especially those who are at an early stage in their career, to
learn new developments in their field and to potentially establish
collaborations with international experts. Supporting US researchers to attend
the conference therefore contributes to the growth of mathematics in the United
States. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The focus of the conference is on the
intersection of the mathematical fields of geometry, analysis, dynamics, and
probability. There have been a number of recent breakthroughs involving the
interaction between two or more of these different areas, and it is important
for US-based mathematicians to stay informed about these developments.
Opportunities to learn from and form collaborations with international
researchers are invaluable, especially for early-career researchers, and such
opportunities have been particularly scarce in recent years. More information
about the meeting is available at

workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
