Abstract&lt;br/&gt;0428532&lt;br/&gt;PI: Timothy W. McLain &lt;br/&gt;Brigham
Young University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The integration of sensing capabilities
into microdevices is a significant challenge because the sensors used are often
larger than the devices they monitor. Compliant micromechanisms may provide a
means of overcoming the difficulty associated with sensor integration in a
variety of applications. Compliant microdevices use the deflection of flexible
members to obtain their motion, which results in desirable characteristics at
the micro level. These characteristics include manufacturability using existing
methods, high-precision motion, and high reliability. A significant advantage of
compliant mechanisms that has yet to be fully exploited is that they have
physical properties that change as the device moves. Since their motion comes
from strain in the compliant elements, any strain-sensitive properties of the
material (such as electrical resistivity) will change as the device moves. This
intrinsic sensing capability of compliant devices is an asset that this project
intends to utilize in the control and function of micro devices. The concept of
sensors intrinsic to compliant mechanisms is powerful and enabling for
microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). Numerous applications could benefit from
the functionality provided by this sensing concept including: micro-sized
nanopositioners, non-contact force threshold detectors, force transducers for
microdevices, reliable bistable microswitches, and nonvolatile noncontact
mechanical memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a project supported under
Sensors Initiative NSF 04-522.&lt;br/&gt;
