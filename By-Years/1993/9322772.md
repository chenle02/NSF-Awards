CTS-9322772 CACHE Corporation L. T. Biegler ABSTRACT Funds from this project
provide travel assistance to U.S. faculty and graduate students to attend the
conference "Foundations of Computer Aided Design '94." Attendees will critically
assess the current state of knowledge and examine future directions for the
field of computer-aided process design. Of particular emphasis will be new
mathematical models which are more accurate and efficient, new synthesis and
optimization strategies, and recent advances in software and hardware which have
facilitated the use of more sophisticated and complex techniques in process
design. The chemical manufacturing industry provides materials and items used in
the production of automobiles, in building and housing construction and in many
other industries. Computer-aided design is critical to the incorporation of
ongoing developments in the chemical manufacturing, so that American firms are
more economically competitive, energy efficient, and environmentally friendly
from inception.
