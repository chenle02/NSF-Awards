9417137 PERRY This award is a renewal of an award to the National Academy of
Science to support the work of the National Research Council's Board on Global
Change (NRC/BGC). Most of this award ($459,060) provides funds to enable the
NRC/BGC and other NRC committees and boards to continue to provide assistance to
agencies participating with NSF in core functions of the NSTC Committee on
Environment and Natural Resources's Subcommittee on Global Change Research
(CENR/SGCR) in the development and evaluation of the U.S. Global Change Research
Program (US/GCRP). Through this additional funding, which was contributed by
agencies participating as members in the CENR/SGCR, the NRC/BGC and related NRC
boards and committees will continue to fulfill their responsibilities in the
following areas: 1. Provision of advice to the CEES/SGCR on the U.S. Global
Change Research Program (US/GCRP); 2. Provision of periodic reviews of the
US/GCRP; 3. Service as a liaison between the U.S. and other nations in
international planning efforts; and 4. Establishment and operation of special ad
hoc groups to address issues of special concern regarding the US/GCRP. In
addition to continuing these core activities, an additional $76,090 is made
available to NAS through interagency transfer of funds from NOAA and funds from
NSF to support a National Forum on Environment and Natural Resources R&amp;D
held in late March 1994 at the request of the White House Office of Science and
Technology Policy. Funds for these activities have been provided by NSF, the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, and the National Institute for Environmental Health
Statistics.
