9421592 Zeitler This award provides partial (67%) funding for the acquisition of
a laser microprobe system that will be shared as a sampling source between the
argon-argon dating and stable isotope laboratories in the Department of Earth
and Environmental Sciences at Lehigh University. The remaining aosts associated
with funding this equipment acquisition will be provided by Lehigh University.
Gas extraction by laser will add a number of substantial capabilities to these
earth science analytical facilities. Chief among them is the ability to sample
individual mineral grains or portions of grains with a spatial resolution of
several tens of micrometers, especially important in applications such as the
geochronology and geothermometry research at Lehigh University. ***
