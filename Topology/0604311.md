The research of the Principal Investigator (PI) in the last few years has been
centered mainly in Exotic Topology and its applications to Geometry. The (PI),
in collaboration with F.T. Farrell, use exotic elements in Topology (e.g. exotic
differentiable or PL structures, non-vanishing of the homotopy groups of the
space of pseudo-isotopies...etc) to produce results in Differential Geometry
(e.g Harmonic Maps, Ricci Flow, Space of Metrics). A priori, these results seem
difficult to obtain without the use of the existence of exotic topological
entities. This research sheds some light on the intricate fashion in which
Topology, Geometry and Analysis are interwoven.



Paragraph #2:

Topology studies properties of objects that are preserved under deformations.
Many strange and unexpected "exotic" topological entities were discovered in the
last 50 years. We use these exotic entities to show that certain well know
analytic deformations in geometry have limitations. These analytic deformations
are analogous to the one obtained using the Heat Equation, which rules the
distribution of heat on a body, from time zero (initial distribution) to
infinity (final equilibrium).
