This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate
the feasibility of using electronically steerable phased array antennas in
conjunction with commercially available low cost wireless transceivers. The
proposed research will demonstrate a low cost phased array that can be used with
a commercial wireless networking card. In the past, phased arrays were big and
expensive, but two critical developments have brought this technology into
economic reach today. The company have conceived a novel technique for
implementing ultra-low-cost phase shifters using PIN diodes and have also
devised a method of controlling the phased array antenna that does not require
radios specifically designed for this purpose. A prototype proof-of-concept
system (including phase shifters) will be fabricated and methods for steering
the antenna will be verified.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential impact of the
combination of low cost radios with economical phased arrays is enormous, in
that it could facilitate wireless broadband access in geographic areas where DSL
and cable modem service are impractical. Deployment of broadband wireless access
has been slow largely due to the cost of sending a truck with skilled personnel
to set up and steer high gain antennas. Wireless Internet Service Providers
(ISPs) report that the cost of installation often exceeds the cost of the
equipment itself. By simplifying the installation, the cost of deployment is
lowered dramatically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
