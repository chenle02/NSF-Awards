This three-year award will support the continuation of a U.S.-France
cooperative research project in atomic, molecular and optical physics between
Thomas Gallagher of the University of Virginia and Pierre Pillet of the Aime
Cotton Laboratory in Orsay, France. The objective of their research is to
investigate laser cooling and its application to collisional studies of
relatively dense samples of cold Rydberg atoms. They will study far infrared
superadiant masers and multibody collisional energy transfer. The proposed
experiments will be done with alkali atoms in laser cooled beams and in magneto-
optical traps. The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration his expertise
on collisions of Rydberg atoms. This is complemented by the French
investigator's expertise in laser cooling techniques and superadiance. The
project will advance our understanding of the effects of Rydberg atoms in light
scattering and collective light emission processes. This may eventually impact
on the fabrication of diode lasers.
