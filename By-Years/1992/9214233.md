The goal of this research is to create and evaluate a model of the process by
which people locate sounds in three dimensions. Emphasis will be placed on
explaining well established but still incompletely understood psycho-acoustical
phenomena. One example is our ability to locate sounds coming from above or
below, despite the fact that there are no binaural differences between the
sounds that reach the ears. Another example is our ability to locate sounds in
reverberant environments that contain multiple sound sources, where echoes and
reflections act as additional, virtual sources. A third example is our ability
to judge distance, since loudness alone is not an adequate cue. The model is
based on the physical effects of sound propagation, and on neurophysiological
studies that have traced the auditory cortex. It extends an existing
computational model of the cochlea by incorporating monaural and binaural,
temporally-based correlation methods to extract the information needed for
source localization. If successful, this work should significantly improve the
abilities of computers to recognize speech or other sounds as they occur in
everyday, multisource environments, thereby extending the range of effective
human-machine interaction.
