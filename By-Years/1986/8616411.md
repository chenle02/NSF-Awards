A detailed investigation of the biosynthetic pathway leading from glutamate to
delta-aminolevulinic acid, the earliest committed chlorophyll precursor in
plants will be carried out. The topic is of current interest with the recent
discovery of the involvement of a special chloroplast transfer RNA in this
process. Using the techniques of molecular biology, protein biochemistry and
enzymology, the genes for the enzymes and tRNAs involved in this process will be
cloned and characterization in order to investigate in detail the mechanism of
action and regulation of these molecules. The experimental systems will be the
cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, or barley. These
studies should uncover novel principles regarding the role of RNA as a cofactor
in metabolic conversions, and will be important to future programs in plant
molecular biology.
