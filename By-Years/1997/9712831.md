9712831 Lambros Modeling of interphase regions found both in nature (animal and
plant tissue and bone) and artificially manufactured materials (composite
fiber/matrix region) has been performed using the concept of Continuously
Nonhomogeneous Medium (CNM). The present project provides measurements for the
experimental validation of the CNM concept. Using full-field optical techniques,
stationary crack behavior in specific interphase regions containing CNMs is
investigated. The observed stress distributions and measured stress intensity
factors are compared with existing theoretical models. An analytical
investigation to determine the sensitivity of existing models to key
nonhomogeneity parameters is also conducted. Experimental and theoretical
investigation of quasi-static crack propagation in CNMs is also performed. ***
