The western South Atlantic circulation is strongly affected by rings and western
boundary currents. It has been surmised that the drift of the Confluence Zone is
in large part due to variations in the transports of the upstream currents
approaching the confluence from the north and south (i.e., the Brazil and
Malvinas currents). The project investigates the influence that Agulhas rings
may have on the Brazil Current variability. Although Agulhas rings lose much of
their strength and energy as they cross the entire South Atlantic, they are so
large and energetic to begin with that they are still very important to the
energy balance when they reach the Brazil Current and blend into it. The
absorption of Agulhas rings upstream by the Brazil Current is a nonlinear
process and the main goal is to determine the influence of Agulhas rings on the
temporal variation of the Brazil Current using a combination of analytical
models and process-oriented numerical
simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: New observations using
satellite data vividly illustrate the importance of the above eddy-current
interaction problem. The problem received limited attention in the past
primarily because it is a very difficult nonlinear problem. Dr. Nof's previous
work on the very same subject has shown that it is not a simple matter to
determine whether the rings would strengthen or weaken the Brazil Current. He
and collaborators have now developed analytical and numerical techniques, which
should, for the first time, enable us to give the answer to the above
question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The study would benefit society
by (i) the education of a new Ph.D., and (ii) providing a continuous series of
lectures and demonstrations to unprivileged kids at the Florida Sheriffs Youth
Branch in Live Oak.
