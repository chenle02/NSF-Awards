Tactile displays are being used frequently as a sensory substitution device for
the blind to present alpha-numeric information. This research will investigate
the use of interactive, computer-generated, tactile display of graphic
information. The project will use a full page tactile display unit developed by
the American Foundation for the Blind or another developed by Chiyoda
Photoembosser. A useable graphic display device for the blind offers
possibilities such as display of economic data in business or tactile maps so
that a blind person can locate him/herself in a strange environment.
