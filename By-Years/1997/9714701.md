Motivated by the challenges of designing multi-user software systems and by the
prospect of ubiquitous electronic commerce, the goal of this research project is
to develop the theoretical foundations for reasoning about utilities in a multi-
agent setting, and use these foundations to construct methods with which to
reason effectively about other agents' preferences and motivations. The approach
draws on developments in AI as well as in economics. Specifically, the project
defines a notion of utility distribution that plays a role analogous to that of
a probability distribution, and the notion of a utility network that allows one
to reason about utilities the way Bayesian networks allow one to reason about
probabilities. Beyond this, the project is investigating hybrid networks, which
allow simultaneous reasoning about probabilities and utilities. The results of
this project will provide a firm theoretical framework in which to reason about
beliefs and preferences in multi-agent systems, with potential applications in
software design and electronic commerce.
