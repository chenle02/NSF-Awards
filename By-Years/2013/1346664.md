In this EAGER project, the Exploratorium, working with an industry partner,
Qualcomm, seeks to engage in foundational research and development on an indoor
positioning system (IPS) and associated applications (audio and database) in
order to improve museums experiences for visitors as well as to improve the
capacity of museums to study learning within museums.

Specifically, the project asks: How can museums appropriately track visitors
within indoor venues in order to understand and improve their STEM learning
experience? To date, there are not industry standards in terms of a hardware
approach (WiFi, video, etc.) or software standards. Part of the impetus for this
project is to establish learning as a focus of tracking capacity, and not merely
as a secondary component of marketing-focused technologies.

The project will design, develop, and test: (1) a whole-museum IPS at three
levels of resolution: gallery, exhibit cluster, and exhibit. (2) methods for
creating and updating indoor maps at each resolution level . (3) a current
software app for delivering museum experiences as well as potential research use
(4) a prototype for a research data management system, including obtaining
visitor consent for participation and validating IPS tracking compared to human
tracking techniques.

Project dissemination will: (1) develop and distribute a case study, along with
lessons learned and potentially best practices, on websites and through
practitioner and museum IT related conferences. (2)share the open source
prototypes distributed through common websites.

The intended impacts of this project are prototyping and testing the ability of
indoor, informal learning institutions to conduct research with large data sets
that were previously impractical. Potential analyses, using analytic and
visualization techniques, include: overall patterns of visitation (holding
times, crowdedness, tracks), temporal and sequential patterns, visualizing
exhibit engagements, exhibit usage, group dynamics, and how exhibits facilitate
social experiences relative to others.
