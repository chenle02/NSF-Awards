This MCCP renewal aims at the incorporation of organic and organometallic
molecules and polymer fragments in inorganic glass matrices synthesized by the
sol-gel method at low temperatures. The main research goals include the use of
the incorporated molecules as optical probes to characterize chemical changes
which occur during sol-gel processing; synthesizing novel materials based on
organic doping of inorganic solids; preparing and optimizing materials and
optical data storage media. This work is part of the Materials Chemistry and
Chemical Processing Initiative, and it is jointly funded by the Chemistry
Division and the Division of Materials Research.
