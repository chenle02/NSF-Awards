Molecular genetics will be used to investigate how complex biological structures
are constructed in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. The development of
Drosophila proceeds via a hierarchy of gene expression which, in its early
stages, generates segmented embryo. Following segmentation, each metamere
develops a particular identity due to the action of the homeotic selector genes.
The products of these genes all contain the DNA-binding homeodomain and probably
function by transcriptionally regulating a set of target genes. To understand
how homeotic selector genes specify particular metameric identities it is
important to isolate and study these target genes. They will be isolated by
using a subtractive hybridization procedure designed to identify differences in
gene expression between animals that overexpress a particular homeotic selector
gene (Ultrabithorax, Ubx) and animals that underexpress this gene. Once
isolated, we will rank our interest in these genes by answering the following
questions: Do their patterns of expression correlate with Ubx expression in wild
type animals? Do their patterns of expression change in animals mutant for
homeotic selector genes (including, but not limited to, Ubx mutations)? And, do
any of these genes map to positions in the genome where Ubx proteins bind or to
where known homeotic loci are located? We will focus on those genes that fulfill
most of these criteria. They will be further characterized both molecularly and
genetically to determine how they function during development to generate
metameric identities.***//
