DMS-0105389 Ronald J. Stern

This award provides partial support for graduate students, postdoctoral
researchers, junior faculty, and principal speakers to attend the "Symplectic
Geometry and Lefschetz pencils" conference to be held April 12-16, 2001 on the
campus of the University of California at Irvine. This conference will bring
together researchers to discuss and present new advances in the study of
symplectic Lefschetz theory and symplectic 4-manifolds . The discovery of
Donaldson that every symplectic 4-manifold supports a symplectic Lefschetz
pencil and the discovery of Auroux and Katzarkov that every symplectic
4-manifold is a finite ramified covering of the complex projective plane
presents the possibility to classify four-dimensional symplectic manifolds using
mapping class group data and methods from algebraic geometry. This conference
will provide an opportunity to summarize, centralize and disseminate results in
this new direction of mathematical research and will provide the opportunity for
new PHD's and graduate students in algebraic and differential geometry/topology
and theoretical physics to learn from the leaders of this emerging field.
