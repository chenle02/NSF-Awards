The goal of this proposal will be to provide data to firmly establish a model
for the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) detectable site of the multimetal
enzyme cytochrome c oxidase. Comparison between the EPR data at six microwave
frequencies for the copper site of nitrous oxide reductase and the EPR
detectable copper in cytochrome c oxidase will be used to unravel the EPR data.
Derivatives of cytochrome c oxidase and nitrous oxide reductase, for which the
ratio of copper per subunit or the ratio of copper to iron vary, will be
compared with the native forms of both enzymes to determine an optimum
functional unit. Second derivative spectra will provide resolution of at least
nine lines for the EPR detectable site in cytochrome c oxidase. Computer
simulations from data at six different microwave frequencies will be used to
obtain EPR parameters. EPR parameters and saturation recovery data will be used
to identify low lying energy states in order to understand the primary electron
transfer pathway.
