The purpose of this project is t attract young scientists to Earth Sciences
research in the high latitudes through attendance at a series of summer schools
and participation in field projects, thus promoting further collaborations and
networking. The goal will be accomplished through a suite of four summer schools
for groups of about 15-20 graduate students, as well as development of online
course materials. Each course will consist of a classroom component and, more
importantly, field experiences, hands-on activities/mini-projects, and
presentations designed for communication to a broader general audience.
Systematic pre- and post- surveys will provide metrics of summer school success.
