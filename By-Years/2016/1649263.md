STEM Continua Using Socio-environmental Systems In and Out of Neighborhoods
(DISCUSSION)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collaborative Proposal ID:
16-49255&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Caesar Jackson&lt;br/&gt;Institution:
North Carolina Central University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaboration
between two Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) will form a
networked improvement community located within the Piedmont Region of North
Carolina. In close partnership with community colleges and civic organizations,
the project will reach families and students that lead to broader participation
of underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics
(STEM) fields. The overall goal is to build and sustain a scalable, inquiry-
based network with the purpose of increasing the academic success of
underrepresented ethnic minorities and women in the STEM continuum. By engaging
in culturally relevant socio-environmental frameworks, project outcomes will
positively impact student retention, knowledge, and quantitative skills in STEM
across socio-economic divides and STEM disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Launch Pilot phase will focus on evidence-based teaching and learning approaches
for middle school students. The core structure of the network will serve as a
platform to launch and guide other age- and level-specific educational
instruction, research, and assessment initiatives. Student understanding of the
nature of science will be enhanced by adapting structure, behavior, and function
(SBF) theory and system thinking hierarchical (STH) models. Ultimately, the
network will represent a driver for social innovation that positively impacts
broadening participation in STEM.
