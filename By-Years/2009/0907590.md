Tech&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Self Assembled Polymer Scaffolds for Liver
Mimics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT: This proposal describes the
development of liver-mimetic cellular architectures using self-assembled
polymeric scaffolds. There is currently no generally applicable methodology to
layer liver cells in vitro. Although two dimensional (2D) cell cultures and co-
cultures are used extensively as model systems, they do not recapitulate key
spatial, geometric, and physiological characteristics of cellular architectures
found in vivo. The specific features of this proposal are the design of
detachable polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) films, the ability to incorporate
cell-adhesive ligands such as galactose, tuning the physical properties of the
scaffold, and the design of nanoporous detachable polyelectrolyte multilayer
films. The specific objectives of the proposal are: (1) Design detachable
chitosan/hyaluronan PEM films and demonstrate the feasibility of using them to
assemble highly functional 3D liver-mimetic cellular architectures. (2) Tune PEM
scaffold film properties to control cell growth and function. (3) Design and
assemble nanoporous PEM scaffolds with tunable porosity for efficient transport
of nutrients and metabolites. Such liver-mimetic tissues can serve as an
accurate model for applications in bioreactor devices, understanding disease
pathogenesis, toxicity evaluations, and in the testing of pharmaceuticals and
drugs. The detachable PEM-scaffold can be modified, both chemically, and
physically to incorporate a diverse range of cell types.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS: Hepatocyte tissue culture has challenged
the regenerative medicine field for some time. This proposal holds promise for
facilitating a range of investigations of liver pathogenesis, toxicity, and,
ultimately, liver-like bioreactor devices. The PI and Co-PI are both active
participants in outreach and educational initiatives on the Virginia Tech
campus. The PI will continue to participate in the VT STARS program, a 3-year
residential program focusing on low-income, under-represented youth from South
West Virginia, and she has just completed a term as Chair of the AIChE Women's
Initiative Committee. The proposal also details her outreach to female middle
and high school students designed to acquaint them with career opportunities in
science and engineering. The Co-PI is a long time participant in the VT Summer
Undergraduate Research Program supported by NSF REU and IGERT awards. Continued
commitment to these and other educational initiatives can be
anticipated.&lt;br/&gt;
