Research into the development of inelastic constitutive models has recently
attracted a high degree of interest. This research has been made possible by the
development of improved computational facilities for model formulation and more
sophisticated computer-controlled testing systems for model verification. An IBM
4341 Group II CAD/CAM system valued in excess of $2 million has been acquired;
however, evaluation and verification of modern constitutive theories require
multiaxial computer-controlled testing systems. Additional equipment will be
purchased, including a computer-controlled, axial-torsion, servohydraulic
materials testing system. This system is capable of applying tensile,
compressive, bending or torsional loads under static or dynamic conditions,
including constant amplitude fatigue and random and programmed loadings. Such
capabilities are extremely important in the development and verification of
modern constitutive theories.
