It is the purpose of this project to measure the optical clarity of the
Antarctic polar ice at depths of 300 meters and 1 kilometer. If the ice is
sufficiently transparent, then a new proposal will be prepared to attempt to use
the ice as a Cherenkov detector for measuring very energetic neutrinos and gamma
rays from astrophysical sources.
