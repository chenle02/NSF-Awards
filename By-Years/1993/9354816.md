9354816 Riedel This proposal requests support for the development of an
innovative, interdisciplinary course called GATEWAY TO ENGINEERING. The course
is designed to introduce first-year engineering students to their chosen field
in a creative and exciting way. The course will be developed by an
interdisciplinary group of 10 engineering faculty, and will be taught by these
faculty to pilot groups of first-year students. Integral to the design of the
course is an ongoing assessment of its success in achieving its objectives.
These objectives include: encouraging students to form a supportive academic
community, improving study skills and survival tactics of first-year students,
nurturing creativity in design, providing a foundation in engineering science in
several areas, involving each student in hands-on laboratory experiences,
providing several opportunities for students to design, providing connections
between engineering faculty and first-year students, introducing students to the
engineering profession in a variety of ways, improving the retention rate of
engineering students from the first to the second year, and ensuring that each
student makes the choice of engineering on the basis of reliable information and
experience. GATEWAY TO ENGINEERING targets a pilot group of first-year
engineering students; it involves an interdisciplinary team of engineering
faculty; it provides significant engineering science content, hands-on
laboratory experience and design opportunities for each student; it enables
students to join the engineering academic community by coming to know their
peers, their teachers, and some upper division students in engineering; it
combines the results of previously-successful first-year programs with
innovative pedagogical techniques in a new and creative way; and it gives the
first-year students a clear understanding of both the study and the practice of
engineering.
