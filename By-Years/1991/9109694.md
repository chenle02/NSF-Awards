This is a Career Advancement Award to support Dr. Benyajati's attempts to
establish primary cell cultures of reptilian renal epithelium. Successful
establishment of such a cell culture system would be a major step forward in the
study of reptilian kidney physiology. Dr. Benyajati's longer-term goal is to use
these cultures to study the regulation of taurine uptake and secretion in snake
kidney. If successful, the establishment of snake kidney cell cultures are
anticipated to significantly enhance Dr. Benyajati's career.
