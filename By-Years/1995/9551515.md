This project funds a multidisciplinary, multimedia, computer laboratory that is
used for instruction by the Departments of Chemistry and Biological Sciences and
the Science Education Program. Many notions in these disciplines, including
those that involve the three-dimensional structure of molecules and energy
minimizations, do not lend themselves to traditional lab approaches and are
better investigated through the use of computer graphics and modeling. This
project addresses 5 areas of curricular development: (1) the introduction of
computer graphics and molecular modeling into the curricula, (2) the use of
commercial and instructor-designed software for teaching difficult concepts and
for performing computer-simulated experiments, (3) the development and
introduction of pre- and post-laboratory critical thinking exercises, (4) the
introduction of information retrieval technology to majors and to preservice and
in-service science teachers, and (5) the introduction of preservice and in-
service science teachers to the use of multimedia in the classroom. The new
computer facility also provides faculty and student access to shareware
graphics, tutorials, and databases through the Internet.
