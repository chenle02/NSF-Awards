We are rapidly moving into a new age of widely-deployed, inexpensive, Internet-
enabled mobile computing and communication devices. This has the potential to
give rise to a whole new generation of services, applications, and modes of
behavior to benefit society based on openness in ubiquitous wireless and mobile
computing. But this requires re-thinking the computing and communication
infrastructure--from the servers in the computing cloud, to the desktop, to the
individual handheld devices, to the network that interconnects them all. This
Expedition aims to promote innovation and competition by breaking down barriers
and constructing bridges for enabling the creation of a truly programmable and
open mobile internet (POMI). Expanding on the ubiquitous computing model in
which users have unencumbered access to distributed computational and storage
resources, this timely experimental systems Expedition will create a virtual
data system to enable users to take ownership of their data; a three-tiered
computational infrastructure to ease the entry of new web services; an open
network to promote network innovation and make wireless capacity available
across heterogeneous and abundant radio networks within a vicinity; and open-
source software to promote existing efforts in opening the cell phone and other
such handhelds. An at-scale prototype system of infrastructure, devices and
applications will be deployed across the Stanford campus--perhaps the most
comprehensive experimental deployment of mobile technology for research ever
performed by a university. Outreach includes the development and distribution of
POMI kits to students at small and underrepresented universities, K-12 schools,
and undergraduates at Stanford to engage in creative and inspired discovery
through mobile-based education and exploration.
