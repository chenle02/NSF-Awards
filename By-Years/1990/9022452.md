This award provides partial support for a workshop in which university,
industry, and Federal government researchers will identify and assess the
research needs for automated mobile robotic platforms with material handling
capabilities. DARPA is sharing in the funding of the workshop, which is expected
to produce recommendations for a common set of specifications and features for
such mobile platforms suitable for a variety of research in vehicle navigation,
noncontact sensors such as vision systems, contact position and force sensing,
processing of sensory information for guiding mobility and manipulation of
multiple manipulators and multiple sensors, and multi-modal systems integration.
