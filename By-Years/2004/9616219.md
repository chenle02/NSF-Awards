ABSTRACT Proposal Number: CTS- 9616219 Principal Investigator: Moser This is a
grant to initiate a focused project to develop reliable LES methods, with well
defined bounds on their accuracy, that can be used in complex fluid dynamic
applications. Several fundamental questions regarding the detailed derivation of
the LES equations, the definition of optimal filters, and the development of
subgrid models will be addressed. The work will focus on the challenges that
need to be met in the treatment of near-wall regions and embedded small-scale
laminar sub-regions that have hindered the wide spread applicability of LES in
complex problems of practical interest. The outstanding issues of LES will be
addressed using a new LES formalism based on the fact that without knowledge of
the small scales, the large scale evolution is essentially stochastic. The
formalism provides a technique to precisely measure the predictability of the
evolution of the large scales, and the performance of any particular LES model.
Furthermore, interpretation of LES in the light of dynamical systems theory,
suggests that past time information can greatly increase the predictability of
the large scales. It is expected that this research will lead to several
advances in the practice of LES. The necessary data for this research will be
obtained from direct numerical simulation (DNS) and/or particle image
velocimetry (PIV) measurements in experiments. These techniques will be applied
to three specific test flows: plane channel, cylinder in cross flow, and a
sudden expansion. Both DNS and PIV are necessary because higher Reynolds numbers
are accessible through PIV experiments and more detailed three-dimensional data
are available from DNS. The three test flows were selected because they are the
simplest flows that exhibit features that have caused difficulties in LES. The
optimizations performed and the models developed in the context of these flows
will be applicable to LES in a wide variety of flows. The work will be jointly
sponsored by NSF and the AFOSR.
