This award to a cultural anthropologist and an ecologist at the University of
Southern California will support their research on a complex irrigation system
in Bali. In a previous project the PIs developed a computer simulation model of
the irrigation system in a broad area, and analyzed the role of religious
priests in managing the flow of water so as to coordinate the activities of
different sub-regions to limit pest damage and stimulate increased rice
production. The model called for a vast amount of precise data about the actual
flows of water, rainfall, crop production and other variables, and this award
will allow the PIs to return to Bali to work with local water engineers and
personnel to set up a large program of data gathering. The end result will be a
more precise test and specification of the model, which should allow local
experts to manage the system better. This research is important because it shows
the role of native religious specialists in economic production, and will help
develop analytical systems to increase our understanding of the function of
regional irrigation systems in traditional societies. Any increase in
understanding of how such food production systems work, especially when they are
so different from our own (i.e., involving religious experts), can potentially
help alleviate the world food problem.
