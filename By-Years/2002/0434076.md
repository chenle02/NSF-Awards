This project provides an opportunity for the sharing of best practices and
identification of science education research questions focused on the theme of
Teacher Research Experiences (TRE). Participants would include TRE PIs, teachers
from TRE projects, scientists who mentored teachers in their research
experiences, TRE project evaluators and project directors and other professional
educators. All have an interest in understanding these projects and how transfer
to the classroom of content, skills and best instructional practices can be
achieved. Identification of educational research questions to guide future
professional development activites of this nature and help inform how to measure
their effectiveness will be of interest to science education researchers. The
results of any such studies may have very broad impact due to the ubiquitous
nature of TRE professional development projects supported by many diverse
agencies. The format would be a three-day symposium at the University of Rhode
Island Graduate School of Oceanography hosted by the PI and Co-PI of Project
ARMADA, an NSF/ESIE TRE project at that university.
