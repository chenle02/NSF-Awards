The objective of this project is to develop an effective and innovative almost
on-line damage detection technique, based on the finite-element formulation and
its condensation for large complex structures. Emphasis will be placed on the
damage detection of nonlinear civil structures, including nonlinear hysteretic
RC frames and base-isolated structures. The research will significantly advance
the current state-of-the-technology in structural health monitoring and make
practical applications for the local damage detection of complex structures a
reality. The developed finite-element based methodology will have the following
capabilities being: (1) capable of tracking the local structural damages using
only a limited number of acceleration sensors, (2) capable of detecting local
damages at element level, and (3) applicable to the health monitoring of complex
nonlinear RC structures. In addition to the theoretical/numerical development,
experimental tests on small-scale and large-scale linear and nonlinear
structures, including large-scale hysteretic RC frames and scaled rubber-bearing
isolated building model, will be conducted to verify the proposed damage
detection technique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a collaborative research among
the University of California at Irvine (UCI), the Nangjing University of
Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA), and the National Center for Research on
Earthquake Engineering (NCREE), Taiwan.&lt;br/&gt;
