Similar molecular strategies are used in stimulus/response coupling in all
cells. The process generally involves transmembrane receptors located at the
cell surface and a set of intracellular signal transduction proteins that carry
information from the receptors to the target proteins that mediate the specific
responses. Bacterial chemotaxis is an ideal model system for investigating the
molecular mechanism of receptor-mediated signal transduction. The system is
composed of a small number of components; a family of transmembrane receptor
proteins, two receptor modifying enzymes, the flagellar motor apparatus, and
four cytoplasmic signal transduction proteins that process information linking
receptor signaling to the motor response. The central signal transduction
mechanism in chemotaxis involves phosphotransfer from a histidine protein
kinase, CheA, to a phosphorylation-activated regulator protein that controls the
direction of flagellar rotation, CheY. Autophosphorylation of the kinase, CheA,
is regulated by the receptors in a mechanism that requires the auxiliary
protein, CheW, and is dependent on both the degree of receptor ligand occupancy,
and on the modification state of the receptor. The system provides an
opportunity for elucidating the fundamental principles of protein modification
reactions and protein/protein interactions in regulatory biochemistry. %%% A
molecular description of signal transduction in the model system of bacterial
chemotaxis is critical to understanding the fundamental chemical strategies for
complex regulatory phenomena such as signal amplification and adaptation. Dr.
Stock's laboratory is using a combination of molecular genetic, biochemical, and
biophysical methods to correlate structure and function of several signal
transduction proteins.
