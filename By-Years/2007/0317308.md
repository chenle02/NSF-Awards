This award supports a research program on the nonlinear interaction of dense
plasmas with magnetic fields. The research will be done in a large laboratory
plasma in a rarely explored parameter regime where only the electrons interact
with the magnetic field, but not the ions, while both species are coupled via
space-charge electric fields. The interplay between two different fluids with
time-varying electromagnetic fields leads to a variety of unexplored nonlinear
effects. This parameter regime is called electron magnetohydrodynamics. Its
nonlinear effects may lead to magnetic turbulence which is of intrinsic interest
and considered important in magnetic reconnection.
