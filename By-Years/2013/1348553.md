Aggression takes a tremendous toll on society, and it is vital to learn how
people may withhold their aggressive impulses. Unfortunately, people seem to
have fewer and less effective techniques for controlling aggression than for
controlling other emotional impulses. A key problem is that popular strategies
for reducing aggression tend to be least effective in the heat of the moment,
when tempers can flare. The proposed research introduces a new motivational
approach that circumvents this problem. This work will contribute towards the
development of more efficient methods for reducing aggression. This is
critically important, as aggression reduction is instrumental in preventing
countless acts of violence, ranging from domestic violence to aggravated assault
and homicide.

The proposed research will target aggressive impulses directly. Prior research
has shown that aggressive impulses are characterized by a strong drive towards
approach actions, for instance, to blurt out an insulting remark or to hit
someone. By blocking this motivation towards approach actions, it may be
possible to lower people's impulse to aggress. The proposed research will
systematically investigate these motivational influences, and will test whether
experimentally manipulating avoidance (versus approach) motivation can reduce
the impact of factors that are known to increase aggression, including alcohol,
the male sex hormone testosterone, and exposure to media violence. In addition,
the proposed research will develop a training program that is geared towards
reducing the motivation to aggress. It is expected that lowering approach
motivation will particularly reduce aggression among angry individuals who are
driven by their impulses and, thus, otherwise most likely to aggress.
