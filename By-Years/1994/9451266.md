9451266 Meints Macintosh LC III computers interfaced with the LabWorks data
acquisition and analysis system and various sensors will be used to computerize
the introductory chemistry and physics laboratories. The implementation plan
will affect students in all introductory chemistry and physics courses for both
science majors and nonscience majors. The integrated package of computer, menu
driven data collection interface, spreadsheet program, and graphing program will
allow students to design their own experiments rather than following the often
"canned" procedures of the past. The emphasis will be placed on the experiment
and the interpretation of data rather than on tedious data collection and
calculation allowing students to discover for themselves what relationships
exist between variables. Over a five year period more than 500 students will
pass through these courses gaining a better understanding of the process of
science and how scientists actually work in modern laboratories. Having the same
system for both chemistry and physics will allow students to use the experience
gained in their first science experience in future courses. This early
experience with computerized data acquisition and analysis will prepare students
for the more computer intensive upper division courses which use computer
controlled UV-Vis, FTIR, and GCMS instruments and a CAChe molecular modeling
system.
