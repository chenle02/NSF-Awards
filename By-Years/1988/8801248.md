The principal investigator plans to work on problems in mathematical analysis
concerning the representation theory of (semisimple) Lie groups. A suitable
example of the latter is the group of rotations of a sphere. Groups like this
are important because they occur in many areas of mathematics (e.g. geometry,
differential equations, algebraic number theory, mathematical physics) as groups
of symmetries. Representation theory allows one to take advantage of symmetries
in solving problems. More specifically, this project will study representations
that come from spaces of automorphic forms (invariant analytic functions) on the
quotient of the group modulo a discrete subgroup. The aim is to obtain explicit
formulas for the multiplicities of known irreducible representations in these
automorphic representations, based on algebraic properties of the discrete group
and information about how it sits in the ambient Lie group.
