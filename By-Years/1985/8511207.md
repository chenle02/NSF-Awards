This research project is concerned with the drainage and stability of thin films
which could be associated with unstable foams. The role of surface viscosity in
coalescence at liquid-gas interfaces is investigated using single bubbles. The
premise of previous work is that the same factors influence both the coalescence
of single bubbles or drops at phase interfaces and the displacement of an
unstable foam in a porous medium. This research project focuses on studying,
both theoretically and experimentally, the problem of the coalescence of single
bubbles or drops. A more detailed theory that will include the effects of any
electrostatic double-layer forces is currently being developed. Using these
theories as a basis, a systematic experimental study of the effects of the
surface viscosities upon the coalescence times of single bubbles at liquid-gas
interfaces is initiated. This includes complementary measurements of the two
surface viscosities.
