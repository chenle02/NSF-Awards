9451763 Chelberg This project is intended to improve the laboratory experience
for Augsburg College biology majors in the study of cell biology. Students will
gain an appreciation of the relationships between intact cells, functioning cell
organelles, and their components through investigations designed to improve both
their thinking skills and their laboratory skills. Effects of the project will
be felt in lab exercises and student projects in introductory and advanced cell
biology courses and in independent student research. A rapid cycling
ultracentrifuge, a multipurpose preparative centrifuge, electrophoretic
equipment and a refrigerated water bath will be used for separation and analysis
of subcellular components. For colorimetric and spectrophotometric analysis of
mitochondrial function, vacuolar proton pumping, nucleic acid and protein
determinations and a variety of related procedures we propose to acquire six
student grade spectrophotometers and a versatile high quality spectrophotometer
with plotting and analytical capability. Students will use a very sensitive pH
meter and a "cool" high intensity light source to monitor pH changes as isolated
chloroplasts pump protons in the light reactions of photosynthesis. All our
planned improvements are designed to give our students experience in framing
questions in cell biology and then learning how these may, and may not, be
answered with modern analytical tools.
