Research will be done on a wide range of topics in condensed matter theory,
including particularly the physics of flexible polymerized membranes, vortex
entanglement in the new high- transition-temperature superconductors,
fluctuations and phase transitions in liquid crystals, electron systems in very
strong magnetic fields, electrons in a semiconductor heterostructure with a
parabolic composition profile, low-temperature behavior of quantum
antiferromagnets, electronic and structural properties of semiconductor surfaces
and interfaces, anharmonic coupling constants of phonons, the microscopic
calculations of structural and electronic properties of solids, long-wavelength
phenomena near a second-order incommensurate transition, dynamic properties of
fluid-solid mixtures, quasicrystals, and interacting Kondo- type impurities.
