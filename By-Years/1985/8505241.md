Network scheduling techniques--such as the arrow diagramming Critical Path
Method (CPM), Precedence Diagramming CPM, and the Performance Evaluation and
Review Technique (PERT)--were developed extensively for the defense industry for
control of their large government contracts. These methods have gradually been
adopted by a segment of the construction industry, but they do not fulfill the
criteria which a good scheduling system should meet. The objectives of this
research include the development of a modeling approach that depicts the hard
logic and alternative logic for project activities and the development of
optimization functions for the scheduling model to minimize project cost at
various levels of probability in achieving the scheduled completion date. In
addition, a system as envisioned would require a unique database which currently
does not exist. An objective includes the development of a specification for
this database and methodology for database support.
