The Oregon Museum of Science and Industry will initiate a six-week, residential
Young Scholars project in high desert research, paleontology/geology, or aquatic
ecology/fisheries for 33 students entering grades 10-12. This summer program
will emphasize research participation in the study of Jurassic environments and
fossil beds, river water sheds, or high desert ecology. Students will be engaged
in field site research in one of the three disciplines for much of the project's
duration.
