This proposal requests support for an international conference on seismogenic
zone studies that are being done under the auspices of the NSF MARGINS program.
The last workshop on this topic was held in 1997. Since that time a number of
studies have been conducted that have developed new and important information on
the factors that influence the distribution, timing, magnitude, and mechanisms
for earthquakes. The purpose of the workshop will be to foster exchange of
information and results between researchers and students and provide a venue for
developing plans for cross-disciplinary work in the future.
