The grantee will conduct three workshops to examine data needs and criteria for
identification of scientific personnel in three principal areas: the physical
sciences, including mathematics and computer sciences; the life sciences; and
the social and behavioral sciences. These workshops will lay the groundwork for
the survey data collecting activities on scientific personnel during the decade
of the 1990's by the National Science Foundation. The workshops, comprised of
representatives from the professional societies, industry, academe and
government, are essential to identifying important data issues and requirements
for the inclusion of personnel in existing as well as newly-emerging scientific
fields. Information on the Nation's scientists and engineers (S/E's) is
developed by the National Science Foundation through its Scientific and
Technical Personnel Data System (STPDS). This System provides numbers as well as
demographic, educational, employment, and geographic characteristics of U.S.
scientists and engineers. These data are collected by three major NSF biennial
surveys: the Survey of Doctorate Recipients; the National Survey of Natural and
Social Scientists and Engineers; and the Survey of Recent Science and
Engineering Graduates.
