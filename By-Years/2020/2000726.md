Algebraic geometry is a subject studying algebraic varieties, which are spaces
described by solutions of polynomial equations. This subject started with the
work of the ancient Greeks about ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas, and now it
has grown to be a modern subject sharing many rich connections with physics and
computer science. The research supported by this NSF award will focus on an
important class of algebraic varieties, called the holomorphic symplectic
varieties, that lie at the crossroads of geometry, representation theory, and
mathematical physics. A better understanding of these varieties will bring deep
insights in both algebraic geometry and its related
fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the PI will build connections
between compact and noncompact holomorphic symplectic varieties with a focus on
the P=W conjecture, which is a central conjecture connecting Hitchin's
integrable systems and Hodge theory. Compact holomorphic symplectic varieties,
which are higher dimensional generalizations of K3 surfaces, have been studied
intensively for decades. A systematic way to compare compact and noncompact
geometries, and to introduce new techniques to Hitchin systems from compact
holomorphic symplectic varieties will bring fresh perspectives and fruitful
outcomes to the P=W conjecture and related questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
