This 1 Tesla SQUID magnotemeter will be applied to the measurement of magnetic
susceptibilities and electrical resistivities in a magnetic field on materials
fabricated at Michigan State University. Low magnetic field and a.c.
magnetization measurements, will become possible, and it will also be possible
to install a light pipe for magnetophotolysis studies. This new instrument will
permit higher sensitivity measurements of susceptibilities and resistivities
from 2 Kelvins to above room temperature. It will be shared equally among
physicists and chemists, and will provide training for graduate and
undergraduate students.
