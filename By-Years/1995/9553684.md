To provide employees skilled in metrology and ISO 9001 to the engineering,
manufacturing, and service/installation industries. To achieve this goal, a
collaboration will be established between the Machine Tool Program at Madison
Area Technical College, the suppliers and users of precision measuring, the
University of WI Center for Quality and Productivity Improvement, the Madison
Metropolitan School District, and the WI School-To-Work Initiatives; and also
articulation of participation from other secondary and postsecondary educational
institutions and professional organizations. This proposal is to be a well-
coordinated, highly integrated effort to: 1) Develop and disseminate curriculum
materials specifically designed for technical training at the two-year associate
degree level; 2) Provide teacher enhancement activities in advanced dimensional
metrology and ISO 9001 that include summer institutes, mentoring and curriculum
development partnerships for associate degree and secondary level school
teachers; and 3) Support the development and coordination of industry-led
statewide programs to offer work-based experiences for high school students; and
4) Assemble a mobile metrology laboratory to provide student education, teacher
enhancement, and calibration of precision measuring tools. The proposed program
will link together the development of instructional materials with faculty
enhancement, student laboratory experience and school-to-work initiatives.
