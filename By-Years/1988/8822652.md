This award provides infrastructure support for ten research projects, with the
primary research areas being parallel and distributed processing, and
programming languages. Other significant research areas are fault-tolerant
programming, algorithms and software for molecular genetics, graphical user
interfaces for scientific visualization, and object-oriented and deductive
database systems. Specific research projects in the general area of parallel and
distributed processing include: 1. development of tools to aid in designing and
developing algorithms for parallel and distributed systems, with emphasis on
high- level tools for relatively naive users, 2. research on language mechanisms
and implementation techniques to facilitate programming computations that
execute efficiently on shared-memory multiprocessors, 3. development of
techniques for compiling concurrent programs written using shared variables into
programs that execute on multicomputers or on multiprocessors with non-uniform
memory access time, 4. research on a configurable operating system kernel,
called the x-kernel, in which communication protocols define the fundamental
building block, and 5. development of analytic methods for evaluating
performance of parallel asynchronous algorithms and applying the methods to the
analysis of particular parallel algorithms running on various multiprocessor
architectures. The research on programming languages includes: 1. development of
the Icon programming language, a high-level language with facilities for
processing nonnumeric data, and 2. development of effective compilation
techniques for logic programming languages. Equipment to be obtained for the
research includes a Hypercube upgrade, a shared memory multiprocessor, high-end
graphic workstations, and optical disks.
