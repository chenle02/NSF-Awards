The research will address three types of wrinkling problems in sheet metal
forming: (1) wrinkling of metal sheets in finite stretching and unequal edge
constraints; (2) wrinkling of unevenly stretched metal sheets; and (3) wrinkling
of partially stretched metal sheets. Each of these three problems can be divided
into two parts: prewrinkling finite deformation and bifurcation analysis. By
taking a unified approach to the problem of wrinkling, a scientific approach to
preventing wrinkling during forming will be developed.
