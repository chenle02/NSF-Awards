MCB-9724910 Green Lay Abstract Our knowledge of plant cell Biology has grown
tremendously over the past several years, particularly in the areas of protein
trafficking, cell signalling, and cell division. In protein trafficking, several
components of the molecular machinery that targets proteins to specific sites in
the cell have been identified and cloned. The study of plant signalling has
revealed steps, signals and intermediates that are novel to plant cells or of
broad significance to both plants and animals. Perhaps the most exciting
advances are from studies of plant cell development because these studies have
brought together several previously independent directions of research. This
Keystone Symposium entitled Plant Cell Biology will highlight the most recent
progress on signalling and trafficking pathways in plant cells. Emphasis will be
placed on integrating these studies with those on cell division, cell death,
morphogenesis and other aspects of plant development to elucidate the intricate
relationships among them.
