A three-dimensional coordinate measurement system and associated hardware will
be acquired to be used for measurements--including modal analysis, force
sensing, directed-light end-effector coordinate measurement--to enable semi-
automatic determination of geometrical, deflection, mass, and control parameters
for several distinct robotic systems. Based on these results, a generic
technology for metrology of such systems will be formulated and demonstrated.
