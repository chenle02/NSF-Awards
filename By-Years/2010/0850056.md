Statistics show significant inequalities in the U.S. food labor sector and that
these inequalities are patterned along lines of gender, race, and class.
However, we know little about the meaning behind these statistics, such as the
mechanisms through which these patterns of inequality are reproduced, how social
disparities are experienced, and how the social categories of class, race and
gender interact to produce inequity. This research will address these questions
and contribute to the discovery of leverage points for change in systems of
inequality in the U.S. food system.

Our methods include individual interviews and group conversations with men and
women employed in the food industry, such as farmers, farm workers, and
restaurant workers. Our hypotheses are: (1) inequality regimes are powerful yet
invisible in food work, (2) particular structures of the reproduction of
inequalities in food work are based on the intersections of paid and domestic
labor, and (3) practices that support these structures of inequalities can be
categorized and leverage points for change can be identified.

The broader impacts of this study include developing both academic and popular
learning modalities, including curricula, discussion groups and seminars,
informational materials, and a book on gender and food. The integrated,
collaborative approach of the research includes an extensive dissemination
component that ensures that workers, policy makers, faculty, and students
participate in and benefit from the research.
