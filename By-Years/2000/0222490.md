Dixon&lt;br/&gt;0222490&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will refine
and test, through collection of and comparison with new field data, a
preliminary Geographic Information Systems (GIS) model designed to identify
locales having a high likelihood that human-derived archeological artifacts will
surface on mountain glaciers and icefields. Preliminary research has
demonstrated that such locales can be identified using this method, which
utilizes a combination of social/cultural, biological, remote sensing and
geologic data. Glaciers and ice patches are melting at an unprecedented rate,
because of the current high rate of arctic warming. It is anticipated that
increasingly older and significant artifacts, paleontological and other
materials will be exposed in the resulting thawed areas. An estimated 10% of the
world's land surface is covered by perennial snow, glaciers and icefields.
Organic remains locked within these environments remain largely unexplored.
Results obtained during preliminary work on these regions include recovery of
rare and unique artifacts that can potentially make significant contributions to
our understanding of human colonization and adaptation. The apparent
acceleration of global warming, and the consequent melting of continental ice,
creates an urgent need to develop the means to locate and preserve such frozen
remains before the newly exposed materials decompose or are otherwise destroyed.
The proposed research addresses this crucial issue.
