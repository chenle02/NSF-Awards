This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) to develop an innovative
model to predict the maximum electron density in the F region ionosphere. The
model is unique in that it uses a set of planetary scale geomagnetic indices as
input. The dependence of F region ionization on these indices provides important
insight into the physical mechanisms that determine ionospheric electron
density. In particular, preliminary results show that the intensity of the ring
current in the magnetosphere is crucial in accurately specifying the global
electron density. This is evidence for a direct coupling mechanism between the
solar wind and the ionosphere. This SGER will allow further refinement and
development of the model including validation and verification of the results by
comparison with global electron density measurements. In the course of the
study, the dependence of ionospheric conditions on various driving forces will
be identified and quantified.
