Recent discoveries in the northern Apennines suggest a possible link between a
large impact and the termination of the latest Triassic (upper Norian or
"Rhaetian") Rhaetavicula bivalve fauna. Preliminary work at three pilot sections
in Tuscany and southern Liguria indicates that the occurrence of quartz with
planar features is linked with at least local extinction of the Rhaetavicula
assemblage and with major sedimentological changes in carbonate microfacies.
Termination of Triassic foraminiferal assemblages also seems to coincide with
the bivalve extinction and facies changes. This research will document
"Rhaetian" through earliest Hettangian microfacies and bivalve paleoecology in
the northern Apennines. The goal is a more complete stratigraphic documentation
of Triassic-Jurassic sections in Tuscany and southern Liguria, to determine
whether the stratigraphic linkage between impact, termination of faunal
elements, and dramatic changes in carbonate microfacies is indeed a regional
phenomenon. This expanded and more complete stratigraphic database on Triassic-
Jurassic events in the northern Apennines will permit a more rigorous test of
impact (in particular the Manicouagan impact) as a mechanism for the end-
Triassic mass extinction.
