This project is concerned with building a fast and theoretically well founded
reasoner - a massively parallel transitivity-tree reasoner - for general AI. AI
reasoning algorithms are often intractable, that is they are too slow for any
practical problem sizes to be of real value. A widely used approach to overcome
these problems has been to create special purpose reasoners. Such reasoners
solve only a very limited set of problems, and are too restricted in
architecture. This research is aimed at designing a reasoner that is more
general than current special purpose reasoners and faster than existing general
reasoners. This reasoner will have a well defined interface to a general purpose
reasoner.
