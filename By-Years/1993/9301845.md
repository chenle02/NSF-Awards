9301845 Pedlosky Theoretical and numerical work will be conducted on linear and
non- linear baroclinic waves in the ocean and atmosphere. Of particular interest
are the role played by atmospheric coherent structures to the phenomena of
blocking and anomalous jet streaks and the effect the termocline upwelling and
boundary sources have on the baroclinic structure of abyssal oceanic flows.
