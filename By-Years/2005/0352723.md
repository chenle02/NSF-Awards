AST-0352723/Monnier, U. Michigan/Ann Arbor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will
support the development of an infrared fringe tracker for the Georgia State
University Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy interferometer. The
interferometer is a 6-telescope array located on Mt. Wilson. Similar in
principle to adaptive optics, a fringe tracker stabilizes the effects of a
fluctuating atmosphere to allow long integrations by the science instrument.
This will improve the limiting magnitude of the interferometer and associated
instruments by at least four magnitudes. &lt;br/&gt;
