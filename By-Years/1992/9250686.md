The aim of this project is to develop an intensive hands-on general biochemistry
laboratory in which fundamental subjects are covered in a thematic fashion from
amino acids to proteins to nucleic acids. Topics in this "learn by doing"
laboratory are coordinated with the accompanying lecture course to reinforce
subject matter. Students will work in small groups, will have a close working
relationship with the instructor and will give informal presentations of their
work to their peers. Not only will this enhance their knowledge of the
fundamentals of biochemistry, but it will also help develop their reasoning and
data interpretation skills as well as their presentation abilities. The
equipment requested (spectrophotometers, fluorometer, electrophoresis setups and
computers) lend themselves to such a small group format.
