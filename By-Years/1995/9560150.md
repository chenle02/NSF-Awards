*** 9560150 Jannson This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research project will
provide an innovative method that can be used to solve multi-dimensional (4-D)
inverse scattering problems (ISPs) in diffusion tomography, without artifacts.
Physical Optics Corporation (POC) will develop a new inverse technique with
rigorously established global convergence, called the Globally Optimized Inverse
Method (GOIM). The GOIM is based on the globally convex cost function (and
Carleman's estimates). This will provide for the first time, the solution of
time-dependent inverse problems in 3-D space for strongly-scattering media. A
backscattering inverse problem for Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is used as a
quantitative example, and potential application scenario for Phase II. In Phase
I, POC will develop a time-effective inverse numerical technique based on layer-
stripping procedure, applicable to real-life opto-medical, Radar, NDE and
seismic scenarios. Its features will be evaluated in the context of
electromagnetic wave source type, specific technical parameters of a sensing
device (including the grid structure of the boundary value set), and the
computer power required (for either Work Stations, PCs, or parallel computers).
The GOIM can be applied to novel diffusion tomography (DT) devices that can
effectively (i.e., with a minimal number of grid points) evaluate, for the first
time, either backscattered GPR waves, or diffuse photons in turbid media; thus,
providing an entirely new category of advanced DT devices applicable to nuclear
waste monitoring, seismic activity monitoring, aging aircraft NDE monitoring,
and early breast cancer diagnostics. ***
