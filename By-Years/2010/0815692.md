This project is a meta-analysis of active learning versus lecture-based
instruction in higher education using multi-level methods to estimate both the
weighted average effect size and its associated variance from experimental and
comparative undergraduate STEM education research studies. It also models the
heterogeneity in these effect sizes by including coded predictor variables such
as: effectiveness, gender differences, ethnic differences, outcome measures, and
explanatory moderator variables (achievement, persistence, and attitudes).
Selected studies and their analyses include a focus on each discipline and the
grouping of all STEM disciplines. Publication-bias is performed via forest plots
and funnel plots and a sensitivity analysis is done by comparing two or more
meta-analyses calculated using different assumptions regarding the primary
studies.
