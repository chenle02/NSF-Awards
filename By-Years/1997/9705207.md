Abstract Zheng Zheng will conduct research on problems arising from the
interaction between complex function theory and functional analysis. Primary
emphasis will rest on the study of certain important spaces of analytic
functions and operators on these spaces. The topics to be considered include the
Hilbert transform, the Berezin transform, algebras on the unit disk, Toeplitz
operators, Hankel operators, and Bergman spaces. This project focuses on a
central problem in the theory of Toeplitz operators and Hankel operators, which
is to establish relationships between the fundamental properties of those
operators and analytic and geometric properties of their symbols. Operator
theory is that part of mathematics that studies the infinite dimensional
generalizations of matrices. It has its origins in mathematical physics, in
particular, in the study of quantum mechanics. The modeling of the atom required
the development of non-commutative analysis. The commutator of operators is the
measure of non-commutativity. A good portion of this project deals with
operators and the analysis of their commutators that acting on spaces of
analytic functions.
