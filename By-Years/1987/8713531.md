The project deals with the study of biaxial stretching of ultra- high molecular
weight polyolefin gel films, especially UHMWPE and UHMWPP. Uniaxially drawn
UHMWPE gels have shown ultra-high strength comparable to its counterparts such
as steel or KevlarR fibers. However, such uniaxially driven fibers are
inherently weak in transverse direction due to fibrillation. The lateral
strength may be significantly improved by introducing biaxial orientation in the
gels. The PI will perform cross-rolling of UHMWPE gels prior to biaxial
stretching to limit significant reduction of sample thickness during biaxial
stretching. Another area that will be addressed is to study the mechanisms of
gel drawing by probing labelled molecules. A third area that will be addressed
is a study of melting and crystallization behavior of UHMWPE gels and the
deformation mechanisms of gel spherulites by conventional time-resolved light
scattering, SAXS, WAXD and optical microscopy.
