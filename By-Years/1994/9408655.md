9408655 Skinner This project involves the dissertation research of a cultural
anthropology student from the University of California- Davis. The student will
study polygynous marriages in Ghana in order to understand the division of labor
in work and capital accumulation. The standard theory of polygyny accounts for
it as due to resource accumulation of men, by controlling the labor power of
several wives. This case study will show how polygyny works in a society where
spouses are economically independent, and men can not appropriate women's labor.
Using ethnographic methods and analysis of divorce cases, the student will try
make an analytic model of polygyny that could be used cross-culturally to
explain the existence of alternative forms of marriage in other areas of the
world. This research is important because the understanding of how alternative
marriage forms work in relation to the distribution of resources between men and
women will help us understand how to design programs to strengthen the family
and maintain it as the primary unit of socialization. This can have implications
for divorce and childrearing as well as for the transmission of STDs.
