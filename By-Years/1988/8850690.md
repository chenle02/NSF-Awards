This model project includes, in the first year of operation, several activities
to strengthen minority education at the precollege level and to improve the
transition of Native Alaskan students into college and university. It was
developed under the leadership of the University of Alaska with the cooperation
of the school systems in Alaska, Native organizations and corporations,
industry, and State Agencies. During the first year, a set of activities based
on science and mathematics experiences, and designed to nurture, encourage and
motivate minority students, are being implemented. These consist of a one-year
sequence of four phases to prepare students in precollege mathematics, science,
and study skills by providing instruction in mathematics and science as well as
incorporating internships and science research projects specifically related to
Native and rural activities in Alaska. The four phases are: five-weeks of
intensive academic instruction at the University of Alaska, including an
introduction to biology, chemistry, basic mathematics, and a seminar on culture,
ideas, and the values of science; distance delivery instruction in which
academic coursework will be continued by delivery to students' home sites; a
return to the campus for further laboratory experience; and, a career counseling
support activity to encourage enrollment in college-level science courses. Plans
for the second year will include science and mathematics activities at the
undergraduate level.
