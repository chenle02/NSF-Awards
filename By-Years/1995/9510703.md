9510703 Berman The award will support the continued development of the Nucleic
Acid Database, a database of three-dimensional structures of oligonucleotides
and nucleic acids. The goals of the project are to devise an easily accessible
and user friendly resource that serves a broad, international group of users
including crystallographers, theoreticians, modelers and other researchers
interested in such structures. The goals of the project are to expand the scope
of the database and to refine existing and develop new, user-friendly software
that facilitate data entry and research on the database, rather than simply on
individual entries. The expansion of scope will allow the database to accept
direct entry by researchers of structural data on nucleic acids determined by
x-ray crystallography. The database will continue to cooperate closely with the
Protein DataBank at Brookhaven National Laboratory, and will now itself include
structural information on proteins and protein-nucleic acid complexes derived
from the Protein DataBank. In addition, the database will provide the first
extensive test of the use of the mmCIF, a new, information-rich format for
structural data on macromolecules that is expected to become a standard format
for such data. ***
