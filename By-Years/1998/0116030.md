The Human Factors Psychology program at the University of South Dakota (USD)
will purchase an ASL Model ETS-PC eye tracker for the purposes of improving its
capacity to meet critical strategic research and research training objectives.
This device will enable researchers to accurately and precisely measure an
observer's 'point of fixation' in the visual field, thus allowing powerful,
objective and verifiable inferences to be made regarding heretofore unobservable
behavioral processes. The ETS-PC instrument has many advanced features making it
uniquely compatible with the program's wide range of needs for performing
quality transportation research both in the laboratory and in the field (e.g.,
while studying driving behavior with the USD advanced instrumented research
vehicle). Three faculty members, designated as major users of the purchased
device, will use the eye tracking system to significantly expand both the depth
and breadth of their existing experimental research programs in transportation
human factors. Four innovative projects will investigate perceptual and
cognitive mechanisms mediating: (1) the legibility distances afforded by
computer-enhanced symbol highway signs, (2) the visual advantages afforded by
fluorescent colored traffic control devices, (3) the visual effectiveness of
novel temporal-chromatic lighting signatures generated by next-generation
emergency vehicle lighting technologies and (4) the visual workload demands
imposed by advanced transportation-related graphical displays and interfaces.
The purchase of the ETS-PC eye tracker will enhance current research
capabilities and provide senior research personnel with new opportunities to
attract external support from our traditional as well as new funding sources.
The impact of these developments will also extend to the quality of the research
training experience for graduate students enrolled in USD's Ph.D. program in
Human Factors Psychology.
