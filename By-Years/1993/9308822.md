9308822 Ryu This project is on research to develop an expression and secretion
system for the yeast Yarrowia Lipolytica. The work involves extensive molecular
biological studies which includes development of a transformation-secretion
system, genetic analysis of a promoter, and isolation of a high secretion
mutant. The developed strain will be used to express model proteins of
industrial relevance, and a two stage fed-batch reactor system will be used to
optimize expression levels.
