This work focuses on the study of phase coherent properties of low-dimensional
tunnel junctions and tunable semiconductor quantum dots. These systems juxtapose
competing zero-, one- and two-dimensional states separated by a precise,
nanometer-scale barriers. Quantum tunneling mixes and enhances the coupling
between the degenerate ground states, leading to potential development of long-
lived quantum coherence in nanometer scale devices. Precise control and
detection of quantum states within solid-state environment remain important
challenges in condensed matter physics today. The development of macroscopic
quantum coherence in these systems arises from quantum phase transitions that
break the underlying symmetry. The underlying physics of phase coherent systems
in nanostructured environment is largely unexplored, the dominant decoherent
mechanisms unknown, and no detailed theoretical model is currently available. A
series of electrical, tunneling, and dynamical measurements to study the quantum
coherent transport of electrons in nanometer-scale semiconductor devices is
proposed. An important feature of the work is fabrication and characterization
of tunnel junctions with barriers down to few lattice spacings. Undergraduate
and graduate students involved in the project will receive training in the state
of art fabrication and characterization techniques. This training is intended to
prepare them for careers in academe, industry or
government.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is centered on the study of
quantum coherent phenomena arising from quantum mechanical interplay of
electrons in nanometer-scale semiconductor devices. Quantum mechanical coherence
is normally difficult to sustain for extended period of time because of coupling
to the external perturbations and presence of imperfections. The quantum
coherence in these systems derives from recent advances in fabrication of
semiconductor nanostructures. In these unprecedentedly clean systems, theories
predict quantum phase transitions into novel collective states that can sustain
exceptionally long-lived excitations. Electrical and high frequency measurements
designed to probe and characterize the postulated quantum states are proposed.
Control and manipulation of quantum states can be exploited for applications in
quantum information processing, a field of increasing technological importance.
Potential applications include quantum computation, quantum cryptography, and
test of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox within a solid state environment.
Undergraduate and graduate students participating in this research receive broad
training in the state of art fabrication and characterization techniques and can
pursue careers in industrial or fundamental research.&lt;br/&gt;
