This project will utilize near simultaneous passes of two (or more) satellites
from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) to investigate (1) the
spatial and temporal structure of large scale electron acceleration (LSEA)
events (also referred to as "inverted-V events" and (2) the phenomenon known as
a "double cusp."

Fortuitous conjunctions of the DMSP satellites occasionally bring the satellites
within 50 km of one another in the auroral zone. The particle precipitation
measurements from the satellites can be used to identify LSEA events and the
differences observed between the satellites can be used to study the evolution
of the LSEA event. Statistical analysis of many such events will make it
possible to separate spatial structure from temporal evolution.

Instances of multiple DMSP passes through the dayside auroral oval will be used
to compare the particle precipitation characteristics on opposite sides of noon.
High latitude magnetic merging takes place on the opposite sides of noon in the
northern and southern hemisphere when the interplanetary magnetic field is
dominated by the east-west component. It has been suggested that the particle
precipitation features originating from opposite hemispheres should have
particular signatures. This project will determine what those particular
signatures are and will elucidate the nature of the double cusp.
