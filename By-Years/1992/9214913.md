Arctic soils are extensive and have an abundance of organic matter acting as a
carbon sink in the terrestrial biosphere. The overall project objectives are to
assess the quantity and quality of the organic constituents in arctic soils, to
predict their increased rates of release, and to evaluate their potential for
decomposition and movement upon thawing of permafrost due to accelerated global
warming.
