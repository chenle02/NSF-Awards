9502791 Zwaenepoel This award provides support for the acquisition of a cluster
of shared-memory multiprocessor nodes interconnected by a high-speed network to
support research in parallel programming systems, and algorithms and
applications from a wide variety of disciplines. The infrastructure will be used
as a research vehicle for computer systems designers as well as computational
scientists. Research projects to be supported include work on compiler and
runtimes for multiprocessor clusters, high-performance I/O, and performance
visualization; and algorithms and applications in mixed integer programming,
molecular dynamics, reservoir simulation, genetic linkage analysis, and seismic
modeling. The infrastructure will also be used in new graduate and undergraduate
courses in multidisciplinary design optimization, and parallel computing.
