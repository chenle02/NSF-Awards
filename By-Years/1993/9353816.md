9353816 Staver This planning proposal will coordinate organizations and
resources in North Central Kansas around a collaborative effort to improve rural
elementary science teaching. A partnership among the North Central Kansas
Educational Service Center, the Center for Science Education at Kansas State
University, and Cloud County Community College as been created through this
process to address the science needs in this region. This collaborative
partnership will develop a project designed to implement hands-on science in
rural school districts by preparing elementary teachers to become local and
regional facilitators of quality hands-on science instruction. The project will
also design a mechanism for providing teachers with implementation assistance,
administrative support, and instructional materials. The cost sharing will be
229% of the NSF request. Cost sharing will come from Kansas State University,
North Central Kansas Educational Service Center, and Cloud County Community
College. ***
