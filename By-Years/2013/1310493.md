The objective of this program is to (1) demonstrate a compact and potentially
cost effective fiber device that will be a drop-in replacement for the complex
optics that are susceptible to thermal and environmental drifts in today's
nanoscale microscopes operating on the principle of stimulated emission and
spatial depletion; and (2) design a next generation fiber capable of
incorporating all optical components of the aforementioned bulk microscope to
realize endoscopic implementations of nanoscale imaging systems.

The intellectual merit of this program is the realization that optical fibers
can be specially designed to support orbital angular momentum carrying vortex
beams, which lead to unprecedented multicolor control of the optical beam shape
that exits the fiber and impinges on a sample. This development, combined with
microscopy principles enabling super-resolution with complex beams, would lead
to the first compact, alignment-free all-fiber imaging system capable of 20-50
nm resolution.

The broader impacts of this program are twofold: (1) Developing minimally-
invasive technologies that can image, at the nanoscale, cellular, subcellular,
molecular, and genetic processes in living organisms, which would significantly
advance our understanding of human pathobiology; (2) Optical vortices form one
of the most visually appealing beam patterns, resembling spirals whose physics
is related to tornado-formation, and their manipulation with fibers enables
developing curricula for a diverse array of students ranging from high-schools
to graduate-schools, which would help attract more US talent to the disciplines
of science, engineering and mathematics.
