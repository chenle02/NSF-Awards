The University of Georgia Marine Institute has been conducting estuarine and
nearshore studies for 35 years and continues to be an internationally recognized
center of excellence for salt marsh research. Due to this recognition, the
Duplin River salt marsh watershed and the estuary adjacent to the Marine
Institute on Sapelo Island have been designated a National Estuarine Research
Reserve. The Institute serves as a prime research base for marine scientists
within the United States as well as for international investigators. This
project will provide partial support for the purchase of a CHN analyzer, the
upgrading of the Institute's present ion chromatograph, and the installation of
a clean bench with laminar flow hood. This instrumentation is vitally important
in maintaining state-of-the-art research capabilities at the Institute.
