Request is made in this application for bio-computing resources for the study of
protein structure-function relationships. The proposed equipment consists of
three Silicon Graphics Indigo2 workstations and necessary software for modeling
protein structures, plus color printer and additional disk drive for database
storage. These resources will enable researchers to model enzyme specificities,
characterize protein-ligand binding interactions at the atomic level, and carry
out computationally intensive calculations on proteins and nucleic acids.
