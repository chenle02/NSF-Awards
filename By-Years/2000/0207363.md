Professor Li first proposes to study the synthesis of C-glycosides in water.
This group will first investigate the coupling of aryl halides with aldehydes in
water then move to coupling reactions involving carbohydrates. This methodology
will then be applied to the synthesis of several polyhydroxylated natural
products.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research of Dr. Chao-Jun li of the Department of Chemistry at Tulane
University. Dr. Li will work on the development new carbon-carbon bond forming
reactions which can be used to prepare carbohydrates in water. When developed,
Dr. Li's work could be applied to the environmentally friendly syntheses of a
number of biologically active molecules which contain the carbohydrate
framework. Students trained during the course of this work will gain skills
needed by the pharmaceutical and speciality chemicals industries.
