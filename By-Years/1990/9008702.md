The objectives of this project are as follows: (l) To design a graphical event
description language and environment to support development of abstract models
for the different layers of a message-passing program's communication structure.
(2) To develop a debugging tool that compares a communication model defined in
the above graphical language to the run-time communication structure of a
program. (3) To study the effectiveness of the graphical event description
language and the debugging technique. The debugging tool provides the user with
a mechanism for directing a debugging session based on the user's mental
abstractions of a program's communication structure. Additionally, the
communication model can be designed for any level of the program and thus allows
the user to debug the program in a top-down fashion. By providing one general
graphical format for describing the model and for displaying the run-time
behavior, users are given a common visual interface for both the input and
output of the debugger based on their own abstractions.
