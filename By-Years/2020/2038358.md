The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of reliable autonomous vehicle systems that may overcome existing
limitations by utilizing sensor measurements to adapt its path while the vehicle
is in motion. As RADAR, LiDAR, and SONAR sensor can be used on the onboard
robotic platforms, markets may utilize autonomous aerial, underwater, and ground
vehicles. One application is the development of a more reliable and safe
autonomous driving system. Another example is an autonomous aerial/underwater
vehicle that may assist in gathering quality data of wild animal habitats and
populations while minimizing the damage of natural environment. Defining the
requirements of the existing autonomous systems will help establish a general
standard for a reliable design for autonomous robotic
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development
of a sensor path planning algorithm that may adapt its direction based on sensor
measurements while the vehicle is in motion. Information theory and
probabilistic sensor measurement models are used in the algorithm to decide the
vehicleâ€™s path such that the most informative measurements can be obtained. The
algorithm is capable of considering the confidence level based on object
identification and the vehicle can automatically re-plan its path based on the
information gathered in real-time. This technology is based on research on
effective and efficient methods to utilize and process the sensor measurements
towards path planning. Technical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm
can compute the minimum-time path while achieving a satisfactory confidence
level from obtained sensor measurements. The application of the path planning
algorithm will give a higher level of autonomy, resulting in a more reliable
integrated system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
