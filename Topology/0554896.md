The PI investigates independence results in the study of countable convergence
questions in the class of compact spaces. Some of the questions remain
unresolved even in the presence of the Proper Forcing Axiom. The sequential
order of a space is a natural ordinal invariant that measures the complexity of
a sequential space; the question of whether there can be a finite or countable
bound on this invariant for compact spaces has only been resolved under CH. We
will also study continuous maps on the remainder of the Stone-Cech
compactification of the integers which are finite-to-one. We will try to
determine if such maps have to be "somewhere trivial" and whether the range
space will be homeomorphic to the domain. This question has been fully resolved
under PFA but not, for example, under MA. Two other questions about the
remainder of N under PFA: can it be covered by nowhere dense P-sets and can
there be non-trivial copies of the remainder?

When one formalizes the limiting process of an infinite sequence of steps one
is naturally lead to the notion of topological space. Points in physical space
can be analyzed using the notion of a converging sequence, but just as
mathematics has a need for a much broader understanding of points (e.g.
functions or processes themselves lying in a space of like processes), so too
has the need for a broader understanding of limit and topological space been
developed to handle convergence in the more general settings. The investigation
into the nature of generalized convergence, connections between conditions that
may imply the existence of (the much easier to understand and apply) classical
convergent sequences, and the behavior of the convergence structure under
deformations is on-going and productive. These notions are very sensitive to the
foundational axioms of mathematics and the questions serve as both a testbed for
foundational study and a generator of new development. One of the most famously
indeterminate questions of mathematics, the continuum hypothesis (the "size" of
the real number line) is intimately connected to these questions of convergence.
