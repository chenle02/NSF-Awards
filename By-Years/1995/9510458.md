9510458 Wang This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry award
will support two Graduate Student Industrial Fellowships and a fraction of a
faculty member's time to work on a collaborative project between the University
of Maryland-Baltimore County and Alcoa Technical Center. The objective of the
research that these GOALI Fellows will participate in is a methodology to
characterize geometric variations of aluminum automotive space frames, and to
transfer these discoveries into industrial practice for the development and
production of all-aluminum automobiles. The research tasks are to determine the
appropriate manufactured part models for aluminum space frame extrusions, and to
identify the appropriate tolerance methods for space frames. Alcoa has
identified researchers to work with the U of MD-Baltimore County team, and has
committed experimental and software support for this project. Results from this
collaboration will allow better fits in the aluminum space frame design for
automobiles, reducing weight and increasing fuel economy. These results will
make manufacture of these frames possible in quantities needed by the automobile
industry. ***
