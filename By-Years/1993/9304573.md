9304573 Stute Groundwater circulating in extended confined aquifers contains
information on past climates. Noble gas measurements, in particular, allow
reconstruction of continental paleotemperatures ('noble gas paleothermometer').
Cl- and isotopic data (D), 18O) provide additional insight into long-term
climate change. This award supports the collection and evaluation of geochemical
data (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, 14C, 13C D, 18O, 36Cl and major dissolved ions) from
two groundwater flow systems in the southern hemisphere, the Stampriet aquifer
in Namibia and the Dilwyn aquifer in southern Australia. Paleoclimate records
from these aquifers will address the relationship between continental and
oceanic paleotemperatures and the latitudinal symmetry of climate change during
the past 30,000 years.
