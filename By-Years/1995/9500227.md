ABSTRACT T. Alan Hatton MIT CTS-9500227 The Department of Chemical Engineering
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology intends to purchase a SPEX
Fluorolog-t2 Fluorescence Spectrometer which will be dedicated to support
research in engineering. This instrument will be used for several research
projects in the environmental, biological and materials areas to probe the
microenvironments afforded by different microdomains in systems such as: (i)
Block copolymer micelles and dendritic star polymers to be used as
solubilization media for separations and reactions; (ii) tailored self-assembled
organic surfaces for chromatographic and sensor applications; (iii) novel
solvents for pharmaceutical synthesis reactions, including supercritical fluid
media; (iv) colloidal nanocrystals for photocatalytic applications; (v)
chemically-modified fluoresces; and (vi) proteins tethered to polymers as
ligands for cell-surface receptors. Information on micropolarities,
mocroviscosities, restrictions on rotational and transitional motion of probes,
and specific and non-specific solvation effects can be obtained using steady
state and time-resolved fluorescence and depolarization. Dynamics of exchange of
probes between different microdomins (e.g., micelles, thin films, protein active
sties, inorganic adsorbates) will be quantified, and the sizes of microdomains
such as micelles determined. These results will be useful in the design of
microheterogeneous systems for the range of application considered.
