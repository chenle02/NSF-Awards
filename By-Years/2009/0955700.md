The principal investigator (PI) intends to apply his expertise in computational
fluid dynamics, space science, and plasma physics, to construct an integrated
teaching and research program in computational physics. This project will
address the needs of the Huntsville area for an experienced technical workforce
by developing a unique educational resource within the Department of Physics at
the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH), with support from the UAH Center
for Space Plasma and Aeronomic Research (CSPAR). The PI's team includes thirteen
new faculty members and researchers recently hired by UAH Physics and CSPAR, all
of whom are closely involved in computational science
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI plans to create a new track in
Computational Physics as part of the UAH Master's degree program in the
Department of Physics. This curriculum will serve both prospective students and
local industry by providing advance training in numerical and supercomputer
techniques. The project's research component will include the development of a
comprehensive computer model of the Solar System, from Earth to its outer edge
and into the surrounding interstellar cloud. This model will address science
problems in charged particle acceleration, pickup ions and neutral atoms, the
physics of interplanetary turbulence, the transport of cosmic rays, and solar
wind interaction with the interstellar medium. In addition, the PI will develop
new supercomputing technologies, including graphic processor-based computing,
using UAH's existing 400-core computing cluster, and eventually larger
supercomputer resources expected to be available in the future.
