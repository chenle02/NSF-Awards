This proposal requests funds to establish a Biological Facilities Center for the
Study of Cell Morphology and Function. Five major instruments are requested: l.
A transmission electron microscope with facilities to section and process
specimens at low temperature. It will be used for immunogold localization of a
wide variety of antigens and for ultrastructural visualization of cell and
cytoskeletal morphology. 2. A high-spatial-resolution low-light fluorescence
microscope system to track the dynamics of fluorescently labeled cytoskeletal
proteins and the position and shape of labeled cells in developing embryos while
minimizing photodynamic damage. 3. A workstation that combines
electrophysiological equipment with imaging of fluorescence ratios from fura-2
to map spatial patterns of neuronal activity and intracellular Ca2a in
electrically stimulated neural assemblies. 4. A laser-scanning confocal
microscope that rejects out-of- focus fluorescence that will enable high-speed
optical sectioning of thick or dynamically changing specimens for studying the
role of Ca2+ in controlling the cytoskeleton and for measuring local demains of
Ca2+ or pH in single neurons, thick ganglia, or heterogeneous epithelia. 5. A
Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer that will permit
continuous monitoring of intracellular metabolites, pH, sodium, and hemoglobin
polymerization in cell and organelle suspensions such as cyanobacteria, oxyntic
cell vesicles, and erythrocytes. This equipment will be used by the forty
research groups to be housed in a new Life Sciences building as well as hundreds
of graduate students who are involved in ongoing research projects. Expected
contributions will be the development of a scanning confocal microscope for
high-speed biological observation as well as innovative solutions to current
problems in molecular biology.
