Karpur 9523342 Ultrasonic techniques have been found to be very effective in
detecting small defects in comparatively small samples. However, in big civil
infrastructure type specimens such as bridges, columns, poles and pipelines use
of ultrasonic techniques has been limited because of high absorption and
scattering of body waves (longitudinal and shear waves which are used in
ultrasonic experiments) in such big objects. In this project unconventional Lamb
waves at very low frequencies (30 kHz - 200 kHz) will be used to detect internal
defects in civil infrastructures. Initial investigations have shown that for
detecting weak bonds and partially damaged internal interfaces, Lamb waves are
much more efficient than body waves. However, Lamb wave sensors have not been
developed yet to its full potential because of the lack of expertise in this
field in sensor industries. In this research the theory necessary to develop
efficient Lamb wave or guided wave sensors will be developed first. Then the new
sensor will be fabricated with the help of transducer manufacturing industries.
These sensors will be tested at the Wright-Patterson Material Laboratory and
will be used to detect internal damages in concrete and metal slabs and pipeline
type civil infrastructures. Two companion projects are supported to carry out
the above described research: University of Arizona which will develop the basic
lamb wave theory and conduct initial sensor design and testing, and University
of Dayton/Wright- Patterson Laboratory which will test the fabricated sensors
and evaluate the results. ***
