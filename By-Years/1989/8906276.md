The two objectives of this research are to develop a reliable combination of
experiment and theory enabling the determination of both positive and negative
polymer-polymer interaction parameters and to develop a better predictive model
for polymer phase diagrams involving rigid rod polymers. In pursuing these
objectives, this proposal covers the following related areas of theoretical and
experimental polymer blend thermodynamics: Experimental determination of
polymer-polymer interaction parameters by osmotic and vapor-pressure
measurements on single- phase, ternary polymer-polymer-solvent systems.
Experimental determination of the associated ternary phase diagrams and a
rigorous comparison of these experimental ternary phase equilibria with equation
of state theories. Development of an equation of state theory for mixtures of
rigid-rod polymers with flexible chain polymers and solvent.
