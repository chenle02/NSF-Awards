With National Science Foundation support, the Museum of Anthropology at the
University of Kansas will upgrade the level of curation for archaeological
materials from 23 sites in Missouri and Kansas. All date to the Middle Woodland
period and the collections were acquired by the museum from 1963 to 1975. In
their current state, the materials are subject to deterioration, accompanying
information is vulnerable to potential destruction and the collections are not
readily available for scientific study. Specimens are currently stored in paper
bags in overcrowded boxes. Accompanying provenience information is available
only in paper form. To remedy these problems, the project will include:
repacking all artifacts into polyethylene bags and acid free boxes; labeling all
boxes with specific content information; labeling all artifacts currently
missing this information; recording the provenience information from these
artifacts as well as all existing catalog information directly onto a relational
database file for easy access to students and researchers. Anthropologists wish
to understand how complex societies develop and many have focused on the
Hopewell phenomenon in the midwest United States. Long before the arrival of
Columbus, Native American groups established a village way of life, developed
long distance trading systems which brought salt water shells and other exotic
objects into the region and built large earthen mounds which served religious
functions. The materials held by the Museum of Anthropology can shed light on
how this phenomenon developed and therefore are of great anthropological
interest. However the materials are difficult to access and lack of a
computerized index makes them difficult to find. Therefore they are not readily
available for scientific study. This award will remedy the situation.
