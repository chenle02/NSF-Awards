James Madison University will purchase an 80386-based computer workstation,
ERDAS satellite imaging hardware and software, and associated computer
peripherals. This equipment will be used to improve instruction in lower-and
upper-division geography courses. Students will be trained in the use of modern
digital imaging techniques in remote sensing. In addition, advanced
undergraduate students will use the equipment for special projects. James
Madison University will match the NSF equipment grant with an equal amount of
funds, and will provide additional support for faculty training.
