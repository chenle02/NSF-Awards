This workshop will finalize initial research plans of the International
Geosphere Biosphere Program (IGBP). The operational phase of the IGBP consists
of a number of core projects addressing different components of the total earth
- oceans, atmosphere, and land, and their linkages through climate and
biogeochemical systems. This workshop addresses the program formulation phase of
one of the core projects, the Global Change and Terrestrial Ecosystems (GCTE) in
a meeting of international specialists at Asilomar, California on May 5-8, 1991.
The purpose of the meeting will be to review evolving research plans for the
focus dealing with the exchange of energy and material of ecosystems as outlined
by the IGBP (1990) and modified by the GCTE meeting in Brighton, England on
February 19-21, 1991.
