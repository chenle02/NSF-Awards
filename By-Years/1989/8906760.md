This award will provide funds to a group at Illinois Institute of Technology
for continued research in Elementary Particle Physics at Fermilab (E-791). The
experimenters will study, in the Tagged Photon Laboratory (TPL), the
hadroproduction of charm and beauty particles. The statistics of charm particles
in this experiment will represent an order of magnitude improvement over
previous results (E-769), allowing a study of rare charm meson and baryon
decays. It will provide a better understanding of charm production and will make
progress towards beauty physics in a hadron environment. The group will also
participate in the design of a planned detector (BCD) for a dedicated B physics
experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron proton-antiproton collider. In addition, the
group will complete the analysis of pictures, taken in the Fermilab 15-ft.
bubble chamber, of high energy neutrino interactions. These interactions have
been particularly useful in studying the properties of particles containing
heavy quarks.
