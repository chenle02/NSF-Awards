ABSTRACT

Proposal Number: CTS-0236281 Principal Investigator: Tour, James M. and McHale,
Mary Affiliation: Rice U Title: SGER NanoKids Education Outreach Project-Proof
of Concept

Ten different configurations of molecules resembling human stick figures have
been synthesized in the PI's laboratory. The molecules as a group are dubbed the
NanoKids. By portraying these molecules in a series of computer-animated
lessons, the PI intends to develop a proof-of-concept support curriculum for
introducing students in the 6-12 grade to the molecular environment. The longer
vision is to develop extensive lessons based on the National Science and
Technology Education standards. This SGER proposal is to obtain the funds for
the proof-of-concept and to prepare for the upcoming submission of the full
proposal.
