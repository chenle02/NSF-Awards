Jiri Jonas is supported by a grant from The Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to continue his research in experimental studies of the
dynamic structure of liquids using NMR and laser Raman spectroscopy. The major
thrust of the research is to study liquids at high pressures and in confined
regions. High resolution NMR of liquids under high pressures is being used to
separate the effects of density and temperature on dynamical processes such as
self-diffusion and shear viscosities. Recent work on the preparation of porous
silica glasses by sol-gel processes have led to studies of both NMR and Raman
spectra of liquids confined in glasses with well defined pore sizes from 10 A to
200 A. The main research directions to be explored include: 1) NMR studies of
the applicability of the hydrodynamic Stokes-Einstein and Debye equations at the
molecular level in liquids near their glass transition temperature; 2) NMR
experiments dealing with confinement effects on angular momentum behavior in
liquids; 3) NMR study of conformational isomerization in confined liquids; 4)
Raman studies of confinement effects on vibrational and reorientational
relaxation in liquids; and 5) NMR study of the pressure effects on hydrogen
exchange in aqueous solutions of amides and polyamides. New information on
liquids at the atomic and molecular level obtained through NMR studies of
liquids at high pressure will help in understanding the function of lubricants.
The studies of liquids in confined geometries has technological applications in
many fields including catalysis, chromatography, membrane separations, and
liquid permeability in geological formations.
