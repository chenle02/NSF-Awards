This research is to apply high resolution seismic analysis procedures to
resolve possible slow coseismic slip in the rupture of several recent large
earthquakes, emphasizing events along the Pacific Coast of North and South
America. The objective will be to understand the nature of deep fault
properties, and the role of quasi-static strain changes and creep or viscous
flow in causing slow cosseismic slip and aseismic slip before and after large
earthquakes. Techniques used for study have been developed under previous grants
for simultaneous analysis of the broadband spectrum of seismic radiation. This
research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
