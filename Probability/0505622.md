The proposed project consists of three parts. The first part deals with
asymptotic formulas for Lyapunov exponents of differential and difference
equations with small random perturbations, and estimates of the Lyapunov
exponents of stochastic differential equations. The second part is devoted to
the spectral problems for certain random and stochastic differential equations.
The third part deals with existence and uniqueness of self-similar Dirichlet
forms, diffusions, and random walks.

The broader impacts of the project include applications to the study of the long
term behavior of natural and statistical processes occurring in random media.
Signal propagation in channels with random obstacles, electro-magnetic waves in
plasma, Rossby waves in oceanography, models of financial markets are just a few
of many examples of such processes. Also, the project contributes to the study
of processes in self-similar objects (fractals), which have many applications in
physics, engineering and biological sciences. The project includes various
educational and REU activities.
