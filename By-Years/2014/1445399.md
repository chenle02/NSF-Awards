One of the major costliest diseases is osteoarthritis, which affects one tenth
of all Americans. The focal articular cartilage defect is one of the main causes
of osteoarthritis. It starts as a small defect and can lead to a widespread
degradation of articular cartilage causing pain and limited joint movement. This
proposal aims to identify opportunities and realize commercialization potential
of the polymer based osteochondral scaffold (an osteochondral scaffold with
biodegradable polymeric materials) for the repair of focal defects in the
articular cartilage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The osteochondral scaffold consists of
an outer shell and an inside core. The outer shell is composed of sintered
microspheres of composite polycaprolactone (PCL) and poly-lactic glycolic acid
(PLGA) for protection of the growing tissue from mechanical stresses. The inside
core has two porous PCL spiral scaffolds laden with PCL nanofibers for cartilage
and bone regeneration. The cartilage portion of the scaffold takes advantage of
several novel features such as dually aligned nanofibers and functionalization
of PCL with chondroitin sulfate and hyaluronic acid to morphologically and
functionally reproduce the actual hyaline cartilage extracellular matrix.
Through this design, the scaffold can create tissue that can best mimic the real
physiological properties of normal cartilage. Through the proposed scaffold,
physiologically functional articular cartilage including the underlying bone can
be regenerated. Moreover, with the outer porous microsphere shell, the scaffold
will be able to sustain physiological loads while protecting the growing
tissues, allowing the patient to return to normal movement quicker. The scaffold
will be able to help people return to their normal lifestyle without the need
for further procedures.
