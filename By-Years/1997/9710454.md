This project will examine coral records from the core of the Western Pacific
Warm Pool to determine whether there is evidence of long-term changes in maximum
temperature that might indicate global warming. Subannual sampling will also
address the question of decade-scale variability. Two Porites specimens spanning
in the last 200-300 years will be analyzed for stable isotopes and trace
elements. In addition, the project will explore the utility of records from the
long-lived Diploastrea.
