An integrated stress analysis laboratory, mainly for senior undergraduates,
which will let them perform various experiments using modern data acquisition
equipment and techniques is developed and built. The scientific principles which
will govern the proposed laboratory are rather simple; they are based on
utilization of several well-developed techniques of experimental mechanics
coupled with a digital image analysis system for optical data acquisition
(photoelastic and moire fringes) and analog-to-digital convertor for electrical
data acquisition (strain gauges, load cells, displacement sensors). The
integrated approach (modern instrumentation and various experimental techniques
together with available analytical or numerical solutions) will be an
indispensable tool for the undergraduate student to really understand the value
of the experiment and the need for critical analysis of results.
