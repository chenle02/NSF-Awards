The Rio Grande rift is an extensional tectonic feature located in Colorado and
New Mexico. Extensive research has established that the rift has been affected
by two phases of deformation, each characterized by development of topography
and accompanied by volcanism. Tectonic models have been developed using heat-
flow, gravity, seismic and topographic information as constraints. However,
models for the earlier phase of deformation are loosely constrained because the
topographic parameters associated with the event are not well known. This ROW
project will employ fission-track analysis in order to provide better
constraints on topographic relief and the near-surface cooling history of the
Rio Grande Rift.
