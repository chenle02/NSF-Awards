The objective of this project is to study "electronic gaging" and create a
system for automatic dimensional inspection of mechanical parts. The focus of
this project is on developing theories and methods needed for systematically
comparing the geometric variations of measured-features with their allowed
tolerances. The approach to the data analysis is based on decomposing the
measurement data into a set of features, and extracting their measures of
imperfection. A set of formal definitions will be developed to express the
meaning of such measures of imperfection as size, form, orientation, and
position.
