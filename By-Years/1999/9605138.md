*** Ellis This grant will support summer research at Wesleyan University for
eight undergraduates for five years. Half of the stipends will be given to women
recruited from similarly sized institutions in the New England area. The impact
of the support will be three-fold. First, the positions will add Wesleyan summer
research opportunities to the limited pool of opportunities available to women
at similar institutions in the Northeast. Second, the emphasis on women will
continue to nurture a receptive environment for women in physics both at
Wesleyan and in the Northeast. Finally, the emphasis on research among physics
undergraduates will be strengthened by the presence of this stable source of
support, contributing to the unique combination of a small liberal arts setting
and graduate research that exists at Wesleyan. The research positions will
involve projects associated with ongoing research efforts primarily in condensed
matter and atomic/molecular experimental physics. ***
