(Public Law 111-5).

Dr Wyse will investigate the early phases of evolution of the Milky Way's thin
disk and the formation of its thick disk by using stellar spectra from the
Radial Velocity Experiment (RAVE). This survey uses a fiber-fed spectrograph on
the 1.2-meter UK Schmidt Telescope to obtain spectra of 150 stars at a time.
From these, she will measure the star's motion towards or away from us, and
estimate its surface gravity and temperature, chemical abundances and stellar
rotation. A graduate student will travel each year to Australia to make
observations for RAVE. One student will study a sample that may represent the
first stars in the Milky Way's disk; they will be selected from RAVE to have a
low metal abundance (below one-tenth of the Sun's value), but to follow the
near-circular orbits characteristic of disk stars. High-resolution spectra will
be taken to obtain more precise chemical abundances. A second student will use
the detailed pattern of element abundances to test whether these stars could
have been born in satellite galaxies that were swallowed by the Milky Way, and
to develop a model for early disk formation.

This award will support two graduate students. The RAVE database will be a
widely useful resource across the astronomical community. The collaboration will
release its database in a form that is compliant with the standards of the
Virtual Astronomical Observatory, making it accessible to the community.
