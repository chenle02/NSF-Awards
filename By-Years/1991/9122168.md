Poled polymeric thin films are uniquely suited for second-order nonlinear
optical applications of ultrashort pulses (<50 fs) since minimal pulse spreading
occurs. This group has already shown that corona- poled nonlinear polymeric
films are particularly attractive for nonlinear ultrashort pulse applications.
The PI proposes various sum and difference frequency experiments with these thin
nonlinear polymeric films. Sum and difference frequency nonlinear interactions
will be used to generate ultrashort UV pulses, resulting in the shortest UV
pulses to date, as well as in synchronized UV and infrared pulses. Additionally,
the PI proposes ultrashort UV pulse shape measurements with a resolution
approaching ten femtoseconds. The possibility of anomalous pulse matching in the
nonlinear polymeric films will be investigated. Terahertz beam generation by
optical rectification is also proposed. Some of the proposed experiments will be
carried out in cooperation with Dr. C.V. Shank>s laboratory at Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory.
