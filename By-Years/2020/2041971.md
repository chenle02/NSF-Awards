Rapid variations in radiation belt electron fluxes during geomagnetic storms
continue to challenge our understanding of space weather. To better understand
these variations, this project investigates how kinetic Alfv√©n waves (KAWs)
affect energetic electron transport in the inner magnetosphere. A novel approach
will be taken which utilizes NASA Van Allen Probes data (with select conjunction
intervals from the NASA BARREL balloon mission) and 3-D fluid-kinetic
simulations. A graduate student and post-doctoral researcher will be supported
by the work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will explore the turbulent
wavefields and the mechanisms through which scattering in these field topologies
may occur. This will be achieved through the analysis of fields and particle
measurements from the Van Allen Probes spacecraft and particle simulations for
distributions of electrons in turbulent wavefields generated from a hybrid data-
theory formalism. These analyses will (1) determine how turbulent KAW wavefield
topologies drive rapid scattering of outer radiation belt electrons and (2)
quantify from statistical wave field measurements and transport rates derived
via simulations, the contribution of this scattering process to outer radiation
belt transport. This research will also be supported by analyses of a number of
conjugate Van Allen Probes-high altitude balloon events of energetic
precipitation in these wavefields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
