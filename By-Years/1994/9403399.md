9403399 Conlon The principal investigator will conduct research on problems in
partial differential equations. These problems are motivated by intuitions
concerning the behavior of interacting random walks over large time scales. A
major step in this direction would be to understand random walks in random
environments. The principal investigator's approach to these problems has been
to obtain sufficiently sharp estimates on solutions to appropriate partial
differential equations. He intends to continue this work. The general goal of
this project is to advance understanding of diffusion in a medium where the
consistency of the medium changes a lot. When two liquids are mixed the process
of mixing is a diffusive process. Heat propagates largely by diffusion. There
are many examples of diffusive processes where the consistency of the medium of
propagation changes a lot.One example is the propagation of oil through porous
rock. Another is the propagation of pollutants in the ground. In each of the
above examples it is important to build up a qualitative understanding of the
mechanism of difdusion in such media. This study will contribute to this,
