Many natural, social and engineered systems exhibit or facilitate complex
behavior. Such behavior often results from the deliberate actions of, and
interactions between, a large number of individuals. The need to study behavior
in complex systems of network-structured interactions in large populations
promotes interest in computational game-theoretic
models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graphical games build on classical models in game
theory, as well as compact, structured representations in probabilistic
graphical models. The result is a practical and computationally amenable model
to handle networked large-population systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The creation
of technology for scientists and policy makers to study and work with large
real-world complex systems of (strategic) interactions requires further advances
in graphical games and models. The project seeks to fill knowledge gaps by
advancing computational aspects of game theory, graphical models and machine
learning, and laying the foundation for a systematic two-way knowledge transfer
between computational game theory and graphical models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
research program strengthens the connection between graphical models and game
theory by casting probabilistic inference problems as equilibrium computation,
creating algorithms to learn games from behavioral data, and characterizing
equilibrium structure and computation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational
program includes the infusion of research results into general education, at all
levels, via development of new courses and integration into existing ones; and a
concerted effort to bridge the Departments of Economics and Computer Science at
Stony Brook. Collaborations through the Center for Game Theory in Economics and
the International Summer Festival on Game Theory, held annually at Stony Brook,
serve as conduits for outreach and dissemination.
