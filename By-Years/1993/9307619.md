9307619 Ellis This project addresses an area of coordination technology called
workflow systems --- systems which facilitate the description, modeling,
enactment, and coordination of structured work processes by groups of people.
These systems assist and mediate communication, interaction, understanding, and
synchronization among collaborating processes within organizations. Workflow
techniques have existed for decades but, despite progress in many areas,
intelligent, industrial strength workflow systems are not well established; the
models themselves are too restrictive and the systems lack flexibility, built-in
intelligence, distribution, and a solid theoretic foundation. To advance the
state of the technology, this research has two objectives: (1) the evolution of
a mathematical family of models for description and analysis of organizational
activity, and (2) the development of system architectures to support the
enactment of organizational workflow.The models must enable expression of goals,
temporal constraints, dynamic change, and exception handling. The systems must
enable execution of dynamic, goal-based models; provide coordination and
assistance to users at each opportunity; and take advantage of distributed
computer systems technology. The method to be employed for this research will
include prototyping efforts, methodology development, and studies of work in
selected offices. The final outcome of the research will be a solid foundation
consisting of a family of models, architectures, and methodologies for the
development of future workflow systems.
