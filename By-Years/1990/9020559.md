Economical design of beams and girders normally requires thin webs. With the
advancement in welding technology, pre-manufactured beams with built-up sections
are gradually replacing beams made of rolled shapes in Europe and Japan. The
objective of the proposal is to study the behavior, to failure, of beams and
girders with corrugated webs. The investigation will include identification of
the most efficient shape of corrugation, and the associated methods of forming
and welding. The approach will consist of experimental and analytical
investigations of the behavior of beams and girders with corrugated webs under
in-plane shear, in-plane bending, and combinations thereof. The results will
include semi-empirical methods to predict the ultimate capacity of beams and
girders with corrugated webs and a guide to design criteria.
