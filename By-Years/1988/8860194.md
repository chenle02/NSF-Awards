This research program will develop the mathematical theory underlying the
elicitation of probability distributions for use in Bayesian regression
analyses. Incorporating expert opinion in the form of probability distributions
in essential in applications for which available data are insufficient for
obtaining precise parameter estimates using classical estimating techniques, but
for which substantial information is available in the form of expert knowledge.
Four objectives of Phase I are (1) investigate the relaxation of assumptions
underlying existing elicitation models; (2) develop theory to exploit the
structure of special cases of the normal linear model; (3) develop methods for
eliciting prior information about common statistical models other than the
normal linear model; and (4) develop improved computational techniques when
expert judgements do not lead to closed-form solutions for prior parameters.
Phase II would develop theory more extensively and build a general Bayesian
regression software package.
