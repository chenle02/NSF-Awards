This award provides support to the Department of Biology at Oregon State
University to continue a Research Experience for Undergraduates Site. A 10-week
summer program will provide 10 undergraduates in biological sciences with
research experiences in ecosystem studies at the Andrews Experimental Forest
which is the site for several interdisciplinary projects, including the NSF
sponsored Long-Term Ecological Research Program. Students will learn and develop
skills as they interact and work closely with scientists from several
disciplines on individual projects within the larger coordinated studies. To
foster student development and monitor what careers they pursue after they
complete the program, a 4-phase program is planned: an overview phase which
explains integrated ecosystem studies, an apprenticeship phase to develop
skills, a personal research phase, and an evaluation follow-up phase. According
to their interests, students will join a collaborating scientist for the second
and third phases. The Principal Investigator will coordinate the program,
organize the overview phase, field trips, and seminars, integrating the students
and collaborating scientists, facilitate progress toward independent
questioning, and evaluating results. Students will be housed at the field
station with other researchers, an arrangement that encourages afterhours
discussions and helps break the barriers between disciplines. The project will
place promising students at a scenic research site with an interdisciplinary
team of scientists to produce good science and develop an enthusiasm for
biological research.
