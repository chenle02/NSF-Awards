Researchers will examine the role of climate forcing and landscape character on
the evolution of vegetation cover and soil carbon storage in the central Arctic
foothills of Alaska. A combination of field methods, modeling and
paleoreconstruction will be used to determine the spatial variation of ecosystem
processes on different age landscapes. The results of this study will provide an
indication of expected changes to the carbon balance in the arctic due to
changes in tundra ecology as a result of global climate change. The study is
important for understanding the role of tundra as a source or reservoir of
terrestrial carbon that may be added to or extracted from the atmosphere under
proposed greenhouse climate conditions.
