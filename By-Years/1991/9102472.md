The Memphis State University Center for Electron Microscopy requests funds to
purchase a transmission electron microscope (TEM) for use by faculty and
students of the university. Among the projects depending on this TEM are: 1)
studies of structure and function in cellular components of an unusual
cyanobacterium, TEM of phycobilisomes; 2) TEM of calcium secretion in plants; 3)
development of the plant microsymbiont Frankia as affected by an unusual cell
wall surface layer; 4) immunogold localization of cytokinin in developing legume
root nodules; 5) vetellogenesis in ticks, elucidation of the mechanism of saliva
secretion in ticks; and 6) investigation of cellular events leading to oocyte
maturation.
