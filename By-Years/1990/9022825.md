Decisions that affect environmental quality both influence and respond to
macroeconomic variables. Further, many environmental and macroeconomic
consequences of current actions will have uncompensated effects that outlive the
actors. This project will develop and analyze macroeconomic models exhibiting
intergenerational environmental externalities. The models proposed utilize the
overlapping-generations framework, since this is a simple and natural
demographic structure for macroeconomic analyses of intergenerational concerns.
The project, among other things, will contribute to the "new growth theory",
since it integrates environmental externalities with models of capital
accumulation under external, increasing returns. The aims of the research are
three fold The first goal is to analyze the properties of overlapping-
generations models with intergenerational externalities. Second, the models
developed will be used to investigate the role of macroeconomic policy in
ameliorating environmental problems. Finally, variants of the models will be
developed that permit detailed consideration of specific environmental concerns,
such as recycling and availability of landfill space. This research is important
because it will enhance our understanding of the interaction of economic growth
and environmental issues.
