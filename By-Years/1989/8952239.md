A cell culture facility will be developed with the acquisition of a CO2
incubator, ultracentrifuge, low temperature short and long term storage units,
inverted phases microscope, ultrapure water filtration system, shaking water
bath, laminar flow hood, and water bath. The facility will give all science
majors the opportunity to develop skills in cell culture, since these
experiences will be integrated throughout the curriculum. The facility will
broaden the range of experimental systems faculty can utilize and will be a key
focus in a planned two-semester microscience laboratory course.In addition, pre-
service teachers and pre-professional allied health students will have access to
cell culture. The college will provide 50% matching funds.
