An SGER award will support a study of the feasibility of using changes in
surface potential to measure wear of materials. Tentative results from a
laboratory in Belarus indicate that the technique has substantial potential as
an in situ, non-contact, low-cost method of monitoring wear processes. The work
will initially concentrate on stainless steel and single crystal silicon subject
to wear in a vacuum. The surface potential changes will be measured with a
vibrating capacitor Kelvin probe and correlated with friction and wear behavior.
Once the baseline data have been determined in a vacuum the equipment will be
tested on surfaces sliding in polar molecular liquids, such as water, in order
to test the feasibility of using the technique in lubricated systems. The
Belarus scientist will participate in the initial equipment development and data
analysis.
