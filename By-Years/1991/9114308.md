Solidification processes are ubiquitous in modern technology. They are important
whenever a substance changes from a liquid or gas to a solid, for example when
ice melts or freezes, when silicon or gallium arsenide crystals are grown for
use in semiconductor devices or silver halide crystals grown for film
production, when Alaskan soil freezing patterns are altered by an oil pipeline,
or when zinc dendrites pierce the walls of a lead- zinc battery. Computer
simulation of solidification processes, the subject of this activity, serves two
purposes. When the fundamental physics is under investigation, the theoretical
predictions of any proposed model must be produced and compared with other
models and with experiment. Solidification is sufficiently complex that this
must be done by careful numerical simulation; exact solutions almost never
exist. Once the fundamental physics is well understood, numerical calculations
can produce data inaccessible to experiment and in some situations can even
substitute for experiment. Considerable savings in time and money can be
realized if numerical simulation can be substituted for experiments. The goal of
the research is to develop technology to solve solidification problems which are
presently beyond the reach of numerical simulation. To achieve this goal, the
investigators will combine the best numerical methods available and extend them
to solve more complex problems.
