9310792 Luther In the Arabian Sea, with its water circulation constrained by
land masses on three sides, the seasonal pattern of primary production and decay
driven by the monsoon winds couples with intense heating of surface water to
promote formation of an extensive subsurface zone of low-oxygen water--the
oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). Particulate organic matter produced in the oxygenated
surface ocean sinks into the OMZ, where it may be utilized by microbes that use
sources other than oxygen -- namely, dissolved nitrate, iron, manganese, iodate
-- for respiration. As part of the U.S.JGOFS Arabian Sea Process Study, the
investigators will investigate the role played by iron, manganese, and iodine
oxidation-reduction couples in this process. Such a study will contribute to
answering two larger oceanographic questions: How does the OMZ influence carbon
cycling? Do anaerobic processes dominate in the OMZ? By sampling the water
column in the vicinity of the OMZ at a series of stations and coupling
concentration data with hydrological data on vertical and horizontal transport
rates into a mathematical reaction-transport model, the investigators will
estimate how important these minimally understood oxidation pathways are in the
regional picture of organic carbon oxidation. ***
