9452336 Hopkins Laboratory experiences in molecular and cellular biology are
enhanced by the introduction of new experiments and by making existing
experiments available to larger numbers of students. These experiences benefit
biology and chemistry majors as well as science education and nursing students.
Opportunities are created for students to gain practical experience in
techniques used in research, diagnostics, and genetic testing. Students
undertake the large-scale production, isolation, and purification of DNA and
proteins from microorganisms and eukaryotic cells by using a fermentor, high-
speed centrifuge, and homogenizer, and they characterize these molecules by
polyacrylamide and agarose gel electrophoresis. The students also explore
technologies of molecular probing by fluorescence microscopy and Southern and
Western blotting with nonradioactive probes.
