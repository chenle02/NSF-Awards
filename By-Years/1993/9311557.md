9311557 Barton Research by Dr. Lawrence Barton of the Chemistry Department,
University of Missouri-St. Louis, on metallaboranes is supported by this award
in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program. Work will
concentrate on synthesizing clusters in which more than one bridging hydrogen
atom in hexaborane is replaced by a metal-containing moiety. Using cluster
expansion methods combined with bromide elimination from bromoborane anions,
novel metallaheptaboranes will be prepared and characterized. Tin derivatives of
pentaborane and hexaborane will be prepared and oligomers of the simple
stannylpentaboranes will be synthesized. Because of their usefulness in
organometallic catalysis and their potential as precursors of electronically
important materials, the goal of the project is to extend the types of
metallaboranes which can be prepared and determine their properties. %%% Boron
hydrides form in small regular structures, some of which contain 5, 6, or 7
boron atoms and an appropriate number of hydrogens. While compounds in which
boron has been exchanged by a metal atom have been formed for other boron
hydrides, metallaboranes have not been investigated extensively in these cases.
Dr. Barton will synthesize and study new metal derivatives of penta- and hexa-
boranes. He will also try to form chains of these species, forming solids which
might be useful ceramics for microelectronics. ***
