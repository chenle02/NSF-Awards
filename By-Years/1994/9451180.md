9451180 Menezes A computer algebra laboratory, consisting of Maple running on a
network of SUN workstations, is being created which will enhance an
undergraduate program in applied discrete mathematics. Discrete mathematics is
an important subject for students in many disciplines, and essential for
students majoring in such fields as applied mathematics, computer science,
engineering and education. A primary focus of the project will be on projects to
illustrate the contrasting nature of discrete and continuous problems. Students
will be able to experiment with realistic examples thereby obtain a better
understanding of the underlying mathematics.
