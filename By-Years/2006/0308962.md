The Principal Investigator, an Associate Professor of Statistics, will spend the
11 months of her IGMS award at the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research
(INSTAAR) in Boulder, Colorado. During this time, she will concentrate on
learning and developing a working knowledge of the geophysics used in glaciology
and other cold regions research.

Cold regions researchers have only recently acquired the technology to gather
large amounts of data. However, historically, there has been little interaction
between statisticians and cold regions researchers, so that there is little
statistical modeling of these large data sets. Most of the data have a spatial-
temporal structure, with problems such as missing data and measurement errors.
While the statistical techniques to address these issues exist, these are not
familiar to the cold regions researchers. Similarly, the time and effort
required for a statistician to understand the science behind the data generating
mechanisms is substantial. This award will allow the PI to spend almost a year
at an institute which specializes in cold regions research. The PI will attend
courses and seminars and as her understanding of the science underlying these
projects deepens, she will be better able to analyze the data resulting from
these projects. She will also teach a seminar course for graduate students at
INSTAAR, and develop collaborative research projects with researchers at
INSTAAR. Upon returning to the University of Wyoming. the PI plans on using her
experience and knowledge gained through this IGMS award to further develop
interdisciplinary research opportunities and to develop and provide
interdisciplinary training for students in Statistics, Geology and Geophysics
and other disciplines

Activities (OMA) and the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS).
