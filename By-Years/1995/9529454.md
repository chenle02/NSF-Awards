AST 9529454 Discovery and Analysis of Extremely Low Metallicity Stars,
Horizontal-Branch Stars, and A-Type Stars in the Galaxy. Dr. Beers will continue
a research program of studying a large sample of very metal poor stars. Such
research is valuable for knowledge about nucleosynthesis, the distribution of
elements in metal poor stars, and gradients across our Galaxy in the colors of
horizontal-branch stars. Obtaining the stellar distribution function in
metallicity, kinematics, and space is a good way to try to understand the
formation and evolution of the Galaxy.
