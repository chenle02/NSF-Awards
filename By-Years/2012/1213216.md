In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Steven L. Bernasek and his
coworkers at Princeton University will investigate the fundamental mechanisms of
heterogeneous reaction systems. The function of organic corrosion inhibitors in
corrosive fluid environments will be examined using electrochemical methods and
photoelectron spectroscopy. The structure and reactivity of self-assembled
organic monolayer surfaces will be studied using scanning probe microscopy, with
a focus on understanding the formation of chiral monolayers and nanopatterned
surfaces. Plasmonic sensors based on ordered arrays of gold nanodots deposited
on oxide substrates will be used to monitor surface reaction dynamics of
catalytic oxidation reactions. This work will be carried out in close connection
to measurements of the internal state distributions of the products of these
catalytic oxidation reactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will have
broad impact on the education of graduate and undergraduate research students.
The interdisciplinary nature of the work carried out in this project provides an
excellent training ground for the development of capable researchers.
Interactions with industrial collaborators expose research students to questions
of commercial importance. The fundamental understanding obtained in this
research will have important impact in the development of new corrosion
inhibitors, in the understanding of self-assembly at surfaces, and in the
clarification of the mechanisms of heterogeneous catalytic oxidation processes.
