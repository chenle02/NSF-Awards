Cataret Community College and North Carolina State University are leading a
collaborative effort for articulation between a two-year college and a four-year
institution for technician education and teacher preparation. The three goals
are (1) improving curricular coherence between community college and upper
division courses of study, (2) increasing the retention and success of community
college students after transfer, and (3) providing comprehensive professional
development activities for university, community college, and secondary school
science and mathematics faculty.
