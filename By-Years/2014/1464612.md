Moses Schanfield at the George Washington University (GWU) Department of
Forensic Science will conduct a planning meeting and related activities to
assess interest in forming a Center for Forensic Science (CFS) as a national
Industry-University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for basic research
advancing forensic science. The prospective Center will address needs related to
those called for by the 2009 National Academy of Sciences National Research
Council report ?Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path
Forward.? Forensic science is critical to the criminal justice system and is
fundamentally an interdisciplinary field of science. Technological and
scientific innovation created through scientific and engineering research is
needed to improve the reliability and utility of the work of forensic scientists
in their investigations. Industrial participation is key to translating basic
scientific advances to community application. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;GWU will
plan to serve as an academic research site for the Center. The GWU Department is
large and well established with eleven full-time faculty members that span the
disciplines of forensic toxicology, forensic chemistry (including trace
evidence), forensic molecular biology, crime scene investigation, digital
evidence/computer forensics, forensic pathology, and law. They have garnered
interest from prospective industrial partners representing a diverse array of
interests including DNA collection, mass spectrometry, and investigation of
crimes committed by drones. They will hold a planning meeting with prospective
industrial partners and associates in order to advance creation of a Center to
address the needs of the forensic sciences. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This planning
grant is jointly supported by NSF and the National Institute of Justice.
