The aim of this project is to undertake research for a book on the development
of oceanography in the United States from 1930 through 1970. The project will
focus on the pivotal role played by Roger Revelle and the Scripps Institution of
Oceanography during those formative decades. Special attention will be given to
the contributions made by Revelle and Scripps to the new oceanography of the
deep sea and ocean floor, but will do so by examining the material culture and
political economy within which such work was situated. The project will draw on
collections in the National Archives, the National Academy of Sciences, and at
the Scripps Institution. In turn, the project will contribute to recent
scholarship on big science, on the formative influence of instrumentation and
material culture in science,and on the relationship between science and the
wider society.
