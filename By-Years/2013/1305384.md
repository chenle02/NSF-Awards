The importance of mobile devices and the mobile networks that support
them&lt;br/&gt;can hardly be overemphasized. Despite fantastic advances in
wireless&lt;br/&gt;technologies and mobile devices, current mobile network
architectures,&lt;br/&gt;while packet based, overwhelmingly resemble their
circuit-switched forebears.&lt;br/&gt;To enable the fundamental research and
innovation demanded to advance&lt;br/&gt;mobile networking beyond the state-of-
the-art, a new facility called PhantomNet,&lt;br/&gt;will be developed and
coupled with the Emulab testbed at the University of Utah.&lt;br/&gt;PhantomNet
will be a fully programmable end-to-end mobile testbed with&lt;br/&gt;unique
features to facilitate research efforts at the intersection&lt;br/&gt;of mobile
networking, cloud computing and software defined
networking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PhantomNet will enable hands-on teaching in
mobile networking&lt;br/&gt;technology in a manner that simply does not exist
today. Further,&lt;br/&gt;the facility will enable forward-thinking research
that re-considers&lt;br/&gt;the technical and economic factors involved with the
interplay&lt;br/&gt;between mobile networks, software defined networks and cloud
technologies.&lt;br/&gt;The availability of a physical facility will help
researchers to&lt;br/&gt;transition new mobile network designs from theory into
practice.&lt;br/&gt;Given that a large fraction of the world's population are
already&lt;br/&gt;users of such networks, and that fraction is growing, the
research&lt;br/&gt;enabled by this infrastructure will have the potential to
have truly&lt;br/&gt;transformative impact.
