Students are learning by exploration and experimenting with graphs in pre-
calculus using the text by Demana and Waits. The learning experience is enhanced
by an expanded computer laboratory with Macintosh computers running Mathemtica.
The former laboratory supported a revised calculus curriculum and the expanded
laboratory will enhance these improvements and revised courses in linear
algebra, differential equations, and multivariable calculus.
