This action funds Maximo Andrew Navarro of University of Central Florida to
conduct a research project, entitled "Spontaneous shape and phase changes over
time in Lanthanum-based Perovskite crystal structures," during the summer of
2012 at National Tsing Hua University in Hsinchu, Taiwan. The host scientist is
Dr. Sanboh Lee.

Lanthanum cobaltite is the parent compound of the system that is a mixed
electronic and oxide-ion conductor of technical interest for oxygen separation
membranes, the cathode of solid oxide fuel cells, oxygen sensors, and catalysis.
The Intellectual Merit of this research project lies in the insight gained from
measuring physical properties and behaviors of lanthanum cobaltite under
specific types of mechanical stresses, including tensile, microhardness, and
nanoindentation tests. The experiments also address the phase changes that
lanthanum cobaltite in specific environments and conditions.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
