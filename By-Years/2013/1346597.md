The proposed grant will promote the design, development and analysis of embedded
and networked sensor technologies, systems, and applications by encouraging
student participation in the ACM Sensys 2013 conference. Besides technical paper
presentations, Sensys, through this grant, will be able to stimulate several
intellectual activities by students. Furthermore, the conference offers several
opportunities for intellectually stimulating discussions between the students
and researchers from around the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The participation
of students in Sensys can have an important impact on their development as a
junior researcher. The grant will also promote diversity by encouraging and
enabling women and other underrepresented minorities to participate.
