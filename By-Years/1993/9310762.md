9310762 Graessley It is proposed to develop a broad base of fundamental
information on the melt state thermodynamics of polyolefin blends. This will be
accomplished by a combination of techniques -- small-angle neutron scattering to
evaluate thermodynamic interactions in the single phase region, laser light
scattering to confirm the location of phase boundaries, and equation-of-state
measurements to assist interpretation and generalization of the results. The
previous studies with model polyolefins, synthesized by saturating the double
bonds on nearly monodisperse polydienes, will be extended. Structurally uniform
polyolefins with well-defined molecular weight distributions, made by
metallocene (single site) catalysts, will now be included. Aside from supplying
thermodynamic information for an extremely important class of polymeric
materials, the proposed work will provide tests of current theories of
thermodynamics for polymeric mixtures where the local interactions are simple,
at least in principle, and the local structures are well defined. The result
will be useful in guiding the development of new blends based on polyolefins as
well as the mixing of structures in plastics recycling. ***
