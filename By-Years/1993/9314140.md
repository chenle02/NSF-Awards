9314140, PI-Flierl: This proposal is directed to the study of the meandering and
eddy production of western boundary currents, both in the case when they flow in
mid-ocean (i.e. the Gulf Stream) and when they follow the coast (i.e. The East
Australian Current). While these motions are generally ascribed to instabilities
of the flow, they generally occur in the form of pulses and develop both in
space and time. This project will address the linear and non-linear dynamics of
pulses and other perturbations on jets. The work will combine a number of
analytical and numerical techniques. The different perspectives offered by the
various process models will complement each other to provide a more detailed
picture of the dynamics. The results will suggest new approaches for analyzing
the oceanic data on meandering and eddy processes.
