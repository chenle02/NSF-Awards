The American Mathematical Society Summer Research Institute in Algebraic
Geometry will be held July 13-31, 2015 on the campus of the University of Utah
in Salt Lake City. Since the 1960s, the US algebraic geometry community has
organized decennial meetings under the auspices of the American Mathematical
Society. These extended summer conferences summarized progress in the field and
pointed to future developments. The resulting proceedings volumes have been
valuable references for generations of algebraic geometers. As the field has
grown, these meetings help different communities within algebraic geometry keep
in contact and current on the broader trends in the field. This award supports
travel and local expenses for approximately 200 of the anticipated 600
participants in the 2015 summer research institute.

The last decade has seen major advances in arithmetic geometry, birational
geometry, derived algebraic geometry, derived categories of coherent sheaves,
enumerative geometry, geometric representation theory, Hodge theory, Kaehler-
Einstein metrics and stability, and p-adic geometry. The institute will offer
morning plenary talks by top experts summarizing recent progress, and afternoon
parallel seminars with more detailed discussion of relevant techniques. The
institute will support participation by many young researchers, as their
exposure to the breadth of modern algebraic geometry will set the research
agenda for the coming decades. More details about the institute can found at the
following two websites:
