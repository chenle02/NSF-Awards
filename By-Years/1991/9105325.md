The goal of the proposed work is the development of detailed three-dimensional
models of inner lead bonds in TAB devices. The models will be used to determine
the effect of various bond defects on mechanical performance of the bond and to
determine new experimental approaches to measuring bond quality. The proposed
analytical technique relies on finite element analysis and incorporation of
analysis developed by other researchers into a phenomenological model. The
proposed experimental techniques uses a magnetically driven manipulator to apply
a well controlled shear force at precise locations of the bond.
