The proposed study is intended to further understanding of the importance of
translational rate to gene expression. Synonomous codons are used with greatly
unequal frequencies. The assay described herein has been used to measure
translational rates for 29 sense codons. Translational rates cover a 25.fold
range and rate correlates with codon frequency. Differences in rate are caused
by differences both of tRNA concentrations and rate constants for tRNA
selection. Other work shows that activities of individual codons can be modified
by the surrounding message nucleotides (context). A lacZ allele is engineered
such that expression depends on the rate of translation of a single codon.
Site.directed mutagenesis will be used to systematically vary the critical codon
so that the relative rates of tRNA selection canbe measured for every codon at
the same message site in living E.coli. Further, the message context of selected
codons will be systematically altered to determine the effects of message
context on translational rate. It explain how biased codon usage and message
context affect translational efficiency. The process by which the information
encoded in a gene is decoded into a finished protein product involves a number
of steps, among them transcription, in which a messenger RNA is made from the
gene, and translation, in which the sequence of bases in the messenger RNA is
converted, in accordance with rules of the genetic code,into a sequence of amino
acids, which is then assembled into protein. For life to proceed, it is
obviously essential that the rate of error (i.e., choice of an incorrect base or
amino acid) be kept extremely low. The mechanisms by which the error rates are
kept as low as they are only partly understood. The work proposed herein will
elucidate some of these mechanisms.
