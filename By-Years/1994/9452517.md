9452517 Rice The Physics department at Miami University is committed to
providing scholarly experience for students in modern optics, stressing
theoretical, experimental, and applied aspects. With the equipment requested in
this grant, we wish to extend our capabilities to include nonlinear optical
effects and high resolution spectroscopy into our laboratories. In the Optics
and Laser Physics course experiments dealing with second-harmonic generation,
phase conjugation, image processing, and AM modulation of laser beams are
proposed. Also, we wish to obtain low cost laser diodes to develop more atomic
spectroscopy labs, with higher resolution than presently available at our
facility. With grating feedback to obtain narrow linewidths, these diodes
present a low- cost method to investigate hyperfine structure for example. The
laboratory experiments resulting from the equipment acquisition proposed herein
would provide undergraduates experience with laser and spectroscopic
applications, concepts, and techniques in the forefront of research that are
utilized in modern optics laboratories across the nation.
