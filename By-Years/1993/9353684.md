An eight-member coalition of minority engineering organizations, committed to
ensuring the participation of African Americans, American Indians and Hispanics
in science and engineering will: o Conduct a qualitative and quantitative self-
assessment of each organization's programs and services to determine what works
and why and to use this as a basis for restructuring individual organizational
activities and for developing a comprehensive agenda for the coalition; o
Develop operating strategies and procedures for networking the strengths of
individual organizations more effectively with one another and with existing NSF
efforts, in particular the Alliances for Minority Participation and the
Comprehensive Regional Centers for Minorities, to help these alliances and
coalitions accomplish their objectives; o Define a leadership role for each
organization that contributes cohesively to the coalition effort and details the
modifications to be made by each organization to ensure optimum performance of
assigned tasks and services; o Develop a comprehensive, long-term plan for the
coalition which outlines the proposed activities and the operational framework,
including any structural changes required of the individual organizations in
order to accomplish the coalition's objectives.
