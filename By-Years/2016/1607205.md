The goal of this project is to provide a unique opportunity for about 16
database students to present their research results, learn cutting edge
research, and interact with internationally recognized researchers from both
academia and industry at the Association for Computing Machinery's Special
Interest Group on Management of Data (ACM SIGMOD) 2016 Conference
(http://sigmod2016.org/) that will be held June 26 - July 1, 2016 in San
Francisco, California. As one of the most prestigious conferences in data
management research, ACM SIGMOD and the associated Symposium on Principles of
Database Systems (PODS) have contributed significantly to the advance of all
aspects of data management technologies and applications since 1975. Besides
meeting with researchers from academia and industry during regular program
sessions, in SIGMOD/PODS 2016 students will be able to participate in the
following interactive activities as partially supported by this project: a new
researcher symposium, an undergraduate research poster competition, face-to-face
meetings with leading researchers, and a student mentoring workshop. These
opportunities will have a long lasting impact on the future career of the
participants. This award will provide partial support for students from U.S.
institutions, especially female and minority students.

ACM SIGMOD/PODS is a dynamic and comprehensive program for publication,
education, and interaction; and it is a leading international forum for database
researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore cutting-edge ideas
and results and to exchange techniques, tools, and experiences. ACM SIGMOD/PODS
plays a significant role in training the future generation of leaders and
workforce in the critical field of data management.
