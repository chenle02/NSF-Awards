This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
program. It is a study of citizen discourse concerning the 1990 Iraq War, based
on transcripts of recorded radio and television talk programs. To examine the
impact of elite discourse, primarily the words of political leaders, on citizen
speech, this research project will analyze the narrative structure, to use of
symbols and ideographs, and the characteristics of key figure. In addition, an
institutional analysis will develop both an empirical and theoretical account of
the radio talk call-in show and its relationship to American public life. This
study will systematically examine an important new arena of social and political
debate in the United States, to learn how powerfully the words of societal
leaders shape the ways ordinary citizens express themselves and to chart the
structure and function of this new cultural institution. In addition to the
scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award will materially
assist a highly promising student in completing research for the Ph.D.
dissertation. Thus it contributes to future scientific manpower and the thorough
training of the next generation of sociologists.
