Trapping and cooling of atoms in the gas phase has been a major area of research
for many years, dominated by the method of laser cooling. Although very
successful, laser cooling has been limited to a small set of atoms in the
periodic table. In a recent breakthrough, a general two-step approach to
trapping and cooling was developed. These new methods will be further optimized,
and applied towards trapping and cooling of atomic hydrogen and deuterium in a
simple room temperature apparatus.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Development of general
methods for trapping and cooling of almost any atom in the periodic table will
open new directions in physics. In particular, trapping and cooling of
hydrogenic atoms will enable in the future more precise spectroscopy, important
for atomic and nuclear physics. The same methods can be applied to cooling of
anti-hydrogen, enabling a more precise test of fundamental symmetries. This work
will enable in the future precision measurement of beta decay of trapped
ultracold atomic tritium, relevant to the question of neutrino mass. The broader
impact on education and diversity is training and support of two graduate
students from underrepresented minorities.
