9302748 Caruthers The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and the
Cooperative Institute for Research in the Environmental Sciences (CIRES) at the
University of Colorado are requesting funds from the National Science Foundation
to purchase a sequential stopped-flow spectrophotometer with both fluorescence
and UV/vis detection. This instrument will play an important role in the
education of graduate and post-doctoral students and in the research of faculty
members in areas as diverse as organic chemistry, analytical chemistry and
biochemistry.
