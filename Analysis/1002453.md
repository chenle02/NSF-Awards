This project will focus on the study of topics in complex analysis in one and
several variables and in related geometric theories. The work is motivated by
the observation that with respect to linear fractional transformations, certain
structures in higher dimensions behave like their one-dimensional counterparts.
The principal investigator will study ten interconnected problems that divide
roughly into three areas: i) the study of estimates for the norm and spectrum of
the Leray transform, a multivariate analogue of the Cauchy transform; ii) in
higher dimensions, the local and global characterization of surfaces in terms of
invariant curvatures and kernel symmetries; and iii) the study of the Szego
projector and Bergman projector under proper holomorphic maps and on weighted
spaces. In addition, the principal investigator will supervise undergraduate
students on projects involving the study of problems that arise in the linear
fractional geometry of the dual and double planes, and for the case of the
complex plane, involving the continued study of an implementation of the
Kerzman-Stein method as it pertains to the computation of canonical domain
functions. Several complex variables has a rich history of providing a context
in which techniques from analysis and geometry support each other in important
ways. This began with the pioneering work of Hartogs in the 1900's and it
continued with the work of Oka in the 1950's. It was followed by work of Chern,
Hormander, and Kohn, and more recently, for instance, by work of Catlin,
D'Angelo, and Webster. The proposed work will follow in this tradition by
drawing together elements of analysis and geometry in order to draw new
connections in complex analysis between one and several variables. Essential to
the project will be the involvement of undergraduate students who will
participate directly in the research. Students will work in teams of two doing
original research on geometric and computational problems that are motivated by
the study of one complex variable. They will be expected to present their work
externally and to publish their work in suitable journals. The end result is
that there will be more students who are excited about mathematics, who have
experienced the benefits of collaborative research, and who are better prepared
for graduate work in mathematics. In this way the project also contributes to
the greater mathematical and scientific infrastructure.
