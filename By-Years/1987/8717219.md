Meaningful participation by U.S. astronomers in the meetings of the
International Astronomical Union is important. Over one- quarter of the active
U.S. research astronomers are working on projects in collaboration with foreign
scientists. Several large foreign instruments which have unique capabilities are
routinely used by U.S. astronomers. The largest and most important international
meeting is the General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union (IAU).
In 1988 the General Assembly will be held in the United States; providing an
unparalleled opportunity for young U.S. astronomers to meet and develop working
relationships with their counterparts from foreign countries. Unlike many other
international scientific unions, the IAU emphasizes scientific sessions and
presentation of research results. The IAU also stresses attendance and full
participation by young scientists. It is important for the continued health of
astronomy in the U.S. that American scientists be able to participate in these
meetings. The American Astronomical Society (AAS) will organize a program of
grants for travel to attend the IAU General Assembly. Applications for travel to
the General Assembly will be accepted by the AAS, and awards will be decided by
a selection committee chosen by the U.S. National Committee for the IAU. The
travel grant program will be publicized by the AAS at its meetings and through
continuing announcements in the AAS Newsletter.
