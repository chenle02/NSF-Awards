The objective of this project is to study discretizations of mechanical systems
with constraints. This study is motivated by the facts that such discretizations
may be used for numerical simulations of mechanical systems and that problems of
studying periodic motions in mechanics and control are intrinsically discrete.
The proposed research is aimed at two areas: (i) Structurally-stable and
structure-preserving discretizations of systems with velocity constraints. The
dynamics of systems with velocity constraints is remarkably diverse. The goal is
the development of discrete dynamical systems that adequately represent the
continuous-time constrained dynamics. (ii) The use of such discretizations in
stabilization of periodic orbits of mechanical systems. It is anticipated that
such control techniques will be especially useful in cases when the period is
long and/or intrinsic structure of controlled systems should be preserved during
numerical simulations.

The dynamics of systems with constraints is important in various industrial and
scientific applications. Such constraints include rolling and sliding
constraints, chained rigid links, and various constraints found in
thermodynamics and electromechanical systems. There are numerous instances in
industry, engineering and science where such constraints arise: robotics, the
dynamics of wheeled vehicles, and the motion of satellites in space are
examples. In applications, stabilization of periodic motions may be desirable--
for example in achieving a desired robotic or autonomous vehicle motion. Our
methods should be helpful in analyzing and prescribing motions of constrained
systems, such as robotic and autonomous vehicles.
