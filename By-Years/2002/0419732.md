This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project will
develop methods to automatically image and detect the early embryo in the
chicken egg while sustaining hatch. A freshly laid fertile egg contains
quiescent cells known collectively as the blastoderm. The blastoderm is covered
by a membrane, and its position is not fixed as it rotates freely near the yolk
surface. Automation of either the injection or sampling process mandates a
procedure that automates the imaging of the blastoderm. Research will focus on
optimizing hardware and software to produce an imaging system that can be used
to sense the blastoderm in two dimensions.

The commercial application of this project will be on the poultry industry, for
production of pharmaceuticals in eggs and / or for producing transgenic chickens
with superior traits.
