Professor Li will investigate the relationship between eigenvalue algorithms
and integrable Hamiltonian systems. Together with his collaborators, he has
proved the complete integrablity of the Toda (QL) flows on orbits through
generic symmetric matrices. Further research will focus on the Hamiltonian
structure and the question of complete integrability for the LU flows, the
Chloesky flows and the extension of the Toda flows to nonsymmetric matrices.
Professor Li will also investigate two related classes of flows which are
important derivates of the Toda flows and are linkeed to the QL family of
algorithms, such as QZ and SVD. These flows are not isospectral, but one of them
preserves singular values of matrices, while the other preserves eigenvalues of
matrix pencils. This research is part of theoretical efforts aimed at a better
understanding of computational methods related to matrix eigenvalue problems.
