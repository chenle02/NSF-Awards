In this project funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Maroncelli will study solvation, spectroscopy, and dynamics
in supercritical fluids (SCF) and expanded-liquid mixtures. Computational and
spectroscopic techniques will be used to obtain a molecular-level understanding
of fluid environments near their critical points. Static and time-resolved
electronic spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations will be applied to
study solvation and its influence on excited-state charge-transfer reactions in
prototypical dipolar, quadrupolar and nondipolar solvents. Time-resolved Stokes-
shift experiments on solutes in supercritical fluids will probe local solute-
solvent dynamics. Gas-expanded liquids will be studied as potential anti-
solvents that may be capable of selective precipitation. Results of this project
will impact not only research on supercritical fluids, but also more general
areas such as the dynamics of regular liquids, dipolar and ion solvation,
dielectric friction, optical line shapes, spectral shifts, and modelling of
interaction potentials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The molecular interactions within a
liquid and those between solvent and solute molecules have been the object of
numerous studies. Supercritical fluids are materials in a low density state that
lacks the distinction between liquid and gaseous states. Currently SCFs are
receiving considerable attention due to the possibility of interesting and
technologically important applications in materials processing. However, our
understanding of these complex systems is far from complete. The well balanced
combination of experiments and simulation in this project will provide critical
tests for models of solutes and solvents and helps train students in a growing
field with both technological and fundamental relevance.&lt;br/&gt;
