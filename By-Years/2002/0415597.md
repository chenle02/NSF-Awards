Regulation of a disease resistance gene by the Arabidopsis BON1

Disease resistance (R) genes are central for specificity determination of
defense responses in plants. The molecular mechanisms of R gene regulation are
not well understood. The Arabidopsis BON1 gene has been identified as a negative
regulator of a rapidly-evolved R gene, SNC1. BON1 belongs to an evolutionarily
conserved copine family possibly involved in membrane trafficking and signaling.
How SNC1 is regulated by BON1 and what cellular processes BON1 modulates will be
addressed in this study. First, the biochemical activities BON1 uses to regulate
SNC1 will be determined. Second, the hypothesis that BON1 regulates SNC1 protein
activity will be tested. Third, the role of a BON1 partner, BAP1, in SNC1
regulation will be investigated. Last, components mediating BON1 repression of
SNC1 will be identified by isolating SNC1 interacting proteins and bon1-1
suppressors.

This study is one of the first efforts to dissect at the molecular and genetic
levels the regulation of an R protein activity by a plant protein that is
probably involved in basic cellular processes. Revelation about how BON1
regulates SNC1 will generate insight into the mechanisms of R protein activation
and the evolution of R genes. These experiments will also likely shed light on
the mechanisms by which activation of defense responses occurs by an impairment
in growth and development. Furthermore, the function of BON1 uncovered in
Arabidopsis will serve as a model for functions of its copine homologs in
humans, and thus enhance an understanding of other copine-involved biological
processes, such as neuronal activity regulation.

The elucidation of regulation of defense responses by BON1 will likely provide
tools to create or breed crops with desired growth and defense features, thus
improving food production in a sustainable way. In addition to training a
graduate student and a postdoctoral fellow, the proposed research will provide
research opportunities for master's students who will become high school
teachers and undergraduate students, including ones who are under-represented in
science. The scientific discoveries from this study will be disseminated through
journal publications and presentations at symposia and conferences by
undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral personnel.
