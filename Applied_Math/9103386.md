This project continues studies in near-integrable systems, concentrating on
four main problems: solution of the small-dispersion KdV equation, the Toda
shock problem, the small-dispersion long-time limit of the nonlinear Schrodinger
equation, and relations of inverse scattering theory to nearly integrable
evolution equations. Integrable systems of partial differential equations often
have solutions whose properties can be exactly established. This is quite unlike
the usual case for nonlinear partial differential equations. What is important
here is that often the properties remain when the system is perturbed. Thus one
can tell a great deal about otherwise intractable problems. Such problems arise
in nonlinear optics (for example, in the design of long-distance communication
networks using fiber optics), in the motion of waves in nonlinear acoustic
media, and in flows around thin wings.
