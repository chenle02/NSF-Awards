Research:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to elucidate the
concept of self-assembled arrays of engineered nanowires, where each nanowire
can be addressed individually as a chemicalnanosensor. To that end, the PI will
synthesize engineered metal-oxide-metal (MOM)nanowires, comprising of a noble-
metal nanowires with a small segment being replaced by ananocrystalline sensor
oxide: SnO2. In other words, a MOM nanowire has a nanoscale SnO2cylinder of
precise dimensions with integral noble-metal nanowire interconnects. The
MOMnanowires sensors are expected to have unprecedented sensitivity and
selectivity due to:&lt;br/&gt;(i) nanoscale SnO2 segment, (ii) nanocrystalline
grains within the SnO2, (iii) noble-metal&lt;br/&gt;nanowire interconnect
serving as an integral catalyst, and (iv) low temperature-sensitivity and low
Ohmic losses. Moreover, MOM nanowires offer the rare opportunity of measuring
directly the electrical conductivity of a nanoscale sensor
material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
will result in the training of a number of graduate and undergraduate students
in the area of nanosensor research, while exposing them to an international
collaboration with the National Chemical Laboratory, Pune, India. In addition,
the PI will perform K-12 outreach to get high school students excited about
careers in engineering.&lt;br/&gt;
