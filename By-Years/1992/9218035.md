Massive stars end their lives in violent explosions known as supernovae. Based
on observations there are several types of supernovae but there remain questions
about which stars produce which type of supernova. Many of the details of the
explosions are still not well understood. Improved light curve and spectral
calculations for types Ia, Ib and Ic supernovae and the nebular phase of SN
1987A will be made. Degenerate carbon ignition is thought to be the cause of one
type of supernova and this will be modelled for comparison with observation. The
observation of super novae from McDonald Observatory and studies of the rates of
supernovae of various types will also be undertaken.
