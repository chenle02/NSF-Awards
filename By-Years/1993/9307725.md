9214852 Glicksman Experimental and theoretical studies are conducted on the
geometric evolution and kinetics of microstructures in two-phase binary alloys.
The two main thrusts of the research are: (1) creation of a suitable data
statistical framework for describing the average geometrical trajectories of
complex 3-dimensional microstructures evolving from their initial phase
transformation states toward thermodynamic equilibrium; and (2) companion
experiments which provide precision stereological data to quantify observed
microstructural changes occurring under well defined conditions of composition,
temperature, phase fraction, etc. The microstructural trajectories are
themselves described quantitatively on a geometric phase plane". Experiments
include isochronal annealing studies, both with and without an applied magnetic
field to eliminate microconvection in solid-liquid alloys, then analyzed
stereologically with a new image processing tool. %%% This study should add
fundamental understanding of how complex, technologically important systems
evolve geometrically and kinetically during processing and approach
thermodynamic equilibrium. ***
