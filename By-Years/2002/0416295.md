&lt;br/&gt;In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division and the Atmospheric Chemistry Program of the
Division of Atmospheric Sciences, Professor Vaida of the University of Colorado
at Boulder will conduct a research program on hydrated complexes by means of a
variety of physical chemistry techniques. The target species to be investigated
include the water-ammonia, water-sulfuric acid, water-nitric acid, and water-
carbon dioxide complexes. These, and others, play a role in the chemistry of the
earth's atmosphere and its climate. The project consists of four specific tasks:
1) to determine high-resolution infrared, visible, and ultraviolet absorption
spectra for the target species; 2) to study their photochemistry and
photochemical product formation; 3) to determine temperature-dependent
equilibrium constants; and 4) to study these species by high-resolution
electronic and overtone spectroscopy. Graduate and undergraduate students will
participate in this research, as will a significant number of collaborators from
other countries. &lt;br/&gt;
