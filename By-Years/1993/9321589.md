9321589 GILBERT This project will utilize both morphological (from all life
stages) and molecular (sequence data from the 12S region of the mtDNA genome)
data to address phylogeny or the pattern of relationships among species in two
genera of passion-vine butterflies. Much research has already been done with
these fascinating insects and a well substantiated phylogeny will allow testing
of several hypotheses concerning reproductive strategies, host plant
associations and mimicry. %%% These tropical butterflies represent an important
model system for studying patterns of mimicry in predator avoidance and other
important areas of behavioral ecology. Sound knowledge of the relationships
among species in this group of butterflies will enhance understanding of
mimicry, host plant associations and other features of their biology. Studying
such model systems can contribute to our understanding of insect groups and
their shifts in host plant associations, thereby shedding light on mechanisms of
host shifts such as those that occur when new insect pests of crops begin posing
economic problems. ***
