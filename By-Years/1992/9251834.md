This project provides undergraduate aerospace engineering students in design
courses the means rapidly to manufacture accurate prototypes or scale models of
parts they have designed, without recourse to skilled labor and well within the
time constraints of a one semester course. To do so, the University employs an
apparatus (Stereolithographic press ) which can use a CAD solid modeler
database, already generated by students in the process of finalizing their
designs, to produce prototypes as three-dimensional plastic solids. Three-
dimensional printing (stereolithography) is safe, dependable, state-of-the-art
technology, well beyond the development stage, and already coming into wide use
in industry. This project represents a pioneering use of this new technology,
embodied in a commercially available apparatus, as a tool to bring the issue of
producibility into the educational experience of engineering graduates. The
project is significant because it addresses the urgent national need to
strengthen the design and manufacturing content of undergraduate engineering
curricula while providing the crucial linkage between those two important
aspects of production.
