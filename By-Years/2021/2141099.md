The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation -
Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to greatly reduce malalignments and
associated complications from femoral (thigh bone) fracture surgery. More than
half of all fractures occur in long bones like the femur. In the United States,
430,000 femur fractures occur annually; and globally, motor vehicle accidents
cause an estimated 1-3 million femoral shaft fractures each year. Surgery to
manually align long bones is arduous and difficult due to the bone’s elongated
anatomy and the opposing strength of the surrounding muscles, requiring the
surgeon and medical staff to exert high traction forces during the procedure.
Poor alignment of the bone fragments is a potentially serious complication, and
one-third of patients experiencing this require additional corrective surgery
that increases costs and more complications. The proposed robot reduces
healthcare costs by eliminating repeated operations and decreasing procedure
times. This benefits patients, surgeons, and hospitals by improving patient
outcomes and reduces the cost of care. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
project develops an orthopedic surgical robotic system for long-bone fracture
surgeries. A malrotation of 15° or more occurs in 28% of patients. Malalignment
leads to leg-length discrepancies and abnormal gait. The proposed concept
consists of a surgical robot, bone-gripping system, and force-feedback
controller to manipulate the robot. This enables the surgeon to accurately apply
large traction forces and precisely align the fractured bone. The proposed
architecture consists of a 3-armed manipulator with two wide-open rings; it
facilitates positioning the leg inside the robot, providing a large workspace
for surgical maneuvers. The objectives are to: (1) optimize the design to
provide highly accurate alignment of bone segments and (2) develop a force-
feedback controller to accurately align bone segments, coupled with software to
predict muscle forces. To achieve these objectives, the research will employ
mechanical design optimization, analytical modeling, computation,
experimentation, and testing on cadavers. The outcome will be a robotic platform
that can be further integrated with image-guided path-planning algorithms for
anatomic alignment of long-bone fractures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
