Fundamental studies of the dependence of the InAlAs/InP band offset on strain
will be conducted by measuring photoluminescence from the Type II staggered
InAlAs/InP interface as a function of pressure using a diamond anvil cell. The
interplay between the deleterious effects of interface roughness introduced by
atomic exchange of arsenic and phosphorus, and the benefits produced by strain
will be explored; it is anticipated that the ability to tune the strain through
the use of hydrostatic pressure will provide fundamental information on the
nature of this unique material. %%% Research will be conducted on the factors
that influence the electronic and optical properties of a particular compound
semiconductor material combination with potential advantages in electronics and
photonics applications. This research is expected to give a fundamental
understanding of the effect of strain on basic material properties and
performance. The semiconductor material combination under study has wide
applicability in electronic and optoelectronic devices; understanding the
effects of strain on electronic and optical properties is also expected to
improve the performance of advanced devices and integrated circuits used in
computing, information processing, and telecommunications.
