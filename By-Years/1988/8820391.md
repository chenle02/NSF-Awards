The objectives of this research are to determine the structures of the surfaces
of various thin-film electronic materials using the techniques of low-energy ion
scattering (LEIS) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Systems to be studied
include: monolayer films of ferromagnetic iron and nickel on silver(001)
surfaces, thin heteroepitaxial films of copper-chlorine on silicon(111), the
chemical interaction of gold atoms with gallium-arsenic(110), and the gold-
catalyzed oxidation of silicon surfaces. The two complementary techniques will
be employed to construct accurate atomic resolution models of these systems and
the substrates on which they are supported. A new mathematical algorithm will be
developed for calculating the angular distributions of low-energy particles
scattered from solid surfaces. The ion scattering apparatus will be modified to
permit time-of-flight detection of scattered ions and neutrals. This will
facilitate study of charge exchange mechanisms on an attosecond time scale
between ions and surfaces.
