This planning grant provides the time and resources necessary for the staff of
Eastern Oregon State College to research and develop a full grant. The full
proposal will deliver content and dissemination technology in ecology education
to elementary school teachers. The topic is central to the economy of the region
and the technology necessary to deliver the project is already in place. The
planning process is carried out in collaboration with the Oregon State
University Agricultural Program, the Blue Mountain Natural Resources Institute,
the Oregon Department of Education, and the ED-NET. The planning process
includes an assessment of the needs, an inventory of current conditions, an
examination of the necessary technologies, and a plan for dissemination. Through
a mini-conference and periodic meetings, the full proposal will take shape. The
cost sharing for the planning grant is estimated at 44%
