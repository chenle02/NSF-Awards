A.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Transcendental
numbers and special analytic functions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
investigator proposes to work on several&lt;br/&gt;problems about transcendental
numbers and special&lt;br/&gt;values of analytic functions, in order
to&lt;br/&gt;understand the many links between analytic and&lt;br/&gt;arithmetic
quantities. In one project, this&lt;br/&gt;research explores properties of
numbers arising in&lt;br/&gt;positive characteristic from Anderson-
Drinfeld&lt;br/&gt;motives, such as periods and logarithms, and
in&lt;br/&gt;particular focuses on the algebraic relations&lt;br/&gt;among
Carlitz logarithms. Furthermore, in&lt;br/&gt;collaboration with N.
Ramachandran, the&lt;br/&gt;investigator plans to study the
relationships&lt;br/&gt;between extension groups of abelian varieties
over&lt;br/&gt;number fields and special values of Hecke&lt;br/&gt;L-functions
and Rankin-Selberg L-functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the fundamental
branches of modern&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, number theory serves as the basis
for&lt;br/&gt;many applications, including cryptography and&lt;br/&gt;coding
theory. The proposed research considers&lt;br/&gt;questions involving the
interplay between&lt;br/&gt;arithmetic and analytic aspects of number
theory,&lt;br/&gt;which have their beginnings in classical work
of&lt;br/&gt;Euler and Gauss. Several parts of the project&lt;br/&gt;lead
naturally to problems for graduate and&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
