The objective of this project is to develop and optimize methods for the
detection of unknown DNA strands by the adhesion of micro-sized particles
bearing DNA to surfaces bearing complementary strands of DNA. Such techniques
would combine DNA hybridization as a high fidelity means of identifying unknown
strands, with bead based adhesion, in which the large number of complementary
strands leads to a higher signal-to-noise in DNA detection, as well as a sharper
dependence on external variables that affect binding, such as temperature,
molecular density and flow rate. Furthermore, the use of micro-sized particles
would lead to simple optical detection of binding, which would facilitate and
broaden the methods for detection. The methods developed here will be useful for
the detection of foreign DNA from pathogenic bacteria, and thus be useful for
pathogen detection and the national defense against bioterrorism.
