Prostaglandins and leukotrienes are two groups of compounds which are important
biological regulators. They are synthesized from 20 carbon fatty acids found in
cell membranes of many organisms. A great deal is known about the structure and
function of these compounds in mammals, but the information is limited in non-
mammalian vertebrates. In mammals, prostaglandins are involved in inflammatory
responses, cardivascular regulation, blood clotting, and reproductive
physiology, among other functions. Leukotrienes are involved in allergic
reactions. Thus, regulation of the synthesis and actions of these compounds is
important to human medicine. It is important to examine poikilothermic animals
such as amphibians and fish, since they respond to changes in environmental
temperature with dramatic alterations in their physiological and biochemical
parameters. The ratios of the 20 carbon fatty acid precursors change in animals
exposed to different environmental temperatures, and chemical reactions involved
in synthesis may be faster or slower depending on the temperature or the other
membrane fatty acids which are present. This research will examine the synthesis
of prostaglandins and leukotrienes and investigate their biological roles in
amphibians and fish. Dr. Herman has discovered that leukotrienes have different
effects on the heart and on blood pressure of amphibians than they do on blood
pressure in mammals. The reasons for the differences will be studied. The
possibility that these animals produce novel compounds with different biological
effects will be investigated. This information will provide a better
understanding of the synthesis and biological roles of these important regulator
compounds
