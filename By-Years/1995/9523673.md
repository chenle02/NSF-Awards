9552899 Auchincloss This two year project brings together 24 women each year who
will be entering either the 10th or 11th grade in the fall. They will
participate in hands-on, research experiences in physics in a non-residential
five week summer program. The women are chosen from the immediate surroundings
of Rochester. The morning portions of their experience is in laboratory
experiences which are discovery based. The afternoons is spent in touring of
laboratories in the area and working on research projects. During the project
and academic year follow-up they learn more about women in physics and complete
their projects including writing a paper about it and presenting it.
