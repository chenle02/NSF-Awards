The main aims of this project are in three directions. (a) To advance existing
approaches and to develop new methods for the rigorous asymptotic solution of
integrable nonlinear wave equations, primarily the nonlinear Schroedinger
equation, in the small dispersion limit; also to understand how the structure of
the solution, critically affected by the modulational instability, depends on
the degree of smoothness of the initial data. (b) To develop methods within the
theory of integrable and near-integrable wave equations to deal with wave
reflection from boundaries and time dependent forcing. (c) To develop numerical
and analytical tools for the study of electromagnetic resonant fields and
surface wave phenomena in periodic and random photonic crystal slabs with as
well as without the presence of nonlinearity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTEGRABLE
WAVE PROPAGATION is often a very good approximation to physical wave propagation
in real materials (e.g. the nonlinear Schroedinger equation and its
perturbations model transmission of light in fiber optics), and related
mathematical aspects like the modulational instability play a crucial role in
the optimal design of communications systems. PHOTONIC CRYSTALS, first developed
in the eighties, allow light to be trapped in or guided through regions of
dimensions comparable to its wavelength. They are already in use in microwave
antennas, low threshold lasers and other devices. In most of their current
applications they function as linear devices. We investigate nonlinear behavior
and therefore pay particular attention to resonant behavior, which generates
large fields for which the nonlinearity of the medium plays a central
role.&lt;br/&gt;
