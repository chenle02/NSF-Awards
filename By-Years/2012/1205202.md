This project will use computer simulations to explore the consequences of
gravitational collapse and the formation of black holes and spacetime
singularities. The small scale structure of general singularities will be
studied in detail. In particular the suitability of such singularities as
precursors for the initial singularity of the big bang will be explored.
Simulations will also be done of the interior of a black hole to see whether the
inner horizon of the black hole is replaced by a null singularity. Simulations
will also be done of critical gravitational collapse and of gravitational
collapse with a negative cosmological constant.

The simulations of gravitational collapse as a possible precursor of the Big
Bang are a promising approach to the question of "where did the universe come
from?" Critical gravitational collapse is analogous to phase transitions in
condensed matter physics and thus points to deep connections between two very
different areas of physics. Gravitational collapse with a negative cosmological
constant is connected through the so called AdS/CFT correspondence to such
diverse physical systems as colliding heavy ion beams and high temperature
superconductors.
