The Gordon Research Conference on the Physics and Chemistry of Laser
Diagnostics in Combustion has been held biennially since 1981. The 1993 meeting
will be held in July, 1993 at Plymouth State College in New Hampshire. The
purpose of this conference is to examine closely and discuss freely the chemical
and physical foundations of the various laser diagnostic techniques including
such issues as quenching, energy transfer, quantitative species concentration
measurements, line spacings, line widths, and convolutions. New themes of the
1993 conference will include laser diagnostics of resonant wave-mixing
techniques, the interaction between the modeling of chemical flame structure and
laser diagnostics, and the metrology of particle diagnostics. The emphasis of
the conference is directed toward the science of the measurement processes. The
invited speakers and discussion leaders include researchers specializing in the
development and application of laser diagnostics in combustion as well as
investigators from basic areas not directly involved in laser diagnostics. The
major products of this conference will be the exchange of information between
researchers on the cutting edge of this technology area, hopefully leading to
synergism which will result in further advances, and a final report which will
summarize the activities of the conference.
