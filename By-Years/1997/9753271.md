This award of the program for Professional Opportunities for Women in Research
and Education (POWRE) supports the research and educational activities of
Professor Laura Pence of the University of Hartford. The research explores the
potential of adapting a synthetic strategy used with dinuclear transition metal
compounds to trinuclear ruthenium carboxylate compounds. The work involves
preparing and characterizing trinuclear complexes having one or two open
coordination sites from the liberation of a single carboxylate ligand and using
the new trinuclear complexes as building blocks for cluster formation. The work
underlies a research program on the process of cluster building with potential
significance to the chemistry of non-organometallic transition metal clusters of
biological importance. The opportunity afforded through the POWRE program will
enhance Professor Pence's research potential and her educational mentoring of
students at a predominantly undergraduate university.
