ABSTRACT ESI 93-55567 Leonard Lipkin University of North Florida Jacksonville,
FL. Technology, Discovery, and Communication in Secondary School Mathematics
This 2-year project features two cycles of a 1-year professional development
program, reaching a total of 52 in-service mathematics teachers and 8
graduate/undergraduate students in mathematics education at the University of
North Florida. The programs focuses on preparing the participants to introduce:
(1) classroom uses of computers and graphing calculators; (2) learning through
discovery, problem-solving, and group effort; and (3) writing as an essential
part of the mathematics curriculum. Each program consists of: (Summer 1) a
4-week summer institute focusing on Algebra/Pre- Calculus/Calculus; (School
Year) monthly meetings to discuss classroom implementation of new lessons and
teaching techniques, critique samples of student work, etc.; (Summer 2) an
institute focusing on General Math/Algebra I/Geometry. Three participants from
the first-year program are selected to serve as adjunct instructors for the
second program cycle. The 52 teachers particpating in the program are expected
to impact some 200 additional teachers in their home schools and districts; the
student participants are expected to use the experience as a basis for
dissertations and/or research papers. Cost sharing is 30% of the NSF
contribution.
