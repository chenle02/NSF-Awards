The proposed research is to develop a methodology based on fuzzy set theory for
the utilization of uncertain and imprecise data in regression and interpolation,
with further application to reliability analysis. Specifically, fuzzy regression
modeling in the cases of both symmetric and non-symmetric membership functions
will be investigated using various regression performance measures, applied to
linear and nonlinear regression. Fuzzy interpolation techniques will be
developed using spline interpolation and kriging. As a result of the proposed
methodological developments, guidelines will be provided for the proper use of
fuzzy set and Bayesian techniques in technical areas including design issues in
hazardous waste facilities and the reliability assessment of structures and geo-
environmental systems. This project is in cooperation with proposal ECS-8802350
by I. Bogardi. Both PIs are renowned in fuzzy set research and well qualified to
conduct the research. Their respective institutions, Arizona and Nebraska
provide more than suitable environments for the work. An award at the level of
$29,841 is recommended for FY88 with a continuation for $30,472 for FY89.
