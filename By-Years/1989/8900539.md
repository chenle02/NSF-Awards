This research project is to organize a workshop on Full-Scale Behavior of Low-
Rise Wood-Framed Buildings to be held in New Zealand in August 1989 just
preceding the Pacific Timber Engineering Conference. Approximately 30
researchers from Australia, Japan, New Zealand, the United States and Yugoslavia
will participate. The ultimate objective that will follow from the workshop is
to develop the capability and expertise to design and construct wind and
earthquake resistant, cost-effective low-rise wood-framed buildings. The
workshop itself accomplishes the following: (i) Establishing the state of the
art, (ii) Establishing and prioritizing research needs, (iii) Establishing a
protocol for reporting results, (iv) Developing a plan to share the
international talent pool and research responsibilities. The workshop will
complement any ongoing activities related to the proposed International Decade
of Natural Disaster Mitigation.//
