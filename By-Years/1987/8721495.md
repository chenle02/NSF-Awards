Experimental and theoretical studies will be conducted on the adsorption of
single gases on heterogeneous surfaces. The isotherms over a wide pressure range
(5 orders of magnitude) will be measured. From the adsorption isotherm data, the
energetic and structural heterogeneities of the microporosity will be
characterized, and the micropore size distribution will be calculated. The
research will improve our fundamental understanding on gas adsorption on real
sorbent surfaces.
