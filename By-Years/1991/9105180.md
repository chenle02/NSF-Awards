The Solid State Sciences Committee (SSSC) continues to identify and examine
issues affecting the health of the field of materials science in the United
States. Over the past three years several SSSC activities have resulted in
reports on specific topics. SSSC assessed the field of photonics and completed a
major study of materials science and engineering. The SSSC is nearing completion
of a study on diluted magnetic semiconductors. The committee continues
periodically to hold a forum designed to bring together researchers and
Washington policy makers. Much of the committee's efforts over the past year
have focused on following up the materials study and identifying new areas for
future attention. The SSSC will continue to respond to the demands of the field
by completing present projects and beginning new projects with similar relevance
to the health of materials science and the solid state sciences. Materials have
been identified by the current administration, through OSTP, as an area for a
national science and technology initiative for the country. SSSC will continue
to support the development of this initiative.
