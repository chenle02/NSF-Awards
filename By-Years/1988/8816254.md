The State University of New York College at Brockport, proposes the acquisition
of a UNIDATA meteorological display and analysis system for education and
research. This system will consist of three workstations and will be used in
introductory and synoptic meteorology courses. In addition, it is anticipated
that the UNIDATA system will be used to educate teachers at the primary,
secondary and introductory college level through workshops involving faculty
from the Brockport campus. The system will also be used to support ongoing field
research on lake-effect snowbands being conducted by the Brockport faculty, and
will be an integral part in the development of an earth sciences information
system which has been proposed by the Department of the Earth Sciences.
