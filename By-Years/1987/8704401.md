Claude LeBrun will study a number of problems in or related to Riemannian
geometry in which complex-analytic techniques may be brought to bear by means of
a twistor correspondence - that is, by thinking of the points of a Riemannian
manifold as compact complex submanifolds of some associated complex manifold.
Several of these problems, notably questions concerning solutions to Einstein's
equations and the Yang-Mills equations, are motivated by physics. Others are
problems internal to geometry and analysis concerning the existence or non-
existence of solutions to particular partial differential equations of a
geometric character. There are three principal directions in which the research
will proceed. First he will seek large categories of examples of quaternionic
manifolds. The second direction concerns further extensions of Witten's
interpretation of Yang-Mills fields in terms of third order infinitesimal
neighborhoods of embeddings. Such extensions have already been carried out by
LeBrun in the case of self dual manifolds. The final part of the program
involves defining a quaternionic analog of the notion of CR structure.
