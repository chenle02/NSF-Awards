Support for an NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site is
continued. The NSF support for 10 undergraduate students each year will allow
them to become involved in the research activities of the faculty. This
experience is designed to provide students with an improved understanding of
research and to encourage them to consider careers in research. Support for this
REU will provide continuity for our program carried out in the summers of 1988
and 1989, supplement the commitment to such research activities, and provide
students with the opportunity to participate in ongoing cutting-edge research
projects. The research activities span the areas of expertise of the faculty in
civil engineering and include projects in water resources, bioengineering and
pollution control, and structural mechanics. Components of the program include
identification of exceptional students through nationwide recruitment with
emphasis on women and minority participation; matching of student research
interests with faculty; close interaction of graduate students and faculty;
close interaction of graduate students and faculty with the undergraduates to
provide students with a fuller appreciation of graduate study, university
research, and careers in academia; an intense two month research experience;
mini-courses, as needed, to facilitate effectiveness in the research projects;
and a mini-conference for presentation of results. The goal of the program is to
excite some of the best engineering students in the nation about the challenges
of a career in research.
