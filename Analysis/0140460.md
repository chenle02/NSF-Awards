Abstract Mukhin

E. Mukhin studies the representation theory of affine Lie algebras and their
quantizations in several directions including the theory of coinvariants of
integrable representations of affine Kac-Moody algebras (with B. Feigin, M.
Jimbo and T. Miwa), the theory of finite-dimensional representations of quantum
affine groups (with E. Frenkel) and the functors between categories of
representations of Lie algebras and quantum groups defined by Knizhnik-
Zamolodchikov and quantized Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations (with A.
Varchenko).

The project is expected to result in description of many features of the
beautiful algebraic-combinatorial structure related to representation theory of
complex semi-simple Lie algebras and their affine and quantum analogs. In
particular, this research has connections to many areas of mathematics such as
theory of symmetric functions and combinatorics of Young tableaux, theory of
special functions, exactly solvable lattice models, conformal field theory,
massive field theory in 1+1 dimensions, etc; as all these theories have
symmetries described in terms of Lie algebras of different kind.
