This proposal requested support for research on the nature of the distribution
of the liquid phase in partially molten materials representative of those
occurring in the Earth's upper mantle. It is an experimental study of the
wetting properties of basaltic melts of primitive composition as a function of
temperature and pressure over ranges corresponding to accepted magma source
regions. The wetting angles are primary determinants of fluid distribution and
permeability for fluid flow. At the present time, wetting angle data are not
available over much of the pressure-temperature range commonly attributed to
magma source regions within the mantle. The information which will be provided
by this research is needed for proper understanding of upper mantle magma
segregation and transport processes operating in regions where primitive melt
compositions are generated.
