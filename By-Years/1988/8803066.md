This international symposium on plant population genetics and genetic resources
will bring together for the first time a rather impressive array of theoretical
and applied plant geneticists. Many recent developments in plant breeding
require a critical appraisal of our current knowledge of evolutionary processes
which account for the rather ubiquitous biochemical and morphological variation
in plant populations. As new genetic engineering approaches for plant
improvement come into use, a new empirical and theoretical basis on which to
combine the molecular and classical breeding methods is needed. A total of 34
invited talks will cover topics of variation assays, statistics of population
structure, dynamics of colonizing species, genetic resources, and some molecular
current topics. At this symposium, plant biologists from all these different
fields will hopefully discover new ways of looking at variation, genetic
recombination, adaptation, and crop development potentials.
