California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, is offering a four-
week summer workshop both in 1986 and in 1987 to provide in-depth instruction in
physical and earth science concepts for 48 elementary school teachers from 24
schools. The instruction will include many hands-on experiential activities
along with the opportunity for supervised practice of teaching strategies. Five
follow-up visits will be made to the participants during the academic year
following the summer workshop. Project staff from both university and school
levels will make these on-site visits for the purpose of supporting the
teachers. The proposal is a result of an expressed need garnered through a grass
roots network called Science Cooperative for Outstanding Public Education
(SCOPE), a county-wide network of teachers, administrators, and others
interested in improving science instruction in the schools.
