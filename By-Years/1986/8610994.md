This research program will investigate the source, progapation path, and basin
effects that produced the strong ground motion observed during the Mexican
Earthquake of September 19, 1985. This earthquake occurred in the Michoacan
"seismic gap," and a high probability exists that a large earthquake will occur
in the nearby Guerrero seismic gap within the next decade. Such an event could
be as damaging to Mexico City as was the September 19,1985 earthquake. This
research program will seek to obtain practically useful estimates of the strong
ground motion shaking that would result from this event. Given the high
probability of occurrence, there is therefore a good chance that these estimates
can be checked against measured data in the near future. Such an estimate, and
comparison with measured data, is expected to result in signficant advances in
the techniques for estimating seismically generated strong ground motion.
