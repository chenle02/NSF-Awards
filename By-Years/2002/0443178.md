As EarthScope observatories are installed at over 3,000 geographical locations
&lt;br/&gt;across the nation, students and the public will be introduced to
scientific questions and to &lt;br/&gt;the role their region plays in
understanding the formation of the North American &lt;br/&gt;continent.
EarthScope can provide a compelling example of how scientific understanding
&lt;br/&gt;advances as new data become available and new hypothesis are tested,
and will &lt;br/&gt;encourage interest in Geoscience. To do so, EarthScope needs
to develop and coordinate &lt;br/&gt;educational activities, provide science and
data products that are accessible to students, &lt;br/&gt;and create teaching
modules that will allow EarthScope resources to be incorporated into
&lt;br/&gt;an inquiry-based learning experience consistent with national
educational standards. The EarthScope Science and Education Committee has
strongly recommended centralized education and outreach coordination and
activities, and the need for personnel to support this function. &lt;br/&gt;This
proposal is designed to address this issues through providing support for the
initiation of an EarthScope Education and Outreach Program.
