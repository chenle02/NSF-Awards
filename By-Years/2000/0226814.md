This proposal will enable participation of junior researchers in the"Frontiers
of Nuclear Structure" Conference to be held on the campus of the University of
California at Berkeley. The conference covers a variety of topics, including
nuclei under extreme conditions, and astrophysics. The majority of the talks
will be selected from contributed abstracts, which generally favors a higher
fraction ofnjunior speakers compared with a program generated from predominantly
invited talks.
