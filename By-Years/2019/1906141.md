The conference "Symplectic Representation Theory" will take place at the Centre
International de Rencontres Mathematiques (https://www.cirm-math.com), in
Marseille, France, from April 1 to April 5, 2019. The subject of the conference
is a rapidly developing field in mathematics which connects several disciplines,
not only in mathematics but also in physics. The main goals of the conference
are to understand the structure of important geometric, physical, and algebraic
objects that appear in very many places that generalize the study of semi-simple
Lie algebras and the geometry of Lie groups and flag varieties. Important
examples included are algebraic objects such as the so-called Cherednik, Hecke,
and quiver algebras; geometric objects such as hypertoric and quiver varieties
and affine Grassmannians; and physical objects such as moduli spaces of vacua of
3D supersymmetric quantum field theories. Recently many important developments
have occurred, making physical objects precise in mathematics, resolving
mathematical conjectures about Koszul duality, mirror symmetry, and quantum
cohomology, and finding geometric constructions of quantum groups and
representations as well as Lie-theoretic objects and new
generalizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the proposed conference is to
bring participants to the forefront of knowledge in this fast moving field. The
keynote speakers are chosen because they are responsible for much of this recent
progress. These speakers to give research talks about: 1) The definition, and
fundamental properties, of the Coulomb branch, its quantizations, and three-
dimensional mirror symmetry; 2) Breakthroughs in our understanding of quantum
cohomology, and its K-theoretic counterpart; 3) (Geometric) categorification,
and applications to combinatorial representation theory; 4) The role of gauge
theory, topological field theories, and categories of branes in symplectic
representation theory; and 5) The classification and structure of symplectic
singularities, their symplectic resolutions, and quantizations. The conference
