&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research involves several interrelated areas
in&lt;br/&gt;spectral graph theory, extremal graph theory and random
graphs.&lt;br/&gt;A main goal is to deduce the fundamental properties and
structures of&lt;br/&gt;a graph from its graph spectrum (or from a short list of
easily&lt;br/&gt;computable invariants). Various combinatorial,
geometric&lt;br/&gt;and probabilistic techniques are being developed for
examining&lt;br/&gt;the relations and behaviors of various graph invariants and
properties. &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research project includes: &lt;br/&gt;(1)
Research in spectral graph theory, including spectral Tur'an
theorems,&lt;br/&gt;quasi-randomness, random walks in directed graphs, Cheeger's
inequality&lt;br/&gt;for directed graphs, &lt;br/&gt;(2) Research in random
graphs with emphasis on random graphs with given degree
distributions,&lt;br/&gt;and examining various aspects including giant
components, average distance, diameter&lt;br/&gt;and eigenvalues
distributions,&lt;br/&gt;(3) Mathematical models for information networks that
generate&lt;br/&gt;random power law graphs, including the growth-deletion models
of preferential&lt;br/&gt;attachments, generalizations of Polya urn's model,
duplication models for &lt;br/&gt;biologic al networks and the development of
tools such as generalizing martigale &lt;br/&gt;inequalities for rigorous
probabilistic analysis of large networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although graph
theory has more than 250 years of history, it is only been very
&lt;br/&gt;recently observed that many realistic networks arising in numerous
arenas have&lt;br/&gt;astounding coherence --- similar shapes (power law degree
distribution) and&lt;br/&gt;having the so-called "small world phenomenon" (small
distances and clustering). &lt;br/&gt;Examples include WWW graphs, call graphs,
biological networks and numerous&lt;br/&gt;social networks. The study of the
graph models for various information networks &lt;br/&gt;has led to exciting new
directions for research in graph theory. In the other direction,&lt;br/&gt;graph
theory provides tools for analyzing and utilizing large complex
networks.&lt;br/&gt;The primary objective of the proposed research is to advance
our understanding &lt;br/&gt;of the intrinsic characteristics and underlying
principles that govern large &lt;br/&gt;information networks. Such principles
are quite effective and essential in dealing &lt;br/&gt;with problems in
computation and communication involving massive information networks
&lt;br/&gt;that arise in Internet computing and massive data
sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
