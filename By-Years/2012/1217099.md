In this project, the PI and his team study the relationship between widely-used
satisfiability algorithms (SAT solvers) and the complexity of proofs, with the
goal of characterizing the proof strength of complete SAT solvers that use
conflict-directed clause learning. The project also focuses on the inherent
tradeoffs between the running time and storage (space) required to derive proofs
and the impact that this has on SAT solvers. SAT solvers are among the most
important and useful tools in a wide range of applications, from finding
solutions to problems under constraints to checking the correctness and safety
of software and hardware systems where their&lt;br/&gt;role as methods of proof
is required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will also explore resource
tradeoffs inherent in solving specific computational problems such as computing
order statistics and encoding data using good quality error-correcting codes
that are resilient to worst-case errors. Such error-correcting codes are
becoming increasingly important in a networked world in which adversaries may
deliberately corrupt network traffic.
