This project investigates mathematical issues and develops computational methods
for solving important classes of direct and inverse problems in optical
diffraction from subwavelength structures. The work is motivated by industrial
applications, including scattering and diffraction by linear and nonlinear
biperiodic structures (crossed gratings), inverse and optimal design problems in
diffractive optics, and near-field optics in periodic and general structures.
The research examines three-dimensional electromagnetic wave propagation in
periodic structures, ill-posedness for inverse problems, adaptive techniques for
solving linear and nonlinear Maxwell equations, and modeling of near-field
imaging. New computational methods and mathematical modeling techniques will be
developed to solve the underlying direct and inverse problems for near-field
optics. New techniques will be developed to deal with the associated linear and
nonlinear Maxwell equations for scattering in complex media and structures. We
will develop robust solution methods for the associated optimal design, inverse,
and imaging problems, to provide guidance for the creation of novel optical
devices.

Micro diffractive optics and near-field optics are fundamental and vigorously
growing technologies with diverse applications, including optical computing,
communications, laser technology, near-field optical microscopy, imaging of
biological samples, and nanotechnology. Because of the small structural
features, light propagation in micro-optical structures is generally dominated
by diffraction. Accurate modeling of electromagnetic fields within these
materials presents challenging and significant mathematical and computational
questions. The computational models and optimal design tools developed by this
project will provide inexpensive and easily controllable "virtual prototypes" of
the structures and media involved in the design of novel optical devices. The
research results will be of immediate benefit to the optics industry.
