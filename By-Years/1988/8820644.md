Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectroscopy is essential
to chemists and biologists who are carrying out frontier research. The
Department of Chemistry at the University of Akron will use this award from the
Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program and the Instrumentation and Instrument
Development Program to help acquire a high-field NMR spectrometer. The areas of
research that will be enhanced by the acquisition include: 1) Mechanisms of
enzymatic reactions 2) Transition metal catalysis of polymerization reactions 3)
Development and study of the chemistry of iodinane reagents 4) New 2D-NMR
techniques for studying weak intermolecular interactions 5) Enzymatic catalysts
for carrying out synthetic transformations 6) Solution structures and
conformations of enzyme active sites.
