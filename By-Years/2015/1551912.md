The growth of high-speed mobile internet access has already revolutionized our
lives and is expected to continue unabated. As new applications such as Machine-
to-Machine (M2M), self-driving cars, and ubiquitous video appear on the horizon,
rapid growth of traffic in wireless mobile and nomadic access will dwarf all
other wireless applications. Therefore, design of future wireless networks that
can sustain such traffic growth is an important research challenge. A critical
piece of such design is spectrum management strategies that leverage maximum
efficiency and maximum public benefit from the radio spectrum. This workshop
will explore the key technical and policy challenges in spectrum management
facing researchers in the coming decade. The proposed international travel
grants will enable U.S.-based researchers to participate in these important
global conversations. U.S.-based researchers will both be able to represent the
U.S.'s unique perspective on spectrum management and be informed by the
different approaches being adopted in Europe and elsewhere. Moreover, U.S.-based
researchers will return home with a clearer sense of key research problems to
guide their own future research, helping to enable the U.S. to remain at the
forefront of wireless communications research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
will enable travel grants to be made to up to 15 U.S.-based researchers to
attend the 2015 Future Directions in Spectrum Management Research Workshop. The
workshop is being held in Stockholm, Sweden on September 29, 2015, co-located
with IEEE DySPAN 2015. Travel grants will be made to enable U.S.-based
researchers that are not presenting at IEEE DySPAN to bring a diversity of views
to the workshop. A few smaller travel grants will also be made to enable DySPAN
presenters to be in Stockholm for an additional day to participate in the
workshop. The PI will seek to identify and make some travel awards to
researchers from underrepresented groups.
