An Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) system is being acquired for the Alabama
Microelectronics Science and Technology Center (AMSTC) and the Auburn University
Materials Research Laboratory (AUMRL). It will be used under the guidance of
specialists in Auger spectroscopy for the characterization of a variety of
materials prepared at AMSTC and AUMRL in support of the following ongoing or
proposed research areas: plasma assisted low temperature epitaxial growth of
semiconductor crystals, plasma polymerization controlled dry etching techniques
for VLSI fabrication, novel approaches for control of fiber-epoxy interfaces in
composite materials, plasma copolymer dielectric layers for microelectronics
applications, study of pitting corrosion mechanisms by surface modification (ion
implantation), and surface degradation of magnetic recording material Co-Cr
alloy films.
