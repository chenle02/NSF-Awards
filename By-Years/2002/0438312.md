This proposal will develop and deploy mechanisms that will facilitate the
research and education in the most important area of computational research.
GRIDCHEM is defined as a common interface for all of the nation's computational
chemists, but it will have applications beyond only the discipline of chemistry.
Many fields of great scientific and industrial importance depend on
understanding the chemistry of their constituents. Modern medicine depends on
understanding the chemistry of disease and the functioning of our bodies. The
fields of genomics and proteomics are involved with understanding the molecules
which make up the human gene and those proteins which they manufacture, i.e.
chemistry. Nanotechnology is the study of materials and mechanisms at the
molecular level, i.e. chemistry. The impact of human activity on the environment
is essentially a question of what polluting molecules are interacting with the
air and oceans of our planet, i.e., chemistry. Any study which deals with
systems made of atoms, in which the atomic scale is important is essentially a
subset of chemistry. In order to predict the behavior of these systems, access
to advanced computational hardware and software are required. GRIDCHEM will
provide the required access in a seamless uniform way, with the result that the
most advanced computational chemistry techniques and resources will become
available to any researcher or student that needs them to make progress in
genomic medicine, nano-materials, global climate change, and many other urgent
issues which will benefit from the results of this
proposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
