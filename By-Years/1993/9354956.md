9354956 Russell Maryland has had a long standing commitment to machine tool
research. The Advanced Design and Manufacturing Laboratory, the Computer-aided
Design Laboratory, and the Photomechanics Laboratory are among the leading
laboratories in the nation. On-going research activities include study of
machine tool dynamics, ceramic machining, synthesis and processing of multi-
layer ceramic actuators, and development of optical fiber sensor technology.
University of Maryland's strong collaboration with industry and government
research institutions provides a unique research environment for GRT. A combined
training and retention strategy that emphasizes the integration of design
throughout the engineering curriculum at the graduate level has been developed
for this proposal. Developing a cluster of academic courses relevant to machine
tool research allows graduate students to integrate ideas and concepts from the
designated courses, and encourages intellectual and social camaraderie to knit
the trainees together. The training focuses on engineering practice and quality
research. Starting from learning operational skills to large-scale system
analysis, they gain leading-edge knowledge. Exciting research projects and
strong interactions among students and with teachers will encourage students to
stay in the program to pursue their Ph.D. degrees. ***
