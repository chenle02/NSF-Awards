Future Scientists and Engineers of America (FSEA) is a structured after-school
program to promote math and science through engineering applications among
American youth, grades 4 through 12. FSEA has hands-on projects at increasing
levels of complexity which provide student members with practical engineering
applications of science and mathematics. Students advance through categories
similar to the Scouts based on Satisfactory completion of projects. They enter
as a technician and advance to levels of scientist and engineer. Chapters are
sponsored by businesses, professional societies and community organizations
which provided mentors and funding for FSEA projects. Each Project is conducted
by a team consisting of a volunteer teacher and a volunteer mentor. A mentor
must have a technical background in a scientific or engineering field. Mentors
can be volunteers recruited from industry, retired scientists and engineers or
engineering students. In less than a year, mentors and teachers have attended
start- up workshops and 24 chapters have been successfully organized. Increasing
demand for chapter development, with continuing emphasis on minority and female
youth, has created the need for further development of projects kits, parent
involvement and continuity among feeder schools. The proposal intends to develop
the procedures, structure and organization that would enable FSEA to develop an
additional 35 chapters in Southern California and become a national after-school
program and expand to other states.
