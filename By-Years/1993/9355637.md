9355637 Hanson The Children's Museum is requesting $910,088 from the National
Science Foundation to create an exhibition to go in an Urban Environmental
Center to be built on a barge anchored in Fort Point Channel, a 500-foot-wide
Boston Harbor waterway in front of the Museum. Our goal is to create exhibits
which broaden public access to the process of science while extending each
person's awareness of an engagement in this particular waterfront environment.
Barge exhibits are focused on water, which has universal appeal to children and
is the central feature of our location; atmosphere -- birds, sun, solar
radiation, shadow, light refraction and diffraction, heat, wind, and clouds;
built environment -- architecture, engineering, buildings, technology -- and
their relationship to living things. We will provide a wide menu of entry-level
approaches to the environment that are not given in school. The exhibits will
take a visitor from where s/he is at the beginning of the visit to a new level
of curiosity and concern. Through observation and direct experimentation,
children will see what varies with the tides, what flows into the Channel from
street run-off, where different creatures nest, what is emitted into the
atmosphere from cars and buildings, and many other things. Some exhibits invite
a playful experience, involving the senses and whole body; others offer a more
focused exploration to uncover principles of a phenomenon. All encourage
practice in such scientific processes as observing, collecting, recording, and
comparing data.
