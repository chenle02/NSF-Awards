9451030 Pladziewicz This project will complete a revision of the laboratory work
in general chemistry and the incorporation of a sophomore-level inorganic
chemistry course into the curriculum of chemistry majors. The goals of these
changes are to: (1) involve students in constructing thoughtful technical
reports earlier in their laboratory work, (2) increase the inorganic content in
the curriculum of majors early in their program of study, (3) modernize the
synthetic methods and characterization techniques used by students in the first
two years of their chemistry program by the incorporation of high-quality
microscale synthetic glassware and modern instrumentation into the laboratory
work associated with these courses, and (4) provide additional equipment for
characterization and study of inorganic materials prepared in undergraduate
research projects.
