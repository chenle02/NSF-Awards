A very important feature in the construction of organic compounds is optimizing
yields for the many steps involved. A number of important variables for these
reactions, e.g. temperature, concentrations, rates of mixing, etc., ideally
should be evaluated for each step in the synthesis. This project in the Organic
and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is developing robotic techniques which the
chemist will find useful in maximizing yields. The Purdue Automatic Synthesis
System (PASS) is being developed as a resource for the synthetic organic
chemist. When completed, PASS will feature eight variable-temperature reactors,
on-line quantitative analysis by HPLC and GC, automated handling of bar-code
labeled samples, and dual robotic arms all operating under the control of a
hierarchical computer network. By using a menu-driven user interface, the
chemist can define the capabilities of the system and the goals of the
experiments which will be automatically executed. Experimental designs such as
grids, screening procedures (fractional factorials, Plackett-Burman), fitting
schemes (central composite, Box-Behnken), and self-directed methods (Simplex or
Uniplex) will be available. The goals of this project are completion of the PASS
hardware, developing the control software, and exploring the prospects for
including artificial intelligence into PASS.
