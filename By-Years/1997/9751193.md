Nonmajor biology students need exposure to sophisticated laboratory
instrumentation. Within the context of environmental science courses, the
university faculty seeks to utilize gas chromatography to expand the exposure of
students to the relationship between field sampling and laboratory analysis. An
instrument with accompanying computer interface and software are used for
student training. The instrument is used routinely in nonmajor environmental
science courses, major environmental science courses, and limnology. The
instrument can be used for independent undergraduate research projects. The gas
chromatographer is heavily utilized for student laboratory projects that explore
the presence of toxic components in local surface waters. The gas
chromatographer allows students to explore gas chromatography as one of the most
commonly used techniques for environmental chemical analysis. *
