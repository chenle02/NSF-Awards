Bates College is purchasing a quantitative x-ray microanalysis system with image
enhancement and processing capabilities, which will enable students to be
exposed to modern techniques in analysis of geologic materials, improve the
school's instructional capabilities, and strengthen their program of
undergraduate research. The x-ray microanalysis system will be attached to a
newly acquired scanning electron microscope. The addition of this equipment to
the geology curriculum allows for 1. the introduction of a new course in
quantitative microanalysis of geologic materials, 2. considerable improvement in
laboratory exercises offered to upper level students, and 3. modernization and
improvement of student thesis research, independent study, and faculty-sponsored
research. The equipment should enhance student interest in the geosciences, and
provide students with state-of- the-art, hands on experience in techniques used
in graduate work and industry. The college will contribute support equal to the
award.
