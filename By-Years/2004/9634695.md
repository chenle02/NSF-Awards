Over the past two decades, economic and political forces worked together to
increase the amount and intensity of cooperative research activity in the U.S. A
sizable literature, attempting to classify, document, monitor, analyze, and
evaluate these activities, has also appeared, as outputs from research sponsored
by federal agencies and foundations. To date there has been no significant
effort to perform a critical synthesis of this literature from and analytical,
policy-oriented perspective. This project will begin to address this need. To
make the initial effort manageable, the review will be restricted to empirical
studies based on original or archival data, rather than theoretical, normative,
or policy analyses; studies of research cooperation among U.S. institutions;
published or at least readily available reports and studies; and materials
published or printed in the last ten years. The primary purpose is to extract
from the empirical literature a set of policy-relevant results based on multiple
studies using different methodologies or measures. The investigators will
prepare structured summaries of all the studies that meet the criteria for
inclusion. These will comprise an electronic data base that can be accessed via
keywords, and will be one of the primary outputs from the study. The results
will also include a critical synthesis of the literature on cooperative research
in the U.S., organized around policy questions of interest to both the policy
and research communities. The review will address methodological and measurement
issues and produce a set of conclusions about what has been learned from the
studies collectively, what level of confidence can be placed on each conclusion,
and why.
