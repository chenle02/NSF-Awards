9531776 Lin This project consists of three closely related topics,
classification of homomorphisms from one given C*-algebra to another,
classification of extensions of one C*-algebra by another, and classification of
C*-algebras of real rank zero. The investigator will use KK-theory plus tracial
information to determine homomorphisms from an abelian C*-algebra to a simple
C*-algebra of real rank zero with stable rank one. To classify extensions, he
will classify monomorphisms from an (abelian) C*-algebra to the corona algebra.
With additional efforts, by classifying homomorphisms (and automorphisms), one
might also be able to classify certain types of C*-algebras (of real rank zero).
One particular class that he will consider is direct limits of some extensions
of certain algebras. The first example of a C*-algebra is the complex numbers.
It is proved to be the only C*-algebra that is also a field. In fact, any finite
number of copies of the complex numbers is a C*-algebra. One can also have
infinitely many copies. If one glues together continuously an infinite number of
copies, one may arrive at the complex-valued continuous functions on an
interval, or even complex-valued continuous functions defined on a circle. In
fact, every commutative C*-algebra (one in which AB=BA) turns out to be the set
of continuous complex-valued functions on some space. By contrast, matrices over
the complex field provide noncommutative C*-algebras. Every C*-algebra is
technically a normed-closed and conjugate-closed subalgebra of all bounded
linear operators on a Hilbert space. What this means is that C*-algebras may be
viewed as some kind of generalized complex numbers, and, as in the case of
complex numbers, C*-algebras have many important applications, ranging from
dynamical systems and quantum mechanics to other fields of mathematics such as
operator theory, linear algebra, noncommutative geometry, group representations,
and so on. For example, C*- algebras together with their groups of symmetries
are often related to problems in dynamical systems. Recent results in C*-algebra
theory have been used to answer questions such as when two matrices commute.
This project is to study, in a way, how many types of such algebras exist, how
to distinguish them from one another, how to construct new C*-algebras from old
ones, and to study relationships between these C*-algebras and possible
applications to other fields. The objective is to gain a better understanding of
these algebras and to develop better theory and methods for applications. ***
