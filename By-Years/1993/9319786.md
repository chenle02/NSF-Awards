9319786 Manghnani The German super-deep continental bore-hole (KTB) project
offers an excellent opportunity to study the seismic and petrophysical
properties of crustal rocks. Laboratory studies of the bore-hole samples,
combined with field seismic surveys in the Bavarian Oberfalz and well-log data,
will enable fine-tuning and enhancement of interpretations of seismic reflection
data and other geophysical signatures in terms of the crustal lithology,
composition, microstructure, fabric, and presence of pore fluids. This project
involves laboratory studies on the frequency, pore pressure, and temperature
dependences of the attenuation properties of the KTB samples which are aimed at
securing a vital linkage in interpreting seismic and well-log data. The results
will also complement existing velocity data. The data to be collected are
essential for understanding wave propagation in intensely foliated and cracked
rocks encountered in this region. A systematic study of the attenuation
properties of KTB samples from varying depths under simulated in-situ fluid
content, fluid pressure, and temperature conditions will help in relating the
laboratory results to subsurface crack modeling and in estimating in-situ
stress. ***
