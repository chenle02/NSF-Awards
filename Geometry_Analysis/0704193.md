Abstract

Award: DMS-0704193 Principal Investigator: John W. Lott

The Institut Henri Poincare (IHP) in Paris will host a trimester-long program on
Ricci Flow and Ricci Curvature over April-July, 2008. As part of this French
activity in a rapidly-developing area of geometric analysis, an International
Conference on Ricci Flow is scheduled for June 30-July 4, 2008 as a conclusion
to the trimester. Topics of the trimester and conference are expected to include
Ricci flow in the geometrization of three-manifolds, Kaehler-Einstein metrics
and Kaehler-Ricci flow, metrics of constant scalar curvature, Ricci flow in
dimensions four and higher, analytic aspects of geometric flows, Einstein
metrics and recent developments in geometric relativity, synthetic Ricci
curvature, and Ricci limit spaces. This landscape was transformed by Perelman's
work on Ricci flow in three-manifolds and all of these areas have enjoyed recent
advances.

This award provides partial support for expenses of US-based participants in
the Paris conference, particularly graduate students and junior researchers. The
subject of the workshop is the Ricci flow and its extensions. This differential
equation and technique in geometry became celebrated with its application by
Perelman and Hamilton to the Poincare Conjecture on the topological uniqueness
of the three-dimensional sphere, one of the great challenge problems of
mathematics. The technique considers a single space with a large number of
metrics (ways to measure distance in the space) by using the Ricci curvature at
each metric to determine a direction for evolving the metric that is likely to
make the metric more symmetric -- loosely speaking, we try to change in the
direction of ever rounder metrics. Although it is often difficult to control all
the details necessary to make such an argument succeed, geometers have found
that this idea identifies optimal metrics in a variety of important situations.
