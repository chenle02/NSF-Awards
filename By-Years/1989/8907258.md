It is proposed to obtain precise theoretical values for amplitudes of the parity
non-conserving transitions in heavy atoms induced by exchange of neutral Z
particles between the nucleus and the atomic electrons, thereby permitting the
determination of the Weinberg angle from atomic physics experiments. The
amplitudes are obtained with a relativistic version of many-body perturbation
theory. The multiple sums occurring in higher order are evaluated with finite-
basis techniques. All orders methods have been devised and will be applied to
cesium. With energies, transition amplitudes, and hyperfine constants accurate
to 1% the parity non conserving amplitudes can be obtained with errors at the 1%
level.
