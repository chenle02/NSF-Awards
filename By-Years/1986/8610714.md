Large scale systems analysis involves complexities that require systematic
procedures which reveal underlying structures in mathematical models that
uncover candidate analytical methodologies and design strategies. The "multiple
time scalestructure" of control systems is a very common such structure.
Professor Khalil will investigate means of relaxing two limitations of multiple
time scale feedback design methods.
