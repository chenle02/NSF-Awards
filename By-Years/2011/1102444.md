The Liquid Sodium Dynamo Experiment at New Mexico Tech is designed to
demonstrate how naturally occurring flows in planets, stars, and Active Galactic
Nuclei (AGN) accretion disks can generate the magnetic fields of these bodies.
The scientific question of the research is whether driven plumes, necessary for
coherent helicity generation in a conducting fluid will create so much turbulent
resistivity as to prevent the necessary orthogonal omega or shear gain and thus
prevent exponential dynamo gain. Educationally, the project offers research
opportunities for undergraduates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The standard belief is
that turbulence in a conducting fluid will make a dynamo in astrophysical
circumstances regardless of the randomness of the motions. This experiment is
designed to prove the contrary. A low turbulent shear flow in liquid sodium
(this experiment) has already demonstrated an omega gain of a factor of eight.
The experimental question is whether helicity injection of approximately one-
eighth the shear flow can recreate the original poloidal field without reducing
the omega gain by turbulent resistivity below threshold.
