ABSTRACT The proposal seeks funding to sponsor a US delegation to the Third
Joint Conference of the Indian Society of Heat and Mass Transfer and the
American Society of Mechanical Engineers. The conference will be held in Kanpur,
India from December 29 to 31, 1997. The conference will cover many important
subjects relevant to a wide spectrum of engineering applications. The delegation
will be involved in delivering keynote lectures, organizing panel discussions,
and other activities designed to promote technical exchanges with attendees from
other countries. The delegation will also visit laboratories and universities in
India. The US participation will not only allow US researchers to gain first
hand knowledge of the critical technological issues facing Indian, but stimulate
future collaboration on research problems that are of mutual interest.
