Changes in anthropogenic emissions of lead as an inadvertent tracer experiment
on oceanic chemical flux processes will be used to determine the magnitude and
rate of oceanic chemical fluxes as they respond to changes in external boundary
conditions. Such an experiment is the best predictor of the fate of other metals
introduced into the ocean by human activities. Physical ventilation dominates
transport of lead into the upper thermocline, so it is important to either
couple lead measurements with those of transient tracers, or to work in areas
where this information is available from ongoing efforts (such as Bermuda and
the "beta triangle" region).
