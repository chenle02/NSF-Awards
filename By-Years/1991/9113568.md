Massachusetts Institute of Technology requests support from NSF for connection
of Assumption College, College of the Holy Cross, and Suffolk University to the
New England Academic Research Network (NEARnet) which is the NSF mid-level
network that serves the New England area. A primary goal of NEARnet is to
facilitate collaborative projects and sharing of resources between instutuion,
including those outside the state. NEARnet will provide operations management
and information services and it will give the three universities a connection to
the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone
network. The each of the universities has written a description of its
orgainization and a statement of the benefits of Internet access that it expects
including: greater functionality and network speed to be able to access
supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being able to
implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty research will
benefit from the links. This is also a unique opportunity for the schools to
explore innovative educational resources.
