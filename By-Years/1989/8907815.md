This proposal is to establish the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE)
Hydrographic Office. The office has the responsibility of coordinating the
scientific activities of the various international components of the
hydrographic program. It will also secure the assistance of data quality control
experts, expedite the calibration of the instruments, and provide for the timely
publication of data reports from the field activities.
