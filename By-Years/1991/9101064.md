Dr. Robert Toreki has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Toreki's doctoral degree was from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology under the supervision of Professor Richard Schrock. Dr. Toreki
intends to continue research at Northwestern University under the sponsorship of
Professor Kenneth Poeppelmeier. Dr. Toreki's postdoctoral research will train
him in a broad range of solids characterization techniques such as DSC, DTA,
TGA, XRD,STEM and TEM. Longer term, he plans to apply organometallic chemistry
to the design and synthesis of new solid-state catalysts. %%% The Postdoctoral
Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural
program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and
attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and
teaching.
