Two directions of research are to be investigated for controlled stochastic
reward processes which model diverse phenomena in engineering. The first
direction augments the usual expected value criteria with variability
considerations. Efficient methods are sought to compute mean-variance tradeoffs,
to compute the effects of a "little" risk sensitivity, to characterize
intertemporal variability, and to extend such notions to sequential games.
General results would be applied to structured models which arise in contexts
such as inventory, production, maintenance, reservoirs, and storm water basins.
The second direction of research exploits preliminary results for models with
certain affine properties. The properties significantly reduce the complexity of
dynamic programming problems and, in many cases, permit the dynamic model to be
replaced with a one-period model. Efficient computational methods would be
sought for higher-order models which frequently arise in practice. General
results would be combined with specially structured models such as in queuing
control, capacity expansion, inventory, multi-stage manufacturing, multi-
reservoir river basins, aquaculture, and agricultural crop production combined
with pest control. This research concerns sequential decision processes. In
particular, two topics are being investigated: (1) risk sensitivity and (2)
models which have certain affine properties allowing the development of
efficient computational procedures. It is expected that the results of this work
will be applied to a wide range of engineering problems such as multi-stage
manufacturing and capacity expansion.
