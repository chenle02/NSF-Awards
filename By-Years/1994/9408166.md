9408166 Hangarter Plant development is influenced by many environmental
stimuli, including light, temperature and gravity. Of these stimuli, light is of
particular importance because it regulates nearly all stages of development in
addition to supplying energy for photosynthesis. Examples of light-regulated
development include germination, stem growth, leaf and root development, tropic
responses, chloroplast development, branching, and flower induction. Plants
respond to different qualities of light through the action of multiple
photosensory systems. The long-term objective of this proposal is to determine
at the cellular and molecular level how blue light in particular is perceived by
plants and converted into modified growth responses. The research will focus on
the Arabidopsis blue light photomorphogenic mutants blu1, blu2 and blu3 which
have been shown to be deficient in several important blue light responses. The
major objective of the proposed research is to identify the nature and mechanism
of action of the gene products required for blue light-dependent signal
transduction. A second objective is to continue conducting physiological and
genetic experiments using various double mutants between the three blu mutants
and other photomorphogenic mutants, including phytochrome-deficient mutants, in
order to identify functional interactions between different photosensory
systems. This work will provide significant new knowledge about the complex
network of regulatory events that control photomorphogenesis and will help
elucidate the mechanisms by which light, and possibly other environmental
stimuli, control plant development. ***
