Many biological processes cycle rhythmically over a twenty-four hour
(circadian) period. Disruptions of this rhythm cause "jet lag" and are a feature
of many neurological and psychiatric diseases. In mammals, the pacemaker that
controls this rhythmicity lies in a brain structure called the suprachiasmatic
nucleus of the hypothalamus. Cells in this nucleus exhibit many cyclic
properties, even when removed from the brain and studied in a dish, in vitro.
Unfortunately, the isolated cells tend to be unstable and thus are difficult to
study for long periods. Dr. Earnest has developed a genetically engineered
suprachiasmatic cell that replicates in culture but still demonstrates
properties of intact suprachiasmatic cells. With this NSF small grant for
exploratory research, he will screen colonies of these cells to determine which
ones exhibit the circadian time-keeping function. If the proposed projects
demonstrate that circadian timekeeping is a stable functional characteristic of
suprachiasmatic clones, potential applications of this experimental model would
be limitless and could serve to rapidly advance our knowledge of the cellular
and molecular organization of the circadian pacemaker mechanism in the brain.
Increased understanding would aid the development of therapies for sleep
disorders due to altered time schedules, space flight, and neurological
disease.***//
