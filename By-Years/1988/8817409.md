The goal of this project is to further characterize the biogeochemical
processes utilizing dissolved free amino acids in anoxic marine sediments. This
work is a renewal of a previous grant and series of experiments utilizing 14C-
labelled amino acids and inhibitors of specific microbial processes, focussing
on the relationship between sulfate reduction and fermentation reactions in
consuming amino acids. A major emphasis of this work will be to quantify the
specific intermediates produced from the metabolism of amino acids in anoxic
marine sediments (e.g., acetate vs. propionate as opposed to simply total
volatile fatty acids). For comparative purposes experiments will be carried out
using sediment collected from several locations. Previous studies of glutamic
acid and alanine utilization in these sediments will be expanded to include
analogous studies involving glycine and lysine. These amino acids have been
chosen for study because they are the dominant amino acids. The results of this
study have the potential of increasing our knowledge of the controls on amino
acid digenesis in anoxic marine sediments.
