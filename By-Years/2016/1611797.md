The so-called almost complex structure is a fundamental notion in the study of
even dimensional spaces in mathematics. The understanding of almost complex
structure in dimension four is of major importance in the mathematical branch of
Differential Geometry. This has also great impact on other subjects including
Physics. The projects designed aim to use powerful tools from geometric analysis
to study almost complex structure, which will lead to applications in string
theory, algebraic geometry and complex geometry. The proposed research will have
immediate beneficial effects to students in the principal investigator's home
university.

The geometry of 4-dimensional smooth and symplectic manifolds has witnessed very
exciting achievements in the last several decades. Despite the great success,
the full understanding of smooth topology of four manifolds and symplectic
manifolds remains largely open. In the last several decades, profound progress
has also been made in the Ricci flow, for example, the solution of Poincare
conjecture and geometrization conjecture in three manifolds. In this project,
the PI will focus on compact almost complex manifolds by using a new kind of
geometric flows, which evolve an almost complex structure to a symplectic
structure. One motivation is to understand precisely when a compact four
manifold with an almost complex structure supports a symplectic structure.
Inspired by the Hamilton-Perelman's theory in the Ricci flow, the PI intends to
study these new geometric flows in a systematical way, such as the longtime
behavior and formation of singularities.
