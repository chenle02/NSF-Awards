The proposed REU site is in the area of Medical Informatics and will
address&lt;br/&gt;issues related to the workflow driven acquisition of image
data in an&lt;br/&gt;electronic medical record environment, and the subsequent
post-processing of&lt;br/&gt;the image information to improve the accuracy and
efficiency of the&lt;br/&gt;consumers of this information, notably radiologists.
In particular,&lt;br/&gt;segmentation, texture analysis, classification and
annotation of computed&lt;br/&gt;tomography (CT) images using computer vision
and data mining techniques will&lt;br/&gt;be
emphasized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since many racial minorities are significantly
underrepresented in computer&lt;br/&gt;science (CS) departments, the primary
educational objective is to promote&lt;br/&gt;graduate studies for bright,
talented undergraduates - especially&lt;br/&gt;first-generation college students
and undergraduates from groups&lt;br/&gt;historically underrepresented in exact
sciences. Furthermore, since the&lt;br/&gt;demand for individuals who see their
career opportunities at the&lt;br/&gt;intersection between Medical Informatics
and CS far outstrips the current&lt;br/&gt;supply, the second educational
objective is to promote and encourage&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary undergraduate
studies in computer science and
medical&lt;br/&gt;informatics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MedIX (MEDical
Informatics eXperiences in undergraduate research) REU&lt;br/&gt;site will run
for three summers, with eight student participants spending 10&lt;br/&gt;weeks
each summer doing research both at DePaul University,
Intelligent&lt;br/&gt;Multimedia Processing Laboratory and Northwestern
University, Feinberg&lt;br/&gt;School of Medicine, Imaging Informatics
Laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
