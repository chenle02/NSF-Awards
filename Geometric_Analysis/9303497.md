The research entails analytic problems on classes of conformally compact
manifolds and manifolds inheriting partial complex structures (Cauchy-Riemann
manifolds). The techniques in question evolve from variational principles and
the geometry of Einstein metrics. This research has potential applications to
mathematical physics, particularly general relativity and quantum gravity.
