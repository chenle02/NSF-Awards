Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometry is an important technique in chemistry.
It is utilized in most areas of chemistry, and knowledge of NMR is considered
essential for the complete education of B.S. chemists. This project allows the
Southern Arkansas faculty to teach the fundamentals and advanced aspects of
interpretation of NMR spectra. In addition, the instrument is used to teach a
number of fundamental chemical concepts such as equilibria, kinetics,
tautomerism, proton exchange, etc. Advanced topics in biochemistry and molecular
chemistry are taught using the phosphorous-31 probe. The institution is matching
the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
