In order to teach scientific principles and methods to psychology majors In an
applied field, we propose the establishment of a laboratory in comparative
psychology. This project is designed to meet two goals. First, it will allow the
psychology department to create a new undergraduate laboratory course in animal
behavior. Second, the laboratory and computing equipment will allow students to
perform detailed acoustic and statistical analysis of the species-typical vocal
behavior of zebra finches. By doing this, psychology majors will have the
opportunity to become involved in techniques and methods of scientific research
that are normally not available to them.Clearly, the optimal undergraduate
research experience Involves students working in faculty research laboratories.
Unfortunately, this approach limits the number of students who have contact with
the faculty member, and the types of research projects in which the students may
participate. By establishing a student laboratory in an area that matches the
research of a faculty member, these problems are eliminated.
