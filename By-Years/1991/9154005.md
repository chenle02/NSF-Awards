This proposal is to carry out exploratory research on "real-world" problem
situations. First the resign of such a problem will be undertaken by a
consortium that consists of faculty from a research university, members from a
national laboratory, and members of an institute for research on learning
together with middle school teachers. The research will address how does working
on such problems link up with the practice of symbolic skills; connect to
mathematical idealizations, e.g. how should the students understanding of linear
functions be introduced and emphasized; require additional understanding in
subject matter and pedagogy for the teacher. Also the questions of assessment of
students will be studied. A project report of the research findings will be made
available for other developers of this type of materials.
