Mathematical gauge theory is a branch of modern geometry partly rooted in high-
energy physics. Its central objects are the gauge fields appearing in the theory
of nuclear forces discovered by C.-N. Yang and R. Mills in 1954, which were
already familiar to mathematicians. The Yang-Mills field equations have
subsequently had an enormous influence in geometry, notably through Donaldson's
work on four-dimensional exotic smooth structures. Yang-Mills flow is a natural
evolution process designed to solve the Yang-Mills equations, much as Hamilton's
Ricci flow does for the Einstein equations. The goal of this research is to
pursue novel applications to mathematical gauge theory by refining and extending
the PI's results on the analytic behavior of Yang-Mills flow.

In dimension four, it remains to establish the uniqueness of the infinite-time
Uhlenbeck limit together with the position of the bubbling points, which
requires carrying out the well-known convergence technique due to Leon Simon in
the presence of singularities. There are two main directions for applying the
flow within 4-dimensional gauge theory: the first is to non-minimal solutions of
the Yang-Mills equations on the 4-sphere, where the analogue of the Willmore
conjecture (proved by Marques and Neves in 2012) is still unknown. The second is
to the Atiyah-Jones conjecture on the stable topology of instanton moduli spaces
on the 4-sphere or a K3 surface. The simpler case of the Yang-Mills functional
over 3-manifolds is also largely unexplored. Lastly, the PI intends to develop
Yang-Mills flow as a tool within the Donaldson-Thomas program for gauge theory
on higher-dimensional manifolds with special holonomy.
