We proposed to develop a comprehensive academic support program in mathematics
for minority undergraduate students at Stony Brook. The program will have two
major aims: 1. Create special workshops for freshman calculus to enable minority
students studying calculus to develop confidence in their mathematical problem-
solving skills and gain analytical insights to launch them successfully into
major in mathematics, science and engineering. 2. Attracts more minority
students into majors in mathematics, and offer these students a program of
academic support and independent projects that will prepare them to enter
graduate programs in the mathematical sciences.
