Northeastern U.&lt;br/&gt;Title: Multiple Pathways towards Gender Equity in the
Information Technology Workforce&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This ITWF award provides
support for a study of graduates of an information systems graduate program
(MSIS) at Northeastern University, as well as men and women currently working in
Information Technology (IT) positions, to understand the factors that influence
entry and persistence of women in IT positions. The MSIS program was designed
for adult learners who wished to make a career transition to the IT field. The
research team will use the longitudinal data collected in the study to develop
and validate a model that will predict women's IT career pathways.
