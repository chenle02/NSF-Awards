*** 95-28553 INRAD, Inc. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project addresses a narrowband, widely tunable infrared light source of
wavelengths in the 3-12 micron region. This spectral region is rich in molecular
signatures, but there are no commercial laser light sources that are both
powerful and broadly tunable in the region. Phase I produced a narrowband,
widely tunable optical parametric oscillator (OPO) based on zinc germanium
diphosphide. Phase II will construct a higher power, narrower bandwidth, more
widely tunable prototype source. Improvement will be sought in coatings, the
extraction of energy from the OPO, and amplification in an optical parametric
amplifier (OPA). Pump laser requirements will be studied for a practical OPO/OPA
system. A prototype system will be constructed that generates a few millijoules
per pulse of tunable, long-wavelength infrared light in a low divergence beam
with a narrow spectral bandwidth. Tunable laser radiation in the 3-12 micron
range will be important in studies of molecular species in environmental
research and atmospheric remote sensing that use mobile LIDAR systems.***
