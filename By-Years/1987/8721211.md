This award will provide one-half the funds necessary to purchase a computing
system to be used in mathematical modeling of the chemical reactions and
transport of elements that occurs during the metamorphism of rocks. The
equipment will be housed at Indiana University. The computing system will be
used to interactively simulate water-rock interactions. Reaction and transport
equations incorporating the stress and interfacial energy dependence of
equilibrium constants will be simulated to predict the formation of layering and
other forms of self organization found in metamorphic rocks.
