This award will support a U.S.-France workshop on Operads and Homotopical
Algebra to take place in Luminy, France, May 29 - June 2, 1995. The organizers
of the workshop are James D. Stasheff of the University of North Carolina and
Jean-Louis Loday of the Institute for Research in Advanced Mathematics,
Strasbourg, France. The objective of the workshop is to bring together American,
French and other Western European mathematicians for discussions on new research
directions on operad and its applications. An operad is a mathematical device
which models many kinds of algebras There is renewed interest in the topic due
to discovery of its relationships to other fields in mathematics (e.g.,
representation theory, graph cohomology, moduli spaces) and its application in
statistical mechanics, theoretical physics and string theory. The workshop takes
advantage of the interests and varied expertise of U.S. and Western European
researchers. It will enhance interactions among the researchers and lead to
future collaborations.
