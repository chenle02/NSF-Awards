This project involves a computer laboratory for interactive learning in
undergraduate geography and geology. Courses are also an integral part of an
environmental science program at the institution. An electronic classroom
consists of microcomputers and computer display equipment that is used for
interactive lectures, demonstrations, and as part of geography and geology
laboratory exercises. Courses and exercises include meteorology, cartography,
computer mapping, imaging interpretation, remote sensing, GIS, field techniques,
plate tectonics and geophysics. The laboratory itself is improving teaching
effectiveness and provides students hands-on experiences in geo-processing
technology. Collectively, the project integrates a computer learning facility
and courses that prepare students to function in a problem-solving environment.
