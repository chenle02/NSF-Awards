9402212 Hamilton This is the first phase of a major research project to study
social and psychological consequences of military base closing in Russia and the
United States. A cross-disciplinary and cross- cultural team of researchers will
survey soldiers, their spouses, and civilians in surrounding communities and
will intervene with selected subsamples to evaluate attempts to alleviate
problems associated with unemployment. By conducting parallel studies in two
societies with very different economic, social, and cultural conditions, this
study will evaluate the stability of findings concerning the effects of
unemployment, while documenting the social consequences of military
demobilization. %%% By bringing together teams of researchers in Russia and the
United States, this project contributes to mutual understanding in the crucial
area of downsizing of these nations' military establishments. The results of the
research are expected to contribute directly to sociology, psychology and
social-psychology. Unemployment and other negative unintended consequences of
demilitarization threaten the benefits Americans hope to gain with the end of
the Cold War, and this study will improve the knowledge base on which policy-
makers can make their decisions. ***
