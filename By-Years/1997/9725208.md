9725208 Yeats This action provides support for continued research on the
earthquake hazzard potential of a portion of the Indian Himalaya. The work
involves completion of field studies, including trenching, designed no establish
recurrence rates and other parameters and to effect technology transfer to
Indians concurring establishment of a viable earthquake hazzard mitigation
program. Results will provide information concerning recurrence intervals and
various earthquake parameters for the great Himalayan earthquakes. They will
also help establish a viable domestic earthquake hazzard mitigation capability
in India.
