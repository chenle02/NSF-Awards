This study will calibrate a high resolution oxygen-isotopic stratigraphy of
Pliocene-early Pleistocene of 17 deep sea sites in the Pacific, Atlantic, and
Indian Oceans with calcareous nannofossil datum events. It will establish the
synchroniety or diachroniety of these datum events and lead to a more precise
biochronostratigraphy for this critical interval for meaningful paleoecological,
paleoceanographic and climatic interpretations.
