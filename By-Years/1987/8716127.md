This grant continues support for the study of the windfield near Terra Nova Bay
and the effects of these strong winds on cyclogenesis in the Ross Sea. The work
is performed by a collaboration of T. Parish at the University of Wyoming and D.
Bromwich at Ohio State University. Cold air runs down the several converging
gaps in the mountains that form the coastline near Terra Nova Bay. The resulting
katabatic winds are among the strongest and most persistent winds in the world.
The proposers have collected data for the past several years from a variety of
sources, including instrumented aircraft measurements, automatic weather
stations, airborne photography of snow formations and satellite imagery. This
work will continue the analysis of existing data and the continued collection of
additional data from satellites and the automatic weather stations. Models will
be developed to attempt to account for the observed winds. Some of the automatic
weather station data are collected in conjunction with the Italian Antarctic
research base at Terra Nova Bay.
