This proposal is a request for support to help cover the costs of organizing the
2004 meeting of the Physics in Collision Conference. It will take place from
June 27-29, 2004 at Boston University. The funds will be used entirely to
support graduate students and young scientists who otherwise could not afford to
attend the meeting.
