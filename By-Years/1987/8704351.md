Males of many species often have colorations and morphologies that are different
from females. Darwin proposed that these differences were due to sexual
selection; that is, the characteristics were associated with increased mating
success. There are two sources of sexual selection; one arises from competition
between males for mates, and the other from female choice of mates, This
proposal uses a series of experiments based on transplants of males among local
populations to differentiate those male characteristics that are shaped by
competition from those shaped by female choice. This question has never been
approached in systematic fashion before, and should greatly increase our
understanding of the dynamics of sexual selection. An equally important factor
affecting sexual selection is the cost to a female for exercising a choice of
mates. Dr. Warner will investigate these costs in terms of the resultant
mortality and fertilization rates that result from different choices.
