In many areas of the country, white-tailed deer populations "are large, growing,
and perceived to be causing many problems for f1uman comunities. In some of
these areas, lethal measures have been used to cull the herds; in others,
citizens have called for fertility control methods such as immunocontraception
or surgical sterilization. In other locations, feral cats present a similar
management problem. Because cats are kept as pets by many people, some states
have laws offering "wild" cats a measure of protection from lethal control that
other nuisance species lack. The examples of deer and cat overpopulation raise
many interesting ethical questions about the appropriateness of managing animals
by manipulating their reproductive systems. To address these questions, this
study relies on two components: an empirical descriptive component and a
normative philosophical component. In the descriptive component, the
investigators ask: what do people believe about wildlife fertility control, and
why do they believe what they believe? In the normative component, the central
question is: how well do peoples' moral beliefs about wi1dlife fertility control
match the content of philosophical literature? The objectives of this project
are to: (1) characterize the ethical arguments people use to support their
judgments about fertility control for deer and feral cats; (2) identify the
characteristics of fertility control methods that influence these judgments; (3)
synthesize works in the ethical literature that have relevance to people's
arguments about wildlife fertility control; and (4) analyze people's arguments
about wildlife fertility control based on this synthesis.

The classification of arguments will provide the basis for the subsequent
ethical analysis, in which the beliefs and arguments described in the empirical
component will be analyzed for their validity and cogency based on an analysis
of the relevant ethical literature. This research will help to generate
recommendations for improving the quality of deliberation about fertility
control in wildlife management. In future research, the investigators will use
the results of this study to guide the design and testing of educational
strategies that will help stakeholders better consider the ethical ramifications
of different decisions about wildlife fertility control. Improving how people
are educated about the ethical ramifications of wildlife fertility control will
help to ensure that management decisions are based on a thorough consideration
of the ethical dimensions of these issues.
