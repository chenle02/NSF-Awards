The focus of this research is the use of ligands to control catalyst homogeneity
and miscibility. First, polymeric ligands will be prepared that have inverse
temperature dependent solubility. The goal is to use a macromolecular ligand to
both ligate a metal and to regulate a reaction. Second, oligomeric ligands will
be designed to provide or contribute to the solvent microenvironment around a
catalyst so that the effects of bulk solvent are mitigated. Third,
macromolecules will be studied for the ability to phase isolate soluble species
from one another in a common solvent. Finally, chiral macromolecular ligands
that enhance stereoselectivity will be studied. %%% With this award, the
Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. David E. Bergbreiter
of the Department of Chemistry at Texas A&amp;M University. Professor
Bergbreiter will focus his work on using the properties of soluble
macromolecules to design ligands that control the physical properties of
homogeneous catalysts. The general idea is to learn if the physiochemical
properties of soluble polymers can control a homogeneous catalyst's homogeneity
and miscibility in useful ways.
