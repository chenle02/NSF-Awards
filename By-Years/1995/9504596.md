Institution: Colorado State Title: Times Series Models and Extreme Value Theory
Abstract: The research is concerned with problems of estimation and research for
time series models whose theory is not yet fully understood. The standard linear
Gaussian models for time series data are inadequate to describe many of the time
series observed in practice so it is important to develop techniques for
estimation and prediction based on more general models. Efficient estimation
procedures and prediction techniques for non-causal and non-invertible ARMA
processes are developed and a study made of the theory and application of
continuous-time linear and non-linear ARMA processes. Extreme value theory for
linear and non-linear models is also investigated. Existing methods of
forecasting are based on assumptions which are frequently not satisfied by
observed economic and scientific time series data. This research develops
methods of analysis and forecasting for a more general class of time series
models, leading to more accurate forecasting of series which do not meet the
restrictive assumptions of the classical theory.
