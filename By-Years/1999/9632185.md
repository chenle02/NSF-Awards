9632185 Riemer The Committee on Astronomy and Astrophysics (CAA) is the National
Research Council's (NRC) advisory body for astronomy and astrophysics, both
ground-and space-based. The CAA is overseen jointly by the Board on Physics and
Astronomy (BPA) and the Space Studies Board (SSB). The CAA provides science
policy recommendations on astronomy and astrophysics issues to the National
Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA), the Congress, the astronomy community, and other organizations. The
activity is supported jointly by the NSF and NASA (through the SSB's core
support). ***
