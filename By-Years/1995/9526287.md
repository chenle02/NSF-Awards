The PIs will perform a comprehensive study of the interaction of the jovian
magnetosphere with cometary dust from Shoemaker-Levy 9. They plan to explore the
spatial evolution of dust particles from (1) the breakup of the comet, (2) the
suspected low level cometary activity during the two year trip of the nuclei
from breakup until reentry, and (3) the motion of charged dust clouds inside the
magnetosphere. Collaborating with a number of other observers, the PIs will
analyze the dust detector observation from Ulysses and Galileo. In addition,
their models will be used to explain the observed distortion of the dust trails
as some of the nuclei reentered the magnetosphere. The ultimate goal of this
project is to provide a detailed inventory of the spatial and temporal evolution
of cometary dust in Jupiter's magnetosphere.***
