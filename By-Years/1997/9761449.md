*** 9761449 Valamanchili This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
will attempt to design and build a variable geometry rheometer and a companion
package of data reduction and modeling software that allows for the study of
field dependent fluids, under application of varying electric or magnetic
fields. Understanding and quantifying the phenomenology of smart materials is
essential to their widespread use in industrial and technological settings,
where issues of reliability and quality control are essential. Such
understanding requires a broad class of material models to characterize,
interpret, and extrapolate the experiments. By the use of plug-ins and fittings,
the rheometer to be developed will allow for both steady and oscillatory
experiments to be conducted in the cone-cup, plate-cup, and Couette geometries
under conditions of both controlled stress and strain rates. These geometries
allow for the measurement of shear stresses and certain normal stress
differences, as well as for cross correlations with models. There is significant
potential for field dependent fluids to be used in industries ranging from
automotive to rehabilitation. Many companies are working towards developing
numerous devices which use field dependent fluids. A key role will be played by
measurement and modeling packages, that allow for the accurate characterization
of these fluids. ***
