In the course of this project, the PI will work with collaborators to solve a
number of compelling problems at the interface between three-manifold topology
and geometric group theory.  One of the main projects aims at understanding the
class of three-manifold groups algorithmically, within the class of groups with
solvable word problem. Another project is to understand the procedure of group
theoretic "Dehn filling" from the perspective of boundaries of hyperbolic and
relatively hyperbolic groups. Finally, the PI will study (again algorithmically)
the class of "virtually geometric" words in free groups.

Three-manifolds are topological objects which are locally three-dimensional,
like the spatial part of our universe.  Geometric group theory is the study of
infinite groups using tools from geometry and topology.  A consequence of the
recently resolved Geometrization Conjecture is that (most) three-manifolds are
determined by their fundamental groups.  It follows that all the topology (and
geometry!) of a three-manifold is encoded in its fundamental group, which then
can be studied using geometric and algorithmic group theory. One concrete
product of this work will be software useful for exploring the class of three-
manifold presentations.
