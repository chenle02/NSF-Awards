Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: CHE-023531 Date:
1-03-2003&lt;br/&gt;PI: Dea Institution: Occidental College
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chemistry Division award supports a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Occidental College for the summers
of 2003-2005. Phoebe K. Dea is the site's program director. Six faculty members
from the chemistry department will serve as REU mentors to eight students, who
will each participate in a ten-week program. Half of the students will be
recruited from local community colleges. The proposed research projects range
from biophysical chemistry, to organic synthesis, to biochemistry, to advanced
materials research. The program will have weekly research seminars, student
presentations, several social events and a final week College-wide poster
session and oral presentations. &lt;br/&gt;
