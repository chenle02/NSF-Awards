The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to create
wireless chargers, which are necessary for the eventual adoption of
programmatic/semi-autonomous commercial drone usage. These chargers directly
address the significant challenge of drone battery capacity, and serve in the
same capacity as gas stations do for cars and trucks. Given the rapidly growing
interest in the use of drone technology for historically dangerous and onerous
activities such as oil & gas, telecom, and utility asset inspection, the
platform could become a key part of the eventual drone infrastructure. Wireless
charging is inherently a clean method of power transmission; by enabling cleaner
technologies, such as electric multicopters, rather than fuel-powered fixed-wing
drones, our platform will be a major accelerant for energy savings in the
future.

This I-Corps project successfully demonstrates long-distance wireless power
transfer using Radio Frequency (RF) beamforming. A working prototype with
multiple antennas and an energy harvester that exhibits successful long-range
wireless charging using RF beamforming has been developed using software defined
radios. In order to scale the system to deliver wireless power to drones, a
massive MIMO transmitter with multiple antennas is proposed. Each antenna's
signal constructively interferes with the others, providing an efficiently
beamformed power gain in the direction of the drone, which is retrofitted with a
rectifier to convert the electromagnetic energy to usable direct current to
charge the battery. Provided the drones are within line-of-sight, the chargers
can deliver power wirelessly from up to 40 to 60 feet, also assuming proper
compensation of the mutual coupling from the antennas. The transmitter and
receiver architectures at the scale of drones have been fully designed, and
require further implementation of the digital signal processing software, system
parallelization, and high-power rectifying circuit to realize the full
beamforming solution.
