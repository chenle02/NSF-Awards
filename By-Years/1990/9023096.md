This award supports Professor Robert Soare of the University of Chicago and
three other US mathematicians to collaborate on research in the field of
mathematical logic with Professor Klaus Ambos-Spies of the University of
Heidelberg. Through reciprocal research visits, they are developing new insights
into recursive function theory, the theory of computation, and computational
complexity. Research on these topics has recently become very active in the U.S.
and abroad. The increasing relation and application to theoretical computer
science and computational complexity have made them even more timely. The U.S.
participants in this collaboration have become some of the U.S. leaders in the
field of recursive function theory. Germany, meanwhile, has had a long and
distinguished tradition in the field. Klaus Ambos- Spies is currently the
leading figure in Germany in recursive function theory. He has done extensive
work in applications of the methods of recursive function theory to
computational complexity. Further collaboration among these leading
mathematicians in this increasingly important field should continue to be
extremely productive.
