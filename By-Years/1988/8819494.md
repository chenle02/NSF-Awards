This project is a three-day mathematical conference on Approximation Theory and
Numerical Linear Algebra, with an emphasis on the interaction between the two
subjects. The conference will be held March 30 - April 1, 1989 at Kent State
University in Kent, Ohio. There will be invited one-hour talks, solicited
twenty-minute talks, and contributed fifteen-minute talks. The main focus of the
conference is to bring together international scholars in these two areas of
mathematics in an intense and close environment conducive to interaction. There
is some participant support available. The conference is under the direction of
Professor E.C. Gartland and will be sponsored by the Department of Mathematical
Sciences and the Institute for Computational Mathematics at Kent State
University, Kent, Ohio.
