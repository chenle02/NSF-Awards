0308345&lt;br/&gt;Bash&lt;br/&gt;This 3-year award to University of Rhode Island
(URI) provides support for technical services during NSF-funded programs on R/V
Endeavor, a 184' general purpose research vessel operated as part of the
University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. URI will
provide one shipboard technician on each cruise of R/V Endeavor to support
seagoing research projects and to maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified
users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation. As
specialized services, they will maintain and operate an undulating, towed
vehicle system that is portable, and is available for use on appropriate R/V
Endeavor or other UNOLS vessels as scheduling allows. The technical support and
instrument maintenance provided via this award enables shared-use operation of
this oceanographic facility by qualified researchers from throughout the US, and
it enables efficient use of the vessel for federally-funded oceanographic
research. Budgets for technical support are evaluated annually, and the cost is
based on the proportion of vessel use by each sponsoring
agency.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
