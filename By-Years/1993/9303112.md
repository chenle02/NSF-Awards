9303112 Morrison A combined experimental and theoretical investigation will be
carried out addressing the issue of melt fracture in the processing of polymeric
materials. A set of experiments with monodispersive polybutadine and polystyrene
will be conducted in various shear flows. The results will be compared to
existing and new calculations on a variety of constitutive equations which
predict viscoelastic instabilities. The investigators hope to establish an
unambiguous constitutive explanation of melt fracture. If the investigators
succeed in establishing such an interpretation of a so far ambiguous and
controversial phenomenaon, it will open the door to eliminating failures from
melt fracture in the processing of polymeric materials. ***
