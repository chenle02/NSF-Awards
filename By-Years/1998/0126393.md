Biological Sciences (61)&lt;br/&gt;Carroll College, Wisconsin's oldest
institution of higher education, is adapting an effective model of core
curriculum reform for the liberal arts setting. We are modeling our curriculum
reform efforts after a successful program developed at the California State
University at Fullerton. Our initial efforts at curriculum revision resulted in
substantive changes to the content presented in the four core courses, but did
not impact how that content was delivered. As outlined in this proposal, our
efforts at curriculum reform now center on three objectives for enhanced student
learning: 1) strengthening the investigatory skills of students, 2) modeling the
integration of biological fields, and 3) developing and implementing multi-level
assessment strategies that validate practice and identify areas for growth. This
project supports faculty development to help coordinate our teaching efforts,
enhance our expertise with particularly effective pedagogical strategies, and
measure the effectiveness of our curriculum. Students are using essential
equipment including mobile workstations in a series of integrated investigations
designed to develop research skills incrementally while also demonstrating the
connections between multiple levels of biological inquiry. Our ultimate goal in
this phase of curricular reform is to enhance student learning by creating an
assessment-driven core curriculum. The outcome of our project is students who
more successfully retain basic concepts in upper-division courses and who
approach their senior research project with a solid foundation in how to ask and
answer biological questions. Secondary biology education students are integrated
into our teaching collaboratives, enhancing their professional preparation. We
are also improving the teaching skills of faculty in the biology department,
with reform spreading to other members of the Science Division, other Carroll
faculty members, and local high school and college science teachers who
participate in faculty development opportunities.
