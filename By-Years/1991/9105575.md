This research is to determine the lateral variation in the uppermost mantle
P-wave velocity and to determine the crustal thickness in the Middle East and
Central Asia. This region has been affected by continental collision between the
Arabian and Eurasian plates and between the Indian and Eurasian plates. The
method is a tomographic inversion of the large data base of regional seismic
travel times from the Worldwide Standardized Seismographic Network and other
Asian stations. The derived uppermost mantle velocities and crustal thicknesses
will be used to constrain models for the evolution of continental plateaus
behind collisional mountain belts, and factors controlling earthquake
distribution. This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard
Reduction Program.
