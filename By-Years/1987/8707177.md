An important new phase in the study of parallel execution of logic programs is
the development of efficient implementation techniques. This project focuses on
the design of a virtual machine for the AND/OR Process Model, an abstract
execution model in which user goals are solved by independent objects
communicating via messages. This work can be characterized as an attempt to do
for the AND/OR Process Model what the Warren Abstract Machine (WAM) did for
Prolog: achieve significantly faster execution through compilation to a virtual
machine tailored to the model of computation. Important aspects of a virtual
machine for logic programs are the representation of binding environments and
instructions that control the order in which goals are solved. The proposed
machine will build what they call "closed environments," environments that have
little or no interaction,so that they can be built and moved anywhere in a
multiprocessor system. Minimal interaction between environments is important if
the system will be implemented on a non-shared memory multiprocessor. The
instruction set of the virtual machine will be tailored to operations of a new
method for controlling AND-parallel processing.
