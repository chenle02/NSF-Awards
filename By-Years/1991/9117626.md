Grossman plans to combine data from different remote sensor platforms with more
conventional data and turbulent flux measurements in the 1992 STORMFEST
experiment. STORMFEST's primary scientific goals are first, to field-test new
mesoscale observing and forecasting systems in preparation for later major field
experiments of the U.S. Weather Research Program; and second, to study the
mesoscale structures of winter frontal and precipitation synoptic scale flow in
which they are embedded. His objective is to quantitatively describe the
structure of the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) in a 50-km square nested within
the larger scale experimental array. The data will provide estimates of fluxes
and profiles over the diurnal cycle, in a variety of meteorological situations,
with varying cloud cover. The database can later be used by other investigators
in conjunction with other experimental (numerical large-eddy simulation) data to
comparatively evaluate the various PBL parameterizations currently in use in GCM
and climate models, and, it is hoped, lead to improved versions of these.
