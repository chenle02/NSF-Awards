ABSTRACT: This project concerns the construction of a combinatorial model of
geometry to be used in theoretical studies where differential forms and tensors
appear inadequate or in practical work, where scientific computation is
required. We have discovered an operator "delta" in the cell structure of the
space of closed curves in a manifold (string space), which records how finite
collections of strings interact with themselves and with each other. This
operator induces a Lie bialgebra structure on the homology of the space of the
locally embedded strings. After developing the abstract theory behind these
string interactions, we will build an explicit combinatorial model using any
cell decomposition of the manifold. The concrete model will be designed to
implement nonlinear computations that arise in the motion of fluids, gases, or
plasmas. The motion of these media is closely related to the way curves in space
twist and curl under the influence of physical forces. Also, the interactions of
the basic structure "delta" alluded to above, can be readily seen in such
phenomena as the recoupling of vertex trails behind the wing tips of airplanes.
We have some optimism that some of our goals can be realized because the
mathematical structure of closed curves seems very well adapted geometrically to
many of the problems we care about on the one hand, and on the other hand once
revealed this structure seems to flow forth rather willingly and with some
pageantry and richness.
