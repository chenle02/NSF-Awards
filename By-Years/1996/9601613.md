*** 9601613 Burchat This grant provides partial support for the purchase of
computer and electronics instrumentation for the recently expanded experimental
particle physics effort in the Physics Department at Stanford University. This
instrumentation will be used by faculty, research associates, graduate students
and undergraduates working on the design of detectors and electronic readout
systems, as well as the analysis of data, for experiments that explore the
fundamental constituents of matter. The instrumentation requested in this
proposal will provide the core around which a strong research effort in detector
development and data analysis can be built. The instrumentation has two related
components: state-of-the- art instrumentation for the development of high-speed
electronics for detector readout and a computer system comprised of a powerful
central server and a cluster of advanced workstations, sufficient to meet both
the simulation and analysis needs of the particle physics group at Stanford. The
instrumentation for detector development consists of high-speed digital and
analog oscilloscopes and a high-speed pulse generator for simulating detector
pulses and for synchronization in applications with critical timing
requirements. ***
