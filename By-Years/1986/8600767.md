This is a theoretical project to obtain a new design methodology for mechanism
design. The method is based on the technique of kinematic mappings. It can be
shown that a kinematic mapping converts the set of possible positions of a
mechanism to an image curve, surface, or solid in a space whose dimensions
depend on the number of degrees of freedom of the system. By determining the
differential properties of the image, this information can be used to design
spatial mechanisms and manipulators in a more efficient manner than is currently
used. This project develops those differential properties and thus establishes
the mathematical foundations for a design methodology based on kinematic
mappings.
