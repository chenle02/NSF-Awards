9407965 ORZACK This is a study of two species of wasp, Nasonia giraulti and N.
vitripennis. Females of these species, like those of many other Hymenoptera
(ants, bees, and wasps), often produce more female than male offspring in their
broods. One common explanation for such an excess (known as a female-biased sex
ratio) is that it has evolved as a response to geographical subdivision of the
population. However, there is no reliable information about population
subdivision in these species (and many others like them). This study will
provide such information. For both species, DNA sequences from individuals will
be compared. The degree to which these sequences differ within and among
localities will reveal whether these species have subdivided populations which
will lead to the evolution of female-biased sex ratios. In addition, females
will be compared to determine whether they differ in regard to the set of sex
ratios they produce when producing offspring in the presence of varying numbers
of other females. This study will also assess whether the number and kind of DNA
sequence differences among individuals are accounted for by the theory that such
differences are not affected by natural selection.
