Sulfur gases are important components of the global cycle of S. They contribute
to the acidity of precipitation and they influence global radiation balance and
climate. The role of terrestrial sources of biogenic S and their effect on
atmospheric chemistry remain as major unanswered questions in our understanding
of the natural S cycle. Preliminary studies by these investigators suggest that
vegetated areas of northern peatlands dominated by Sphagnum mosses emit large
quantities of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) relative to other wetlands, and that
changes in these wetlands during climatic changes could affect the high latitude
atmospheric S cycle. This study will measure the rates of emission of DMS from
wetlands to determine the importance of these habitats as sources of gaseous S,
will address seasonal effects, the role of hydrological changes in affecting DMS
emissions, and the microbiological formation and consumption of DMS in wetlands.
