Simulations of large systems are computation and memory intensive. However for
many critical applications, simulation is the only way to design high
performance and reliable systems. The wide availability of distributed
processors and multiprocessors opens up the possibility of carrying out
simulations by allocating each process in the simulation on a different
processor, thus, potentially achieving significant speedups and low memory
requirement per processor. However, distributed simulation requires resolution
of several problems including decentralizing the advancement of clock,
collection of statistics, termination of simulation, analysis of overheads as
compared with sequential simulation, and optimization of performance. Unlike
previous approaches that incur either too much computation overhead by using
centralized coordination or too much communication overhead by using a
distributed solution, hierarchical decentralized solutions to problems have been
developed in distributed simulation. The objectives of this project are to
explore methods for generating distributed simulations directly from
specification, develop techniques for improving the efficiency of distributed
simulations, design methods for collecting and analyzing data from distributed
simulations, and carry out experiments on a variety of multiprocessing systems.
