This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project proposes
to develop a novel microchip based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on compact
disk (CD-ELISA) for rapid detection of biological molecules.

The commercial application of this project will be for detection of food-borne
pathogens and toxins. The proposed system is expected to have the advantages of
low cost, simple operation, parallel detection, fast response, and ease of
automation.
