Modern signal processing algorithms and their corresponding matrix-based
operations are computationally demanding and require implementation into
application-specific VLSI chips and systems. Since circuits for executing modern
signal processing are large and complex, it is necessary to have state-of-the-
art tools to design the chips and systems. Understanding the nature of such
tools is an important research issue today. The principal investigator is
investigating the structure of an advanced silicon compiler dedicated to the
design of digital signal processing circuits. He intends to analyze and evaluate
different number formats and their finite word-length effects on important
signal processing algorithms, and to evaluate architectural tradeoffs needed for
efficient VLSI realization. Results are being incorproated into high-level
computer-aided-design optimization programs. He is also integrating the system
tradeoffs with lower-level silicon assembler tools through an appropriate
electronic design database.
