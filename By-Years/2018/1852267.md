This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Texas Christian
University provides eight undergraduate students the opportunity to participate
in ten weeks of research on topics in atomic, molecular, bio, chemical, and
statistical physics, as well as astronomy and planetary science. The main goal
of the program is to provide a memorable and potentially career-defining
experience for student participants, who may not have a clear direction of
career path upon entering the program. Thoughtfully-selected field trips, weekly
discussions with other students and faculty, and workshops on career-planning
are vital components of the REU program, providing opportunities for students to
consider a broad range of career possibilities and professions in physics and
engineering-related fields extending beyond the focused summer research project.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to participating in research with an
experienced mentor, the REU students will engage in weekly activities to ensure
not only that their research stays on track but that they have an engaging
collegial and scholarly experience. By the end of the program, every student
will have given a formal presentation about their work and prepared a conference
poster and a 10-page report. This award is supported by the Division of Physics
and the Division of Astronomical Sciences within NSF's Mathematical and Physical
Sciences Directorate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
