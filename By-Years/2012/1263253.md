This award supports the continuation of the Research Experience for
Undergraduates (REU) site at the Department of Physics at Alabama A&amp;M
University (AAMU). The site will provide research opportunities to 27 talented
undergraduate students from institutions with limited access to basic research
in science and engineering. Participating students will be actively engaged in
cutting edge research under the direct supervision of energetic faculty mentors
through the completion of self contained ten week projects in a collaborative
research environment. The projects available to participants include forefront
research in Materials Science, Photonics, Space Science, and Nanotechnology.
Exposure to a dynamic and diverse research in physics enhances the REU
participants' understanding of scientific research and broadens their
perspective on related professional careers in STEM. Each participant will have
an individual research project with one on one mentoring from a faculty member
as well as ample interactions with graduate students. Each participant will be
making unique advances in experimental design, instrumentation, data acquisition
and analysis, as well as engaging in hands on research experience with state of
the art equipment.
