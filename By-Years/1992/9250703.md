The Department of Geology and Astronomy is purchasing sample preparation
equipment required for X-ray fluorescence and X-ray diffraction, used in
conjunction with existing X-ray analysis instruments. Students in upper level
required courses use the analytic equipment in geologic investigations. Students
from a variety of science disciplines at the University enroll in a course
providing general instruction in X-ray analysis. In addition, the equipment is
shared with other departments within the University which are engaged in
undergraduate research.
