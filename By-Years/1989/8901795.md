The research project involves the following three levels: 1) work in theoretical
inductive inference towards the discovery of general properties of learning
algorithms which can indicate whether a particular problem class is learnable or
not, and the precise relationships between the various components involved in
the learning paradigm; 2) work in the development of feasible learning
algorithms towards the discovery of general classes of problems which can be
feasible learned (i.e., learned in polynomial time); and 3) work in the
application of analytical tools to specific learning systems. The majority of
effort will be spent on the last two levels where the investigation into
feasibly solvable learning problems with be guided by potential applications.
