The stress changes induced by the construction of a system of embankments built
over a soft clay deposit will be investigated using a special self-boring
pressuremeter. The approach consists of combined experimental and analytical
studies to evaluate the suitability of the self-boring pressuremeter and to
study the effect of embankment construction on in-situ stress changes and
anisotropy. The proposed program is feasible and should provide useful
information for advancing the understanding of soft clay properties and
improving pressuremeter test techniques. The PI has a solid background in the
proposed research area. An award is recommended.
