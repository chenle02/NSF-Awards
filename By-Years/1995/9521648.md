9521648 Johnson This research involves taxonomic study of several genera in the
Scelionidae, a large group of parasitic wasps of demonstrated importance as
biological control agents of insect pests and of general evolutionary interest.
This group has over 3,000 species described, but the vast majority are either
undescribed or unidentifiable. These wasps attack and kill the eggs of other
insects and spiders, thus acting as a natural means to keep pest populations at
low levels. The project will monograph the taxonomic diversity and relationships
of two genera within the family. %%% The project will be an important
contribution to our understanding of the taxonomy and systematic biology of
scelionid wasps. The results of the study will be published in peer reviewed
publications, in addition the character data, the geographic distribution data
associated with each specimen, and graphical keys to identification will be
stored in electronic form as the work proceeds and then made available on the
Internet. Two graduate students will be trained to develop expertise on the
systematic biology of these wasps as an integral part of the project.
