9623836 Rubenstein Every spring approximately 2.4 billion birds from 185 species
migrate from their African wintering grounds to breed in the Palaearctic. The
migrants are members of 185 species and the majority are small insect eating
passerines. Long distance migration in small passerines is physiologically
intriguing because it combines elements from two disparate physiological states:
fasting and high aerobic exercise. This project will use Old World warblers
(Sylviidae) as a model to study the fuel use and protein conservation of long-
distance vernal migrating passerines. Short, medium and long distance migrants
(Sylvia spp) will be captured mid-migration in Sede Boker, Israel. Variation in
fuels used in flight and protein catabolism will be correlated with the effects
of energy reserves and migration distance. This project promises to add new
levels of understanding to exercise physiology, fasting biology and migration
physiology and promises to broaden our understanding of how these processes can
work in concert.
