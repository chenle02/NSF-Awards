9353030 Garbisch The intent of this project is to prepare a guidebook for
students and teachers of grades 7-12 that will encourage, facilitate, and guide
the creation, enhancement and restoration of wetlands. The guide is expected to
be about 150 pages in length and will be divided into two parts. Part I will
provide information on the common wetland types with integrated learning
activities. Part II will include information on identifying potential sites for
implementing the project and will include the information necessary to achieve
these objectives. The guide will also include information on ecological
functions, hydrologic regimes and plant communities of wetlands. It will provide
an alternative for hands- on projects that will result in a school yard habitat
well suited for student monitoring, research and instructional activities. An
urban wetland restoration project will be selected to field test the project.
