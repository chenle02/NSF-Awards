9354028 Squires A series of computer simulations of industrial-type chemical
engineering processes designed to be used as senior-level chemical engineering
laboratory experiments were developed on a previous grant. This project is
porting five existing computer simulation software modules (presently written
for Sun workstations) to HP, DEC, IBM, and Silicon Graphics workstations. It is
estimated that this effort would triple to 36 the number of chemical engineering
programs using the modules in senior-level courses. The project involves the
application of the new modules at nine other participating schools also. ***
