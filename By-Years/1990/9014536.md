Community-based settlement is an important component in the dynamics of Third
World urbanization. It consists of lower-income, self-help housing characterized
by occupant-builders who act together in their collective best interests. It
stands in contrast to the more common settlements of individuals who act singly
in their own best interests. While studies of individualistic settlement of
independent family units abound, no empirical studies have been conducted on
community-based settlements. This doctoral dissertation research is a field-
based study that will compare two individualistic and two community-based
settlements in Mexico City and Ciudad Juarez in order to explore differences in
occupant-builders' design motives, the resultant housing designs, and subsequent
levels of housing consolidation. Data for the study will be collected by means
of participant observation, selected informant interviewing, heuristic
elicitation "games," and research evaluation of buildings. This research will
provide valuable information for urban geographers, planners and developers, and
architects about the expression of the social dynamics of self-help housing in
the development of urban landscapes. It will contribute to our knowledge about
the provision of adequate housing for thousands of families who are moving from
rural areas to rapidly growing cities in developing countries throughout the
world. The project also will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising
young scholar to continue to develop independent research skills.
