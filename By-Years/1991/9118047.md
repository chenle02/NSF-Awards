The principal investigator will study the source of fluids, the length scales of
compositional heterogeneties in the fluid, and the timing of fluid-rock
interaction within the Franciscan complex of California, utilizing isotopic and
other geochemical techniques. The results of this work will bear on the role of
fluids in subduction zones, as well as on the geologic history of North America.
