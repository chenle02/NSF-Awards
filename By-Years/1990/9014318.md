The computer graphics metafile interpreter GPLOT, produced at PSC, has been
extremely successful with over 150 copies transmitted to users. The basic system
is very stable, but there is a continued need for maintenance and further
development, driven by the advent of both new output devices and official
extensions to the CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) standard. The proposal effort
will address recent new addenda to the present ANSI CGM standard, and
incorporate two new devices in the GPLOT driver interface.
