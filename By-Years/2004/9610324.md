9610324 Williams Organizations Concerned about Rural Education (OCRE) will
identify exemplary community-based initiatives utilizing technology to enhance
science and mathematics learning for students in rural areas. The project will
contribute to contribute to community decisions by citing examples from rural
America that showcase innovative collaborative efforts that will be featured in
a national video conference in March 1997. Print and on-line information will
complement the video conference materials. Project strategies include: a survey
to identify initiatives, documentation on each selected by case study an
inclusion in the video conference on-site and follow-up materials, dissemination
via on-line, and features in OCRE's newsletter and other publications. The
project will describe common initiative features such as: innovative approaches
for use of technology, components for professional development, scalability and
replicability, attention instruction and content, implications for public
policy, sensitivity to resource constraints of rural communities, and commitment
and active participation of community leaders. ***
