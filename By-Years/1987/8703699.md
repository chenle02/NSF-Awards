Lactobacillus plantarum produces a manganese-containing enzyme with catalase
activity, which has been called pseudocatalase to distinguish it from the heme
enzyme catalase. Pseudocatalase is an oligomer of subunits each of which
contains two manganese atoms which have been shown by ESR measurements to
participate in a binuclear cluster. Catalytic activity is inhibited by
hydroxylamine and by fluoride in the presence of substrate, hydrogen peroxide.
These features suggest that this enzyme is a close relative and a soluble
homologue of the binuclear manganese enzyme in the oxygen evolving center of
green plant photosynthesis. Dr. Carter has crystallized this enzyme in the
presence and absence of a combination of substrate and fluoride that leads to
inactivation of the enzyme and attendant bleaching of the prosthetic group. The
crystals diffract to high resolution and he has collected three-dimensional
native crystal intensity data to 4.5A resolution. He now plans to solve the
crystal structures and to analyze them for clues to their reaction mechanism and
their relationship to the oxygen evolving center.
