Research is conducted to design instructional methods that effectively
integrate knowledge about science instruction, higher-order skill acquisition,
instructional design, and intelligent tutoring. This project develops a
prototype of an intelligent tutoring tool, that incorporates these new
instructional methods with real life examples and a collaborative information
delivery environment to support teaching and learning of chemical engineering in
introductory undergraduate classes. The project capitalizes on the information
rich environment of the World Wide Web (WWW), the full distributed and
multimedia capabilities of the Internet, Java, and the use of multimedia,
Internet, and interactive visualization tools. The freshman engineering
courseware that utilizes study-buddy will focus on fundamentals of chemistry
with real life examples such as current environmental issues of air pollution
and ozone depletion.
