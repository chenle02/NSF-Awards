The focus of this research is the development of new catalysts for
enantioselective reactions. Chiral phosphines and chiral derivatives of
dimethylaminopyridine will be evaluated as enantioselective acylation catalysts,
as well as sulfonation and phosphorylation catalysts. The emphasis will be on
reagents that can be used under conditions of cooperative catalysis. Procedures
that allow simultaneous catalysis by a chiral nucleophile and by a Lewis acid
will be investigated, and amplification of selectivity via sequential stages
involving chiral catalysts will be explored. Techniques that provide rapid
access to chiral phosphines will be studied, including enantioselective
protonation of phosphorous-stabilized anions, use of inexpensive chiral subunits
that allow synthesis of enantiomerically pure phosphines via diastereomer
separation, and asymmetric transformation techniques. With this award, the
Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Edwin Vedejs of the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin. Professor Vedejs will
focus his work on the development of practical catalysts for the preparation of
chiral substances in enantiomerically pure form which is of great importance in
the synthesis of compounds of biological and industrial interest. Emphasis will
be placed on main group reagents, such as phosphorus and nitrogen-based
reagents, and non-toxic metal ions to minimize disposal problems in potentially
large scale applications.
