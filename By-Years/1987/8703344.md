Brownian Motion and Differential Geometry: This award recommendation is made
under the U.S.-Industrialized Countries program for the Exchange of Scientists
and Engineers, 1987/1988 Competition. The program is designed to enable U.S.
scientists and engineers to conduct long-term research at research institutions
in the industrialized countries of Western Europe as well as Japan, Australia
and New Zealand. Exchange awards provide opportunities for the conduct of joint
research and the utilization of unique or complementary facilities, expertise
and experimental conditions in foreign countries. Awards are selected on the
basis of scientific criteria relevant to his/her field of science, the
prospective potential of the applicants for professional growth, as well as
criteria relevant to the furthering of international cooperation in science and
engineering. The program is particularly directed to scientists and engineers
who are embarking on their research careers. This research project addresses
applications of stochastic processes to problems in differential geometry. The
first area of discussion is the use of Brownian motion to prove vanishing
theorems for harmonic forms on complete manifolds, as in earlier work of K. D.
Elworthy and the proposer. The second area is the use of Brownian motion
techniques to prove index theorems on noncompact manifolds. The project is under
the direction of Dr. Steven Rosenberg, Department of Mathematics, Boston
University, Boston, MA 02215, U.S.A., and Professor K. D. Elworthy, Mathematics
Institute, University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, United Kingdom. This award
recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate, international travel,
local travel abroad, stipend, dependents allowance, if applicable, language
training, if required, and a flat administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S.
home institution.
