This proposal describes an electron diffraction study of the structure of free-
standing smectic liquid crystal films that exhibit novel hexatic ordering.
Special attention will be given to the behavior near crystal-hexatic and hexatic
liquid phase transitions, and the dependence on sample thickness, and the
occurrence of surface induced phase transitions will be studied.
