This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Invasive species are a large and
growing threat to ecosystem function, biodiversity and even human health.
However, the traits that enable some species to expand their ranges and become
pests remain understudied. The focus of the project is to ascertain how the
world?s most common songbird, the house sparrow, has been able to colonize most
of the planet. Native to Eurasia, this species now is found on all continents
but Antarctica. Some invasions are still ongoing, such as the one in Kenya that
began about 50 years ago. Introduced to the coastal city of Mombasa, the species
is spreading westward towards Uganda predominantly into areas occupied by
humans. It is hypothesized that this range expansion is being facilitated by
adjustments in physiological traits, namely sacrifices of expensive immune
defenses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The emerging field of ecological immunology is
revealing that contrary to intuition, animals do not always possess maximal
levels of immune defense; in some contexts, such as during invasions, they
appear to sacrifice particularly costly components to allocate resources to more
immediately lucrative activities, such as reproduction. To test the hypothesis
that invasions are fostered by sacrifices of immune defenses, comparative field
and lab studies across Kenya will be conducted over several years. This
interdisciplinary approach will involve modern technologies in a 'wild' setting,
and will provide new insight into how to control animal invasions. The impacts
of the work will be broad involving the joint efforts of American students and
scientists, staff at the National Museum of Kenya, and native Kenyan
schoolchildren and their teachers. In sum, the work will provide new information
for an underexplored area of evolutionary biology, improve our ability to
preempt invasions, and simultaneously reinforce scientific relationships in
parts of the world where such networks are yet rare.&lt;br/&gt;
