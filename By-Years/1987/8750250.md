The University will introduce x-ray diffraction techniques into the
undergraduate geology curriculum. X-ray diffraction is an essential tool for
understanding crystal structures and mineralogy. The equipment consists of a
Phillips X-ray diffraction system with scintillation detector and powder camera,
sample preparation equipment, and microprocessor control. The equipment will
find use in introductory mineralogy and petrology courses, advanced optical
mineralogy and petrography courses, a techniques oriented course in x-ray
mineralogy and as part of independent undergraduate research. With the
availability of an x-ray diffractometer, students will gain a greater
appreciation of the fundamental principles of crystallography and mineralogy and
be better able to function as working geologists following graduation.
