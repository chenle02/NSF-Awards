The objective of the proposed research is to develop environmental proxies from
coastal marine microfossils that can be used to reconstruct high-resolution
records of global change over the past millennium. Coastal settings can yield
records of past climates with annual to decadal resolution. The proposed work
will provide a foundation for determining long time series that are needed to
analyze climatic and oceanographic conditions on a range of time scales and to
evaluate the evolution of coastal ecosystems through time. Microfossil and
isotopic data from cores from Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, and living forams
and ostracodes, as well as temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen data from
the area will be used to develop the environmental
proxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
