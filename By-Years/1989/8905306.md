The research involved is in two distinct but related areas of local commutative
algebra. One area is the study of systems of parameters in local rings whose
smaller local cohomology modules have finite length and the effect of blowing-up
an ideal generated by a system of parameters on such. The second area is the
study of minimal birational regular local rings and connections with the regular
closure of ideals. This project involves research on the interface of
commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. Given a curve, a commutative algebra
can be associated with it. Information derived from studying the commutative
algebra supplies information about the curve. This is a rapidly developing area
which impacts many areas of mathematics.
