Dr. Carl Heiles will continue his wide ranging investigations of the diffuse
interstellar medium primarily using radio astronomical techniques. He will
continue extensive observations of Zeeman splitting of the 21-cm neutral
hydrogen line, concentrating on extensive maps of interesting regions; attempt
the measurement of linear polarization of the 18-cm lines of hydroxyl; study the
morphology and kinematics of large interstellar shells and supershells by
detailed mapping of the 21-cm line and diffuse radio recombination lines;
investigate the fundamental topology of the neutral interstellar medium by
intensive analysis of existing data; perform a blind search for anomalous
velocity features, such as may be due to rapidly expanding shells; investigate
the global properties of the diffuse radio recombination line emission and the
Warm Ionized Medium by performing a large survey in the Galactic plane; perform
a comprehensive and detailed investigation of globules in ionized hydrogen
regions by using both molecular and optical emission lines; confirm a possible
detection of the 327 MHz line of deuterium; and launch a search for the 310 MHz
lines of deuterated hydroxyl.
