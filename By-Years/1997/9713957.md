This research project is to develop the knowledge base required for implementing
an advanced control system that more directly controls coating properties in the
integrated plasma deposition processing. The primary areas of the research
include: (a) developing appropriate models that yield insight into the relation
of manipulatable inputs, process variables, and resulting material attributes,
(b) development of appropriate sensors, control strategies and algorithms, and
(c) experimental analysis to confirm models and fundamental assumptions of the
control strategy. The research has a balance between theory and experimentation.
This research effort will be focused on making connections to two industrial
groups: that of the end-user who seek to develop new coatings, and that of the
equipment vendor. While equipment vendors have not historically been leaders at
developing improved control systems for plasma deposition, seeking such
collaborative efforts will help promote diffusion of new technology to industry.
The work is in close collaboration with industry to ensure the research is
focused on issues relevant to industry and to jointly conduct experiments
utilizing an industrial state-of-the-art plasma deposition facility.
