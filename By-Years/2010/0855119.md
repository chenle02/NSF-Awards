The PIs research will encompass a broad program of studies, including nuclear
physics, particle physics, general relativity, string theory and cosmology.
Fundamental impacts will come from phenomenological studies in nuclear and
particle physics, which will extract the fullest possible implications of data
from existing experiments and those anticipated in the near future. Such work is
important in testing the validity of the currently accepted Standard Model of
elementary particles, as well as providing tools for the anticipated discovery
of physics beyond the Standard Model. Further fundamental impact will come from
theoretical work in general relativity, string theory and cosmology which will
probe the foundation of our most basic concepts about the Universe by exploring
new theories which aim to extend what is already known. In particular the PIs
will work on hadronic parity violation, Baryogenesis, rare charm decays, higher
derivative gravity theory, and Randall-Sundrum models of black holes. They also
intend to work on effective theories of gravity, cosmology and dark energy.
Broader impact will accrue through participation in novel interdisciplinary
courses presenting a panorama of science to highly motivated students. Further
impacts will come from a unique venture "Big Bang Radio" which will present
frontier science to a general audience through well-crafted radio programs. The
PIs have also been involved in writing a second edition of dynamics of the
standard model and Kastor has created an interdisciplinary course-Cosmos to
Humanity given through the universities honors program.
