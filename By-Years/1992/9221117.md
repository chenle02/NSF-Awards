Development has proven to be a powerful analytic tool for dissociating
different forms of learning and memory in Aplysia. In this project a
developmental strategy will be used to explore two key questions: (1) What is
the relationship between nonassociative and associative learning? Having already
determined when nonassociative learning (sensitization) emerges, it will first
be determined when associative learning (classical conditioning) emerges.
Following this behavioral analysis, both forms of learning will be compared at
several mechanistic levels: (i) biophysical; (ii) biochemical; and (iii)
synaptic. (2) What is the relationship between short-term memory and long-term
memory? Having already determined when short-term memory (minutes-hours) for
sensitization emerges, it will first be determined when long- term memory (days-
weeks) emerges. Following this behavioral analysis, the development of short-
term and long-term memory will be investigated at biophysical, biochemical, and
synaptic levels of analysis. By using development as a dissecting tool to
uniquely dissociate and analyze complex behavioral and neuronal processes in a
preparation such as Aplysia, which is highly suited for a mechanistic analysis,
this research project can significantly advance scientific knowledge in an area
of fundamental importance: the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying
learning and memory.***//
