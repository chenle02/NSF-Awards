This Research Experiences for Undergraduates award will support ten students
engaged in a nine-week program of research spanning a broad spectrum of the
mathematical frontier. The grant continues REU support based on a plan of broad
faculty involvement and problem selection. Each student will be involved in one
of four possible research areas, with between one and three students working in
each area. Past experience at many REU sites indicates that students are unsure
of their own interests and profit from learning specifics from several faculty
advisors. The advisors will be joined by faculty from Florida A&amp;M
University. Mathematical areas will include the study of fundamental groups and
covering spaces. Using algebraic and topological techniques efforts will be made
to construct covering spaces of various manifolds. Work will also be done using
an interactive graph program to study mapping properties of complex functions as
representations of idealized flows. Modern game theory will be employed to study
conditions under which noncooperative games have cooperative solutions. Studies
on dynamical systems will focus on discretizations of the barotropic vorticity
equation of fluid dynamics. There will be several other scholarly activities on
the campus at the same time as this project. The opportunities for mixing among
students in different disciplines will create a stimulating environment. Joint
social events are planned.
