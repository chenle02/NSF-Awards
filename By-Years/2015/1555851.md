This project will contribute toward increased understanding of surface weather,
accuracy of forecasts and reduction of risk to life and property. In particular,
it will lead to improved forecasting of jet strength, precipitation bands, and
cyclone intensity. The research will enhance understanding of the dynamics
responsible for stratosphere / troposphere exchange, hence the distribution of
climatologically important trace constituents. The website focusing on inertial
instability in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) will enhance
public knowledge of weather systems.

Inertial instability can play a significant role in facilitating stratosphere
troposphere exchange (STE) in midlatitude cyclone. A stratospheric intrusion can
occur by poleward motion in the uppermost troposphere (accelerated by inertial
instability), overriding a thin layer of stratospheric air. Inertial instability
also plays a key role in poleward momentum surges and jet flare-ups. It has also
been found that inertial instability plays a key role in STE associated with
tropical cyclones.

Further modeling and observational studies of the role of inertial instability
in UTLS near both midlatitude and tropical cyclones will be undertaken in this
study. The role of inertial instability in STE, both around the periphery and
near convective maxima, with a focus on the relationship between convective
potential vorticity dipoles and inertial instability in the UTLS, will be
examined. The climatological occurrence and distribution of inertial instability
in the UTLS and its relation to other features of midlatitude cyclones will be
calculated using 37 years (1979-2015) of Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for
Research and Applications (MERRA) data. Composite analysis will be used to
relate the locations of inertial instability to other aspects of cyclones,
including jet locations and air mass pathways. Products will include charts and
sections depicting the location and occurrence of inertial instability in the
context of transport pathways.
