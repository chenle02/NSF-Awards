In a physiology course covering both animals and plants, laboratory methods for
collecting and recording data are being greatly improved. A series of
experiments are being developed to give students the opportunity to collect and
analyze data with state-of-the-art transducers and instrumentation, and a
computerized data acquisition system. In addition, computer simulations of other
physiological events are being used, allowing for practical lab experience,
realistic experimental design, and data analysis in a short period of time and
at low cost. These experiences will better prepare students for advanced
individual research projects, internships, further education, and jobs. The
course is unique in that it combines fundamental principles of cell, animal, and
plant physiology. The college will contribute an amount equal to the award.
