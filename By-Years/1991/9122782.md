Employment relationships across all sizes of firms were altered since the 19th
century, as wage-earners in America moved from small enterprises to large ones.
Simply put, there was transition from a spot market for labor to one of implicit
and explicit contractual relations. The purpose of this project is analyze the
dimensions of the changing relationship between firms and workers and the
implications of this changing relationship for the economy. This research is
particularly timely and important given the continuing and major restructuring
of the American economy and the consequences this holds for American workers.
The underlying thesis to be tested is that a chaotic labor market, in which
workers often participated in nonproductive mobility, was replaced by one that
grated labor property rights in jobs and that more fully utilized the work
force. Labor unions, unemployment insurance, and other protection for labor
fostered the change, but it was also brought about by other forces. Various
aspects of this evolution will be analyzed more thoroughly such as unemployment
and the wage structure across the 20th century. In addition, several related
issues will also be studied including the returns to general and to specific
human capital, the length of the employment relationship, the provision of
benefits, the inter-industry wage differential, and the impact of immigration.
Some of the necessary data sets exist, but in addition a large sample of firm-
level records will be assembled to reveal details about worker-firm
relationships during the 20th century.
