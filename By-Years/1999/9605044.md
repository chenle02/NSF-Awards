9605044 This award provides short term support for a collection of over 500
mutant zebrafish recently isolated by the grantee. The funds will support
distribution of mutants to other researchers on request, and the preparation of
frozen sperm of each mutant strain that will be used to help found a permanent
collection at the University of Oregon sometime in the next year. Over the last
few years, the zebrafish (Danio rerio) has emerged as a promising model system
for genetic studies of vertebrate development. This small tropical fish has a
generation time of about 3 months and lays large numbers of eggs. The eggs are
fertilized externally and develop into transparent embryos. For these reasons,
the fish is amenable to genetic analysis and experimental manipulation at a cost
significantly less than that of the mouse, the only other widely used model
system for genetic studies of vertebrate development. Although the development
of the requisite techniques is relatively recent, a large and growing number of
investigators have begun to use the organism.
