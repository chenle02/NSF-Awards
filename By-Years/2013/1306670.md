Design of a Protein Stability System Regulated by
Light&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tools that can rapidly and conditionally perturb
protein function are critical for the quantitative characterization of complex
biological behavior. While numerous small molecule-based approaches have proven
useful in advancing our understanding of protein signaling, the precise
spatiotemporal regulation of protein activity remains a significant challenge.
To address current limitations, this project aims to develop a general strategy
to control the levels of any protein-of-interest with high spatiotemporal
precision. Key to the success of this methodology is the design of a
photoswitchable degradation (PSD) sequence that becomes metabolically unstable
when irradiated with a specific wavelength of light. In particular, the
photoswitchable degradation system will comprise a mutant of a light-sensitive
phototropin domain that contains an embedded tetrapeptide degron. In the absence
of light, the photoswitchable degradation domain will adopt a conformation that
cages the degron and prevents its recognition by the endogenous cellular quality
control pathways. Upon irradiation with light, the photoswitch mutant will
undergo conformational changes that expose the degron and promote its
degradation. This light- dependent instability will be conferred to any protein-
of-interest genetically fused to the PSD domain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed project, which is co-funded by the program Instrument Development for
Biological Research, will result in a novel, unique tool to (1) control the
activity of any protein-of-interest and (2) elucidate the mechanistic details of
protein-protein interactions. During the tenure of the fellowship, the fellow
will obtain extensive training in the fields of biochemistry, cell biology, and
structural biology. In addition, the fellow will mentor underrepresented
minority undergraduates and K-12 students through the Stanford Summer Research
Program and the Stanford Science in Service Program, respectively.
