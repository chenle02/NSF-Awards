Yuichi Kitamura University of Minnesota - Twin Cities SBR-9632101 This research
will investigate parametric likelihood methods. Parametric likelihood methods
are central to econometric and statistical research. In general, parametric
methods involve the use of rather arbitrary assumptions on the data generating
process. This research will build on recent literature on nonparametric
likelihood methods which extends the concept of likelihood to models without
distributional assumptions. One of the contributions of this research is to
extend various empirical likelihood methods to time series observations by
treating the dependence structure nonparametrically. Extensive simulation
studies will be undertaken to examine the nature of these new methods. In
addition, the project will investigate a new criterion for model comparison,
looking at various specifications of dynamic asset pricing models.
