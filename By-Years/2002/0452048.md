The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will host two 8 week summer
programs, for 6 students each over the next 5 years. Topics will include
Evolutionary Game Theory (Muncaster), Geometric Group Theory (Whittlesey),
Number Theory (Ahlgren, Hildebrand), Harmonic Analysis (Rosenblatt), and
Visualization in Virtual Environments (Francis). Our students join the working
environments of faculty mentors, their postdocs, graduate students and
collaborators. Students work on individual or small group projects in their
mentor's current research area. We provide tutorials in the required math, in
LaTeX and other subject-specific computer packages. Students learn to search the
literature, to give good lectures, and to communicate their solutions in public
seminars and clear pre-prints. We coach their expository skills, referee their
paper drafts, help the students submit their work to journals when appropriate,
and encourage them to give talks at mathematical meetings that include
undergraduate research.

We choose students from applicants across the nation. Women, members of under-
represented minorities, and students from schools without doctoral programs are
especially encouraged to apply. Descriptions of past REU programs can be found
