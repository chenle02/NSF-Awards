This award will support an international symposium on artificial intelligence
and mathematics. The symposium will be held January 3-5, 1990 in Fort
Lauderdale, Florida at the Pier 66 Hotel. There has always been a strong
relationship between mathematics and artificial intelligence with applications
of each discipline to the other. This symposium represents a step towards
improving contact and promoting cross-fertilization between the disciplines. The
invited speakers--David Mumford is the keynote speaker--are excellent
representatives of the two disciplines.
