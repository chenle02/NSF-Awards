Professor Enright's program of mathematical research has three main aspects.
The first is the continuation of a study investigating the connections among
systems of differential equations, certain affine varieties called determinantal
varieties, and highest weight representations for a Lie group. The second
objective is to present a theory of special functors on categories of modules
for a Lie algebra which will allow the extension of the functorial methods of
Zuckerman and Vogan to a domain which includes Kac - Moody Lie algebras. The
third aspect is a study of unitarizability for representations of Kac -Moody
algebras. This project has to do with the representation theory of Lie groups
(and of their cousins, Lie algebras), which bear the name of the Norwegian
mathematician Sophus Lie. One basic example of a Lie group is the group of
rotations of a sphere, where the group operation consists of following one
motion by another. Detailed information concerning this group is very helpful in
solving mathematical or physical problems in which spherical symmetry is
present. Other groups of motions capture other kinds of symmetry. A more
algebraic (as opposed to geometric) source of examples of Lie groups comes from
the multiplication of matrices. The group of all invertible real (or complex)
matrices of a given size is a Lie group, as is just about any subgroup thereof
that can be described in a natural manner. It is desirable to be able to go back
and forth between the geometric and algebraic points of view, for instance to
consider the numerous ways in which the rotation group of the sphere can be
realized as a group of invertible matrices. This, roughly, is representation
theory. Facts about the representations of a given group tend to store a lot of
information very economically. Transfer of this information, say between two
different ways of keeping track of the representations of a single group or
algebra, is something Professor Enright is involved in studying. Although Lie
objects in the classical sense are finite-dimensional, there has lately been a
great deal of interest in their infinite-dimensional analogues, whose
investigation is also part of this project.
