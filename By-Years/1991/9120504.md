In this project in experimental physical chemistry funded by the Chemistry
Division, Professors Moore and Tossell (University of Maryland) will study
electron capture reactions and other ionic processes in plasmas, using several
spectroscopic techniques. These include electron transmission spectroscopy and
photoionization mass spectrometry. Materials to be studied include several
fluorocarbons and silanes which are of immediate interest in the plasma chemical
deposition processes used in commercial manufacture of semiconductor devices.
%%% Ultraminiature semiconductor devices used in all modern computers are made
by depositing appropriate materials from dense, electrically charged gases
called plasmas. The new field of plasma chemistry thus has immense technological
importance. Professors Moore and Tossell will use a combination of quantum
mechanical theory and modern spectroscopic methods to elucidate the nature of
prototypical chemical reactions in plasmas.
