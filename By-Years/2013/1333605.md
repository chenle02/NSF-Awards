1333605&lt;br/&gt;Sirignano&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A huge methane storehouse
exists in methane hydrate sediments at the continental shelve edges in a
permafrost state at depths of about a thousand meters at supercritical pressures
for methane and air but subcritical for water. Oxygen or air can be delivered to
depths for hydrate combustion for power and heat to melt and pump or to mine the
hydrate. Methane hydrate burning with oxygen or air at the deep-ocean conditions
(high pressures with water and fuel) will be simulated. Methane-water-air
mixture oxidation at high pressures will be analyzed in a canonical
configuration matching a planned experiment in a parallel, separately funded
program: analysis of combustion and vaporization hydrate particle vaporization
and combustion in oxygen, enriched air, or air. Substantial uncertainties about
chemical and thermophysical properties will be analyzed through a stochastic
framework, using the Polynomial Chaos Expansion approach. Collaborations will
occur with the experimental team of the new UCI Deep Ocean Power Science
Laboratory. Two pioneering aspects of this research within the energy and
combustion science community are the study of combustion of hydrocarbons mixed
with water (hydrates or clathrates) at deep ocean conditions and use of a
stochastic framework to quantify the uncertainties. Graduate student
researchers, including under-represented groups, will be attracted by the
program novelty and educated through the substance. This research can contribute
to future editions of Professor Sirignano's successful book. Participants will
make presentations and work with the Summer Science program of the NSF-funded
minority CAMP program and UCI COSMOS high-school-outreach program.
