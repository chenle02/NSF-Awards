This grant provides support for researchers, educators, and graduate students
from the United States and Africa to participate in an U.S.-Africa Educational
and Research Workshop on Bayesian Analysis to be held at the University of Cape
Town, South Africa, from December 16-17, 1996. Bayesian analysis is a unified
collection of principles, mathematical procedures, and computational techniques
which is used to solve scientific and policy problems in the natural,
biological, and social sciences. The United States participants will give
presentations on Bayesian principles, applications, and computer programs. The
workshop will immediately precede the 4th World Meeting of the International
Society for Bayesian Analysis to be held in Cape Town.
