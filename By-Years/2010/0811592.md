CCF-0811592&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CPA-SEL: Practical Typestate Verification with
Assume-Guarantee Reasoning&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jonathan
Aldrich&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the main difficulties in modern software
development is using software libraries and frameworks correctly. This project
is developing new tools to verify temporal usage properties of libraries and
frameworks, capturing the permitted ordering of calls to an object and the state
of that object when the calls are made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key verification
challenges addressed by this project include inheritance and subtyping,
recursive callbacks from a library into the client and back, and multiple
aliased pointers to a library object. The project is applying assume-guarantee
reasoning to these challenges: allowing multiple clients to access an object
cooperatively, with an agreement about how that object should be used so that
each client can safely make assumptions about other clients? behavior, and in
turn each client guarantees that it will not violate other clients?
assumptions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is developing the underlying
theory behind the approach, but is also building practical tools and evaluating
them on real-world applications and libraries through scientific case studies.
If successful, the project will increase the productivity of software engineers
when using libraries, reduce the number of defects in software, and help
students to learn about the theory and practice of lightweight software
verification tools.&lt;br/&gt;
