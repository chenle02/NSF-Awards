The mechanical engineering department at MIT is planning to develop strategies
for integrating service learning into their core technical curriculum.
Engineering service learning at other institutions is typically focused on
elective and capstone classes; This planning grant from NSF would enable the
mechanical engineering department at MIT to develop strategies for integrating
service learning into the core technical curriculum as well. The specific
objectives of this proposal are 1) to develop curriculum for mechanical
engineering service learning classes at the sophomore, junior, and senior
levels, 2) to develop widely applicable models of service learning in
engineering, 3) to promote faculty awareness and understanding of service
learning pedagogy, and 4) to create assessment and research strategies that will
enable MIT to contribute to the research on undergraduate engineering education
and service learning.

The project will demonstrate whether SL can be applied more broadly in the
engineering curriculum and the results will be of considerable interest to
others considering an SL program. The results will have even more impact because
the project work and assessment plans are comprehensive and high quality. The
project will also have 2-way impact in the communities served by the projects.
The communities will benefit by the products and services being developed by
bright engineering undergraduates for their needs and the students will benefit
by direct contact with and understanding of the communities they are serving.
