This EAGER proposal engages practitioner perspectives in improving
research/evaluation capacity. This project conducts exploratory research to
build on a previously developed conceptual framework and a cyberinfrastructure
tool (Netway) and designs and tests a protocol for research/practice
integration. Twenty STEM education projects will be examined and new measures
for engaging researchers and pracitioners will be developed.
