This award supports cooperative research in seismology to be conducted by Jer-
Ming Chiu and others at Memphis State University collaborating with Beatriz
Coira and Jose Viramonte of the Universities of Jujuy and Salta, respectively,
in Argentina. Seismologists and geologists from the U.S. and Argentina will
conduct a detailed seismotectonic study of the central Andes. They will use high
resolution seismic data obtained from the new seismic array experiment in San
Juan and the ongoing experiment in the Jujuy region to: (1) incoporate knowledge
of surface faults into the design of the network in Jujuy, (2) compare analysis
of the San Juan and Jujuy data and (3) integrate new seismic data with geologic
information to make tectonic interpretations. This cooperation between U.S.
seismologists and Argentine geologists will provide new information about
seismic activity and crustal and lithospheric structure. The addition of
geological, geochemical, geomorphological and volcanological information from
the co-investigators at Jujuy and Salta will permit a detailed correlation of
shallow crustal seismicity with known surface faults making tectonic
interpretation possible. This type of cooperative study is essential to obtain
new insights into regions of active crustal compression.
