9316032 Jordan This research is to calculate properties of mantle flow that can
be tested by means of global seismic data. 2-D and 3-D numerical experiments
will be done to catalog the types of flow models consistent with the observed
radial correlation function, as well as other diagnostics. Important parameters
include the viscosity profile and the amount of internal heating. Seismic
modeling will be directed at two topics. 1) Data sets for determining 3-D mantle
structure will be improved by the development of multi-mode estimation
techniques for extracting the parameters that describe free-oscillation
multiplets split by aspherical heterogeneity. 2) The seismological inverse
problem will be reformulated in terms of a two-point correlation function, a
stochastic approach where the angular integrations are replaced by averages over
products between pairs of data points. ***
