FLUID DYNAMICS OF THE AORTA DURING LEFT VENTRICULAR ASSISTANCE

The goal of the proposed research is to improve the design of Left Ventricular
Assist Devices (LVADs) and their integration into the human body by providing
detailed information on the 3-D blood flow through the native heart and aorta
when using these devices. The intellectual merits of this research program are
to gain a fundamental understanding of the interaction of flow through the heart
and nonpulsatile LVADs, establish the effect of surgical configuration and
aortic anastomosis angle on flow abnormalities. The proposed approach represents
a new paradigm regarding the study of LVADs, through application of a systematic
analysis based on fluid mechanics to investigate the interaction of these
devices with the human body. The findings of these studies will lead to further
questions about the optimal strategies to improve continuous flow LVADs as
permanent devices. The broader impacts of this research program are to improve
the performance and efficacy of LVADs for patients, identify optimal surgical
methods for LVAD implantation, suggest strategies for LVAD control during
recovery that optimize outcome, add to the information health care providers
need in caring for LVAD patients and decrease the cost of treating congestive
heart failure patients. The results of this research will be most useful to
surgeons, to modify implantation techniques; to engineers, for improvements in
LVAD design and control strategies; and to physicians treating patients
suffering from congestive heart failure.
