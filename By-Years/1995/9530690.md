Elliot 9530690 This award provides funding for an investigation that will
incorporate a drive torwards a 1904 conjecture of Dickson, and the celebrated
prime-pair problem. This drive will be developed using harmonic analysis on the
multiplicative group of the rationals. To this end, unimodular multiplicative
functions are to be viewed as characters on the group, and a systematic study
made of their value distribution on arithmetic progressions with large
differences. Besides their intrinsic interest and applicability in number
theory, the methods to be employed offer a theoretical approach to various
algorithms used in the fast factorization of large numbers; hence, these methods
bear on public encryption. Methods already developed for the study of arithmetic
functions, exposed in part in an AMS Memoir, more fully in a book to be
published by Cambridge University Press, are to be employed to radically
restructure the teaching of Analytic Number Theory in the proposer's university,
and, in particular, applied to the training of several graduate students working
towards a Ph. D. An auxiliary study is to be made of the value distribution of
the least primitive root of a prime modulus. The function is connnected to an
old conjecture of Vinogradov, and of vital interest in the theory of computing.
This research falls into the general mathematical field of Number Theory. Number
theory has its historical roots in the study of the whole numbers, addressing
such questions as those dealing with the divisibility of one whole number by
another. It is among the oldest branches of mathematics and was pursued for many
centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within the last half century it
has become an indispensable tool in diverse applications in areas such as data
transmission and processing, and communication systems.
