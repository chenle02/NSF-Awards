Dr. Katherine Hunt is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to study the theory of transient, collision-
induced changes in molecular dipoles and polarizabilities. These studies will
help spectroscopists to probe intermolecular dynamics of fluids on subpicosecond
time scales which in turn will help them to elucidate solute-solvent
interactions critically important to chemical reactions. Dr. Hunt's theoretical
work will help to determine transient, collision-induced changes in molecular
dipoles and polarizabilities needed to extract dynamical information from
observed line shapes. For interacting molecules with slight charge overlap, she
plans to perform calculations using a newly developed polarizability density
theory which accounts for the intramolecular distribution of polarizability and
for overlap damping, as well as dispersion, higher-multipole induction, and
nonuniformity in the local electric field. She will develop efficient methods
for computing nonlocal response tensors, including nonlinear susceptibilities.
She will find physically-based approximations to these tensors, and carry out
calculations of collision-induced properties that are important
spectroscopically. She plans to treat nonadditive exchange-polarization via a
modified density-functional approach or exchange-perturbation theory. Ab initio
calculations will also be carried out for molecules with appreciable overlap.
