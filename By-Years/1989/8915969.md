Carley The topic of this research is the design and use of a smart sensor system
for light-stripe range finding. A plane of light is swept over a three-
dimensional object that is imaged on a two- dimensional array of pixels. (The
array of pixels and the plane of light are parallel planes.) At the time that a
point on the object is illuminated, the corresponding pixel will receive its
maximum light intensity. By recording the times at which pixels receive their
maximum light intensities, the three-dimensional structure of the object can be
determined. The sensor uses photodiodes integrated on a chip with analog
circuitry at each pixel that can determine the time of maximum illumination.
This circuitry is augmented with inter-pixel signal processing circuitry to
increase the accuracy of the sensor, and with A/D converters and multiplexors to
allow communication with a computer. A 28 x 32 sensor array has been fabricated
and demonstrated.
