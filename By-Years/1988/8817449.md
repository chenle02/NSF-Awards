Project will examine the earthquake source parameters of major earthquakes from
the central and eastern continental US. Source parameters, rupture modes, and
fault geometries will be examined using body wave inversion. Project benefits
include: determination of maximumsize earthquakes in this environment, source
statistics, geologic control of the earthquakes, state of stress in the earth,
long term earthquake hazard reduction.
