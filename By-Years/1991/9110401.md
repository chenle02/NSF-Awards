A fundamental question in neurobiology is how the brain forms and maintains
memories. One possibility is that neurochemical changes are involved. To test
this idea, Dr. Dluzen has designed a clever series of studies that uses in vivo
push-pull cannula system combined with state-of-the-art methods of detecting and
identifying relevant neurochemicals. He will measure specific neurotransmitters
or their metabolites within discretely localized brain regions in freely
behaving animals. The animals will perform a series of novel behavioral tasks
that allow evaluation of the behavioral responses within the context of
memory/recognition processes. Moreover, Dr. Dluzen will examine how hormones and
previous social experiences modulate the behaviors and neurotransmitters. Thus,
his work will lead to a better understanding of how neurochemical responses
within specific brain regions are involved in the formation and maintenance of
memories and recognition processes and how hormones and experience alter these
memories.
