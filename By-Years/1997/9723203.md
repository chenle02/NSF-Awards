Hsu 9723203 Technical Section The flexibility and adaptivity of the vertebrate
immune system to the environment is based on the extraordinarily wide diversity
of the cell surface receptors that mediate immune function. In vertebrates,
large multigene families and a unique mechanism of recombination brings together
different gene segments that are expressed in lymphocytes. In the living
representatives of the earliest vertebrates, the jawless fishes and in the jawed
cartilaginous fishes, it is not clear if expression is dependent on gene
rearrangement in the latter or if a multigene family exists in the former. The
specific aims of this work are: to isolate VH-like sequences from jawless fish
by the new PCR approach developed in this laboratory in order to identify a
multigene family encoding lymphocyte cell receptors in representatives of the
most primitive vertebrates, to compare the expression of the shark joined and
unjoined IG genes in order to determine the role of the recombination process in
Ig expression in jawed vertebrates, and to investigate the regulation of IG
expression in sharks with respect to allelic/isotype exclusion, in order to
determine if the lymphocytes are polyspecific. Non-technical section The
proposed experiments will expand our insight into the existence and role of
multigene families and the rearrangement process in the representatives of the
earliest vertebrates and allow a better understanding of how the modern,
adaptive immune system evolved specific, clonal recognition of pathogenic non-
self. ***
