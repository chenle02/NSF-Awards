This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase I project proposes to
explore the feasibility of creating a new method for analyzing and evaluating
free-form student responses within computer-based assessment and tutorial
systems for mathematics. This research will apply new XML technologies in an
attempt to evaluate a student's mathematics understanding at a much deeper level
than is possible with existing computer-based assessment systems, which will
lead to improved assessment reporting and adaptation of mathematics curricula.
The proposed method for implementing mathematics assessment not only represents
an innovative application of XML technologies to a significant problem in
education, namely mathematics assessment; it also proposes a new specification
that can be used to supplement emerging standards in computer-based learning and
interoperability.

Traditional standardized assessment methodologies have been criticized for the
low level of skills they evaluate. Improved assessment methods are necessary in
order to adapt mathematics instruction to the needs of individual students. The
proposed research will also demonstrate that XML technologies can address a
range of applications much broader than e-commerce and web publishing.
