This research seeks advancement of the basic knowledge of the physics of dusty
plasmas (one of the fast growing areas of plasma physics), and its application
to diverse environments such as the Earth's ionosphere, and laboratory and
industrial plasmas. Areas of study include: &lt;br/&gt;(1) waves and
instabilities in weakly coupled dusty plasmas, including effects such as
magnetic fields, plasma inhomogeneities and boundaries, with detailed
applications to dusty plasmas in the Earth's ionosphere and in the laboratory;
&lt;br/&gt;(2) waves and structures in strongly coupled dusty plasmas, including
waves in bilayers, and lattice structures of paramagnetic dust.&lt;br/&gt;(3)
innovative applications involving interaction with electromagnetic waves.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal covers a broad range in that it investigates
the basic physics of various dusty plasma environments, including space and
laboratory dusty plasmas in magnetic fields, strongly coupled dusty plasmas,
dust in microplasmas, and possible technological applications of dusty plasmas.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research includes training of students and broad
dissemination of results through talks and publications. In addition, the
research may have impacts on plasma technologies (e.g., plasma processing,
nuclear fusion) in which dusty plasma concepts can play a role. Furthermore,
some of the research may have overlap with topical research areas in photonics
technology (e.g. photonic crystals).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal was
submitted to the NSF-DoE Partnership in Plasma Science and Engineering joint
solicitation 08-589. This award is being funded by the Plasma Physics Program in
the Division of Physics.
