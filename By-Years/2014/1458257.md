Texas Lutheran University (TLU) has received an NSF Scholarships for Science,
Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) award for their project
entitled "Learning Applied Science and Effective Research (LASER)." LASER will
increase the number of academically talented and financially needy students and
graduates in biology, biochemistry, chemistry, and physics. The project team
will recruit and enroll 16 students to form two LASER cohorts: eight students in
year one and eight students in year two. Students will be retained through
graduation, achieving a baccalaureate degree, and employed in a STEM career
within six months of graduation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A well-planned retention
program will build on TLU academic support services that include supplemental
instruction, peer tutoring, and strong career development programs. New STEM
support services being designed specifically for LASER include a LASER
living/learning community, cohorted courses, LASER peer and faculty mentors,
professional networking, cohorted co-curricular STEM career modules, and science
internship/research opportunities. The project external evaluator will use both
formative and summative evaluations to assess student progress to degree,
participation in project activities, graduation rates, and career placement.
Particular emphasis will be placed on the surveys to assess and improve the co-
curricular career modules and professional conferences/networking. These data
will provide information about effective support of students through to
graduation.
