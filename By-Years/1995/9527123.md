9527123 Joseph This project will develop highly efficient methods for computing
the three-dimensional motion of large number of particles in solid-liquid flows,
under the action of the hydrodynamic forces and torques exerted by the
suspending fluid, and use these methods to elucidate the fundamental dynamics of
particulate flows and solve problems of engineering interest. The goal is to
develop high-performance, state-of -the-art software packages called particle
movers, capable of simulating the motion of thousands of particles in 2-D and
hundreds in 3-D domains, in both Newtonian fluids, governed by the Navier-
Strokes equations, and in several popular models of viscoelastic fluids. Such
simulations will be extremely computationally intensive. It is therefor
imperative to develop the most efficient possible computational schemes, and to
implement them on parallel machines, using state-of-the-art parallel algorithms.
The project will develop two different computational schemes for simulating
solid-liquid flows on parallel computers. The first is a generalization of the
standard Galerkin finite element method in which both the fluid and particle
equations of motion are incorporated into a single variational equation,
containing both fluid and particle velocities as primitive unknowns. In the
second approach, an embedding method, the fluid flow is computed as if the space
occupied by the particles were filled with fluid. The no-slip boundary condition
of the particle boundaries is enforced as a constraint using Lagrange
multipliers. This allows a fixed grid to be used, eliminating the need for
remeshing, a definite advantage in parallel implementations. The new schemes
will be used to study the microstructural (pair interaction) effects which
produce clusters and anisotropic structures in particulate flows, to produce
statistical analyses of particulate flows (mean values, fluctuation levels and
spectral properties), to derive engineering correlations of the kind usually
obtained from expe riments, and to provide clues and closure data for the
development of two-phase flow models and a standard against which to judge the
performance of such models. They will also be used to solve practical problems
of industrial interest such as sedimentation, fluidization an slurry transport
of solid particles in Newtonian and viscoelastic fluids.
