9401673 Ciesielski The primary objective of this U.S.-Polish workshop proposed
by Krzysztof Ciesielski of West Virginia University is to enable US and Polish
mathematicians to present the results of their most recent research in the area
of real analysis. The past decade has witnessed a reemergence of real analysis
as one of the fundamental subdisciplines of mathematics. Long taught as a core
course at the undergraduate and graduate levels, classical real analysis is
regaining its more traditional role at the intellectual root of both modern
applied and pure mathematics. Another aim of the workshop is to provide the
participants with an opportunity to interact and gain a deeper understanding of
the ideas presented at the workshop and identify new areas for further research
in the field of real analysis. This project in mathematics fulfills the program
objectives of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the
U.S. and Poland to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of
strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and
mutuality of benefit. ***
