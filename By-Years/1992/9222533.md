The investigators study the spatial and temporal dynamics of territory
formation for wolves (Canis lupus) and the resulting impact on the distribution
of white-tailed deer(Odocoileus virginians). Their model is based on field
studies from northwestern Minnesota that indicate that adjacent wolf packs form
distinct territories that are separated by "buffer zones" where packs rarely
trespass. These buffer zones can provide a spatial refuge for the primary prey
species: white-tailored deer. The field studies show that deer density is higher
in the inter- territorial areas (refuges) and is lower near the center of
established territories (where deer populations may be subject to intense
predation). The buffer zones may also stabilize wolf- deer interactions by
providing a reservoir of deer that can recolonize areas of wolf territory that
have suffered heavy predation losses. The mathematical model the investigators
develop describes the behavioral wolf-wolf and wolf-deer interactions using a
system of coupled of nonlinear partial differential equations, and describes the
long-term ecological wolf-deer interactions using a system of coupled nonlinear
difference equations. The analysis of the model equations will employ
mathematical and numerical techniques from areas such as perturbation theory and
finite difference numerical methods. This should lead to a detailed quantitative
understanding of wolf territorial pattern formation, and an illustration of how
territoriality influences the distribution and abundance of deer. The research
will have a wider application to the general area of territorial pattern
formation; such patterns provide the basis for social organization in many
mammals and birds.
