The Global Lambda Integrated Facility (GLIF) 12th Annual Global LambdaGrid
Workshop is being held in Chicago, October 11-12, 2012, collocated with the 8th
IEEE International e-Science Conference, the Open Grid Forum, and the Microsoft
e-Science Workshop. The GLIF organization's annual workshop provides an
international forum for Research &amp; Education network managers and engineers,
computer scientists and discipline scientists who are involved in the design,
development and use of advanced optical networks to meet, discuss, develop and
demonstrate innovative solutions to complex societal problems. These optical
networks are the underpinnings of an evolving global high-performance computing
and communications ecosystem, and provide the "big pipes" that enable scientists
to access complex collections of digital "big data" in timely fashion so that
they can extract knowledge and insight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Global networking
is a vital component of global cyberinfrastructure, and it is the GLIF community
that focuses on how to optimally design and develop on-demand LambdaGrids of
interconnected distributed computing, sensor and instrument resources to best
enable data-intensive science, thus representing intellectual
merit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GLIF 2012 presents an opportunity to better
architect how high-performance networks, or "big pipes", can best enable access
to "big data" in order to provide scientists with timely information for
analysis and ultimately knowledge. Nascent work in these areas is already
impacting scientific disciplines, from bioinformatics to metagenomics to
geosciences, and it is the general public that will ultimately benefit.
