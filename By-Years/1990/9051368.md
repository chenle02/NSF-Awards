The acquisition of a preparative ultracentrifuge and a liquid scintillation
counter is facilitating the upgrading of the biochemistry laboratory. Students
can now use contemporary methods for the purification and analysis of
biomolecules. These instruments allow the conversion of the course into a
multistep experimental format, designed to illustrate the sequential nature of
scientific inquiry. The instruments also enhance the flexibility of experimental
design, both in the laboratory course and in undergraduate research projects.
This will result in better student understanding of scientific research and
increased familiarity with the uses and applications of modern biochemical
methodologies. The university will contribute an amount equal to the award.
