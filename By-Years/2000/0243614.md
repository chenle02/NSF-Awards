This proposal requests funds to continue Research and Development (R&amp;D) for
the BTeV experiment. The central focus of this experiment will be on the weak
decays of the b-quark and c-quark. The very successful Standard Model (SM) of
Electroweak Interactions cannot explain the different quark or lepton masses or
the different couplings between the quarks. Many crucial tests and measurements
need to be done to better determine the parameters of the model and to search
for deviations from the SM in the data. Such variations could be evidence for
"New Physics", such as explaining the connections between CP violation in the
early universe and the oscillatory behavior of quarks and neutrinos. The BTeV
experiment will run at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory's Tevatron that
collides protons with anti-protons. These collisions produce very high rates of
b- and c-quarks. By empowering University groups to conduct instrumentation
R&amp;D, this activity will promote directly the education of graduate and
undergraduate students.
