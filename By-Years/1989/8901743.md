The distributions of the linear polarization of radio wavelength emission from
compact radio sources will be studied at milliarcsecond resolution using the
technique of the Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). These radio sources
are associated with the nuclei of quasars and active galaxies, where enormous
amounts of energy are emitted on very short timescales, probably due to the
infall of material onto a supermassive black hole. The energy manifests itself
as radiation on all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. At radio wavelengths
we see compact radio-emitting `cores' and `jet-like' features, that vary rapidly
in both total intensity and polarization. In many sources, bright knots of
emission appear to be moving down the jets at several times the speed of light.
The goals of the observations are: (1), to map the topology of the magnetic
field structures and to study their evoulution; (2), to obtain kinematic and
geometric information to constrin models of superluminal sources; (3), to help
understand the differences between differnt classes of compact radio sources;
(4), to probe the plasma surrounding the rdio sources in the innermost regions
of quasars and active galactic nuclei; and (5), to study the relationship
between the milliarcsecond radio structure and the large scale (much greater
than 1 arcsecond) jets and lobes found in extended radio sources.
