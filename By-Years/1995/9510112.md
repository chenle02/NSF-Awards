Transaction Processing (TP) systems form a core software component in database
management systems, making sharing of information and concurrent processing in
multi-user, distributed environments possible. However, the currently used
Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID) properties of
transactions have limited the use of TP systems in new applications such as
engineering design and long activities, due to their inflexibility. This project
strengthens the ACID properties to support a spectrum of choices. For example,
Epsilon Serializability gives application designers fine-grained choices in the
specification of bounded inconsistency tolerance. This work complements
theoretical results such as the ACTA framework. This project maps strengthened
atomicity, isolation, and durability properties onto existing proven software
systems, in particular, TP monitors such as Transarc Encina. Combining theory
with practice, the results from this research will make strengthened production
TP systems available to the designers and implementors of advanced applications
such as cooperative long tra nsactions and autonomous TP on the Internet
