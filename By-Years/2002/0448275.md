CAREER: Semantic Programming, Aaron Stump.

Correct software has never been more societally important, yet approaches to
developing correct software remain too costly for widespread use. This project
aims to make a fundamental alteration to the programming paradigm, to enable the
creation of provably correct code at a reasonable cost. The project proposes to
develop new programming languages where programs can be written with tightly
integrated formal proofs of correctness. Proofs are data in the programming
language, just like booleans or strings. Type checking ensures that if a
function requires a proof of some fact (e.g., a pointer is not null) in order to
operate correctly, such a proof is indeed supplied where the function is called.
Functions may also produce proofs as part of their output. Technical problems
that must be solved arise in supporting programming with proofs in the presence
of mutable state (i.e., program variables whose values can change) and other
effects. Broader impacts of the proposed work include developing new languages
for correct programming, together with publicly available prototype
implementations; and the creation of new courses for graduate students and
advanced undergraduates incorporating the ideas of the research. The proposal
also includes a K-12 outreach component.
