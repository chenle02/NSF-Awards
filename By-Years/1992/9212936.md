Knowledge of the effects of the social structure on stratification is largely
based on information about Western capitalist societies. The different nations
and regions of the former Soviet Union provide a diversity of forms of planned
economy. This diversity in combination with the extraordinary recent political
and socioeconomic changes permits a new opportunity for deepening our
understanding of the effect of social structure on stratification. This proposal
will assemble a data set in preparation for a study of the transition from
dependency to adult roles of people born between 1966 and 1968 in the Soviet
Union. These individuals were educated in a fully-developed socialist society,
completed secondary education during the period of Perestroika (1983-1985), and
began their job careers during the transition from socialism to a new political
and economic system. Specifically, a longitudinal data set on 20,000 secondary
school graduates in 13 different regions of the former Soviet Union will be
assembled and verified in preparation for a study of the influence of social
structural variables on early life course transitions. This project will
contribute to our understanding of how societal institutions shape people's
lives, and it will thus help to counterbalance the emphasis in the U.S.
literature on how individual characteristics shape people's lives. The timing
and geographic locations of the longitudinal data collections to be completed
and assembled in single data set provide a unique opportunity for studying early
life careers.
