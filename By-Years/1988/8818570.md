This project is an integrated study of the optical and physical properties of
the antarctic snow surface. It has four components which concern the processes
by which global climatic variability is imprinted into the proxy data recorded
in the antarctic ice. The effect of surface roughness (sastrugi orientation) on
the angular distribution of reflected sunlight, and the spectral distribution of
thermal infrared radiation will be measured to provide the knowledge necessary
for the interpretation of Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) satellite
data. The mechanism of dry deposition of atmospheric aerosols in the snow
surface will be measured by observing the air flow in the permeable upper firn,
and samples of hoarfrost and will be examined for their isotopic composition.
The former will allow the evaluation of the extent to which the concentration of
aerosols in the firn and ice represent contemporaneous concentrations in the
atmosphere, while the latter will yield a comparative study of isotopic ratios
to the ambient air temperatures.
