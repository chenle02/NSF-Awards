This project, funded under the auspices of the Small Grants for Exploratory
Research (SGER) program, is an exploration of sediment cores extracted from the
Hybla Valley, a deep paleo-valley of the Potomac River. This investigation is
intended to determine if the site and the cores preserve a record of glacial-
induced sea level change in the region. This research is a collaboration among
scientists from the University of Minnesota-Duluth and the U.S. Geological
Survey who will conduct x-ray fluorescence analyses on the cores.

The research could have broad impact on the wider science community and catalyze
new thinking in issues surrounding climate by offering a new perspective on old
and knotty scientific problems surrounding sea level variability. The activities
fit well into the potentially transformative, high risk, and exploratory nature
of the SGER program.
