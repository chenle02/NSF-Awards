This work is a continued investigation of Larmor-Wave propagation through pure
metal plates at millimeter wave freqencies. The study will include alkali metals
and noble metals. A new high vacuum facility allows for the first time the
fabrication, by sputtering and evaporation, of alkali-metal samples. The Larmor-
wave studies can proceed immediately as the conduction electrons are strongly
coupled to ferromagnetic surface layers. In addition, the application of
ferromagnetic surface layers may well allow the observation and study of new
modes of excitation of the conduction electrons which have been predicted
theoretically but not observed as yet.
