ABSTRACT CTS-9632685 The proposed project is to investigate condensation in
micro grooves that are 5 to 500 mm wide. Prior studies have shown that when
micro grooves with such small dimensions are involved, the condensation rate
could not be completely explained by models which only take into account
gravitational and capillary forces. The proposed work is to incorporate
interfacial forces in a model and conduct heat transfer experiments to determine
the individual roles of gravitational, surface tension, and interfacial forces,
and verify the model. By using micro grooves of different widths and apex
angles, the dominance of the different forces could be revealed. The working
fluids to be used are ultra-pure water and methanol.
