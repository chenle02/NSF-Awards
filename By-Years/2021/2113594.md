The goal of this project is to understand how to create ordered coatings of
different shaped particles with advanced material properties. The project aims
to understand how different shaped particles, with different aspect ratios and
curvature, interact with each other and dynamically assemble into
microstructures with useful properties. The overall approach is to use optical
microscopy experiments and computer simulations together to measure and model
particle interactions, dynamics, and assembly processes. Electric fields applied
through microelectrodes will be used to control how particles are concentrated,
interact through tunable and directional attraction, and assemble into ordered
configurations while avoiding disordered states. This project will provide new
fundamental insights into the mechanisms governing the interactions among
colloidal particles of different shape and the formation of microstructures.
This understanding will provide a basis to engineer processes for assembling
surface coatings with novel electromagnetic properties. Other benefits of the
project include training a future advanced workforce and broadening
participation of underrepresented groups in local schools.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;To achieve these goals, the project will systematically escalate
complexity in microscopy measurements and analytical models of anisotropic
colloidal interactions, microstructure, and dynamics. In the first step, the aim
is to understand how to manipulate single and ensemble anisotropic particle
position, orientation, and structure. This aim will be addressed by measuring
and modeling electric field mediated interactions between anisotropic particles
for systematic variations in particle shape. In the next step, the aim is to
understand equilibrium phase behavior and non-equilibrium microstructure
formation important to anisotropic particle based material properties. This aim
will be attained by measuring and modeling how different thermodynamic
conditions and field-mediated interactions control microstructures. In the third
step, the aim is to understand how dynamic pathways towards ordered states in
anisotropic particle systems determine processing of target microstructures.
This aim will be achieved by measuring and modeling how interactions and
particle shape determine collective dynamics and defect relaxation as functions
as concentration and configuration. Finally, attempts will be made to scale-up
processes using electrode arrays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
