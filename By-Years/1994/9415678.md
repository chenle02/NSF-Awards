This laboratory project will measure the differential cross sections of ozone
(O3) for the energy loss of 0.2 eV to 1.5 eV region by electron impact in order
to identify any states which exist in this energy region. The differential cross
sections for the energy loss in this important low energy region will be
measured by utilizing a supersonic beam to reduce the rotational and vibrational
temperatures and minimize spectral congestion. A crossed-beam method will be
used to obtain data for laboratory angles from 6 to 160 . The energy loss
spectra and the residual mode spectra will be decomposed by a simulated
annealing computer technique in order to obtain the vertical energies and slopes
of potential surfaces in the O3 Franck-Condon region for each excited electronic
state which contributes to the bands.
