Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are powerful computer-based tools for
storing, managing, and manipulating information about spatially-distributed
phenomena. GIS has proved extremely valuable to municipalities, government and
non-profit agencies and private business, assisting them in information
management, planning and decision making, emergency response, and monitoring of
environmental change. Effective use of GIS requires substantial training and
expertise. This has been a major obstacle to full realization of GIS' benefits
in government and industry. This project will develop a software-based GIS
Expert Assistant as an aid to enhance the training process, assist the
occasional user, and improve reliability and consistency of GIS analysis
results. The GIS Expert Assistant will be built using the knowledge engineering
techniques developed by the artificial intelligence community, and will
incorporate knowledge and techniques recognized by experts in the GIS field. The
GIS Expert Assistant will function as a readily-available consultant or aide,
providing immediate assistance while a user is interacting with the GIS. It is
not intended to replace or overrule the experienced practitioner or instructor,
but will enable more efficient use of these scarce human resources. This
research will provide the basis for implementing a commercial software package
to assist users of GIS packages in learning and using their GIS more
effectively.
