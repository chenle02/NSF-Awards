In the 21st century, scientific research will have even more significant and
immediate human impacts. Decisions about what, where, how to measure, and how to
structure the engagement between scientists and the public, including policy
professionals, will entail important and often nuanced ethical dimensions. This
study seeks a deeper understanding of structures and interventions that can
facilitate ethical maturity in young investigators. The project and its
investigators will bring together research scientists, educators, and ethicists
to work over three years, in 3 phases, to: (1) develop a framework to discuss
and understand ethics in science education; (2) create a method to measure the
ethical maturity of young investigators and (3) conduct a pilot study in formal
and non-formal science learning settings. The investigators hypothesize that
ethical behavior in science is substantially impacted by the affective,
emotional, and interpersonal aspects of scientists' connections to their
communities of practice. Therefore, educational programs that emphasize team-
and project-based learning in the context of rigorous scientific protocols will
do a better job of encouraging ethical practice than those that rely heavily,
let alone exclusively, on text-based learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
framework and its associated methods will, if successful, link science education
with emotional maturity, affective reaction, and interpersonal connections
appropriate to best ethical practices. It will do so in a network of urban
public schools and summer programming for city teens, settings that can have
very broad application. Hopefully the lessons learned will improve the ways that
scientists think about their own professional activities. There is also
potential for improved ethical depth among learners who will primarily be
science consumers. The capacity to define and measure ethical maturity in the
context of science learning would be a valuable tool for educators, especially
those working with young researchers in their formative years. If the central
hypothesis of the project (that team-oriented, research-based pedagogy is
advantageous for affective and emotional growth and leads to more ethical
choices), then this study will support these highly effective, but logistically
difficult, educational strategies. In addition, a better understanding of the
links between earth and environmental science subject matter, ethical choices,
and the ethical practice of science, will prepare those headed into STEM careers
for the types of technically-complex choices that citizen will face in the 21st
century.
