The objective of this project is to develop custom analog VLSI hardware for
several tasks that occur early in the computational vision process. The work
involves both hardware development to implement existing algorithms and
algorithm modification to match hardware capabilities. A goal of this research
is to build a single-chip motion sensor and analyzer that will be useful for
robot navigation. The sensor array can be placed at the focal plane of lenses to
acquire binocular image input directly from environment, and the outputs will
consist of the intensity field, velocity field and depth map of the scene. The
system can be used as a front-end processor for a variety of vision applications
such as robot navigation and object recognition. The researchers in this team
have impressive research achievements. The team has expertise in algorithms for
vision, analog circuit design, system design and parallel computation. It is an
excellent group with the potential to make significant discoveries along the
way. The laboratory facilities and intellectual environment at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology are an excellent basis for the proposed work. The
funding of this proposal is strongly recommended.
