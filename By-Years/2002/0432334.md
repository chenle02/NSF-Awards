This award provides partial funding for U.S. ocean scientists, particularly
those in the academic research community, to participate in the activities of
the North Pacific Marine Science Organization (PICES). This organization was
established in 1992 to promote and coordinate marine scientific research in
order to advance knowledge of living marine resources, land-ocean and
atmosphere-ocean interactions, ecosystem components and processes, resource
usage, ocean response to global weather and climate change, and human impacts in
the North Pacific. Members presently include Canada, China, Japan, Korea,
Russia, and the United States. Participation by U.S. scientists in Annual
Meetings, scientific committee working groups and workshops, will also be funded
through this award.
