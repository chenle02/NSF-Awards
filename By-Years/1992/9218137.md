&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;9218137 Shepherd &lt;br/&gt;This award supports the
dissertation research of a cultural anthropologist from the University of
Virginia. The project analyzes the production and representation of social and
cultural distinctions in the interaction of backwards ethnic groups known as Bai
in western Yunnan, China. The student will conduct participant observation and
study life histories in rural communities, as well as study rural popular
theater groups, regional festivals, and representations of the archaeological
past in local museums, to understand how the local ethnic groups relate to the
state. The theoretical issues to be studied are how local ethnic groups resist
national-state domination at the same time that they use state institutions to
protect their political and cultural rights.&lt;br/&gt; At a time when the world
seems to be erupting in ethnic violence vis-a-vis weakened national states
(e.g., USSR, Yugoslavia) we need to understand how local groups accept and
reject different forms of national hegemony. This sort of case study will
provide valuable comparative information towards this theoretical goal.
