The proposed research concerns the development of harmonic map theory in the
setting when the domain and/or the target spaces are singular spaces. The
motivation of such an extension of harmonic maps is for their application in
superrigidity, geometric group theory, minimal surface theory and character
varieties. The PI proposes to explore the interplay between analysis and group
theory via harmonic maps. From the analysis point of view, it is a central
problem to determine under what conditions harmonic maps are regular and, if
not, to determine the structure of the singular sets. From a group theory point
of view, harmonic map theory is an important tool in studying rigidity
questions. Among the specific problem that will be investigated using harmonic
maps are: rigidity properties of NPC (non-positively curved) spaces, quadratic
differentials and Teichmuller theory of complexes and the theory of singular
minimal surfaces.

The notion of energy has its origins in the mathematical description of the
physical world. Roughly speaking, the energy of a map between two spaces
measures the total stretch of the map, and harmonic maps are the critical points
of the energy functional. Thus, the understanding of harmonic maps is of great
interest to both mathematicians and physicists. Harmonic maps are important
because they are analytical objects that can be used to represent geometric,
topological and algebraic objects associated to a space. They have numerous
actual and potential applications in many fields of mathematics or well as in
other sciences.
