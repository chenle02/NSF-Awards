INT 9603052 Szyld This U.S.-Czech mathematics workshop on iterative methods and
parallel computations will be held in the Czech Republic at Milovy, during the
week of June 16, 1997. The U.S. organizer, Dr. Daniel Szyld of Temple
University, will work with Czech counterpart, Dr. Ivo Marek of Charles
University, with the intent of bringing together scientists and engineers from
academia and industry to examine questions pertaining to iterative methods,
numerical linear algebra, and related efficiencies in parallel implementation of
numerical methods. It is hoped that fruitful exchange among participants at the
workshop will lead to new U.S.-Czech cooperative research activities in
mathematics and computer science, with long-term potential for applications in
supercomputing and engineering topics such as ground water flow simulation. This
mathematics workshop fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to
combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence. ??
