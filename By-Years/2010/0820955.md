The Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program at NSF Division of Chemistry will
support the international collaborative research project of Prof. Peter Stang of
the University of Utah and Prof. Li-Jun Wan of the Chinese Academy of Sciences
in Beijing, China. Profs. Stang and Wang and their students will synthesize and
characterize surface-confined two and three dimensional self-assembled molecular
architectures using advanced scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to provide
insights into and facilitate the "bottom up" nano-fabrication of novel
molecular-based devices. Molecular-based devices, e.g. molecules that possess
the ability to act as sensors, switches, motors, machines and memory components,
when properly designed and controlled, constitute the backbone of the nascent
nanotechnology that has the potential to revolutionize manufacturing and
consumer goods in the 21st century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This international
collaborative research project is supported jointly by NSF and the National
Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC). The study is also supported by the
Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) at NSF.
