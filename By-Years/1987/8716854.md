This proposal requests support to obtain several pieces of equipment to
establish an integrated system for combined quantitative microscopic
fluorescence analysis and electrophysiological recording. Six major users have
proposed projects that will utilize the instrumentation. Five of these involve
Ca2+ measurements by fluorescence coupled to membrane transport or receptor
studies (exocytosis in Mast cells, receptor studies in mammalian neurons,
intestinal electrolyte transport, nicotinic receptors and Ca2+channel function,
Ca2+ movements and hormone production in luteal cells). The sixth project will
use Ca2+-mediated fluorescence to study muscle myotubes in culture.
