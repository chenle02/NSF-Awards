This research focuses on the branch of catalyst research dealing with the
interaction effects of catalytic metals with support structures, a field which
contributes to the understanding of the workings of catalyst systems and surface
reactions. Actions of carefully prepared model systems are investigated. The
variety of systems to be studied will serve to consolidate conclusions from
previous studies of others. An innovative approach is being used in the
preparation of new catalyst materials. Comprehensive, multi-pronged analytical
methods are being applied to the materials characterization work for this
research.
