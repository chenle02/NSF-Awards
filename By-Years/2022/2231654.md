This IUCRC planning project will investigate the feasibility of a multi-site
center for Aviation Big Data Analytics (ABDA) that aims to address two
fundamental issues: limited access to aviation big data; and a shortage of
robust workforce with integrated big data analytics and aviation competencies.
The proposed ABDA Center will advance research and education through discovery
and innovation at the confluence of big data analytics and aviation. Its mission
is to develop big data analytics solutions specially designed for the aviation
industry to ensure the safety, security, and prosperity of the U.S Aviation
Ecosystem.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;ABDA has two sites: Embry-Riddle Aeronautical
University (ERAU), and New Mexico State University (NMSU). ABDAâ€™s research will
focus on four thrust areas: (1) Data characterization and data requirement
identification; (2) Development of next-generation big data-enabled systems,
services, and applications; (3) Development of diverse ABDA-capable U.S.
Workforce of the Future; and (4) Development of AI/machine learning solutions
towards sustainable aviation. NMSU brings expertise in energy-aware autonomy of
emerging electrified aircraft for advanced air mobility, energy cost and
emission assessment, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning.
Complementary expertise at the other site includes aviation data science and
business analytics, flight research, unmanned aerial systems and autonomous
systems, and aviation cybersecurity.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;ABDA Center's
research is expected to have three major societal implications: (1) to foster
novel big data analytics/AI/machine learning approaches that ensure the safety,
security, and prosperity of the U.S. Aviation Ecosystem; (2) to foster a
research community committed to advancing research and education at the
confluence of big data analytics and aviation, and to transitioning its findings
into industry practice; and (3) to collaborate with a minority serving
institution site to recruit more underrepresented students and develop diverse
ABDA-capable U.S. Workforce of the Future. NMSU will advance diversity by
recruiting and educating students. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;All data, software,
and artifacts produced in this project will be archived and preserved, according
to standard institutional security and privacy practices and policies, for at
least five years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
