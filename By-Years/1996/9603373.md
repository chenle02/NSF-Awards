This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in theoretical and
computational chemistry involves the theoretical chemistry group of Ludwik
Adamowicz at the University of Arizona and the research group of Jean-Pierre
Malrieu at the Universite Paul Sabatier, in Toulouse, France. The award provides
travel support to Dr. Adamowicz, a postdoctoral researcher and a graduate
student. The objective of the research is to develop new, more accurate quantum-
mechanical ab-initio methods for calculating electronic excited states of
molecules and clusters by applying the French group's method of variational
configuration interaction. The project takes advantage of the complementary
expertise of the Arizona and Toulouse groups and will advance understanding of
methods for calculating molecular systems.
