The objective of this research is to investigate creep-fatigue damage and to
develop macro-micro based life prediction rules for engineering materials under
complex loadings. Gas and steam turbine components, piping and pressure vessels
in power plants and the national aerospace plane are subjected to complex cyclic
mechanical and thermal loadings where the developed life prediction rules could
be used to assess the residual lives of these structural components. This study
will use a state-of-science structural materials, such as Type 304 or 314
stainless steel, or the superalloys of Waspaloy, Rene 45 or Inconel 718. The
microstructures and the microdeformation processes will be related to the
macroparameters in this life assessment analysis. The PI is a minority
applicant.
