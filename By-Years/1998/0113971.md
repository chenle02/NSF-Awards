State-of-the-art run-time systems are a poor match to diverse, dynamic
distributed applications because they are designed to provide support to a wide
variety of applications, without much customization to individual specific
requirements. Little or no information flows from the application to the run-
time system to allow the latter to fully tailor its services to the application.
As a result, the performance is disappointing. To address this problem, this
project will pursue application-centric computing, or Smart Applications
(SMARTAPPS). The overriding philosophy of SMARTAPPS is "measure, compare, and
adapt if beneficial." That is, the application will continually monitor its
performance and the available resources to determine if, and by how much, the
application could improve its performance by restructuring. Then, if the
potential performance benefit outweighs the projected overhead costs, the
application will restructure itself and the underlying system accordingly. This
process occurs continuously to adapt to the dynamic needs of the application and
the availability of system resources. The adaptation can occur at various levels
including selection of an algorithmic approach suitable for the current problem,
run-time parallelization and other related compiler optimizations, tuning
reconfigurable OS services (e.g. scheduling policy), and system configuration
(e.g., selecting which computational resources to use). The SMARTAPPS framework
provides performance monitoring and modeling components, as well as mechanisms
for performing the actual restructuring, to integrate these levels of
adaptation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will test SMARTAPPS on several
important computational science applications and representative platforms
throughout the development process. From computational physics, it will study
discrete-ordinates codes that simulate subatomic particle transport. From
computational biology, it will study a molecular dynamics code and a code that
simulates protein folding and ligand binding (also known as drug docking).
SMARTAPPS will be developed and run on current distributed, heterogeneous
platforms, including the ASCI machines, large NUMA machines, networks of
workstations, and, ultimately, the Grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
