9503352 Wilkens This award will support a detailed study of the fine-scale
properties of marine sediments and their relation to sediment physical
properties. Basic objective is to understand primary chemical and grain size
characteristics that control characteristics such as porosity, density and
acoustic velocity. Project will use Ocean Drilling Program samples and data,
laboratory measurements of physical properties and modelling to relate physical
properties. ***
