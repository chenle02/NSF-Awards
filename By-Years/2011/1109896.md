This award will support a theoretical investigation of recently-discovered
supernovae with unusual characteristics. New surveys are digging up large
numbers of supernovae of all types, and some relatively rare events have now
been thoroughly studied. The goal of the project is to see if these supernovae
can be explained as resulting from thermonuclear supernovae in which the total
mass of the exploded white dwarf does not necessarily equal the maximum allowed
(Chandraskehar) mass. The PI will explore double degenerate mergers, helium
shell explosions, and accretion induced collapse events, and will compare
observations of light curves, spectra, and polarization to the output of models
that include sophisticated radiation transport codes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project will allow direct comparisons between theory and observation, which will
help observers explain new discoveries, and help modelers to stay rooted in
actual data. This group will also organize a summer school on high-performance
computing, which will draw 50 students. The goal of the school is to give
students hands-on experience with production scientific codes, which will help
produce the next generation of computational astrophysicists.
