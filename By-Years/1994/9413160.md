9413160 Talley In this project, the PI will conduct basic hydrographic
operations on the central Indian Ocean meridional section along 80 deg E, and
the eastern part of the zonal section along 33 deg S (designated lines I8N and
I5E respectively under the World Ocean Circulation Experiment - WOCE). Data will
be used to look at inflow of deep water into the Central Indian Basin, the fate
of the deep water (in conjunction with the other WHP sections), the meridional
structure of equatorial currents, particularly the deep ater, and the vertical
structure of the subtropical gyre. I5E will be used to measure the Leeuwin
current and will provide a check on time variability, when compared with the
first occupation of this section in 1987.
