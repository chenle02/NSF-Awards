The Time-Split B-tree is a system of data retrieval which takes advantage of
the best aspects of two storage mediums: cheap, sturdy, non-erasable, but slow-
access optical disk storage and more expensive but faster-access magnetic disk
storage. This is accomplished by placing recent versions of data on magnetic
disk where it can be updated quickly and incrementally moving older data to the
slower optical disk as it matures. In addition, keeping all versions of data
takes the place of a log and makes recovery simple. The principal investigator
plans to analyze, refine and extend the Time-Split B-tree by: parameterizing
space utilization on both mediums to improve performance for an expected use
pattern; providing support for several kinds of temporal semantics; comparing
with other proposed methods for using both mediums; providing support for large
hierarchical versioned objects; allowing intermediate versions of records to be
discarded; and, consolidating current (magnetic disk) data when old versions are
migrated to optical disk. The research will contribute to the understanding of
the interaction between access methods, transaction processing, temporal
semantics, versioning and the interplay of storage mediums with different
characteristics.
