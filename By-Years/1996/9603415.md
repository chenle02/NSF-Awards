This three-year award for U.S.-U.K. cooperative research involves Alexander
Ruzmaikin, Michael Freedman and Joan Feynman from California State
University/Northridge and Mitchell Berger and Renzo Ricca from University
College London, London, United Kingdom. The award provides travel and living
expenses for Dr. Ruzmaikin's visits to the United Kingdom. The objective of the
research is to investigate the application of the mathematics of topology to
solar and heliospheric physics problems. In particular, these applications will
address fundamental questions that involve the complex magnetic field of the
Sun. They will study the equilibrium and dynamics of magnetic flux tubes in the
solar interior and atmosphere and conditions related to the initiation of
flares, coronal mass ejections and turbulent flows in the Sun and solar wind.
The project is interdisciplinary and brings together U.S. experts in solar
physics and U.K. mathematicians.
