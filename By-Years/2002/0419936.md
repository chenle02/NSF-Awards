This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
optimize plant transgenic phage protein-based antibacterial technology.
Specifically, this project will refine the methodologies needed to create
transgenic tomatoes that express holins, lytic proteins produced by
bacteriophages, in the amount needed to kill plant-pathogenic gram negative
bacteria. The follow-on work will focus on controlling the most serious
bacterial diseases of geranium, citrus, grape and rice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
commercial application of this project will be in the area of transgenic crops
to control a number of very important plant diseases for which limited options
currently exist. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
