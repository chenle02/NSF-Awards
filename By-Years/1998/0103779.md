Professor Mary Berry of the University of South Dakota is supported by the
Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study the excited state decay
dynamics of vapor phase lanthanide complexes. These experiments represent the
first application of spectroscopic molecular beam methods to the case of
lanthanide complexes, complementing studies by others on alkali, alkaline earth
and transition metals. Resonance Enhanced Multiphoton Ionization (REMPI)
spectroscopy will be employed to investigate europium (III) complexed with
organic ligands. The initial focus will be on the feasibility of REMPI detection
in these molecular systems. These gas phase studies will allow the spectroscopy
and dynamics to be determined without the convoluting factors of crystal strain
and solvent and ion interactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lanthanide compounds are
important in energy applications and are used as materials for lasers, for
example. A more thorough understanding of the spectroscopy of these compounds
will prove useful in developing new optical materials. The PI has an excellent
mentoring record including Native American students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
