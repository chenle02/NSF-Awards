9320555 Koenker Quantile regression is gradually developing into a comprehensive
approach to the statistical analysis of linear and non-linear response models.
By supplementing the exclusive focus of least- squares-based methods on the
estimation of conditional mean functions, with a general technique for
estimating conditional quantile functions, it has greatly expanded the
flexibility of both parametric and non-parametric statistical methods. Research
is proposed on methods of inference for quantile regression, nonparametric
quantile regression and smoothing, and economic applications. The new
applications of quantile regression include non-parametric demand analysis and
related welfare economics, several applications to time-series analysis,
extensions to errors-in-variables and more general multivariate settings, and
applications to survival analysis and duration models. There is already a well-
developed theory of asymptotic inference for quantile regression. However, when
inference on discrete quantiles is desired, as is increasingly common in
econometric applications, one is faced with a rather bewildering array of
methods based on direct estimation of the asymptotic covariance matrix, an
approach which involves estimation of the reciprocal of the error density at the
quantile of interest, or some form of the bootstrap. Versions of both approaches
are available in existing econometric packages. Recently, however, three
alternative approaches to inference have emerged. All of the new approaches
share the advantage that they circumvent the necessity to directly estimate
error density. This project will compare systematically the available methods
for constructing confidence intervals and for linear hypothesis testing.
