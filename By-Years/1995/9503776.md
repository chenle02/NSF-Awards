The small flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana, a member of the mustard family,
has become the model system for plant biology. Its unique features allow it to
be applied to a wide variety of research problems, including plant physiology,
the molecular genetic study of organ development, and plant-pathogen
interactions. The importance of Arabidopsis to plant biology is increasing with
the international development of germplasm and DNA stock resource centers,
genetic and physical maps and their techniques, plus expressed sequence tag and
genomic sequencing projects. Furthermore, because flowering plants evolved
recently, characterizing a gene in Arabidopsis often simplifies the isolation of
a corresponding gene in another flowering plant. The primary mission of this
project is to provide a specialized electronic database that can be used by the
scientific community to collect, cross-reference, organize, distribute and
maintain the scientific data and their results. The immediate goals are to
create an initial prototype database with input from the user community, and to
maintain the existing public Arabidopsis database, AAtDB, in the interim. It is
expected that the prototype developed under this award will become a basis for
the next generation Arabidopsis database that will meet the needs of the
researchers for the foreseeable future.
