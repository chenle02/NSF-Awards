This award is for a planning grant funded under the Minority Research Initiation
Program. The purpose of a planning grant is to provide financial support for an
investigator to prepare a competitive research proposal. This planning grant
will enable the investigator to prepare a research proposal which focuses on
analyzing the consumer behavior of low income people. Like all consumers, the
behavior of low income people is motivated by economic, sociological, and
psychological factors. However, often those responsible for helping poor people
improve their consumer skills through education intervention feel that low
income people are irresponsible and irrational when it comes to making choices.
This proposed research will examine the consumer behavior of poor people and
seek to determine whether or not economic theory provides a structure for
understanding and evaluating the consumer behavior of this income class.
