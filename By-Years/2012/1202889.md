Evolutionary causes and consequences of personality variation in social groups:
Do fish schools benefit from individual social personality variation?

Two of biology's most exciting and influential lines of research have emerged
from animal behavior in the past decade. First, the study of complex collective
behaviors, like shoaling, has shown how these behaviors may emerge from the
individual behaviors of independent agents, and the functions they may play. The
second emerging line of research, behavioral syndromes or animal personalities,
focuses on the causes and consequences of consistent individual behavioral
differences. The project will clarify 1) whether individuals vary in their
ability to detect and respond to food and predators vs. exploit the information
produced by others, 2) whether this tradeoff in use of public vs. private
information is related to shoaling behavior, leading to consistent differences
in the use of high risk/reward positions within the group (social role
specialization), and 3) whether the particular social composition of detectors
(private information) vs. responders (public information) affects either the
group's ability to respond effectively to food and predators or the relative
fitness of different types of individuals.

The Fellow has an extensive mathematical biology background, which will be
enhanced by the chosen mentors (Dr. Couzin and Dr. Leonard). The Fellow will be
trained to deploy such techniques as real-time video tracking, parallelized
simulation of individual based models, analysis with Markov Chain Monte Carlo
models, development of robotic fish, and implementation of adaptive dynamics
models. Insights gained from the project will be presented at Dr. Couzin's
OpenSwarm website, which is being developed to teach the public about collective
behavior.
