This MRI will be used in two ways to prepare a full proposal. First, the choice
of a mass spectrometer, a necessary piece of equipment, will be investigated.
Second, a strong working knowledge of appropriate numerical climate models will
be gained by close interaction with personnel at GFDL, Princeton University.
