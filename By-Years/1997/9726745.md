This award supports Drs. Patrice Simard, Vladimir Vapnik, Yann LeCun, and Leon
Bottou to collaborate with Klaus-Robert MÂ¼ller of GMD FIRST (Research Center for
Information Technology) in Berlin. The collaboration will extend current
knowledge about support vector machines (SVMs) which can represent functions in
spaces with trillions of dimensions and are used for such applications as time-
series prediction, image analysis, and optical character recognition.
Specifically, the research will study methods for incorporating invariance
properties into SVMs, methods for automatically choosing the parameters and
kernels of SVMs, numerical techniques for computing support vectors, extending
SVM beyond current uses, and improving pattern-recognition performance. One
result of the research will be a numerical code for the computation of support
vectors that will be available to the research community.
