The objective of this Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry
(GOALI) project is to establish a sensor-enabled modeling framework to real-time
predict and preserve the safety limits of tire/road interaction. Tire/road
interaction plays an important role for safe operation of motor vehicles. The
project will develop, implement, and evaluate a safety-preserved tire/road
interaction estimation and control scheme. The following three objectives will
be pursued: (1) a sensor-enabled tire/road interaction modeling scheme; (2) a
tire/road interaction safety-limit estimation and control system; and (3)
technology implementation and transfer at Ford as well as research/education
integration. The approach of this research is based on the integration of the
physical and dynamic tire/road friction models with the distributed tire rubber
deformation sensing system. Based on the sensor-enabled models, on-line
estimation and control strategies will be developed to predict the safety limits
of tire/road interaction and prevent vehicles from unsafe operation.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The success of this project will advance fundamental
understanding of tire/road interaction by providing new sensing mechanisms for
modeling tire/road interaction, new knowledge and methodologies to real-time
estimate the safety limits of tire/road interaction under normal driving
conditions without the need of severe and unsafe maneuvers, and a new adaptive
control methodology to preserve vehicle safety. Industrial implementation of the
resulting methodology is expected to generate broad economic and societal
impacts. One of the direct applications of the proposed research will be to
advance the ?smart tire? technology in the automotive industry. The project will
provide students (at the K-12, the undergraduate and graduate levels) with
multidisciplinary training, exposure to important industrial problems, and
practical experience.
