This project investigates the role of fund flows and fees in portfolio choice
and asset pricing. The main focus is on (i) understanding how these aspects fit
in the existing theory, (ii) developing theoretical tools that make them
tractable, and (iii) evaluating the departures from classical results due to
flows and fees. Central issues are the extension of duality theory, and the
development of asymptotic techniques in the long-horizon and small-fees limits.

This research aims to incorporate fund flows and fees - two central aspects of
financial intermediation - in mathematical models of financial markets, to
understand their agency effects on asset allocation, and their implications for
welfare and pricing. This project will help understand the role of financial
intermediaries, the incentives created by their fee-based contracts, and their
interaction with investors' response through flows, that is subscriptions and
redemptions.
