Fine-grained concurrent programs offer the potential for portable concurrent
programming, but their efficient execution is not yet practical. The objective
of this project is to develop techniques to support efficient execution of fine-
grained programs by transforming their execution grain size. Fine-grained
programs present special problems because the overhead of each grain can
overwhelm the benefits of exploiting their concurrency. The project focuses on
concurrent, object-based programs because they allow the expression of fine-
grained concurrency and couple data and program, providing important data
locality information. The program transformations increase program locality by
grouping objects. This allows small computational grains to be merged into
larger grains, increasing execution efficiency and reducing communication
requirements. The research will examine quantitative analysis of control and
communication patterns in concurrent object-oriented programs, the development
of program analysis and transformation techniques, and their implementation and
evaluation based on a sharable intermediate form. Quantitative analysis provides
a useful point of reference and the basis for understanding the behavior of
programs. The analysis techniques identify invocation paths and static object
relations, enabling the application of program transformations grouping objects
along invocation paths. Such techniques increase program locality, reducing
communication and permitting the use of more efficient, specialized code
sequences.
