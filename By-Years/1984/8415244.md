This research project is for a study of the dynamic fracture of solids under
conditions of general in-plane loading. The aim is to better understand the
mechanics of crack initiation, crack path evolution, and crack growth under
mixed mode dynamic loading. Experiments will be performed on Homelite 100, a
brittle polyester that has been well characterized in terms of mechanical
behavior, particularly dynamic fracture under opening mode loading. The dynamic
fracture events will be monitored using a high speed framing camera in a
shadowgraph arrangement to determine the stress intensity factor as well as the
history of crack extension.
