Recent hypotheses suggest that the breakup of a single supercontinent at about
750 Ma has led to the origin of several independent continents now widely
scattered over the earth. It poses testable models for identifying the former
extent and connections of these continents and gives new meaning to previously
identified intercontinental (eg. Pan-African/Brasiliano and Grevillian/Kibaran)
orogenic systems. The work will focus on a unique triple junction exposed in the
Namib Desert on the coastal escarpment of northern Namibia. This key locations
is near the center of the hypothesized supercontinent. The initial focus of the
project is on the foreland thrust and fold belts of the southern and western
Congo margins , involving sequences related to rifting, passive-margin
subsidence, terrane accretion and terminal collision. Pesults will provide
essential data to reconstruct the tectonic history of this area and to allow a
rigorous test of the hypothesis that these events are part of a supercontinent
breakup that has led to the present distribution of continental crust.
