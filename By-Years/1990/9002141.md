This one-year grant will permit Dr. Yuille and one student to extend their
preliminary work in representation and visual recognition of human faces. Their
current system can locate strong features such as eyes and mouths by using
parametric adaptation of deformable templates. They are now applying robust
statistical methods to identification of partially occluded or unresolved
features, and will also study pyramid algorithms for matching a global face
template. The goal is robust face recognition in the presence of noise and
distractions.
