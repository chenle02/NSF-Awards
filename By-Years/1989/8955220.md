The University of Iowa will conduct a thirty-month program to develop a cadre
of lead teachers in discrete mathematics, transformational and vector geometry,
and the use of technology in teaching mathematics. In all, sixty well prepared
secondary mathematics teachers will participate in a series of summer workshop
and follow-up activities designed to provide the necessary subject matter
content and leadership training and to winnow out the final group of lead
teachers. These leaders will return for a two-week workshops on leadership and
additional work on implementing the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics
Standards. This project builds on a successful Teacher Enhancement program
conducted previously by senior staff members. The project includes a strong
component on learning issues especially relevant to under- represented groups in
mathematics. The University of Iowa, Maharishi International University, and the
participants' schools are contributing an amount equal to 25% of the National
Science Foundation request.
