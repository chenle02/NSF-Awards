ABSTRACT 9500290 Lesser, Michael Techniques have been developed to produce
thinned, black illuminated charge-coupled device (CCD) detectors for
astronomical observations. These techniques have matured to the point where they
are now routinely applied to detectors of many different formats from several
different manufacturers. This project extends this development into several new
areas of importance to the scientific community, and particularly to astronomy.
New techniques will be developed to thin and optimize the very large format CCDs
(&gt; 10 cm 2, &gt; 2048x2048 pixels) which are now at the forefront of
semiconductor manufacturing technology. These large format devices are necessary
for the construction of CCD mosaics to cover the huge focal planes of large
telescopes and large telescope spectrographs. The new techniques to be developed
include very large area thinning, methods to package large devices for flat and
often buttable operation with simplified electrical interconnections, and the
capability to characterize the detectors at cryogenic temperatures prior to
thinning. Second, the processes will be extended to thin and optimize the very
small, high speed readout devices required for the active and adaptive optics
instrumentation planned for nearly all large telescopes. These detectors must
have the highest possible quantum efficiency in the visible and near-IR to
obtain sufficient signal-to-noise in the extremely short exposure times
required. The techniques to be developed will be available to the entire
scientific community. Back illuminated devices are of great important to many
scientific disciplines other than astronomy. Physics, chemistry, engineering,
and medicine are all in need of the low light level, wide bandpass imaging
detectors which will be developed here. ***
