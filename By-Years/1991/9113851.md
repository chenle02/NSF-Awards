This proposal is part of a systematic study of the Arctic environment and its
role in global change promoted by NSF's Arctic System Science Program. It is a
three year project to investigate equilibrium arctic climates simulated by
state-of-the-art computer models for the global atmosphere, the Arctic Ocean and
arctic sea ice. A sequence of simulations and analyses will be performed with
uncoupled, partially coupled, and fully coupled model systems. This research
effort will use existing data sets to simulate the present-day arctic climate
and the climate of an enhanced greenhouse scenario. Processes and feedbacks
intrinsic to the Arctic, and neglected or poorly resolved in previous studies,
will be evaluated in detail.
