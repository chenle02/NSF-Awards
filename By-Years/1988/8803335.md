This proposal describes basic research on low-dimensional heterostructures and
quantum structures, hereafter termed ultrastructures. The ultrastructures will
have radically new properties introduced by their new degrees of quantization.
The research will involve an integrated investigation of formation, fundamental
characterization and device implementation of these extremely small structures.
Ultrastructure microfabrication will be achieved by in situ epitaxial crystal
growth and high- resolution focused ion beam methods. Characterization of the
structures will be carried out using sensitive, spatially resolved structural
and spectroscopic methods. The novel physical properties originating from
carrier confinement will be investigated and incorporated in exploratory
electronic and photonic devices.
