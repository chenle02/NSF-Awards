Phaeodarian radiolarians are planktonic protozoans that play a role in oceanic
carbon and silica cycles. Phaeodarians have been largely ignored in Antarctic
waters because their distributions are so different from those of other
protozoans. They have several characteristics that make them unique among
protozoans and potentially important in the Southern Ocean. Phaeodarians consume
a wide variety of foods from bacteria to small metazoans, especially siliceous
cells and particles. When phaeodarians die, their siliceous skeletons are more
susceptible to dissolution than polycystine skeletons. In Antarctic waters where
large phaeodarians can be more abundant than in other oceans, a large
phaeodarian below the euphotic zone represents a substantial amount of silica.
Phaeodarians are also potential links between nanoplankton populations and
macrozooplankton. Gowing will determine the abundance and distribution of
phaeodarians and polycystines, and investigate the feeding biology of
phaeodarians by vacule content analysis and measurement of feeding rates. These
investigations will be the first steps in determining the importance of
phaeodarians in Antarctic carbon and silica cycles and in food webs.
