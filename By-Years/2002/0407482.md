Biological Sciences (61) This project is providing effective undergraduate
education in molecular biology using an integrated research-problem-based
approach in an advanced, undergraduate course. The entire course is presented
within the framework of a research cloning experiment that the students complete
in the laboratory. At the end of the course the students generate their own
research proposals with experiments that they can subsequently pursue. The
material for the course is being adopted from the NSF-sponsored Unraveling DNA
text, and adapted to serve a student populace dominated by rural, first
generation college students with significant numbers of female and African
American students. Adaptations include integration of the laboratory and
classroom experience and modification of all laboratory exercises. This project
is increasing the participation of underrepresented groups in molecular biology,
enhancing scientific literacy among the students, and integrating research and
education by enhancing the institutional research and educational
infrastructure.
