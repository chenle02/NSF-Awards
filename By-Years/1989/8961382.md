In this Phase I SBIR proposal, RD Instruments proposes to demonstrate the
feasibility of developing an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) with twice
the depth range of existing instruments. The proposed instrument will be able to
measure the velocity of water masses to a depth of 1500m. In order for
scientists to make realistic estimates of oceanographic currents, velocity
measurements to a depth of at least 1200m are essential. Present ADCP
capabilities are limited to about 700m. Velocity measurements of water masses
requires a narrow acoustic beam width and extremely precise measurement of
acoustic signals reflected from small particles in the water in order to locate
those particles. In addition, measurement of phase shifts in the return acoustic
beam indicate the velocity of those particles, and hence the velocity of the
water mass.
