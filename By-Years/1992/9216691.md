This research project will investigate the coordination of two physically-
coupled human arms and two artificial arms in cooperative manipulation tasks.
The project will focus on the interaction when there is physical contact between
the two arms. The mechanisms underlying the generation of trajectories and the
interaction forces and moments of two human arms will be studied. The
investigators also will develop control algorithms that would specify the motion
and forces of two artificial manipulators during the performance of similar
coordinated tasks. This research is important since the understanding of
coordinated reaching and manipulation by humans will be advanced. In addition,
the research will improve the control algorithms for coordinated multi-robotic
reaching and grasping.
