This project supports research by Paturi, his graduate students and
collaborators on foundational questions about the exact complexity of NP-
complete problems The core questions addressed concern the difficulty of
exhaustive search, and to what extent an exhaustive search may be pruned to
improve its effectiveness. The project will study the complexity of algorithms,
especially for the fundamental problem of satisfiability, but also for other NP-
complete problems such as the traveling salesman problem and k-colorability. The
PI and his students will study probabilistic search algorithms that succeed with
exponentially small probability. They will study self-reducibility among
instances of the circuit satisfiability problem as well as the fundamental
question of trade-off between time and probability for NP-complete
problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research on exact exponential-time algorithms for
NP-complete problems not only has the potential to improve our understanding of
fundamental limitations of feasible computability, but may possibly lead
directly to new algorithms for satisfiability and other combinatorial
optimization problems. The project will support graduate student education and
research in computer science, especially in algorithms and complexity theory.
The PI engages in teaching at the undergraduate and graduate level in computer
science that will benefit from his research activities supported by the project.
