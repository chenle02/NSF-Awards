Increasingly, the need arises to solve large-scale complex optimization problems
modeled by simulations that allow little or no structural assumptions on the
form of their objective functions. And yet their complexity and scope demand
integrated approaches to finding optimal designs. This grant will fund the
investigation of the potential of a fictitious play paradigm as an algorithmic
approach to such problems, both from theoretical and practical points of view.
Fictitious Play &lt;br/&gt;(FP), which is an iterative process originating in
game theory, executes a non-cooperative game repeatedly among players
represented by a partition of the decision variables of the underlying system
optimization problem. Best replies, as opposed to jointly optimal strategies,
can thus dramatically reduce the computational complexity of the problem.
Proposed work will focus on computationally practical variants of such an
algorithm, and their application to two practical problems: design of dynamic
traffic signal timing plans and large-scale instances of Dynamic Programming. In
particular, as part of our research, we hope to establish close links between
concepts and results in game theory and dynamic programming that so far appear
to be unexplored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The opportunity to seek better system
performance using realistic simulations of complex systems with an algorithm
that gracefully scales and offers the opportunity to compute in parallel can
have significant benefits for areas such as, but not limited to, transportation
and manufacturing. If successful, this research will not only lead to potential
improvements in these application arenas, but will also provide a general and
efficient algorithmic tool for improving design of complex realistically-modeled
large scale systems, which promises to be broadly and easily applicable. The
research promises to produce significant interactions with industry and
government to insure realism for the models and data developed.&lt;br/&gt;
