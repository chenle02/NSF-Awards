Concordia College will improve the quality of physics and earth science
instruction by instrumenting computer controlled experiments. These will
increase the accuracy and precision of data gathered in experiments, and speed
the calculations needed to convert raw data into usable data, so that the time
normally spent on these activities can instead be used in analyzing data and
drawing conclusion from them. The major purchases will be two Apple computers,
interface cards, sensors, a printer, and a plotter to provide hard copies of the
data gathered and manipulated. The sensors will be used measure time intervals,
temperatures, frequencies, and weather phenomena. Most of the students taking
physics and earth science courses at Concordia are studying to become elementary
and secondary school teachers.
