Coding theory has for long focused on designing error-correcting codes with the
assumption that the length of the transmission message can be made as large as
desired. Modern settings, however, such as the Internet of Things and machine-
to-machine communication, require devices to communicate short messages with
very small delays while maintaining a high degree of reliability. This conjures
up a long-standing challenge in coding theory: design low-complexity channel
codes that provide high reliability and low latency. This project aims to
develop error-correcting technologies well-suited to such demands of the
evolving information infrastructure.

This research will investigate two rich classes of code-designs: stream codes
and Reed-Muller codes. Stream codes, recently proposed by the investigator and
co-authors, combine the powerful features of convolutional encoding and
iterative decoding, while Reed-Muller codes are classic code designs that have
recently been shown to achieve capacity in erasure channels. Preliminary studies
suggest that both stream and Reed-Muller codes have remarkable performance at
short lengths, but using highly complex decoders, posing the issue of whether
computationally efficient decoder may be found. This project focuses on
developing novel algorithmic and analytical frameworks aiming to: (i) design
efficient decoding algorithms; (ii) develop new theoretical frameworks for the
analysis of the proposed algorithms; and (iii) establish fundamental length-
rate-complexity trade-offs in the non-asymptotic regime.
