The Mada Maagarishtauo Awa Hee Aadsa Maa Aru Maa Giguckiigash (The ones that
teach our children how everything on this earth works) STEM Teachers of
Excellence Education Program (STEEP) will establish an accredited baccalaureate
elementary teacher education program that is standards-based and uses
constructivist methods that focus on relevant science and math based on
identified needs. The development of a new elementary education program of study
that is standards-based and uses constructivist methods that focuses on relevant
science and math based on identified needs will represent an innovative model
being done for the first time in a tribal college setting. The incorporation of
Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara cultural values with math and science concepts
across the elementary teacher education curriculum will enhance the chance for
elementary school age children to become grounded in STEM fields because of
their teachers.&lt;br/&gt;
