This research involves a study of the role of supporting infrastructures, such
as laboratory facilities, equipment, support personnel, funding, communication,
etc., in technology development. These studies will be addressed in particular
to understanding the role of these infrastructures in promoting or hindering the
development of a group of critically innovative technologies that exhibit
certain well-defined characteristics. The investigation will be conducted from
an historical point of view, and will focus on a carefully selected group of
case studies, which include instances in which contemporary technologies, such
as high-temperature superconducting materials, are included. This research seeks
to provide anecdotal data on the technologies studied that may help in
understanding the role that NSF/ENG can play in technological innovation in
emerging engineering technologies.
