9701767 Tenore Support from NSF will augment funds from the Luso-American
Foundation (FLAD), and the Portuguese National Science Organization (JNICT) to
encourage interaction among U.S. and Portuguese marine scientists sharing mutual
research interests on coastal oceanographic processes characteristic of the
land-sea interface that significantly influence productivity of coastal marine
environments. The project builds on previous work to encourage the Portuguese to
develop a rigorous research framework and structure collaborative activities
along the lines of NSF-funded LMER (Land Margin Ecosystems Research) projects.
Collaborative US - Portuguese research efforts have centered on developing
methodologies to characterize and quantify land use patterns, coastal habitats,
and available data on hydrographic patterns and biota of the Portuguese LMER
sites. Results from this project will form the basis for prioritizing specific
research projects to further the knowledge of coastal marine science in
Portugal.
