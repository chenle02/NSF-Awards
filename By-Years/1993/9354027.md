9354027 Miller The aim of this project is to provide teachers of undergraduate
science and engineering courses with sufficient curricular background and
information to enable them to introduce the subject of materials science into
existing introductory courses or to develop a new introductory course in this
area. The project targets teachers in four-year colleges and in community
colleges in the Pacific Northwest region. The summer component of this project
entails an intensive two-week program in materials science with lectures, small
group discussions, laboratories and research sessions for a group of 30 college
science, engineering and technology instructors. The variety of activities built
into the workshop sessions enables participants to gain hands-on knowledge of
the materials field and of working laboratory experiments that can be used in
their home institutions, while insuring that they have sufficient time to learn
and reinforce needed basic understanding in the materials area. The academic
year follow-up activities in the program include curriculum development
activities by participants interacting by computer; and a weekend meeting on
campus during the academic year will reinforce these activities and provide
additional background and advanced topic lectures to participants. ***
