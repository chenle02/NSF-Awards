This research project focuses on the study of some of the collective nontrivial
boundary dependencies of the Casimir force using an atomic force microscope. The
primary aims of the project are the demonstration of collective nontrivial
electromagnetic zero point photon diffraction-like effects in Casimir forces
from periodically corrugated surfaces, novel characteristics of the lateral
Casimir force which can lead to horizontal motion, resulting entirely from the
vacuum properties of quantum electrodynamics and observation of repulsive
Casimir forces. The broader impact involves the education of both graduate and
undergraduate students as well as outreach to K-12 "at risk"
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
