Trade Unions and employers' associations vary widely in their degree of
centralization across the advanced industrial democracies. The sources and
economic consequences of the extent of centralization of such associations have
been subjects of considerable debate. While it is clear that the extent of
centralization has substantial consequences in terms of economic policies and
outcomes, the specific nature of these relationships is not well understood.
This collaborative research explores both the causes and consequences of union
centralization in advanced industrial societies. Government data and interviews
with local experts will be used to construct a comprehensive data set on the
centralization of national industrial relations systems and of trade unions and
employers' associations in approximately 20 european nations over an extended
time period. These data will permit a much more systematic and thorough
exploration of the causes and consequences of union centralization. When
completed this project will provide the basis for a better understanding of
union, management, government relations and how they can be improved.
