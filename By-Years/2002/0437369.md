In this U.S.-Brazil collaborative project supported by the Americas Program of
the Office of International Science and Engineering, Dr. Emilio M. Bruna,of the
University of Florida will pursue a program to examine the effects of herbivores
(leaf cutter ants), granivores (rodents), and their interaction on a diverse
plant community in an understudied tropical ecosystem, the cerrado of Brazil.
Together with U.S. coworkers and Brazilian colleagues from the Federal
University of Uberlandia, Dr. Bruna will perform a multifaceted experiment to
examine the effect of the removal of different trophic levels on seedling
recruitment in this ecosystem, both independently and synergistically. They
expect to learn not only the relative importance of granivory and herbivory
factors, but also how they interact to influence plant population and community
dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project focuses on a topic of considerable
importance to ecological research. Through this research the investigators hope
to answer a fundamental question in plant population ecology. This project also
provides international research experience for U.S. students and will strengthen
a developing collaboration with the Brazilian scientists.&lt;br/&gt;
