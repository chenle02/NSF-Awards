Dr. Kevin Williams has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Williams' doctoral degree was from the University of Pittsburgh
under the supervision of Professor Julius Rebek. Dr. Williams intends to
continue research at Harvard University under the sponsorship of Professor
George Whitesides. Dr. Williams' area of postdoctoral research will be the
synthesis of molecules capable of molecular recognition and their application to
chemical synthesis. The synthesis of the nucleoside antibiotic, tunicamycin,
will be developed using a combination of enzymatic and chemical synthetic
approaches. The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an
important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and
experience of new Ph.D's and attract them into meaningful careers in
contemporary chemical research and teaching.
