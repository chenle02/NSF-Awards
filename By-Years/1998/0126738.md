Marymount College, a women's college, is incorporating a collaborative inquiry-
based approach to teaching physiological principles in six laboratory courses by
making data collection, analysis and presentation consistent with present
technology. This incorporation involves two phases and aims to overcome present
impediments of incomplete and inconsistent experimental data collection, low
student participation and lack of time for students to thoroughly understand
concepts. The project is adapted from a NSF-funded program for physiology-based
courses at Goshen College (CCLI # 9950383). Students are using more graphic data
representation and apply critical thinking skills to data analysis and the
development of creative hypotheses. Evaluation of critical thinking skills is
being inventoried through questionnaires and surveys. Dissemination of
assessment will occur through participation in undergraduate conferences,
publications and development of Web sites.
