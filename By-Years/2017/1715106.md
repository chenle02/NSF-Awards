This is an expedition objective research proposal that will use samples from
IODP exp. 340 to the Lesser Antilles. This proposal seeks to examine the effect
of tephra deposition and diagenesis on sediment chemistry, pore fluids, and
ocean chemistry. The specific hypothesis is that tephra sedimentation and
diagenesis promotes burial of organic carbon. It does this by consuming
oxidizers that would otherwise degrade organic carbon and/or binding carbon to
metals. The PI proposes to analyze major and trace elements and Sr isotopes, for
all samples and pore waters. The PI also proposes to analyze organic C,
carbonate, carbon isotopes, reactive Fe and Al for sediments and pore water
solids. The work has the potential to provide an important constraint on the
oceanic carbon cycle.
