This project provides an opportunity for biology and chemistry secondary school
teachers to learn and use basic science concepts and theories as employed in
industry for developing curriculum units. The project is predicated on the
thesis that a curriculum that is developed by teachers from direct experience
will induce changes more quickly in new teaching strategies and produce more
highly motivated students and a greater understanding of science. Visits to
industries, agencies and natural sites are organized to provide direct
experience to teachers. These visits will be supplemented by lectures and
laboratory work conducted by university staff paired with experienced high
school science teachers. Three week summer workshops in chemistry and biology
will be held during the summers of 1988 and 1989. The activities will continue
with 12 meetings during the academic year. This project will assist in
determining if familiarity with equipment and practical applications of theories
and concepts in applied settings will build motivation for pursuing science
careers.
