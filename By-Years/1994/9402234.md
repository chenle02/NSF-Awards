9402234 Raufaste This award is for continued support for the U.S.-Japan Panel on
Wind and Seismic Effects which was established in 1968. The Panel develops
technologies that advance engineering design and construction practices for
improved quality-of-life. The Panel is composed of 18 federal agencies who
participate in ten task committees. The task committees focus on specific
national issues, e.g., earthquake hazards reduction; passive and active control
systems; repair and rehabilitation of structures; and wind and earthquake
engineering for offshore structures. Annual meetings alternate between Japan and
the U.S. ***
