A nonuniform contact pressure between the casting and the mold during the
solidification process can result in a casting surface with wavy defects as well
as undesirable residual stresses. The latter could cause spontaneous failure of
the casting at a later date. Dr. J. R. Barber will use measured contact
resistance and contact pressure between the casting and mold to study the
solidification process. The related experiments will be conducted at ALCOA
Research Laboratory at no cost to this award thus demonstrating its industrial
significance. This study should lead to optimum material properties and mold
cooling strategies for a better surface finish and minimum residual stresses in
a casting. Dr. Barber is most qualified to undertake this interdisciplinary
research involving solid mechanics and heat transfer. Dr. O. Richmond, ALCOA,
will conduct the experimental studies and participate in the theoretical
studies. Also Dr. A. Azarkhin, ALCOA, wail be an advisor and an active
participant in the theoretical studies.
