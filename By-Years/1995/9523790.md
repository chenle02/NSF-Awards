The PI will install and operate an existing low light level imager in the
vicinity of the Bear Lake Observatory, Utah, for two years. Two primary tasks to
be undertaken are: (1) mapping energy sources into the upper atmosphere at mid-
latitudes. This will create the framework for interpreting upper atmosphere
dynamics above mid-latitude regions, and (2) mapping presence, persistence, and
extent of atmospheric gravity waves. This will enhance the testing and
interpretation of temperature mapping efforts from BLO. The project's long range
goals is to make measurements that improve understanding of the energy coupling
within the atmosphere system, which will require extended observations of both
mesospheric and thermospheric emissions relevant to the tasks identified above.
