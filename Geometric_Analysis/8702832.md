Ian Anderson will continue his investigations of the variational bicomplex.
This is a topic which has rapidly moved into the forefront of research into the
calculus of variations. Its applications range from conservation laws of partial
differential equations to Riemannian structures and variational problems in
differential geometry. The variational bicomplex is a bicomplex of differential
forms which derives its name from the fact that one of its differentials may be
identified with the Euler-Lagrange operator from the calculus of variations.
Anderson's work will focus principally on the calculation of the cohomology of
the variational bicomplex. When applied to systems of differential equations the
importance of this cohomology arises from the fact that it is generated, in
part, by the conservation laws of the equations. In this context Anderson will
investigate the case of over-determined systems of equations. Group actions on a
fiber bundle also give rise to the problem of calculating equivariant
cohomology. Here Anderson will carry out the computations in cases of interest
to mathematical physics.
