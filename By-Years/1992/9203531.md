This award from the U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science Program supports
collaborative research in geology to be conducted by Dr. James F. Cotter of the
University of Minnesota, Morris and by Dr. A.C. Rocha- Campos of the
Universidade de Sao Paulo in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The goal of the research is to
determine the origin of boulder pavements by comparative study of examples from
the Minnesota River Valley in the U.S. and the Parana Basin in Brazil. The
project will study boulder pavements from the Pleistocene of the Minnesota River
Valley and the Itarare Subgroup (Late Paleozoic) of the Parana Basin in Brazil
in order to determine the processes which resulted in clast concentration,
emplacement and modification. The collaboration expands the knowledge base of
the two groups in a way impossible for either group acting alone. The project
brings together the expertise of the U.S. group with recent and late Pleistocene
glacial deposits with the Brazilian expertise in sediment and sedimentary
structure analysis. The U.S. group, situated in a predominantly undergraduate
setting, will expose undergraduates to front-line research.
