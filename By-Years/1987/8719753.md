This project is the preparation of a dictionary and reference grammar of Mbay,
a Nilo-Saharan language with contrastive tone spoken in south central Chad and
the neighboring Central African Republic. The work was begun during the PI's
service in Chad with the Peace Corps. The dictionary and grammar are now
undergoing thorough revision and improvement.
