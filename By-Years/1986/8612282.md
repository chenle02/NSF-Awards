Two-phase flow remains as an area of mystery in fluid mechanics. such flows are
prone to many types of instabilities. One such instability, thermal instability,
will be studied in the research. The research will have both experimental and
theoretical portions. The experiments will encompass all of the important
variables that govern the thermal instability. In the theoretical work, a model
previously used for other two-phase instabilities will be extended t thermal
instability.
