Laminated sediments collected form the Gulf of California by the PI provide
direct evidence of the extent of oxygen minimum zone. During the last glacial
and the Younger Dryas events the thermocline waters were better ventilated. PI
will use chemical proxies to reconstruct paleochemistry of the Pacific
intermediate water from glacial to interglacial time. AMs dating will provide
the necessary chronological control.
