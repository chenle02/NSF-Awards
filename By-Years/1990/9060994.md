This SBIR Phase I research will experimentally and analytical evaluate the load
bearing capacity of different borehole breakouts, and the feasibility of using
such configurations as an excavation shape. If tunnels or underground
excavations incorporate a cross- sectional shape similar to a stable breakout,
the cost of support and long term maintenance could be greatly reduced or
possibly eliminated.
