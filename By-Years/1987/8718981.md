This award is to support US participants in a joint seminar between the US and
Taiwan on neurobiological regulation and neurofunction. The seminar will be held
in November 1987 in Phoenix, Arizona. This award will support the participation
of ten US scientists; support of the scientists from Taiwan will be the
responsibility of the National Science Council of Taiwan, NSF's counterpart
under the cooperative science program between the American Institute in Taiwan
and the Coordination Council for North American Affairs. The seminar will focus
on the exchange of research information and techniques in the areas of molecular
and cellular mechanisms that regulate the integrative function of the nervous
system. The participation of scientists from Taiwan will allow US researchers to
explore Taiwan's unique perspective on exploitation of natural products, such as
bungarotoxins, and will contribute to the development of joint research projects
of mutual interest and benefit.
