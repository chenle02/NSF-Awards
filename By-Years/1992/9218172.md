This award supports a two-year collaborative research project between Professor
Richard O. Buckius of the University of Illinois and Professor Kunio Hijikata of
Tokyo Institute of Technology and Professor Toshiro Makino of Kyoto University.
The objective is to experimentally and theoretically analyze radiative heat
transfer properties of surfaces and films from first principles. Usual radiant
energy transfer calculations for surfaces and films make rather ad hoc
assumptions about the surfaces roughness, length scales, and material properties
due to the lack of fundamental knowledge of the radiation scattering
characteristics and the interface parameters. Very common engineering
approximations include specular reflection, diffuse reflection, constant bulk
material properties, small interface roughness, etc. These approximations are
often inaccurate for surfaces used in many practical applications, and they
usually require an empirical approach to determine specific values of the
radiative properties. The collaborative project considers exact approaches to
the quantification of the radiative surface properties through the use of
general electromagnetic scattering and molecular kinetic theories. The U.S.
group is addressing the rough and configured surfaces while the Japanese groups
are studying the superconducting films and optical properties and rough films
from a fractal-based approach.
