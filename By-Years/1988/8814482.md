A prototype of an object--oriented distributed data base system will be
developed for the Global Ocean Flux Study. For both MS- -DOS and VAX VMS
systems, sample "methods" and some demonstration programs will be developed. In
addition, data management activities needed to support the time--series and
North Atlantic Bloom studies will be conducted. In the second year the system
will be expanded to SUN and Macintosh workstations and the computer programs
will be improved and documented as needed.
