This conference award provides partial travel support for US participants to
attend the "Workshop on Ramsey Theory and Computability Theory", to be held in
Rome, Italy, in July 9-13, 2018. The workshop seeks to capitalize on a string of
recent results in reverse mathematics, more specifically, recent advances at the
intersection of computability theory and combinatorics. A mixture of US based
speakers and students will be supported.

The workshop will focus on the computability-theoretic and proof-theoretic
strength of combinatorial principles such as Ramsey's Theorem for pairs and
Hindman's Theorem. More information on the workshop can be found at
https://www3.nd.edu/~cholak/Colosseum.html

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
