The contribution of this project comes from studying how well markets perform in
environments in which the economic fundamentals seem to create particularly
severe problems for decentralized allocation procedures. These environments
include those with public goods, those studied in the literature on imperfectly
competitive models of recessions, and cooperative synergies within
organizations. The investigator analyzes the rich structure of complementarities
in these problems using strategic market games models and determines a
fundamental connection common to all of these environments that is related to
Ostroy's No-Surplus idea.
