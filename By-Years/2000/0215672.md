This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is developing an
advanced questions answering (QA) system with the use of innovative natural
language processing (NLP). The specific areas addressed by this project are: (1)
a true open-domain, high precision QA system optimized for commercial
deployment; (2) distributed processing that provides an unprecedented QU system
response time; and (3) system management and reporting tools for real-time
customer feedback.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The final product will provide accurate
and short answers to questions asked in plain English. The need for this
capability is widespread in companies, government agencies, and among
individuals. The users may be casual questioners who ask simple factual
questions, consumers who look for specific product features and prices, research
analysis that collect market, finance, or business information, or professional
information analysts such as law enforcement officials searching for very
specific information requiring considerable expertise.
