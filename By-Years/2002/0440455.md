This project explores employing distributed computational resources to combat
the unreliability and highly variable performance inherent to wide-area systems.
The goal of this work is to balance wide-area performance, security, and
resource utilization by efficiently replicating and migrating computation using
inexact information distributed across multiple administrative domains. To this
end, this research addresses three areas important to scaling the global network
infrastructure: i) dynamic placement and migration of computation for efficient
utilization of global resources, ii) resource allocation among principals
simultaneously utilizing resources in multiple administrative domains, and iii)
a security infrastructure that enables the fine-grained transfer of rights for
wide-area computation. The impact of this work will be increase fairness,
scalability, and fault tolerance for distributed systems leveraging this
infrastructure.
