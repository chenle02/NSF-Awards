I research project is concerned with the consequences of long term human
exposure to elemental chlorine and chlorine containing organic compounds which
is an issue of increasing public concern. Chlorine in the environment has been
associated with such disparate phenomena as carcinogenesis, reductions in human
sperm count, and increased fragility of egg shells in endangered avian species.
More stringent regulation of the release into the environment of chlorinated
species is anticipated. A major source of long term, low level exposure to
chlorocarbons is through the public drinking water supplies. The most
significant means of minimizing the associated health risks is the reduction of
those chlorinated by-products caused by excess chlorination. This requires a
continuous and detailed knowledge of chlorine levels throughout the drinking
water distribution system so that more precise control of chlorine additions can
be made. Such control will maintain antimicrobial activity while reducing
unwanted disinfection by- products. This research project has commercial
potential in the monitoring of chlorine levels on a continuous basis in drinking
water systems.
