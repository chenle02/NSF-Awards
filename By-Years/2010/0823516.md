Funding is provided to develop long-term temporal records of ground surface
temperatures by using temperature-depth profiles from geophysical boreholes as a
means to constrain climate variability over timescales longer than the
instrumental record. Specifically, the researchers will: (1) continue operation
of the Emigrant Pass Observatory (EPO) in arid northwestern Utah where
meteorological data and ground temperatures are being monitored; (2) investigate
the ground thermal regime and land-atmosphere coupling across a climatic
gradient in the, Cascades, Oregon; (3) repeat the logging of selected boreholes
to test how to isolate the transient climate events associated with climate
change; (4) investigate the observed variability in reduced temperature
profiles; and (5) investigate processes leading to the discrepancy of warming
estimates derived from multi-proxy reconstructions and temperature-depth
profiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts involve a strong educational
mentoring portion and an equally strong intellectual portion. Scientifically,
this research could help lead to a more sophisticated understanding between
temperature-depth reconstructions of ground surface temperatures and multi-proxy
records of climate change. Educationally, the project will support a graduate
student whose background in contemporary global change issues will be broadened
by developing quantitative skills cross disciplinary interactions across the
solid Earth geophysics and atmospheric sciences. The project will also involve
graduate research assistants in the University of Utah, NSF supported GK-12
project titled WEST (Water, the Environment, Science, and Teaching) led by one
of the PIs (Chapman). WEST students interact with Salt Lake City School District
teachers and K-12 pupils, lead field trips, create laboratory exercises, and
establish meteorological stations at local schools.
