This project will plan the development of a biological database for the genus
Peromyscus (deer mice and 55 allied species). Mice of the genus Peromyscus are
extremely abundant throughout North America and are widely used in pure and
applied research. Research areas in which Peromyscus is commonly used includes
ecology, genetics, systematics, evolution, behavior, physiology, metabolism,
parasitology, epidemiology, and toxicology. Currently there is no comprehensive
database for this significant group of organisms, although more than 3500
journal articles have been published and several hundred investigators currently
use peromyscines in their research. The database envisioned, although including
genetics, is expected to contain a broad range of information concerning many
aspects of the biology of these rodents. This database, therefore, will differ
substantially from the several mammalian genomic databases currently accessible.
The long-range objective is to have about eight or nine topical components of
the database up to date and readily accessible on the Internet. The Peromyscus
Data Base (PDB) will be developed and operated through the Department of
Computer Science and the Department of Biological Sciences, Peromyscus Genetic
Stock Center, of the University of South Carolina at Columbia. Other
institutions may become involved as planning progresses. Several existing free-
standing databases will be incorporated into the overall database.
