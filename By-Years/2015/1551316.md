The goal of the Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing systems conference series
(SASO) is to provide an interdisciplinary research forum, focused on advancing
the foundations for engineered networked systems and services based on
principles of self-adaptation and self-organization. Understanding these
principles will enable design and development of safer, more secure, more
reliable future systems ranging from smart resilient electric power grids to
future intelligent transportation systems with driverless cars. This workshop
grant will enable students from many diverse fields to participate in
discussions at this workshop with leading international researchers and to
advance a shared community vision of the potential of self-adapting and self-
organized engineered systems.
