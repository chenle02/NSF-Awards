Students in organic chemistry and in special problems courses in scientific
research are doing experiments in the ultraviolet and visible region of the
spectrum. Students are gaining experience with their own spectra of organic
compounds for spectra structure correlations and learning to operate a modern,
programmable, computer- directed spectrophotometer equivalent to those used in
industry and national laboratories. The students are doing experiments such as
the measurement of the spectra of aniline, the anilinium cation, and
nitrobenzene. They are then considering the displacement and enhancement of
absorption bands in the spectrum due to the structural substitution of the amino
group on the aromatic ring, the disappearance of the shift and enhancement when
the amino group is converted to the anilinium cation, and the appearance of
additional bands when the structural change involves substitution of a nitro
group on the benzene ring. The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal
sources.
