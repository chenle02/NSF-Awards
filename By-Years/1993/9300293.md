The Undergraduate Summer Fellowships in Orthopaedic Bioengineering program at
the Hospital for Joint Diseases is a continuation of a similar program held for
the past eleven years. This Research Experiences for Undergraduates program is
based on the premise that the ideal place to supplement the basic education of
bioengineers with practical experience and expose them to "real-life" situations
of the sort that will characterize their future careers is in the intense
medical environment of a teaching hospital. Such experience is critical to the
education of engineers and scientists who will create new concepts and develop,
design, and manufacture medical devices. Such training is necessary to maintain
and expand the competitive edge enjoyed by the U.S. medical device industry,
whose products are recognized as being the world's best. The program's projects,
chosen from ongoing Departmental research activities with independent funding
sources, will involve ligament and cartilage repair, spinal fixation, fracture
repair, physical chemistry of biomineralization, mechanical and electromagnetic
effects on tissue growth, and total joint design.
