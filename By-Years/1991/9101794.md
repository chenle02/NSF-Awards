A flow cytometer will be employed in projects by two major and two minor users.
1) It will be used to monitor quantitatively the progression of differentiation
of sea urchin male germ line cells in culture. The large number of samples
processed will make feasible the optimization of culture conditions and the
evaluation of effects of hormones, growth factors, and cell-cell interactions in
promoting production of sperm cell. 2) It will be used to characterize
mechanisms which maintain lipid asymmetry in normal and sickled red blood cells,
and to probe the resistance of cytotoxic T lymphocytes to lysis by their product
perforin (involved in antigen-specific killing of target cells by the mammalian
immune system) using the dye merocyanine 540, a fluorescent molecule sensitive
to lipid asymmetry of live cells. The minor users will employ the instrument to
3) analyze expression of cell surface molecules controlled by cell type specific
promoters in cellular slime molds to study their developmental regulation, and
4) analyze as preparation for sorting and biochemical analysis of populations of
rod outer segment disks from the mammalian retina as they are processed and
discarded with aging.
