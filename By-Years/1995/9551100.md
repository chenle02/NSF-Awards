This project updates laboratory instruction in geographic techniques. To that
end, the geography curriculum has been revised, strengthening requirements and
providing more structure. One of the goals of this project is to improve spatial
analysis skills of students through the use of a computer-based laboratory
sequence of techniques courses. These courses provide the students with the
technical skills necessary to compete in the work place or in the graduate
school of their choice. The new equipment for this project includes five state-
of-the-art computers and appropriate peripherals and software. This project
allows instruction in the basic areas of map interpretation, remote sensing,
cartography, and GIS to be taught as geographers use these techniques in the
real world.
