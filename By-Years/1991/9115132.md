Among the most impressive strides in astrophysics over the last decade has been
in the area of the physics of compact stars. Part of the reason for these
advances has been the less visible but equally important progress made in the
theory of their internal structure. In the past several years the Principal
Investigator (PI) has been at the forefront of the application of solid-state
theoretical physics to the construction of models of white dwarfs and neutron
stars. This three-year award will provide support for the continued research in
this general area, including a wide variety of topics ranging from neutron
stars, to "brown dwarfs," to giant planets. This work will include research into
the oscillation frequency spectrum (how these objects vibrate) as well as the
"equation of state" in them which permits an estimate of temperature and
pressure in their interiors.
