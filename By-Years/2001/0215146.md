This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project proposes to
develop an integrated software package for the design and optimization of novel
Simulated Moving Bed processes for multi-component separation and purification.
Innovative design methods, simulation software and equipment have been developed
and tested at the laboratory-scale for a number of biological separations,
including amino acids, sugars, a peptide drug, an antibiotic, an anticancer drug
and an antiviral drug. Laboratory data show that the new technology can produce
high purity (>99%) chemicals at high yield (>99%). When compared to conventional
batch chromatography, this technology can increase product yield by 5% to 15%,
increase throughput per bed volume and reduce solvent consumption by an order of
magnitude. During this Phase I Project, new tools for parameter estimation and
cost optimization will be developed and integrated with existing design and
simulation tools. This will result in a user-friendly interface for the
integrated package.

The commercial applications of this project are in the area of recovery and
purification of pharmaceuticals and other biochemicals. The proposed technology
is expected to impact purification costs in a major way, resulting in annual
savings of several million dollars per product.
