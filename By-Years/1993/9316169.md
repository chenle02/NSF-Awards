9316169 Bird This project will utilize a large data base on faults,
displacements, rotations and stress directions for further developing improved
models for the evolution of North America since 85 Ma. These data will be
reduced to tables with attached references, uncertainties and digitised map
locations and will be the basis for a number of finite elements models, so as to
constrain a number of important variables such as selection of the most
appropriate rheology for the lithosphere and the accurate closure of the plate
loop to model the gradual formation of the San Andreas transform during the
Neogene. Results will provide a detailed forward model of the development of
North America during the Cenozoic.
