9402895 Komanduri The award is for the development of an integrated approach to
the design of equipment for precision finishing of advanced ceramics and glasses
based on the magnetic field assisted polishing technique. Experimental and
analytical approaches will be taken to develop the science base for the design,
construction, and optimization of the equipment used for the polishing. Finite-
element based techniques will be used to help select specific magnetic field
configurations, and optimization of process parameters will be based on studies
of relationships between process parameters and various measures of process
performance. A database relating process parameters and process performance will
be developed. The finishing techniques to be developed here can be used
successfully for efficient finishing of a variety of materials both magnetic and
non-magnetic, as material removal rates are at least an order of magnitude
higher than conventional polishing techniques. The analytical techniques
developed here will facilitate design and optimization of the equipment without
reliance on trial and error as is currently the case.
