IBN: 9634401 PI: Hiromoto Specific functional areas of the brain can contain
100,000 to 1 million neurons. When trying to model functional aspects of these
neural networks it is critically important that the model is of a sufficiently
large scale (greater than 1,000 neurons) to examine emergent properties of the
network. Large-scale biophysical neural networks on the order of 10,000 neurons
require efficient computational resources that are beyond the normal scope of
single high-speed computer workstations. Advances in interprocessor
communications and algorithms for computing large-scale problems now permit us
to apply these methods to neurophysiological questions. In this work, we intend
to develop tools that can be used to investigate how networks of biophysical
models of neurons behave based on known anatomical connectivity, cellular
neurophysiology, and rules for synaptic plasticity. Our project has two specific
aims. First, we will develop algorithms and supporting software that exploit the
inherent properties of parallel computational architectures for simulating the
synchronous activity of neuron models interconnected by synapses that undergo
activity-dependent changes in strength. Such changes may accompany learning. The
simulator developed here will be user-modifiable at many levels allowing for the
study of different brain regions having varied anatomical and physiological
characteristics. Second, graphic visualization tools will be developed to better
study and analyze the large amounts of data produced by the large-scale neural
simulations. These will include methods to examine the states of individual
neurons as well as the correlated activity of different neurons within the
network.
