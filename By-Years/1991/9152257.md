This project develops a laboratory to accompany a senior lecture course, Natural
Gas Engineering. The lecture course contains information on gas properties, flow
measurements, and gas processing. The laboratory course contains eight
experiments designed to help students have a better understanding of the natural
gas properties and operations: (1) diaphragm meter, (2) gas gavity
determination, (3) gas viscosity, (4) gas chromatograph, (5) retrograde
condensation, (6) equillibrium constants, (7) hydrates formation, and (8)
permeability reduction due to retrogade condensates. The new equipment obtained
includes a gas chromatograph, sampling valve, Ruska pump and a reactor.
