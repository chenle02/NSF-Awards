Algebraic geometry is the study of solutions of polynomial equations, with many
applications in other parts of mathematics, physics, and engineering. Some of
the well-studied objects in algebraic geometry are the projective plane (the
plane with additional "points at infinity") and curves on it. A natural question
is that of finding the number of curves that satisfy certain special conditions,
such as passing through fixed points or having special shapes, which was the
starting point of a branch of algebraic geometry called enumerative geometry.
During the past twenty years, the interaction between enumerative geometry and
string theory in physics has resulted in many exciting new developments and has
been a central area of current research. This research project aims to define
and study new invariants, in a broader sense on general algebraic surfaces, that
have connections to both mathematics and physics. These invariants contain
sophisticated information about the number of singular curves, the geometric
properties of the surface, and the parametrization space of singular curves. The
project envisages development of a theoretical framework and tools for
computation, as well as establishing connections between different subjects in
mathematics. It will add to the understanding of geometry of algebraic varieties
and has application to the description of spacetime in string theory.

This research project treats several problems in algebraic geometry, especially
about the enumeration of singular curves on algebraic surfaces and its motivic
generalization. Previous work has established that the numbers of varieties with
certain given singularities satisfy universal formulas. This project concerns
the generalization of these universal formulas in the motivic sense. The
research defines a sequence of motivic invariants and studies their quantitative
properties as well as their geometric interpretation. The work aims to extend
the existing connections with Gromov-Witten theory, stable pairs theory, and
modular forms for these new invariants, and to compare them with other motivic
curve-counting invariants. One of the advantages of these new invariants is that
they satisfy nice formulas and only depend on topological intersection numbers.
