The study of hybridization is important in evolutionary biology because it
reveals the forces at work in the final stages of speciation. Some populations
of animal species commonly hybridize, but it is usually difficult if not
impossible to determine the causes hybridization in nature. The proposed
research takes advantage of an exceptionally favorable situation for
investigating the causes of hybridization and the reasons for relatively high
fitness of the hybrids. On the small island of Daphne Major in the Galapagos
archipelago the medium ground finch, Geospza fortis, occasionally interbreeds
with two others; G. scandens, a resident species, and G. fuliginosa, an
immigrant. Pedigree analysis has shown that hybrids may survive and breed as
well or better than the parental species, over several years. Ecological reasons
for their fitness will be investigated by intensive study of feeding
efficiencies and diets. Possible advantages arising from enhanced heterozygosity
will be assessed by an analysis of inbreeding effects in the G. fortis and G.
scandens populations. Causes of interbreeding will be identified by statistical
analysis of mating patterns. Results will be of theoretical importance to our
understanding of speciation and the role of hybridization in maintaining genetic
variation in small and potentially endangered populations.
