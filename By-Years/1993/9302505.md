This award supports the research of Professor Savage to work in combinatorics.
One of the fundamental problems in the area of combinatorial algorithms is that
of efficiently generating items in a particular class in such a way that each
item is generated exactly once. Asymptotic improvement in the efficiency of
combinatorial generation requires not only good data structures and algorithm
design techniques, but more often, some new insight into the structure of the
combinatorial class involved. These structure questions are in the realm of
well-known open problems in discrete mathematics, graph theory, group theory,
and combinatorics. It is these type of problems that Professor Savage will
address. The research is in the general area of combinatorics. Combinatorics
attempts to find efficient methods to study how discrete collections can be
organized. The behavior of discrete systems is extremely important to modern
communications. For example, the design of large networks, as in telephone
systems, and the design of algorithms in computer science all deal with discrete
objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research.
