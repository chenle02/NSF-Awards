This project has two parts. First research will be completed on the existence
of solutions of the nonlinear Boltzmann-Fokker-Planck equation and its
linearization about equilibrium in the physically relevant Li-space setting.
Second, the inverse scattering problem for the 3-d non-spherically symmetric
Schrodinger equation will be considered in the form of a Riemann-Hilbert
problem. In particular, the principal investigator will prove the existence of a
Wiener-Hopf factorization of its "symbol," determine the nature of the partial
indices specifying the Fredholm properties of the problem, and express the
solutions in terms of the factors. In addition, the connection of this method to
the Newton-Marchenko method and other alternative approaches will also be
studied.//
