The proton is one of the building blocks of everyday matter, with protons in the
core of every atom. The proton is in turn made of subnuclear particles known as
quarks and gluons. The project supported by this award will improve our
understanding of the proton's internal structure, with a focus on the dynamical
behavior of the constituent quarks. High-energy particle accelerator facilities
at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) will be used to perform the
research. A beam of protons will be accelerated to high energy and strike a
liquid hydrogen target; the nucleus of a hydrogen atom is comprised of a single
proton. Measurement of the particles produced in the collisions will provide
information on the behavior of the quarks in their parent
protons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The efforts supported by this award will
additionally serve to increase diversity among young scientists trained as
nuclear physicists. Training the next generation of nuclear physicists is
critical to maintain expertise relevant to the nation's energy and defense needs
and to continue advancing both applied and non-applied research in nuclear
physics and technology. In each year of this award a student from Mount Holyoke
College, an undergraduate institution for women, will be given the opportunity
to perform summer research in nuclear physics at Fermilab. Furthermore, this
award will provide tuition, salary, and travel support for an African-American
graduate student. In addition to supporting his dissertation research, he will
receive support to travel once per semester to his alma mater, Howard
University, a historically black university, to speak with current physics
undergraduates about his experience and progress pursuing a Ph.D. in nuclear
physics.
