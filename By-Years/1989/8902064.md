Mississippi's revised proposal to NSF describes a Program Plan designed to
increase the competitiveness of selected research scientists in the State over a
three year period with a goal of attaining or exceeding the threshold of
national competitiveness. Reviews were conducted to evaluate the scientific
merit and potential for achieving national competitiveness for the principal
investigators and their associates. The revised plan includes 6 components (5
approved herein) in the areas of Chemistry/Materials Science. These components
represent investigators in Mississippi's four largest universities (Jackson
State University, Mississippi State University, The University of Mississippi,
and The University of Southern Mississippi) and the University of Mississippi
Medical Center. The component proposals incorporate various mechanisms to remove
identified barriers to research, including the acquisition of critical equipment
or facilities, addition of technical support personnel, increased faculty
release time, an reduction of professional isolation. Mississippi proposes cost
sharing in a ratio of about 3/1. A management plan (amended) is outlined which
will permit monitoring component project progress to ensure that NSF goals and
the goals of the Mississippi Program Plan are achieved.
