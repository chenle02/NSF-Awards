The Fort Worth Museum of Science and History proposes to develop a 5,000 sq ft
traveling exhibition, along with educational material and programs. Motivated by
the challenge of solving a crime, visitors will become engaged in a scientific
investigation that cuts across the multiple disciplines of forensic science.
This project builds upon the successful implementation of "Whodunit? The Science
of Solving Crime," funded by a prior NSF grant (ESI-9253370).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed exhibition will travel to the member
institutions of the Science Museum Exhibit Collaborative, where the primary
target audiences will be children in the upper elementary and middle school
years. The proposed 12-month planning grant would enable research, front-end
evaluation, project team meetings, and the development of a conceptual plan and
a business plan for the new exhibition beginning. The Museum will develop
specific plans to reach underserved audiences and to examine the feasibility of
creating a version for small science centers.&lt;br/&gt;
