9504054 Poggio The research project consists of three parts. First, the
investigator plans to sharpen the tools to analyze the sample complexity
question -- how many examples does the learner need to generalize well? This is
related to the complexity of the model the learner is using to fit the data and
generalize to unseen data. Implications for model selection and data mining will
be explored. Second, it is proposed to develop active algorithms which choose
their own examples. This reduces the sample complexity of learning at the cost
of an increased computational burden. Access to high performance computing will
help greatly. Applications to function approximation, pattern classification and
system identification will be explored. Finally, the tools developed earlier
will be applied to the domain of natural languages. In particular, the sample
complexity of learning grammar will be investigated. At the same time the
evolution of human languages can be modeled as a dynamical system. This can be
used as an evolutionary criterion to choose between different linguistic
theories (models). ***
