Intellectual Merit: The Nanoelectronic Devices for Defense & Security (NANO-DDS)
Conference is a bi-annual science and technology event which has been organized
for the purpose of reviewing the evolving research and development (R&D)
activities in the arena of nanoelectronic devices that have direct relevance to
critical capability needs for national defense & security in the future. The
charter of this special conference is to unify and focus the very broad array of
nanoelectronic and supporting nanotechnology activities that are currently
engaged in reaching the long expected applications payoffs in core defense and
security related areas such as sensing, data processing, computation and
communications.

Broader Impacts: The inherent multidisciplinary nature of the nanoscale science
& technology (Nano-S&T) field and the potential for impacting high priority
objectives motivate the unique organization of this 2011 conference. The
conference will support participation of many new faculty and graduate students.
