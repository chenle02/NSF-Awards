In the course of developing the world's most efficient manufacturing sector,
U.S. management has relied increasingly on beliefs and practices which are
proving to be less well adapted to post-1980 requirements for regaining
international competitiveness. The objective of this research is to undertake an
intensive exploration of the management development policies, practices and
results in five major Japanese companies as the basis for comparison with five
major U.S. firms in similar industries. Field work for the Japanese portion of
this exploratory project has been completed. This project will carry out the
U.S. complementary part of this undertaking. Given the urgent need for better
understanding of the core issues underlying our county's decline in
manufacturing competitiveness, this study is not only timely but should
contribute a unique and very well respected perspective to the knowledge base in
technology management.
