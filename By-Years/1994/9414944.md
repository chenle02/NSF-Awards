The Chemistry Department at Mississippi State University will utilize NSF
support for the renovation of more than 18,000 square feet in the first phase of
a three stage process to improve research and research training laboratories.
This first component of an overall $11 million dollar building renovation
project will benefit 115 researchers including undergraduate researchers
participating in an NSF-REU site award. The NSF-supported laboratory activity
will increase bench and hood space through space reconfiguration; enhance
safety; and expand laboratory opportunities for the disabled. Subsequent MSU
renovation work will address instructional facilities and the balance of
research space within the Hand Laboratory building. The structure is 30 years
old and has never been renovated; through partnership with NSF, 14 research
laboratories will be impacted, and the building's HVAC system will be replaced.
This initial activity will take two years and will enable Mississippi State to
operate a nationally-competitive MS/Ph.D. research program with specific
emphasis on chemical studies leading to the development of advanced composite
materials and to the reduction of contaminants in soils. It will also be
important to the department's commitment to increase minority participation in
research activities within the Chemistry department.
