This award will support continued UV and visible solar irradiance observations
at Barrow, Alaska, and Summit, Greenland, until 31 May 2009, and subsequent
processing of fully calibrated data for submission to the World Ozone and
Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre (WOUDC) and the Cooperative Arctic Data and
Information Service (CADIS) of the Arctic Observing Network (AON). The
observations will maintain unbroken records of fully calibrated UV and visible
solar irradiance data at Barrow, where data acquisition began in 1990, and at
Summit, where data acquisition began in 2004. Submission of data to the data
centers will ensure that they are freely and openly available to the scientific
community and other interested parties. The Barrow and Summit observing sites
are part of the NSF Ultraviolet Spectral Irradiance Monitoring Network (UVSIMN)
that has supported research into the effects of stratospheric ozone depletion
and other climatic factors on UV radiation at the Earth's surface, and
consequences for aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, and people. The broader
impacts include the provision of data to educators, researchers, and policy
makers, for example through continued contributions to assessment reports.
