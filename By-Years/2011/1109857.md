Dr. Blake and his team study the chemistry and physics of the innermost regions
(0.5-50 AU) of very young circumstellar disks. The project uses of ground-based
(Keck-NIRSPEC, VLT-CRIRES, Gemini-MICHELLE) spectroscopy and spectro-astrometry
of accretion disks. The rovibrational line emissions of the molecules CO, HCN,
C2H2, H2O, OH, and other molecules are used to constrain the physical and
chemical structure and evolution of the protoplanetary disks' inner regions.
These observations are interpreted with 2D (axisymetric) and 3D radiative
transfer models. In order to derive accurate molecular abundances, the group
will extend their radiative transfer codes to generate non-local thermodynamic
equilibrium level populations relevant for IR transitions. Further studies are
planned for the outer disks using far IR and submm lines from Herschel and
potentially ALMA. The project provides training for a PhD student and postdoc.
