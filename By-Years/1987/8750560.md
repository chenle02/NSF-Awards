This Department has initiated a series of courses with emphasis in
Biotechnology. The new fermentation equipment purchased through this grant is
making it possible to offer laboratory components of these courses. One
7.5-liter fermenter and two 2-liter fermenters are updating and supplementing
existing equipment used in the Biotechnology- related courses, allowing
introduction of current fermentation and chemical engineering techniques. This
equipment also will be made available to students conducting undergraduate
research. The new equipment helps students acquire hands-on experience with
scientific equipment they may encounter as they go on to advanced studies or to
employment in Microbiology-, Biology- or Chemistry-based careers.
