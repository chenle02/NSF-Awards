The ClassAction project is developing a model for interactive classroom
materials for formative assessment and rapid student feedback in introductory
college science courses. Taking the form of carefully crafted multiple-choice
questions in electronic databases, the formative assessment items are
specifically designed for student voting that promote collaborative discussion.
Based on student misconceptions research, they are designed to allow rapid and
reliable formative assessment of student learning in large classrooms equipped
with electronic personal response systems. The questions are illustrated
visually with animations and simulations and are dynamic in that instructors can
easily transform them into alternative representations. Considerable background
instructional resources are included in each module to allow instructors to
provide feedback. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Initially set in the context of
introductory astronomy for non-science majors, the questions target common
student misconceptions that have proven difficult to overturn. The materials are
designed using a learning cycle approach to encourage students to elicit,
confront, and resolve their misconceptions. These efforts effectively balance
research informed pedagogy and creativity. The ClassAction project has
considerable impact on the way in which formative assessment is used to improve
astronomy instruction and the underlying design is easily transferable to other
disciplines. The database infrastructure and created materials are being widely
disseminated throughout the science education community. &lt;br/&gt;
