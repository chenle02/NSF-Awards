Dr. David F. Kelley is supported by a grant from The Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to perform time-resolved studies of reaction intermediates
which are isolated in low temperature Argon matrices. This research will provide
a more fundamental understanding of the physical process of chemical reaction.
Two areas of research will be explored: 1) studies of photo-induced bimolecular
cycloaddition reactions of aromatics and aromatic olefins, and 2) studies of
intermolecular excited state proton transfer. In both cases the species to be
studied will be formed in a molecular jet expansion and trapped in a matrix of
condensed argon carrier gas. Reaction intermediates will be studied by
picosecond emission, two color laser induced fluorescence and absorption
spectroscopies. A variety of allowed ?2+2! and ?4+4! addition reactions will be
studied with reactants chosen to facilitate unambiguous assignment of the
intermediate transient spectra. The studies of intermolecular excited state
proton transfer reactions will elucidate the effects of solvation on proton
transfer rates. For these experiments proton donors will include phenol, alpha-
and beta-napthols, and their nitro-substituted derivatives, while solvents will
include water, ammonia and alcohols.
