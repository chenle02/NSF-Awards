This award funds the first year base amount of a five-year Presidential Young
Investigator Award. The research aims to develop algorithms for image
manipulation, including new techniques for image reconstruction, antialiasing,
and generalized image warping. This investigation is developing and evaluating
new nonlinear algorithms for image reconstruction which are efficient, amenable
to hardware implementation, and superior to popular techniques of equivalent
cost. Such algorithms play an important role in warping systems. The research
also investigates the role of image warping in scientific visualization, and
examines the consequences of separable image warping for elastic matching in
object recognition//
