General Audience Summary

This project will support participation of US scholars in the international
conference, "Science and Power, Science as Power," the 7th International
Conference of the European Society for the History of Science, to be held at
Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic. The goal of the conference is to
bring international scholars together to advance scholarly efforts concerning
two intertwining themes, how the nature of science and the nature of power have
shifted historically, and how the relationship between science and power as
itself changed over time. The outcomes of this conference will include promotion
of international intellectual interchange, scholarship, and broad dissemination.
The grant will promote US scholars' contributions in this exploration, with
particular attention to supporting graduate students and independent scholars.

Technical Summary

The grant will support eight US participants including three PhD students, an
independent scholar, junior scholars, and scholars from underrepresented groups
(including women). All of the participants and the principal investigator are
scheduled to present in sessions at the conference. The conference theme
focusing on power is intended to attract scholars from underrepresented groups
in the fields of History of Science, Technology, and Medicine; this is
particularly so for those who are situated in the European "periphery." With the
cooperation of the international Commission on Women and Gender Studies, which
is independent of European Society for History of Science, two conference
sessions focusing on women, gender and science have successfully been included
on the program, and several of the US participants are indeed participating in
those sessions.
