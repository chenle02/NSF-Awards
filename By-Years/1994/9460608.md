This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate a low-
cost thermal process for commercially producing nano-alloys. Nano-alloys are a
broad new class of nonequilibrium materials with unprecedented microstructures
(and novel properties) that have been artificially modulated in zero to three
dimensions on scales less than 100 nm. These materials are gaining much
attention owing to their considerable commercial potential both in monolithic
materials and in device applications. The ultimate realization of the commercial
potential and the rate at which the applications develop significantly depends
on the availability and the price of nano-alloys. This in turn depends on the
development of an economical process to produce nano-alloys in commercially
viable quantities. Nanomaterials Research Corporation proposes to demonstrate
such a process. The program's technical approach is to synthesize nano-alloys by
controlled particulate growth in a proprietary venturi reactor followed by
adiabatic termination of the growth process. The significant advantages of such
a route are: continuous production, robust process control, higher yield and
selectivity, minimal energy costs and product-flexibility. They expect to
establish the proof-of-concept of the process during Phase I (their focus: TiFe
and MgNi), optimize the process and commercialize a wide range of nano-alloys in
research/test quantities during Phase II, and during Phase III, commercialize
nano-alloys in bulk quantities.
