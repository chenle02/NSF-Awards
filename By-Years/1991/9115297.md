Molecular theory will be applied to the thermodynamics of adsorption in porous
and heterogeneous solids. This work will improve the fundamental thermodynamic
basis for separations based upon selective adsorption form fluid mixtures.
Particular emphasis is placed upon bridging the gap between recent developments
in statistical mechanics and engineering applications. The two major thrusts
are: 1) development of analytic expressions for adsorption equilibrium in porous
solids and 2) the development of models for the influence of microstructure upon
adsorption in heterogeneous solids such as silica gel and activated carbon.
Analytic solutions of one- dimensional models will be used to analyze
assumptions built into existing adsorption models and will provide a basis for
improving them. Monte Carlo simulations of detailed three- dimensional molecular
models will be used to determine the effect of microstructure of the adsorbent
on the adsorption equilibrium.
