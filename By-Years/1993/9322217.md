9322217 STERN This award provides funds to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates Site in Experimental Psychology at Pennsylvania State University.
Eight undergraduate students will be selected to work as apprentices with
faculty members who are nationally known for their research and highly
experienced at preparing undergraduates for graduate school. Students will work
full-time for eight weeks in the summer in various subareas of experimental
psychology, including psychophysiology, emotions, perception, cognitive, and
physiological psychology. They will design an independent research project
during the latter part of the summer and complete it with the help of their Penn
State mentor and "home" school memtor during the following academic year. At the
end of the spring semester, they will present their research results at a Penn
State department colloquium. Every effort will be made to encourage and assist
students to gain admission to graduate school. This award contributes to the
Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in
science through active undergraduate research experiences. ***
