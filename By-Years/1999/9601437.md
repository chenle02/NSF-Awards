This is a study of the social construction of the American electricity
industry. It will explore the theory that several defining features of the
industry were not inevitable, and were in fact heavily contested. These include:
l ) separation of the production of generating equipment from that of
electricity; 2) the provision of electricity by central stations, over long
distances, as opposed to small-scale ("isolated") generation in each home and
business; 3) dominance of the industry by investor-owned rather than
municipally-owned companies; 4) the integration of generation, transmission and
distribution in single companies -- in effect, merging wholesale and retail
provision of the product; and 5) the development of huge holding companies,
integrating the provision of electricity by many smaller companies, over large
geographic areas. The research will apply quantitative techniques of analysis to
unexpectedly rich data discovered by the investigators, such as comprehensive
annual and even quarterly directories of all utility companies in North America,
detailed proceedings of the two trade associations' meetings, and as well as
numerous sources on the thousands of individuals who were decision-makers in
this industry. Among the planned analyses are: studies of the evolution of
interlocking directorates over time, coordinated with studies of how the
industry reached its highly concentrated form; analysis of the role of equipment
suppliers, to examine how they became clearly separated from producers of
electricity; investigation of how this industry became a duopoly (General
Electric and Westinghouse); network analysis of individuals in the industry,
through information provided in trade association proceedings and other
biographical sources; study of the movement over time of individuals among
organizations, and how this movement enhanced consensus in the industry and
shaped social networks. %% The aim of this project is to use data on the
development of one particular industry to devel op new ideas about the social
construction of industry boundaries and goals, thus producing a fresh scientific
perspective that can be applied to a wide range of contemporary industries. The
data are probably the most comprehensive available on the inception and
development of any major industry, and the study will therefore make a valuable
contribution to methods and theory in the sociology of industrial organization.
It will provide scientists and industrial leaders with an improved understanding
of the ways that a new industry is shaped not only by technological and economic
constraints, but also by the mobilization of resources by concerned individuals,
operating through their network of colleagues and competitors.
