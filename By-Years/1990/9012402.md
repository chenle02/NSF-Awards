The purpose of this exploratory study is to develop time series data on
aggregate investments in infratechnology in the U.S. and to evaluate the
statistical relationship between these investments and various indices of
technological advancement. In general, changes in research and development (R&D)
expenditures-- which capture direct investments into the scientific base,
generic technologies and proprietary technologies--have long been viewed as an
important indicator of the technological health of our economy. The efficiency
of conducting R&D, however, depends heavily on investments in infratechnologies,
which consist of nonproprietary measurement and test methods, procedures, and
data that support an industry's internal R&D, production and marketing
activities. As such, data on aggregate investments in infratechnology could
represent an important new indicator of the Nation's technological advancement.
This project thereby could contribute to the Foundation's responsibility to
provide for the collection and interpretation of data on scientific and
engineering resources.
