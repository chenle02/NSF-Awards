Theoretical research will be conducted in two unrelated areas: turbulence and
biophysics. The statistics of a passive scalar advected by a turbulent velocity
field will be studied numerically in two dimensions to guide analytic theory
which has formal analogies to the treatment of band edge tails, and propagation
in random gauge fields. Among the experimental issues to be addressed are the
distribution function of the scalar and its derivative at point and the nonzero
value of the derivative skewness in high Reynold's number shear flows. Scalar
transport also arises when the Euler equations are written with Clebsch
variables, a representation that may facilitate understanding why vortex
structures form. In the area of cellular biophysics, the dynamics of voltage
sensitive ion channels will be explored based on similarities with solid state
systems. Specifically frequency dependent response and fluctuations will be
examined for nonequilibrium effects as well as simultaneous passage of several
ions - a sort of Coulomb blockade. The possibility of a collapse transition in a
long loop of negatively supercoiled DNA will be investigated taking proper
account of the thermal fluctuations. %%% Theoretical research in condensed
matter physics will be conducted focussing on two different condensed matter
systems. One system involves turbulence and related phenomena in the flow of
fluids. The other system is biophysical. The elastic properties of proteins and
conduction across biological membranes will be studied.
