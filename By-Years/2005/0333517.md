0333517 Collins&lt;br/&gt;This project is a one year study to initiate
continuous measurements of water properties and velocity at the entrance of the
Gulf of California to understand the processes controlling the exchange of mass
and heat between the Gulf of California and the Pacific Ocean. This is
collaboration with Mexican Scientists at the Universitad Autonoma de Baja
California in Ensenada. Specific scientific objectives include: to determine the
kinematics of the forcing of the Gulf by the Pacific Ocean, to determine the
characteristics of the water masses exchanged between the pacific and the Gulf
of California, and to determine if the circulation yields the fluxes of heat
needed to reproduce the observed warming and cooling of the
Gulf.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: the US Scientists involved in this project will
training their Mexican counterpart and their technical staff in deploying
moorings. The scientific analysis of the data will be done jointly, thus
fostering international collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
