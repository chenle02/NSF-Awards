This work is on the theoretical physics of measurements in quantum mechanical
systems. There are two components to this research. First, light scattering is
used as a method to measure the properties of an atomic system. At the true
quantum level, light arrives at a detector as individual photon counts. Light
scattering in a model system is simulated exactly, and then simulation results
will be used to develop statistical techniques to extract information about the
system even if there are only a few isolated photon counts. In a related issue,
to enable full transfer of quantum mechanical information between light and a
collection of atoms, the atomic sample should ideally be dense and cold. Massive
numerical simulations of light propagation in a cold dense gas have shown that
the current understanding of such systems is flawed. New principles will be
formulated that govern this case. This work is pure basic research, and the
final aim is to help build the science basis for future quantum
technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well
potential is used as a generic example to study light scattering from a material
sample. The light is assumed to be monitored using detectors capable of single-
photon resolution. The quantum mechanics of the joint light-matter-detector
system is solved exactly using quantum trajectory simulations. A Bayesian
inference is developed as a method to extract the maximum possible amount of
information about the atoms from the observed photon counts. The immediate aim
is to devise repeated and correlated photon counting measurements for monitoring
and feedback control of quantum systems. More generally, light scattering is the
method to monitor not only double-well condensates, but also probably the
majority of atomic systems under continuous observation. To reach a resolution
at the level of a single quantum, the sample has to be optically thick. The
potentially high densities and the low temperatures beneficial for quantum
coherence will bring in the possibility of cooperative response of the atoms to
light. Cooperative light-atom interaction using classical-electrodynamics
simulations of light propagation in a medium of point dipoles will be studied.
The objective is to find out how the cooperative response alters the results of
light scattering experiments.
