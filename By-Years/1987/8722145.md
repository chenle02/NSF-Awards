This award will support research on numerical simulation of the seasonal cycle
in an energy balance model under varying boundary conditions, in order to better
define the role of seasonal cycle variations in paleoclimatic changes. Focus is
on a set of numerical sensitivity experiments based upon altered land-ocean
distributions which will enable examination of long term, glacial-interglacial
transitions and associated seasonal cycle variability. This research will
enhance our understanding of how and why climate changes have occurred over the
relatively recent geologic past.
