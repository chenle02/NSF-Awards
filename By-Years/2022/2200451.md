The Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network, a non-profit organization,
has been instrumental in serving as a catalyst to improve the education of
under-represented groups, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics (STEM). This project supports the QEM Talent Development and
Innovation in Sciences (TDIS) Internship Program in providing a research-focused
professional development initiative that places students at the National Science
Foundation as a mechanism to stimulate and support the development of the next-
generation STEM workforce through career exposure and mentoring/guidance for
underrepresented STEM degree-seeking undergraduate and graduate students.
Interns, representing diverse institutions, are exposed to a range of
professional development activities that have direct benefits to them
professionally, as well as indirect benefits to their home institutions and
campus-based peers. The internship program provides personal and professional
skills development to facilitate the internsâ€™ successful pursuit of STEM-focused
advanced degrees and careers. This human capacity building endeavor will help
train a diverse, engaged, and globally competitive STEM workforce prepared to
meet future challenges through discovery and
innovation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The TDIS internship opportunity leverages and
expands the interns' prior learning from school with new experiences from NSF
training and mentoring, as well as QEM professional development engagements.
Interns further develop their research skills; strengthen their awareness and
knowledge of programs, policies, and issues that affect the quality of STEM
education, particularly in low-income communities; and sharpen their awareness
of general STEM-focused policies, legislation, and programs. Interns benefit
from opportunities to engage in research and data analysis; expand their
knowledge of graduate school and STEM career preparation; and gain effective
networking as well as communications (writing, public speaking, and computer)
skills. The program builds on over 30 years of success employing strategies that
make the program valuable including the use of technology and leveraging
relationships with key stakeholders that make the summer experience more
relevant to 21st Century students' professional
growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
