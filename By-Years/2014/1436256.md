Implementation Projects provide support to Historically Black Colleges and
Universities to design, implement, study, and assess comprehensive institutional
efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate degrees in
STEM and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthening STEM
education and research. The award to Harris Stowe State University seeks to
build on previous successful efforts to increase participation of African-
American students in STEM disciplines, including STEM Teacher Education. The
institution seeks to provide students with the academic preparation, as well as
analytical and technical competencies they will need to succeed in graduate
school or STEM careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has three specific
objectives that tie in to the overarching goal: 1) to increase the recruitment
and enrollment of first-year and transfer STEM majors; 2) to increase the
retention and graduation of STEM majors; and 3) to increase student engagement
through faculty development opportunities. A set of evidence-based strategies
and interventions has been designed to achieve these objectives. Through the
evaluation plan the project will address the question: "To what extent can
academic and social integration interventions impact student retention, student
success, student engagement and graduation in STEM disciplines, particularly at
a small Historically Black University?"
