In this project, the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS) is replicating
ENLIST Micros--an implementation model and curriculum that helps science
teachers use microcomputers. This 42-month project has two purposes: 1) to
develop and evaluate three models to replicate teacher- enhancement programs,
and 2) to establish ENLIST Micros at sites throughout the nation. The project
uses two models to replicate ENLIST Micros: 1) a trainer-of-trainers model, and
a dissemination model. Over three years, 12 sites participated in the trainer-
of-trainers model (model 1) and use ENLIST Micros with 750 science teachers. The
BSCS staff also consults with people at 12 sites to help another 750 science
teachers implement educational computing (model 2). Lastly, dissemination
workshops (model 3) present ENLIST Micros to another 100 people, who may work
with 2,000 science teachers. As a result, the project is establishing regional
sites that continue ENLIST Micros without outside support. Those sites are to
improve the use of microcomputers by more than 3,000 science teachers.
Furthermore, we are determining the cost effectiveness of the two models for
disseminating teacher- enhancement projects. An amount equivalent to nearly 193%
of the NSF award is being contributed as cost-sharing.
