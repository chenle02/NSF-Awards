With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Luigi G.
Marzilli, Robert P. Hammer and George G. Stanley, of the Department of Chemistry
at Louisiana State University and A&amp;M College will acquire a 700 MHz NMR
spectrometer equipped with advanced cryoprobe probe technology. The equipment
includes a superconducting 700 MHz magnet system with 5.4 cm bore (field at
16.43 Tesla), and a triple resonance inverse cryoprobe with filters, cooled
preamplifiers for proton and deuterium-lock, and actively shielded Z-gradient.
This instrument will enable the following research projects: a) studies of
Metal-DNA interactions; b) bioanalytical separations using chiral polymers; c)
beta-Sheet propensity of alpha, alpha-disubstituted amino acids; d) aggregation
&amp; association of porphyrin sensitizers; e) NMR studies of tetrapyrrole
systems; f) molecular level investigations of pollutant &amp; membrane
interactions with natural organic matter; and g) in situ NMR studies of a
bimetallic catalyst. Faculty at a number of area institutions (Southern
University, Grambling, Dillard and Xavier) will also have access to the 700MHz
instrument. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of
the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to
characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-
art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier
research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in
environmental chemistry and biochemistry.&lt;br/&gt;
