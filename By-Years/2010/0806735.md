This five year project is a STEM scholarship program called Scholars of
Excellence in Engineering and Computer Science (SEECS). The scholarships support
20 academically promising, financially needy students per year studying in one
of the six majors in the School of Engineering and Computer Science. The
intellectual merit derives from the program structured agenda that supports the
academic, personal, and professional development of scholars. Through group
activities and a Professional Development course, the program enhances the bond
among scholars as a way of increasing retention. In line with the University
commitment to community engagement, the program also includes a service-learning
project that involves the scholar cohort working on a STEM project that meets a
community need. Enrichment activities make students more aware of the role of
STEM professionals and help them develop the social and leadership skills for
their future careers.
