0323430&lt;br/&gt;Driscoll&lt;br/&gt;The proposal describes a set of tools to
enhance the capability of an independent system operator (ISO) to address issues
of security and efficiency. In effect, the ISO is to be provided with tools to
address market equilibrium models and solution methods that include
environmental modeling. The models are based on convex optimization procedures
and on simplified market designs. The work is to proceed along somewhat separate
environmental and power system tracks.
