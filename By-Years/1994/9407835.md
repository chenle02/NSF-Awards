9407835 Coley In tropical rainforest, most predation on plants by herbivores
occurs on young leaves. Rates of damage are 20 times higher than on mature
leaves, and 70% of the lifetime damage takes place during the short period of
leaf expansion. Damage is high because young leaves are tender and rich in
protein. Toughness, the most effective defense, is not possible during leaf
expansion. This suggests that other defenses, including secondary chemical
metabolites, may be particularly important in young leaves. Theoretical
considerations of sequestration, reclamation and turnover rates of compounds
also suggest that young leaves should contain a diversity of chemical defenses.
However, previous studies that quantified total phenolic or tannin
concentrations were unable to explain variation among species in rates of
herbivory. Thus a more detailed perspective of chemical defense in young leaves
is needed in order fully to understand plant-herbivore interactions in the
tropics. The PI proposes to examine the secondary metabolites in young leaves by
isolating and identifying as many compounds as possible from each of a few
species. The deterrent or toxic activity of isolated compounds will be tested
using a suite of natural enemies ranging from viruses, bacteria and fungi to
insects. These sophisticated chemical analyses will allow the PI to address a
variety of ecological and evolutionary questions about plant-herbivore
interactions, including: 1) are current theories correct in predicting a great
diversity of secondary metabolites in young leaves? 2) Why does a single species
have a variety of secondary metabolites? Is it an adaptive response to the
occurrence of a diversity of natural enemies? 3) It has been argued that
synthesis of secondary metabolites may be physiologically incompatible with
another major defense of young leaves, namely rapid expansion to shorten the
period of vulnerability. The data gathered in this study will shed much light on
all these intriguing ecologi cal problems.
