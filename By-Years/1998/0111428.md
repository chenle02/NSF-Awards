This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports research by Professor Vincent L. Pecoraro at the University of Michigan
on the synthesis of metallomacrocyclic complexes, which utilize metal ions as
part of a cyclic structure surrounding a central metal ion. Goals include the
preparation of chiral metallacrown complexes, selective recognition of chiral
guest molecules by metallacrown complexes and the modular synthesis of chiral
solids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Chiral or asymmetric molecules occur naturally in
biology and are also important in new drug synthesis where molecules of
different chiralities must be quantatively prepared. This research focuses on
creating molecular recognition agents that may be employed in new methods for
the separation of chiral molecules.&lt;br/&gt;
