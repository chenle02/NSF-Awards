The award is for support of the 56th annual meeting of the American
Malacological Union to be held from 3 - 7 June 1990 at the Marine Laboratory
(MBL) in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. A special symposium on neuroscience and
behavior is planned for which support is awarded. This symposium will be well
attended and several out standing scientist in the field of evolutionary aspects
of integrative neuroscience have been invited. The symposium should be important
in synthesising much of the current knowledge in this area as it relates to
primitive neuronal networks involved in behavior.
