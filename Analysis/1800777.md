Dynamical systems play an important role in all the sciences. They occur as
models for predator and prey populations, orbits of planets and weather
conditions. Some of the dynamical systems that are easiest to state are obtained
by the iteration of a single map, viewed as a function from the real line to the
real line, or from the complex plane to the complex plane. More recently
researchers in physical sciences have been interested in models given by higher
dimensional mappings. In the complex setting one can make use of complex
analytic and geometric tools that are not available in the real one.

The aim of this project is to describe the dynamics of a complex analytic map
from a space of several variables to itself in the presence of a fixed point
that is parabolic. The local study of holomorphic maps close to a fixed point is
well understood (although not complete) in one complex dynamics. In several
dimensions however, the situation becomes much more complicated. The PI will
also focus on global dynamics in this setting and investigate the possible
behaviors of orbits and their relation with multipliers at fixed points.
Finally, the PI will explore applications of summability theory in the context
of parabolic maps in several dimensions.
