Evidence supports the following view of meiotic recombination in yeast: Double-
strand-break repair is governed by two pathways, which are distinguished by the
products of resolution of their repair intermediates. One pathway (Type I)
yields the crossover and noncrossover resolution types expected from the cutting
of both Holliday junctions of the intermediate. The other pathway (Type II)
yields only one of the two types of crossover resolution that could arise from
cutting DNA strands in the intermediate, along with a single noncrossover type
that appears to arise without strand cutting. Crossover resolution of Type II
intermediates depends on a set of proteins demonstrably required for crossover
interference. Crossover resolution of Type I intermediates occurs independently
of these proteins, and Type I crossovers display little or no interference.
These studies of interference in yeast, which are expected to yield findings
applicable to mammals and green plants as well, promise to provide an
explanation for documented differences in crossing-over in yeast as compared
with Drosophila. In so doing, they will enhance our understanding of meiosis, an
essential feature of sexual reproduction. Understanding this basic biological
process will enable biologists to develop better solutions to many of society's
most pressing problems
