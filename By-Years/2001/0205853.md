With a number of upgrades coming to the Arecibo Observatory telescope of the
National Astronomy and Ionospheric Center in the next year, the Observatory is
poised to carry out a large-scale deep survey for new pulsars. Current estimates
are that about 1000 new pulsars will be discovered. The system will have high
sensitivity to the fastest pulsars and to compact binaries with orbital periods
less than a few hours and with every possible kind of companion including black
holes. There are implications for detailed modeling of the magnetic field and
ionic distribution in our Galaxy, defining the Galaxy's spiral arms, and
gravitational wave studies of compact binaries. This project will lay the
groundwork for the survey through a survey design and pilot observations,
developing data processing software, and investigating radio frequency
interference mitigation techniques. ***
