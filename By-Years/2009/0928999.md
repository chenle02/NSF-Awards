0928999&lt;br/&gt;Andrei Shkel&lt;br/&gt;University of California,
Irvine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to investigate a
new class of inertial instruments relying on inertial properties of atoms.
Specifically, work will be made to investigate how the precession of spin-
polarized nuclei of Rb and Xn isotopes ?caged? in a small volume can encode and
carry inertial information about rotation of objects. It is estimated that the
proposed technology will achieve performance levels comparable to state-of-the
art conventional gyroscopes, but at a fraction of their cost. Several
fundamental challenges will be addressed in the project, including the
feasibility of operating an atomic gyroscope with a miniature cell, magnetic
field uniformity in microfabricated coils, effects of assembly and fabrication
imperfections, methods for wafer-level filling of alkali metal vapor and noble
gases, development of miniature non-magnetic heaters, and the effect of cell
shape and buffer gases on the nuclear relaxation time. This research is expected
to advance scientific knowledge in the areas of innovative sensing concepts,
signal processing, and system-level implementation. This highly
multidisciplinary project will provide unique educational experience for
undergraduate and graduate students through team collaborations. High school
students will also participate in this project through unique summer
internships.&lt;br/&gt;
