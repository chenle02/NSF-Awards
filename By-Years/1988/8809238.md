A number of problems in computational complexity and pseudorandomness are being
investigated, using new extensions of Lebesgue measure theory and the Baire
category method as tools. These techniques, recently developed by the principal
investigator, assign probabilistic and topological "sizes" to subsets of
complexity classes. This approach, which has already revealed new, quantitative
information about the structure of these classes, is being used to investigate:
(1) relationships between uniform and nonuniform complexity, with particular
emphasis on circuit-size and program-size complexities; (2) quantitative
relationships between the "span" of (i.e., the set of problems efficiently
reducible to) a problem and its complexity properties, including approximation,
complexity cores, and hard instances; (3) theoretical aspects of
pseudorandomness; and (4) the adequacy of pseudorandom sources for efficient
randomized algorithms. The complexity-theoretic measure and category methods
themselves are being refined, strengthened, and extended to a wider variety of
classes.
