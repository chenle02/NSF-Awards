9511999 Meadows This grant supports research in elementary-particle physics by
two faculty members, a postdoctoral research associate and 3 graduate students.
They study the properties of charm particles, analyzing data from an experiment
at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and one planned to be done at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. For the latter they contribute to detector
instrumentation development and fabrication preparing for experimental
operations in two or three years. They also are developing reconstruction and
analysis software. ***
