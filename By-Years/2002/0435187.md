A national partnership involving research and teaching institutions, a minority
serving institution, community-based organizations, and high performance
computing centers at the state and national level is providing stewardship for
high-quality, effective computational science educational materials. Primary
activities of this NSDL Pathways project include evaluating, modifying,
collecting, tagging, and (where rights can be obtained) archiving the best of
the growing body of computational model based materials that are available on
the Web. The project is also providing: 1) mechanisms for NSDL users, content
creators, and collection maintainers to add to and annotate the collection; 2)
an outlet for peer reviewed publication for content creators; 3) training and
technical assistance to collection maintainers; and 4) an infrastructure for
educators to bind disparate learning objects into functional units tied to state
and national standards. The initial audiences for the Computational Science
Education Reference Desk are undergraduate faculty and their students, both
future scientists and engineers and future teachers. The project also expects to
have a direct impact on in-service teachers and their students in intermediate
and secondary schools, as well as life-long learners.
