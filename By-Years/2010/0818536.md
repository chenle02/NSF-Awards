This project is concerned with how the human visual system is able to maintain
an up-to-date representation of the world when the world and the position of the
person in the world are constantly changing. Consider, for example, a driver on
a busy street. As the car moves down the road, new objects come into view and
other objects go out of view. At the same time, objects out it the world, such
as pedestrians and other vehicles, are independently changing course. This
example highlights how critical it is that visual information be dynamically
updated. This project will test the hypothesis that the updating process is
guided by the viewer's current interpretation of what objects are out in the
world and where they are relative to each other. The implication is that the
updating process is active and viewer dependent.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the dynamic process of representational
updating can facilitate the design of human-machine interfaces, roadways, and
other artifacts by allowing designers to take into account the strengths and
weaknesses of human visual processing. Knowing how the visual representations
are updated can also guide educational programs for drivers, lifeguards, air
traffic controllers, heavy machine operators, airport security screeners, and
others who rely on careful scrutiny of a visual environment.
