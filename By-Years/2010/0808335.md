CBET-0808335&lt;br/&gt;Zoski&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this 4 day-
workshop on electrocatalysis is to develop approaches and guidelines,
experimental and theoretical, to aid in the discovery of new electrocatalysts,
especially those for technologically important reactions (like oxygen reduction
and water oxidation) and to obtain a better understanding of the reaction
mechanisms. It will bring together scientists and engineers in this field
working on theory [e.g. density functional theory (DFT)], in situ catalyst
surface characterization, biomimetic and combinatorial approaches to
electrocatalyst synthesis, and reaction mechanism determination.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. Interactions among theoreticians and
experimentalists in both formal and informal settings will generate a better
understanding of electrocatalyst materials, as well as new ideas, in this
important area of research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. This workshop
will facilitate interactions between scientists with broad and complementary
research interests in the area of electrocatalysis who would normally not have
the opportunity to meet. Such exchanges and new interactions can lead to
important advances in energy related-science, particularly in the development of
alternative, cleaner, and more efficient energy technologies.
