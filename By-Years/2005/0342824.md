With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of North Texas will
acquire a computer cluster. This equipment will enhance research in a number of
areas including a) reaction kinetics of gas-phase radicals; b) electronic
properties of conducting polymers; c) detailed mechanisms of organic reactions;
d) bonding and reactions at surfaces; e) development of electron correlation
methodology; e) rational design of metal catalysts for organic synthesis; and g)
modeling of luminescent materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A cluster of fast,
modern computer workstations is vital to serving the computing needs of active
research departments. Such a "computer network" also serves as a development
environment for new theoretical codes and algorithms, provides state-of-the-art
graphics and visualization facilities, and supports research in state-of-the-art
applications of parallel processing. These studies will have a significant
impact in a wide number of areas, including materials science and synthetic
organic chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
