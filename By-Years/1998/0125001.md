This award will provide support for graduate students and
junior&lt;br/&gt;investigators to attend the Gordon Conference entitled, "QCD
in&lt;br/&gt;Extreme Conditions: High Temperature, High Density and small x."
&lt;br/&gt;The conference will focus on issues relevant to heavy ion
physics,&lt;br/&gt;taking advantage of results from the first experimental run
at the&lt;br/&gt;Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven
National&lt;br/&gt;Laboratory. Approximately 20 speakers (divided roughly
between&lt;br/&gt;experiment and theory) have been invited according to
their&lt;br/&gt;expertise and leadership in the field.
