Abstract ATM-9528051 Allen J. Riordan, Steven Koch, and Gerald Watson North
Carolina State University UNIDATA: Equipment for UNIDATA-Supported Teaching and
Research in Meteorology. Funds will provide the necessary hardware that shall
permit North Carolina State University (NCSU) continued participation in the
Internet Data Distribution (IDD) system. This allows access to new data
including model simulations, GOES-8, and local sensor input. The upgraded
equipment allows access to meteorological information for ongoing research and
educational programs.
