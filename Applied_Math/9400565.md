Gao 9400565 Based on the complementarity theory developed by Gao- Strang in
1988-89, the objective of this proposed research is to offer a comprehensive
study on the duality theory in nonsmooth mechanics and the related numerical
methods for finite deformation systems. Topics will include: (1) Nonsmooth
plastic flow and structural limit analysis; (2) Nonlinear buckling analysis for
plates and shells; (3) Control problems and optimal design of smart materials
and structures; (4) Complementary finite element method for nonsmooth
optimization. Finite deformation nonsmooth mechanics has been found more and
more important applications in smart structural analysis, civil and aerospace
engineering. Direct method for solving nonlinear and nonsmooth systems has
always presented serious difficulties for mathematicians and engineers. The dual
approach andcomplementary finite element method, however, possess a great of
advantages. We can expect that the results of this proposed research will
provide new insight to the nonsmooth mechanics, variational methods, finite
deformation theory, nonlinear optimization theory and numerical methods.
