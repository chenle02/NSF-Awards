This project will support the creation of an undergraduate computer
graphics/dynamics laboratory at Boston University for students in elementary
calculus courses. It is being funded under the Instrumentation and Laboratory
Improvement (ILI) Program, which has the stated goal of improving "the quality
of the undergraduate curriculum by supporting projects to develop new or
improved instrument-based undergraduate laboratory and/or field courses in
science, mathematics, or engineering." This laboratory will expose students to
some mathematical topics of current interest in the area of dynamical systems
and will add an experimental component to the traditional calculus course.
