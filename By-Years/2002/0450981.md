This Small Business Innovative Research Phase II project will demonstrate
practical and cost-effective designs for a high energy density Proton Exchange
Membrane (PEM) Fuel Cell. The approach taken will utilize the treatment of
membranes with Interpenetrating Polymer Networks (IPN), as demonstrated in Phase
I, to create regions with enhanced strength and the desired ionic, reactant and
water transport properties for a viable Segmented Fuel capable of operating with
ambient diffused oxygen for portable applications. A systematic modeling
procedure will be developed to generate optimal, thermally and hydraulically
stable segmented fuel cell designs, with specific electrode arrays, given
voltage, and power requirements. Size/weight trade-offs will be
considered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work supports the effort to develop fuel
cells for portable consumer and industrial power which is safe, durable and
energy efficient. PEM based fuel cells are a mature technology which takes
advantage of very simple chemistry and the introduction of the GES IPN-improved
membranes will permit designers greater flexibility in producing fuel cells
which meet the needs for portable computers, tools, communication, medical and
industrial equipment.
