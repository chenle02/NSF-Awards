The evolutionary development of bipedal stance, which freed the hands from
locomotion, is considered a fundamental distinction between humans and our
closest relatives. Accompanying that development was an increase in instability
of the body. Engineered devices such as cars and robots typically solve the
stability problem by having a wide base of support and/or having the bulk of the
weight concentrated lower down. However, the human body has a narrow base of
support and most of its mass is concentrated higher up in the trunk, making us
inherently unstable and prone to falls. This project brings both experimental
and sophisticated nonlinear analysis techniques to bear on the question of how
the stability of human bipedal locomotion is achieved.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Locomotion is a critical daily life activity. Our living
environment is structured to be compatible with the scale and manner with which
humans move. Despite attempts to restructure the environment, people who have
limited mobility and are forced to navigate with assistive devices such as
crutches or wheelchairs still encounter many obstacles. A better understanding
of how we interact with the environment for upright stability has implications
for improving human mobility of all kinds and hence quality of life. The
investigators also foster participation of undergraduate and high school
students in the research through established programs at the University of
Maryland and Montgomery Blair High School. By targeting ethnic and racial groups
currently underrepresented in science, the project makes significant
contributions to the integration of research, training and
education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is co-funded by SBE/BCS and the Office
