This award provides funding for the workshop "Analysis in Lyon" which occur at
the École Normale Supérieure de Lyon, October 26-30, 2015.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop focuses on recent developments in Analysis,
especially in the field of partial differential equations. The topics to be
covered in the workshop are gradient flows, regularity theory for optimal
transport, Ricci curvature flows, pressureless gas dynamics, fractional
diffusion, and kinetic theory. This award gives young researchers without other
funding the opportunity to participate in this workshop. A (partial) list of
confirmed speakers includes L. Caffarelli, W. Gangbo, S. Serfaty, F. Lin and C.
Villani. The organizing committee will strive to make this opportunity known to
target groups through a variety of media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop
