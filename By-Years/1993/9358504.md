ABSTRACT --- CTS-9358504 FLIK The PI will attempt to solve thermal problems
crucial for the development of electronics and opto-electronics technology. This
will be accomplished by studying heat transfer in micro structures and novel
materials. Attempts will be made to develop fundamental new experimental
techniques in microscale heat transfer, e.g., for the measurement of temperature
fields in the tens of nanometers, the measurement of thermal conductivity of
thin films and radiative properties for thin films and small molecular clusters.
Theoretical methods to predict these properties will also be pursued.
