A central goal of research in artificial intelligence, operations research, and
related fields is the development of algorithmic approaches to decision making
under uncertainty. This project considers influence diagrams, a widely-used
graphical model for representing and solving problems of sequential decision-
making under imperfect information. Influence diagrams were originally developed
to provide a more compact representation of a decision problem than is provided
by a decision tree, which suffers from an exponential explosion in the number of
its branches as a function of the number of variables in the model. Although
influence diagrams provide a compact problem representation, standard algorithms
for solving influence diagrams do not represent the solution to a decision
problem in a similarly compact form. This project addresses this limitation by
introducing a more compact graphical representation of decision strategies that
improves the scalability of algorithms for solving influence diagrams, makes it
easier for a human user to understand the recommended decision strategy, and
allows a principled approach to approximation. In addition, the project develops
a new approach to solving influence diagrams based on branch-and-bound search,
including an incremental approach to probabilistic
inference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The algorithms and software tools developed from
this project will improve the scalability and utility of influence diagrams as
an approach to automated decision making under uncertainty. These contributions
will have a broad impact in the many disciplines in which influence diagrams are
applied, including medical decision analysis and support, therapy plan
selection, user modeling, information retrieval, climate change analysis, and
many others.
