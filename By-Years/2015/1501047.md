This research lies in the intersection of several fields of mathematics,
including representation theory, algebraic geometry, number theory, and
mathematical physics. In particular, new connections between the Langlands
program (which originates in number theory - arguably the oldest subject in
mathematics) and quantum field theory will be explored.

On the more technical side the PI will study various moduli spaces attached to
affine Kac-Moody groups (such as the affine Grassmannian, Uhlenbeck
compactifications of moduli spaces of principal bundles on some algebraic
surfaces, and some others) in order to attack the following problems: 1) a
construction of local L-functions for representations of p-adic groups, 2) Hecke
algebras and Eisenstein series for affine Kac-Moody groups over functional
fields, and 3) instanton counting and other problems in 4-dimensional gauge
theory.
