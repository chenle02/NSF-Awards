The effect of pressure on the sooting of flames will be studied in a variable
pressure gradient wind tunnel. Soot will be monitored accurately through
sampling and radiation probes, and properties will yield to advanced optical
techniques (extinction and scattering). Soot generation and disappearance will
be documented as a function of the pressure field and geometry. The possibility
to control soot formation by design-dependent pressure fields could be an
outcome of this fundamental work. The effect of shear and radiation losses will
be included in this study.
