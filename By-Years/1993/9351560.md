9351560 Chittenden An atomic absorption spectrometer and thermogravimetric
analysis instrumentation are being used to greatly strengthen the laboratory
training in Quantitative Analysis, in two senior level undergraduate courses,
Instrumentation and Inorganic Chemistry, and in our capstone undergraduate
research course, Special Problems in Chemistry. Students are completing senior
theses based on their research projects. The three senior level courses, as an
interrelated group, convey a strong emphasis on environmental chemistry.
Particularly stressed are the areas of water (surface, ground, and rain water)
quality and the inorganic synthesis and characterization of models for
hydrodesulfurization (HDS) catalysts which are necessary for the removal of
sulfur from fossil fuels. Environmental chemistry, being broadly
interdisciplinary in nature, is providing a comprehensive view of the field of
chemistry. ***y
