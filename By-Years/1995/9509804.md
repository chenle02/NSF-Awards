9509804 Olmstead Since the time of Darwin, systematists have worked to produce
classifications of organisms that represent the evolutionary or genealogical
relationships among them. The fact that pre-Darwinian classifications of plants
have persisted to this day for many groups attests to the conservative nature of
change in the reproductive structures that were used as primary characters by
Linnaeus and subsequent botanists. Research on DNA nucleotide sequence variation
in flowering plants by Dr. Richard Olmstead and several others has revealed
serious discrepancies between traditional family-level classification and DNA-
based groupings, for several well known groups of plants including the mint,
verbena, borage, and snapdragon families. Similarities in ovary and fruit
morphology have apparently misled taxonomists to unite genealogically separate
groups within the same family. Dr. Olmstead is continuing DNA sequencing studies
of genes of the chloroplast in representative samples of Boraginaceae,
Hydrophyllaceae, and Scrophulariaceae, large families with widespread
distributions in temperate regions of the world. Related groups such as
Convolvulaceae (morning glory family), Labiatae (mints), and Verbenaceae are
being studied by colleagues and others. The DNA-based analyses of relationships
will provide a phylogenetic framework for this large group of advanced dicots,
independent of the schemes based on traditional morphological features and thus
serving as a test of them. Because such taxa as Antirrhinum, the cultivated
snapdragon, serve as model laboratory organisms, it is important to know their
close evolutionary relatives in order to extrapolate genetic and physiological
findings.
