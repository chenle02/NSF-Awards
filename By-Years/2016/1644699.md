This is a project from the University of Akron to extend and expand their
existing I-Corps Site. Akron was one of the first three Sites funded through the
I-Corps program. NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities
established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple,
local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites
provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training
and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the
marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. This project represents a
Type II Site. There are two types of I-Corps Site proposals: Type I proposals
are submitted by institutions that have not had prior funding as an I-Corps
Site;Type II proposals are submitted by institutions that have had prior funding
as an I-Corps Site&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a strong project based on a
history of success and a demonstrated commitment to the I-Corps process. UA is
achieving their goals of preparing teams for the National program and/or
I-Corps@Ohio; encouraging collaboration and enhancing understanding of
innovation and entrepreneurship as evidenced by the number of teams that are
completing the Site program; continuing on with additional training and
receiving external funding. There is evidence of a strong network of support
from the university and community as well as an experienced leadership team and
mentor network. UA has a very strong track record of translating innovative
ideas into companies, and the system created I-Corps@Ohio, a statewide I-Corps
program. Under-represented participants are encouraged through the Jumpstart
inclusion program and the UA Site has been particularly successful in including
women in their programs.
