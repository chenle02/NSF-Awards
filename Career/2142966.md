This project focuses on the role of symmetry in algebraic geometry, which is the
study of the solutions of systems of polynomial equations in many variables, and
methods of exploiting symmetries in these systems to better understand their
structure. Solving such systems is often very difficult: in general, it is hard
to learn much about the set of solutions unless one knows some peculiarities of
the specific equations at hand. This research lies at the intersection of
algebraic geometry and dynamical systems, which studies the behavior of repeated
applications of functions on certain sets of points. A key component of this
project is to bring the techniques from each of these disciplines to bear on
questions from the other. The project includes educational components at every
level. At the most advanced levels, the project focuses on introducing algebraic
dynamics to new audiences, including graduate students in dynamics and
researchers in algebraic geometry. The project will also involve several
undergraduate researchers learning the basics of the field, as well as the
development of educational materials for younger students hoping to understand
the breadth of mathematics beyond calculus.

More technically, a primary goal of the project is to understand the growth of
degrees of iterates of rational maps, from both computational and theoretical
points of view. There has been considerable effort directed at understanding
lower bounds on degree growth, and the investigators will use new methods from
the Sarkisov program to study this question. The researchers will also
investigate computational questions and improve the capacity of the open-source
SageMath system to compute dynamical degrees. In other directions, the
researchers will focus on questions related to the growth rates of spaces of
sections of tensor powers of line bundles as well as higher-dimensional versions
of the bounded negativity conjecture.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
