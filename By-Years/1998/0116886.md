The Amaldi Conferences were initiated in 1994 by an international group of
scientists involved in the search for gravitational waves in honor of Edoardo
Amaldi, the Italian physicist who was one of the founders of the University of
Rome Gravitational Wave group. The conferences are now a continuing series
sponsored and organized by the Gravitational Wave International Committee
(GWIC). GWIC has members from all of the major gravitational wave detector
projects around the world. This proposal requests support for travel to the 4th
Amaldi Conference to be held in Perth, Western Australia, July 8-13, 2001, for
members of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC). The Amaldi Conferences are
the principal international meetings for the Gravitational Wave community. The
latest developments and accomplishments in this rapidly growing scientific field
will be reported at this meeting. In addition to this important exchange of
ideas and advances in gravitational wave science, US members of the LSC will
have an opportunity to discuss research on techniques to improve the sensitivity
of LIGO interferometers with their Australian collaborators who are also members
of the LSC.
