The goal of this proposal is to search for correlations between the
superconducting and normal-state properties in selected oxide and Buckminster
fullerine compounds as a function of hydrostatic pressure. Emphasis will be
placed on the effect that pressure induced changes in the local oxygen ordering
have on the superconducting transition temperature Tc. The results of this study
should lead to information on the mechanism(s) responsible for the
superconducting state and aid in the search for compounds with higher values of
Tc.
