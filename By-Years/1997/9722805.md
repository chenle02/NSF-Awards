PI: Hanlon IBN: 9722805 Major advances in fundamental neurophysiology have come
from studying the nervous system of the squid. The giant axon, giant synapse,
and the eyes are outstanding unusual features of squids that provide excellent
model systems for neuroscience. The Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) in Woods
Hole, Massachusetts has been a leading international center where physiologists,
anatomists, biochemists and biophysicists have obtained squid for their research
on nerve impulses, synaptic transmission, axonal transport and organelle
motility, membrane structure, cell death and repair, and ion channel
distribution and function. This project continues partial funding for improved
collection of live squid in good condition, using a variety of capture
techniques. Results of this support will have a broad impact because obtaining
squid in excellent condition will enhance the potential of the new MBL Marine
Resources Center facilities to provide longer and better maintenance, and so to
provide healthier squid of consistently higher quality at a lower cost to the
researchers in neuroscience.
