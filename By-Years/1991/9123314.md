This award supports Professor Rosemary Renaut of Arizona State University to
collaborate in mathematics research with Professor Rolf Jeltsch of the Applied
Mathematics Group of the Swiss Federal Institute (ETH), Zurich. They are
studying the stability of certain numerical algorithms for solving hyperbolic
differential equations. Typically, numerical solutions to these differential
equations can be found by a variety of methods such as finite elements, spectral
methods and finite difference methods. In this proposal finite difference
methods are emphasized. Realistic solutions of hyperbolic initial boundary value
problems are required in many areas including computational fluid mechanics,
geophysics and aerodynamics. A complete geometric description of the order star
of Riemann surfaces will provide insight into the stability and accuracy of
numerical algorithms to solve these problems. Both researchers have been active
in the numerical solution of hyperbolic equations; Dr. Renaut's work has been
mainly concentrated on the wave equation, while Dr. Jeltsch has worked on the
advection equation. Many other problems will benefit from a deeper understanding
of these numerical algorithms.
