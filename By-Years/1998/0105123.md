This study tests for effects of habitat heterogeneity in population dynamics of
snowshoe hares, critical prey for many coniferous forest carnivores, including
Canada lynx. Prevalent hypotheses appeal to habitat heterogeneity and resulting
source-sink dynamics to explain the lack of hare population cycles in their
southern range (the contiguous U.S.A.). Veterinary ultrasound and radio-
telemetry will estimate birth, survival, immigration and emigration rates in
different forest stand structure types. These estimates will test hypotheses of
population dynamics in heterogeneous landscapes. Computer models will test for
influences of landscape configuration on the relative importance of different
vital rates. An experiment will test for changes in hare abundance resulting
from pre-commercial thinning, a common silvicultural perturbation in forest
habitats. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will test theories that explain why
certain animal populations do or do not cycle from high to low density, a
central question in ecology. They will also inform federal, state, and private
management of forested habitats where snowshoe hare population size, and Canada
lynx population viability, are of concern and provide research training for
undergraduate student-scientists.&lt;br/&gt;
