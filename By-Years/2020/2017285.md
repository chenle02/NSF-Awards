Difficulty hearing and producing new sounds in a second language leads to
lowered comprehension of the target language and difficulty speaking in a way
that can be easily understood by native speakers. This can lead to painful
interactions and potential abandonment of the acquisition effort. Research and
anecdotal evidence highlight the difficulty that speakers of non-tonal languages
have when attempting to form novel tone categories in other languages. Results
from the proposed research will provide a greater understanding of the factors
that affect the process of acquisition of novel tone categories, benefitting
both learners and teachers. Factors tested in the proposed experiments are
specific to pedagogical considerations when introducing novel suprasegmental
categories. With greater foundational knowledge regarding these issues, language
teachers will have a wider range of tools with which they will be able to
develop optimal methodologies for helping their students better acquire tone
categories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second language acquisition differs from first
language acquisition in that it is possible to exogenously direct the learnerâ€™s
attention to the target sound categories. However, even in second language
acquisition, the majority of exposure to novel sound categories in the natural
world occurs incidentally through interactions with native speakers and media,
rather than through explicit instruction in a lab or in the classroom.
Therefore, it is important to understand factors that affect the incidental
formation of novel sound categories in natural speech. The proposed studies
investigate factors affecting the incidental acquisition of novel tone
categories by having learners focus on a simple visual matching task with tokens
from the target auditory categories providing predictive clues about the
location of the visual targets. This incidental learning paradigm permits the
examination of factors known to affect novel sound category learning during
explicit, directed training. A greater knowledge of factors impacting novel tone
category formation during incidental learning will provide a contrastive
evaluation of our knowledge of novel sound category formation during training
with explicit instructions, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of how
humans process speech sounds and form new sound
categories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
