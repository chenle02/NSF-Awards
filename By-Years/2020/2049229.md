Bureaucracies provide important services to communities, including facilitating
understanding of policies that shape lifeways and identity. Some communities,
Indigenous and tribal communities for example, express and build identity in
different ways, in turn shaping the receipt of bureaucratic support. Variation
in notions of kinship and individualist versus collectivist orientations affect
how communities interact with bureaucracies; the desire for social change can
drive the expansion or contraction of bureaucratic efforts. This research
examines the extent to which bureaucracy is shaped by community identity and
community social movements. In doing so, it aims to re-theorize how
bureaucracies are defined and deployed to effect positive change. The research
supports training of a U.S. doctoral student and results will be disseminated
widely to diverse audiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This doctoral dissertation
research examines how large bureaucracies with large endowments understand and
achieve their purposes to serve communities and mediate between communities and
larger governmental entities. It investigates bureaucratic roles in supporting
versus hindering community movements and how identity is shaped in these
processes. The researcher will perform ethnographic and linguistic research in
U.S. bureaucracies, examining documents and document practices, conducting
participant observation of bureaucratic and community venues, and semi-
structured interviews of bureaucrats and community stakeholders about their
daily work. The researcher will also collect life stories of bureaucrats and
community stakeholders, examining how historical events and experience over the
life span articulates changes in social movements and bureaucracies. The results
of this research will contribute to theories of bureaucracy and its role in
social movements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
