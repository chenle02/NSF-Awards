Professors Raina Maier, an environmental microbiologist, Jeanne Pemberton, a
surface chemist (both of the University of Arizona) and Cynthia Larive, an
analytical nuclear magnetic resonance expert (of the University of Kansas) are
funded by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program and the Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities for the investigation of microbial surfactants and
their role in the surface chemistry of soils. This problem is to be addressed in
an extensive interdisciplinary research program involving batch and flow-through
column and micro-organism culturing, and analyses including FTIR, NMR, XPS, AFM
and PCR. The goal is to sort out the interaction of biosurfactants in natural
and model soil systems that are both contaminated and uncontaminated.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biosurfactants released by microbes play an unknown role
in the transport of metals in the soil environment. In addition to aiding in
questions of transport of metals (both natural and pollutants), the work may
help provide new methods for bioremediation and/or elimination of contamination
in soils. A unique cross-training of graduate and undergraduate students is in
place in conjunction with the research.&lt;br/&gt;
