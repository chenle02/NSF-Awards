Quantifying the immense diversity of microbial life poses significant new
challenges. Statistical methods currently available to estimate microbial
diversity are, at best, unproven, because they are not compatible with the
highly skewed species abundance curves that are characteristic of most microbial
communities. The objectives of this research are to 1) develop novel statistical
approaches to estimate biodiversity, 2) test these methods using existing data
sets, and 3) make these methods available to the community in the form of freely
accessible, easy to use, sophisticated statistical software. The software tools
will implement a wide variety of older and novel methods for estimating species
richness, including parametric and nonparametric procedures and interactive
graphical displays. These tools will be tested by applying them to existing data
sets, and they will be used to analyze emerging global patterns of microbial
biodiversity. The intellectual merit of the project is that these tools have the
potential to transform microbial biodiversity research by providing reliable
biodiversity metrics with meaningful standard errors. The broader impacts of the
project include student training and the creation of tools that will serve a
growing cadre of biostatisticians, bioinformaticians, and microbial ecologists.
