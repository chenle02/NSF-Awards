This research site will lead undergraduate research programs in several areas of
mathematics. These areas include algebra, applied analysis, combinatorics,
geometry, knot theory, financial mathematics and mathematical games. For eight-
week periods in each of the summers 2003-2005, students will work intensively in
teams on appropriate research projects. Results of successful projects will be
published in peer-reviewed journals. Women and minorities are encouraged to
apply to the program.
