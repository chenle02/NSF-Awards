9703154 Spruck The proposed research deals with a number of geometric problems
in the area of Riemannian and differential geometry. Asymptotic shape of
curvature flows, local two dimensional isometric embedding problem, complex
Green's function and existence of analytic functions on Stein manifolds, and
isoperimetric inequality on Cartan-Hadamard manifolds are among the problems to
be pursued. The main tool to be used is the theory of Monge-Ampere equations.
The use of nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations to solve
fundamental problems in differential geometry has been one of the great
achievements of modern mathematics. Perhaps the most important nonlinear
elliptic equation is the Monge-Ampere equation and there have been significant
advances in our understanding of this equation in the last several years.
Partial differential equations model various natural phenomena where several
parameters vary simultaneously and their rates of change over a short time
interval can be observed. Thus far, a general theory of such equations is very
much lacking, especially when the equation is fully nonlinear.
