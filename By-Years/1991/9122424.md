This is a proposal to study imprisonment, placement in asylums, and welfare
policies in five common-law countries--the U.S., the United Kingdom, Canada,
Australia, and New Zealand-- over the period 1955-1985. During this period the
trend has been in all five countries toward an increased use of prisons and a
curtailed use of mental hospitals. The primary objective of the study is to
study more fully the relationship between changes in prison and mental hospital
populations in the five countries, and to examine how they relate to changes in
welfare policies. The study will collect quantitative data on institutional
capacities, welfare benefits, and other variables in each of the five countries.
The analysis would use pooled cross-sectional timeseries analysis combined with
more qualitative historical analyses. This study will contribute greatly to our
understanding of how societies identify and sanctions deviants. Its unique
contribution will be to link social control practices as exemplified by prisons
and mental hospitals with wider social and political processes expressed in the
welfare policies of each nation.
