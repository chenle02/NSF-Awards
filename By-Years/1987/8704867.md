Current technology often requires an ability to analyze remotely the behavior of
complex materials and components, and in adverse environments. Advanced strain
(stress) analysis and quantitative NDE methods are particularly needed. Although
most conventional approaches are inadequate, or are unsuitable for hostile
environments such as cryogenic or elevated temperatures, differential
thermography (SPATE) appears advantageous for such applications. The technique
is non- contacting and sensitive, and provides information expediently which is
difficult or virtually impossible to obtain otherwise. A SPATE (Stress Pattern
Analysis by Thermal Emission) system primarily for stress analysis, and NDE of
composites and ceramics at extreme temperatures. Current applications also
include thin films, wood, welds, orthopedic implants and material damage.
