This project is integrating nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) theory and practice
into the undergraduate chemistry curriculum. Initial experiments in organic
chemistry laboratories focus on the interpretation of H1, C13, and NOE (Nuclear
Overhauser Effect) spectra and how to elucidate structure using information
obtained from chemical shifts, splitting patterns, coupling constants, and
integration ratios. In subsequent coursework and laboratories, the nature of the
FT-NMR experiment and instrument operating variables is being examined and
problems involving reaction kinetics, magnetic moments of paramagnetic
compounds, intramolecular rearrangements, 2-D methods, and other applications
are being studied. Instruction of inexperienced undergraduates in the operation
of the FT-NMR spectrometer is being augmented by video tapes that describe
safety around magnets, sample preparation, instrument setup with step-by-step
computer commands for the various experiments, data acquisition and processing,
and the presentation of the spectra. The department additionally is conducting
an outreach program whereby students at nearby colleges are invited to our
campus for NMR workshops and summer research opportunities.
