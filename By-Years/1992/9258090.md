Computational approaches to generating design topologies will be investigated.
These approaches will emphasize grammatical formulations of design problems that
model form and function, and techniques to reason from first principles.
Deterministic and stochastic optimization techniques will be used as search
mechanisms within the expanding design space. Designs will be evaluated for
quality based on a new economic model of cost and quality.
