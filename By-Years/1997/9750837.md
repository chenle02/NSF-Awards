This project is directed at two goals. First, an experiment involving catalytic
isomerization of n-butenes is built and introduced into the two required senior
chemical engineering laboratory courses. The experiment is based on an existing
gas chromatograph and involves a relatively simple apparatus built around a
tubular glass reactor packed with chromia alumina catalyst. Purchased equipment
includes an FID detector and second inlet for the chromatograph, a capillary
column capable of separating the three n-butene isomers, and a tube furnace. The
students become familiar with the essentials of heterogeneous catalysis and see
how kinetic and equilibrium data for catalytic reactions are generated and
analyzed. Second, an existing experiment involving the dynamics and control of a
multivessel flow system is interfaced to the Internet. This setup allows
students (using Web software such as Netscape Navigator) in several
nonlaboratory courses (including a first-year elective open to all engineering
students) to see, run, and acquire data from this system. Equipment includes a
color video camera, motorized lens, tilt and pan stage for the camera, video
compression card, and Pentium computer. *
