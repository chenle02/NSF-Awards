This U.S. - Brazil Cooperative Science Program award supports travel expenses
and expendable research supplies and services related to the visits of Drs. R.
Charudattan and D. Habeck, U of Florida, Gainesville, to Brazil . The purpose of
the visits is to perform research on biocontrol of weeds occurring commonly in
the U.S. and Brazil. Conventional weed control relies on chemical herbicides,
which are costly and may cause damage to the environment. Biocontrol is an
alternative, environmentally safe way of controlling weed and insect
populations, which may result in large cost savings. The role of insects and
pathogens of biological origin in controlling sicklepod, and purple and yellow
nutsedge, three weeds that occur in agroecosystems, and waterhyacinth, Brazilian
peppertree and melaleuca, three weeds that occur in aquatic ecosystems, will be
researched. Since these weeds are widespread in both Brazil and the U.S., both
sides will benefit from the collaboration.
