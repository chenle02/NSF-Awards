In recent years, interesting classes of knotted and linked curves in spaces of
dimension 3 have arisen in the study of large-scale phenomena in algebraic
geometry: these include quasipositive links (cut out, in a sphere of arbitrary
radius in complex 2-space, by a polynomial in two complex variables) and links-
at-infinity (where the sphere is "infinitely large"); these links should be very
special topologically (e.g., highly asymmetric), but it is known that such
classical invariants as the Alexander polynomial cannot detect this. Also
recently, new topological invariants of knots and links have come to light:
these include the enhanced Milnor number (defined for "fibered" links, using
differential topology) and the generalized Jones polynomial (defined for all
links, and apparently much more combinatorial in nature); both of these
invariants detect some asymmetries, and the Jones polynomial was used to give
the first proof that a particular knot (the figure- 8) is not quasipositive. Now
there is evidence that the generalized Jones polynomial and the enhanced Milnor
number are related. Rudolph plans to study this relationship more closely--among
other reasons, in search of the geometry underlying the generalized Jones
polynomial. Quasipositive links and links-at-infinity will serve as test cases.
