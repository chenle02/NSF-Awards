*** 96-60765 Gluck This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will explore a new approach to ultra fine polishing of nickel-
phosphorous coated hard memory disks. Phase I will investigate an entirely new
approach to nickel-phosphorus polishing that uses a fixed abrasive polish stone,
and coolant. Optimization will be accomplished by comparison with the existing
foreign technology of soft polishing. Increased memory densities (from 1 gigabit
per square inch to 3 gigabits per square inch) and pseudo contact recording for
read/write heads will be investigated. Initial products for the electronics
industry will be high performance foamed stones engineered specifically for flat
surface polishing. This innovation in polishing may induce changes in other
important operations in electronics manufacture. ***
