Quality oriented management practices have lacked a well grounded behavioral
theory base for explaining and predicting variance in outcomes across different
organizational contexts. This research will test and refine a new theoretical
framework that will enable tailoring of quality management practices contingent
on organizational conditions, with the aim of enhancing the effectiveness of
these practices. The new theoretical framework suggests that there are two
different types of quality management practices, one type that is suited very
well for quality improvement of highly certain tasks, and the other is well
suited to improvement of uncertain tasks. This theory suggests that quality
practices must match the task environment if they are to be effective. The
research will be use a multi disciplinary empirical methodology combining case
studies with a large scale survey. The case studies will challenge certain
aspects of the new theory, while the survey will enable generalizability of the
theory as modified following the case studies. Two previously related studies
have successfully pilot some of the proposed methods. case study research will
be conducted in firms that represent a range of sizes and industries, including
Zerox, Motorola, Applied Materials, U. S Bureau of Mines, and smaller
organizations belonging to the Hogan Quality Consortium.
