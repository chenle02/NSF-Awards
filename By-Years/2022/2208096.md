The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to further develop and commercialize an
ocular gene therapy to reverse the effects of dry age-related macular
degeneration (AMD), a disease affecting over 11 million Americans today and
representing the leading cause of blindness in the elderly in the United States.
The proposed treatment has the potential to preserve independence, economic
stability, and quality of life of those affected by AMD and reduce US healthcare
costs with just a single treatment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project technical plan will optimize the
formulation, dose, and route of administration of an investigational therapy in
a large animal model. The project will first develop gene therapy formulations
with various vehicles. The formulationsâ€™ efficiency in retinal tissues with an
injection into the eye will be assessed with preliminary pharmacokinetic
analyses. Toxicology studies will be performed to assess safety and efficacy of
the novel formulation and the injection route at various doses over 3 months.
Subsequently, the project will assess risk in manufacturing the gene delivery
vehicles to ensure that high concentrations can be manufactured for future
clinical use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
