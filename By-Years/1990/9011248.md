The objective of this project is to carry out fundamental research in complexity
theory and logic, focusing on the formal status of the P=? NP question. This
question involves hundreds of long-studied computer decision problems, and asks
whether they can be solved by time-efficient methods, or not. The first part of
the project is to develop a uniform foundation for "structural" complexity
theory, one which refines the techniques currently used to investigate
polynomial time. A key idea for making progress is that many of these techniques
can be sharpened to study linear time computation, where results analogous to "P
= NP" are already known, and where basic properties have simpler representations
in formal logic. Expected results are a better classification of problems
solvable in linear or "nearly linear" time, and a deeper understanding of the
obstacles to answering the major open questions for polynomial time. The second
part combines complexity theory with techniques developed by logicians for
analyzing certain specific formal systems, ones capable of modeling much current
work in theoretical computer science. Several researchers have raised the
possibility that "current methods in computer science" may be incapable of
resolving "P =? NP" and related questions; this project seeks a definite answer
in terms of these formal systems. A further goal is to develop those techniques
which these systems may lack, aided by recent evedence that some concrete
results essentially require "abstract" methods, and by advances in computer-
assisted theorem proving.
