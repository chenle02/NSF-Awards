This is a study of the divisions within US Catholicism. The study of Catholicism
provides a unique opportunity to examine how competing religious identities and
movements can develop and remain in opposition within a single overarching
institution. Whereas conflicting Protestant identities and movements have often
brought about denominational splits, competing identities and movements within
Catholicism have not. The tension between the forces dividing Catholics on
religious and social issues and those unifying them as one people is the subject
of this dissertation. Two methods will be used to analyze differences between
traditional, moderate, and liberal Catholics: (1) in-depth interviews with 60
members of three Midwestern parishes and (2) national survey data from the
General Social Surveys of 1998 and 2000. Four basic research questions will be
addressed: (1) Are the labels "traditional," "moderate," and "liberal."
meaningful to ordinary Catholics? (2) Are these identities connected to
theological differences, intra-church conflicts, and religious movements? (3)
How do Catholics create and negotiate separate spaces for traditional,
moderates, and liberals within a single Church? (4) What are the key social and
economic issues separating traditional, moderates, and liberals? The
contribution of this research to social science is centered in contributions to
be made to the study of religious identities and institutions. At a time when
religious identities are increasingly politicized throughout the world, it is
important to understand how these identities develop and are maintained.
Investigating how these identities interact within a unified institutional
setting will also allow us to more fully understand the religious forces that
divide us from each other and those that unify us.
