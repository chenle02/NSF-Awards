This award provides partial support for the acquisition of a confocal microscope
for the research activities of the Department of Biological Sciences. In
addition, the instrument is expected to play an essential role in the education
and professional development at all levels. The instrument will be used in
research projects aimed at an understanding of fundamental cell, developmental,
neurobiological and physiological processes, including: (1) studies aimed at
understanding cell growth and cell movements in vitro and in vivo; 2) high
resolution immuno-localization studies focusing on proteins with important
functions in embryonic development, signaling, and membrane transport; (3)
studies of microbial community structure, and (4) analysis of genetic mutations
on cell structure and gene expression. A significant number undergraduates,
graduate students and other professionals will use the microscope through an
existing, formal course on microscopy applications, and through other laboratory
courses with modules that will utilize the instrument. Students will also have
access to the confocal microscope for their own independent research projects.
