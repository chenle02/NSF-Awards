HD/ Files/ Data/ Awards-FY94/ 9413461.roth.nr.sger The objective of this project
is to investigate and document liquefaction-related deformations in the vicinity
of the Los Angeles Reservoir resulting from the January 17, 1994 Northridge, CA,
earthquake. (Observations in this area are remarkably similar to those of the
1971 San Fernando earthquake.) Significant structural and soil-related damage
occurred, and a large amount of data was recorded at numerous stations in the
Los Angeles area, Redondo Beach, and the Port of Los Angeles. This liquefaction-
related data is expected to yield valuable insight into the nature of
liquefaction. Specifically, it will provide the opportunity to verify existing
analysis procedures for the prediction of the seismic performance of earth
structures. ***
