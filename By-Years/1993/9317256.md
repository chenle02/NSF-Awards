9317256 ESTES This project will be devoted to the continuing development of
mathematical and computer models for human memory and classification
performance. The objectives are twofold. One function of the models, analogous
to that of the gene model in genetics, is to help us understand what goes on in
the memory system when it is impaired by aging or brain damage or when it gives
rise to super-normal or "expert" performance, and to provide an essential
framework for relating experimental results on cognitive functioning to
mechanisms revealed by research in neural science. The second role of the models
is that of "learning machines" that can serve as components of intelligent
systems for accomplishing complex tasks like speech recognition, language
comprehension, medical diagnosis, and coping with the vast quantities of data
returned from spacecraft. Estes has developed two types of models under his
long-term NSF support, one based on symbol processing, as in traditional
artificial intelligence, and one based on structures and processes suggested by
work on neural networks. In this research, Estes will test and refine both
models further in relation to several major outstanding problems: How is it
possible to gain rapid access to the large amount of information stored in human
long-term memory? How can people learn many difficult categorizations
simultaneously with little interference, e. g., learning several languages or
several computer operating systems? How do people make decisions among
alternatives that differ in their constellations of associated values and
uncertainties of outcomes? How do the hypothesized short- and long-term memory
systems of the computational models relate to the neural systems of the
hippocampus and frontal cortex that are currently being studied. ***
