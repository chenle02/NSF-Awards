Greg Voth, Gary Ayton, and Thomas Cheatham of the University of Utah are
supported by the Division of Chemistry through the Information Technology
Research program in a collaborative effort between theoretical chemistry and
computational biology. They will develop and implement a novel multi-scale
computational grid simulation method designed to examine spatially and
temporally coupled phenomena in large biomolecular assemblies. Applications
include DNA, actin filaments, microtubes, and amyloid
plaques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently, it is computationally intractable to
perform atomistic simulations on macro-scale dimensional problems. Moreover,
traditional continuum simulation methods break down as the meso-scale regime is
reached. This research is expected to result in the construction of a viable
micro-to-macro simulation methodology which, in the context of large biological
systems, will address long-range electrostatics, water vibrations, solvent
interactions, conformational sampling, and external fields.
