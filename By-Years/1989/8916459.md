Peroxisomes are nearly ubiquitous in eukaryotic cells and have essential
functions in respiration and lipid metabolism. Peroxisomal proteins are nuclear-
encoded and are synthesized on free polyribosomes, then imported into pre-
existing peroxisomes post-translationally. Peroxisomal proteins, unlike many
mitochondrial and chloroplast proteins, are synthesized at their mature size and
lack cleavable transit peptides. The long term objective of this project is to
understand the mechanism of peroxisome assembly. The aims of this proposal are
to identify topogenic sequences that act to direct peroxisomal proteins to yeast
peroxisomes. Previously, this laboratory determined conditions for measuring the
in vitro import of peroxisomal proteins to peroxisomes from the yeast Candida
tropicalis, and identified topogenic sequences in one peroxosomal protein
(aceyl-CoA oxidase) that are capable of direction this protein to peroxisomes.
Nothing is known regarding the targeting and insertion of peroxisomal integral
membrane proteins. The plan is to clone and sequence a matrix and membrane
protein from C. tropicalis peroxisomes. Using the established in vitro assay and
by an in vivo import assay, peroxisomal targetting signals will be investigated
and compared. Also, the gene encloding peroxisomal citrate synthase from
Saccharomyces cerevisiae is in hand; this will be expressed and, using the above
methods, it will be determined whether signal sequences are conserved in
peroxisomal proteins from C. tropicalis and S. cerevisiae. By these means, it is
hoped to gain a better understanding of the mechanism by which peroxisomes are
assembled.
