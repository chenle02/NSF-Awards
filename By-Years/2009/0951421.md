This award provides support for up to two-years for an REU Site at New Mexico
State University. Five students will be recruited for an eight-week summer
experience in research related to information-based manufacturing. The overall
goal of this program is to attract and encourage students with physical
challenges to consider a research-related career as a viable career option.
Students will have an opportunity to engage in state-of-the-art research
projects in areas such as virtual prototyping and information-oriented modeling.
It is anticipated that this research experience will effectively expose students
to the exciting world of research and thus encourage students to pursue graduate
study. It is anticipated that this program will have a Broader Impact on the
nations need to increase the number of U.S. citizens and permanent residents
engaged in research-related careers at U.S. universities, government agencies,
and in private-sector organizations.
