This project supports two students to work on numerical investigations of
planetary systems involving collisional dynamics, primarily planetary ring
dynamics and planetary formation, including enhancement of the codes used. This
project is funded under the auspices of the Research in Undergraduate
Institutions (RUI) program. The Principal Investigator is working on simulation
of the Saturnian ring system and on a general data analysis and visualization
tool, with support from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA). This added-value project will significantly improve the research as well
as strengthen the existing collaboration, while including undergraduate students
on a cutting-edge project in planetary science.

One student will work to organize and perform simulations of embedded moonlets,
silicate material in the ring, and Saturn's F ring, and to analyze the results.
The second student will work to improve the simulation code by enhancing support
for accretion, and to develop analysis tools for the code. Their results will
aid in interpreting Cassini observations and providing a general understanding
of the Saturnian ring system, as well as helping to understand the early stages
of planetary accretion. Comparison with experiments will enhance the accuracy of
these numerical models, and improve the quality of the tools available to the
whole planetary science community. The students will also present their results
each year at an astronomy conference and at a conference on parallel computing
or simulation methodologies.
