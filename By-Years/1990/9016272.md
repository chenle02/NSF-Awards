This grant supports a workshop to Appraise Research Opportunities in Nanometer
Scale Science and Technology, to be held in Baltimore, Maryland, July 26-27,
1990, in conjunction with the Fifth International Conference on Scanning
Tunneling Microscopy and the First International Conference on Nanometer Scale
Science and Technology. The joint conferences will attract world experts in the
field to discuss state-of- the-art results both in analytical tool development
and in the nanometer-scale science and technology made possible by these new
tools. This is a field which is rapidly producing major advances in materials
understanding and new device technologies. By taking advantages of the presence
of these experts, the proposed workshop will review progress in these areas;
identify research opportunities, assess the potential impact of nanometer scale
research; assess government, academic and industrial research plans; and
recommend resource allocation strategies. The results of the workshop will be
published in the Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology in order to widely
disseminate the information to the community.
