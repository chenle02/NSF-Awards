9628071 Silver The PI proposes a GPS field and dynamic modeling investigation in
Papua New Guinea focused on understanding the changes in width and strain rates
of the transition from subduction at the New Britain trench to collision in New
Guinea, which provides an ideal example of the many stages of arc-continental
collision. ***
