This project will explore several interconnected questions in the area of
modulation-invariant time-frequency analysis. The first group of questions is
concerned with the return times phenomenon for measure-preserving systems. Here,
one is interested in the convergence of weighted averages along flows in
dynamical systems, specifically when the weights are generated by a flow in a
second dynamical system. Two problems of particular interest are to determine
the amount of Lp regularity required for convergence, especially when the
averages are replaced by singular integrals, and to determine, in terms of
variation-norm estimates, how quickly this convergence occurs. These problems
should be addressed by proving suitable extensions of the Carleson-Hunt theorem.
The second group of questions concerns the bilinear Hilbert transform. One
problem of interest here is to find new estimates which are uniform in the
parameter which determines the singularity set for the transform. A second
problem is to determine the rate of convergence for truncated transforms and the
associated maximal operator. Although, at first glance, these two groups of
questions may not seem to be related, their resolution is expected to be largely
guided by a common set of tools.

The proposed research falls under the broad umbrella of harmonic analysis, a
discipline which studies the decomposition of many types of data into
combinations of basic waves of varying frequencies. These decompositions have
been broadly applied in areas such as physics, chemistry, biology, and finance.
An application which is especially relevant here is data compression, where one
seeks to represent a signal, such as a movie or audio track, accurately while
using a minimum amount of storage space. Convergence rate estimates, as in the
previous paragraph, can in principle be used to characterize how much space is
needed to give a "good" representation of a signal. The project also makes
significant contact with areas of mathematics outside of harmonic analysis,
including ergodic theory and additive combinatorics, and can be expected to
stimulate many active discussions with faculty and students of the LSU math
department, and with collaborators across the country.
