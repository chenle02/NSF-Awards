This is a 4-year Career Development proposal with focus on stochastic inventory
systems and supply chain management. The research plan is organized into three
areas. First, the PI will establish high performance heuristics for a class of
multi-echelon stochastic inventory systems. Second, he intends to investigate
the value of improving communication between members of a supply chain. The
final part of the research plan involves issues of marketing-operations
interface, specifically, channel coordination (analogous to supply-chain
management but with independent firms), and product variety.
