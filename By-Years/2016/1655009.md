The Institute for Systems Research (ISR), at the University of Maryland (UMD),
College Park, will organize an International Symposium on Networked Cyber-
Physical Systems (CPS) together with the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS),
Technical University of Munich (TUM) in Germany. This first symposium of its
kind in the new and emerging area of Networked CPS is to be held at the
Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) of the Technical University of Munich (TUM)
tentatively on September 19-20, 2016. The plan is to have this Symposium on an
annual basis, with the location alternating each year between TUM, Munich, and
UMD, College Park. This symposium will aim at the establishment of collaboration
in the new area of Networked CPS at an international level. The broader societal
impact of the proposed effort is likely to be high due to its strong relevance
to a new generation of industry, namely exploiting the Internet-of-Things (IoT).
The training, education, and workforce development involving under-represented
groups are going to play a critical role in this new development and will be
discussed as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At this workshop, the critical research
challenges will be identified by world renowned researchers from several
countries (USA, Germany, England, Switzerland, Greece, and The Netherlands), who
are experts in a variety of fields related to the interdisciplinary area of
Networked CPS. The workshop will also aim to explore the intellectual
underpinnings of a highly important and emerging area, potentially having great
global and technological impact due to its strong relevance to a new generation
of industry, namely involving the so called the Internet-of-Things (IoT). The
results of the workshop will be made available to the public in the form of a
report. Requested funds will be used primarily to cover the expenses of plenary
and invited speakers and researchers from the USA.
