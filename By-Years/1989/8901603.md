The research involves the study of semiparametric and nonparametric statistical
models in the presence of censored data. Graphical model diagnostic methods will
be developed to compare the hazard experience of two groups in two-sample
experiments and for goodness-of-fit tests of the Cox regression model.
Confidence band procedures will be developed for nonparametric regression and
data-based rules will be given in bandwidth selection problems for hazard
function estimation. The relationships between the response variable and
predictor variables will be studied through semparametric rate functions and
transformation models. Procedures will also be considered for testing
independence of paired survival times.
