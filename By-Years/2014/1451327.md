Getting robots to perform useful work in uncertain environments is still a grand
challenge in robotics. One of the biggest possible impacts of this ability would
be to enable the development of new co-robots that are nurses, handymen, and
butlers for the elderly and infirm. Other important applications would be co-
robots that can help find and evacuate the injured during first responses to
disasters, improvements in design and control of active prosthetic devices and
exoskeletons, and locomotion and manipulation behaviors for collaborative human-
robot work. This proposal requests funds to organize a workshop focused on
developing new planning and control methods to extend robots? abilities to
transport themselves to work sites and then to perform useful physical work.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A two-day workshop is proposed to encourage collaboration
between the research communities of robotic manipulation and locomotion, both in
academia and industry. The workshop is motivated by the fact that, although the
underlying physical principles driving locomotion and manipulation are similar,
the techniques developed by the two communities are not. The workshop will
analyze the reasons for these differences and explore ideas to bring them
closer, with the goal of cross-pollinating advances in both fields. In addition,
the workshop will consider the impact of industrial efforts to address these
problems.
