Even when there is no logical reason for them to do so, initial status
differences among group members, such as race, class and gender, can organize
interaction in groups. Such organization is often detrimental to both the
individual and the group. We propose four experimental studies to study how
racial inequality in task groups can be lessened. The first two studies examine
how presentation of the group task affects racial inequality. The next two
studies test whether group members can transfer their experiences from groups in
which racial inequality is lessened to new groups.

Broader Impacts: The results reflect upon interactions common to many small
groups, such as research teams or classrooms. Additionally the studies involve
research training for both graduate and undergraduate students.
