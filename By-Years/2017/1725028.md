This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and the
Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) programs. Professor William Jones from
the University of Rochester and colleagues Richard Eisenberg, Daniel Weix,
Michael Neidig and Ellen Matson have acquired a dual source diffractometer
equipped with a cryostat. In general, an X-ray diffractometer allows accurate
and precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule,
including bond distances and angles. The instrument also provides accurate
information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring
molecules. The diffraction studies impact many areas, including organic and
inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument is an
integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of
undergraduate and graduate students in chemistry and biochemistry at this
institution as well as at local primarily undergraduate universities and
community colleges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is aimed at enhancing
research and education at all levels. It is used to determine structure and
bonding in: non-precious metal catalysts for organic synthesis, transition-metal
catalysts, transition metal complexes with non-traditional ligands, ternary
metal oxide semiconductor nanomaterials used in photochemical reactions, and
organometallic compounds.
