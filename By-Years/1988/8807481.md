The human osteology collection housed at the Peabody Museum, Harvard
University, is one of the largest and most important systematic collections of
its type in the country. It consists of over 15,000 individuals from well
documented archaeological, medical, and forensic investigations. These
collections form a broad comparative resource for cross cultural research in
physical anthropology. The increasing demands on the collection by researchers
and lack of adequate storage space have made it difficult to utilize these
collections effectively. To remedy this problem, museum personnel will
reorganize and upgrade the storage facilities, conduct an inventory and
conservation survey, and develop a computerized catalogue system. Human
osteology collections are significant research resources because of the light
they can shed on the changing relationships of culture and biology through human
history.
