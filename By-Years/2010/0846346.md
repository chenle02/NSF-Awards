This project uses holomorphic curves to study questions in the intersection of
symplectic geometry and low-dimensional topology. One main goal is developing an
algebraic framework for the relative version of Symplectic Field Theory, with
applications to contact geometry and knot theory; significant partial progress
has recently been made by the Principal Investigator and other researchers. A
related goal is studying the smooth topology of low-dimensional objects (e.g.,
knots and three- and four-manifolds) via the Symplectic Field Theory of
cotangent bundles. The Principal Investigator has previously used this strategy
to introduce a knot invariant called knot contact homology, which has partially
understood connections to string topology. This project will develop the theory
of knot contact homology by studying its generalization in Symplectic Field
Theory and extending it to invariants of low-dimensional manifolds. Possible
applications include relations to similar homological invariants such as
Heegaard Floer homology and Khovanov homology, and new approaches to problems in
low-dimensional topology such as knot concordance and distinguishing smooth
structures on manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Low-dimensional topology, or the
study of shapes in three and four dimensions, is a classical subject of
paramount importance in mathematics and of natural interest to other sciences,
especially physics. In recent years, many fundamental and longstanding open
problems in low-dimensional topology have proven remarkably amenable to new
techniques from a different mathematical field, symplectic geometry. Much of
this progress has involved the study of holomorphic curves in symplectic
manifolds, which has close ties to string theory in physics. The Principal
Investigator will use his past work on holomorphic curves within the framework
of Symplectic Field Theory to develop new invariants of topological structures
such as knots and three-dimensional spaces. This will likely have interesting
applications to low-dimensional topology, including a long-term goal to resolve
the still-unsolved smooth four-dimensional Poincare conjecture using symplectic
techniques. The Principal Investigator will also pursue several educational
endeavors, including the development of a new general-interest course for
undergraduates, introducing methods of mathematical reasoning through analysis
of patterns in nature, the arts, and everyday life.&lt;br/&gt;
