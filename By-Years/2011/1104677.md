Intellectual merit: Plant mitochondrial genomes are surprisingly different from
those of animals and fungi. They are also involved in such diverse and important
processes as plant growth, flowering and seed set. A significant technological
gap in the study of plant physiology and genetics is the inability to transform
plant mitochondria. Although it has not been accomplished in the laboratory,
horizontal gene transfer between mitochondria of different plant species is
evidence that foreign DNA can be incorporated into the mitochondrial genome. A
new understanding of recombination mechanisms suggests two novel approaches to
the problem: using large homologous regions for targeting, or transforming a
mutant defective in recombination homology surveillance. This research will
enable new approaches to plant biology and biotechnology that are currently
impossible. Three important phases of achieving transformation will be done.
These are to engineer the bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens to target
introduced DNA to mitochondria, to use large regions of homology for
recombination targeting, and the choice of selectable markers. This project will
use multiple approaches to the selectable marker problem, including both
endogenous and exogenous genes.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: This project will
have a tremendous impact on the research infrastructure for plant mitochondrial
biology. This will dramatically open up the field to new experimental directions
and new advances, both for basic biology and in agriculturally important plants.
The project will involve an undergraduate research training experience in the
summer, and there will be an emphasis on broadening participation. A high school
student and teacher training effort at the institution will be incorporated, and
the institution also sponsors an undergraduate summer internship program that
will be integrated into the project.
