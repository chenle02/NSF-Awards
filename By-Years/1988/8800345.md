This three day conference, to be held at the University of Pittsburgh March
9-11, 1988, will present recent advances in nonlinear computational mathematics
and mechanics. There will be 12 to 15 invited speakers and a contributed paper
session. SIAM is a cosponsor, and funding for participant support will be
provided by the University of Pittsburgh, AFOSR, and NSF. Computational
mathematics is a discipline that utilizes methods of mathematical modeling,
algorithm design, and computer simulation to study physical phenomena.
