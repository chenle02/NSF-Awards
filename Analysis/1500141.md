This award supports U.S. participation in the workshop "Asymptotics in
Integrable Systems, Random Matrices and Random Processes, and Universality" held
at the Centre de Recherches Mathematiques (CRM), Montreal, during June 7-11,
2015. In recent years there have been several important developments in the
study of certain equations describing the motion of waves as well as of large
time or large system-size randomly interacting systems (such as the spread of
bacterial colonies or the interactions between many electrically charged
particles). The mathematical methods underlying these developments have
surprising commonalities. This workshop will feature presentations by over two
dozen experts in these diverse fields to present their recent research results
and discuss directions of future efforts. About 25 more participants are
expected to be present, including many researchers in their early careers. The
workshop aims to advance the field and also to help the young researchers to
identify important and promising new research directions.

The topics of workshop include integrable systems, random matrices andrandom
processes, and their possible novel applications. These three areas have
benefited from each other over the last two decades. In recent years all of them
have seen new significant developments. This workshop aims to foster the
exchange of these new ideas and developments by bringing together experts in
these three areas to discuss progress and challenges.
