Many animals use odors to find food and mates, but the environmental
distribution of odors is very complex in turbulent environments. Determining the
ways that animals use odor and flow information will clarify the capabilities
needed for sensory nerve cells and brain activity to guide chemosensory
navigation. This project combines detailed measurements of odor concentration
and flow velocity fields with behavioral measurements of blue crabs underwater
performing chemically mediated foraging trials. Novel laser fluorescence and
digital particle-tracking technology is used with advanced videography to obtain
three-dimensional data about the chemosensory cues, including multiple
elevations above the bottom. Analysis will test the involvement of the
antennules, the relative importance of local versus global hydrodynamic cues,
the use of chemosensory 'contrast' across the body for turning cues, the use of
vertical chemosensory cues for posture and locomotion, and how the flow
environment affects signal structure and animal performance.&lt;br/&gt; Results
will be important for understanding important properties about fluid dynamic
cues involved in behavior, and so will have impact beyond neuroscience to fields
such as chemical ecology, marine and terrestrial ecology, animal behavior, and
robotics and search algorithms. Broader impacts also include excellent cross-
disciplinary graduate training in biology and hydrodynamics, including minority
recruitment.&lt;br/&gt;
