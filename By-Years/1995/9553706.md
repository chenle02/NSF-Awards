In recognition of the importance of complex technologies to the future of the
United States' economy, the Colorado Community Collegeland Occupational
Education System (CCCOES) proposes to establish the Rocky Mountain Advanced
Technology Education Center (RATEC). The purpose is to provide a comprehensive
educational center to ensure response to the region's identified needs to
provide resources to insure: well-educated mathematics, science and engineering
technicians; effective development of new educational technologies,
internationally competitive manufacturing; and integration of current research
into advanced technical education. Collaboration for RATEC will include: K-12
schools, colleges, universities, business, industry, and government. RATEC will
disseminate information and provide in-service programs in Colorado with
invitations issued to states throughout the Rocky Mountain Region and the
nation. The system of community colleges--utilizing its centralized HEAT Campus
--will coordinate and disseminate curricula and other educational products. The
five technologies are: Community College of Aurora, Metrology: Community College
of Denver, Precision Machining; Front Range Community College, Environmental
Science; Pueblo Community College, Manufacturing; and Red Rocks Community
College, Biotechnology.
