This project investigates three aspects of long-run economic growth: first, the
shape of comparative growth over the past century, second, the extent to which
broad asset price indices - predominantly stock market indices - forecast actual
or expected future economic growth, and third, possible lessons on the links
between financial structure and growth taught by the comparison of Great Britain
and the United States at the turn of the twentieth century. All three parts of
this project will extend in significant ways the baseline of information
economists have to draw conclusions about the relationship between the structure
and performance of financial markets and the shape of long-run growth. Most
importantly, the first part of the proposal - the improvement, extension and
analysis of the long term data - will generate a new database. This new database
would provide a better picture of the shape of productivity advance in the
industrial core of the world economy and diffusion to the periphery of new
settlement over the past century. It would also provide more accurate and
reliable data for future studies of the determinants of long-run growth.
