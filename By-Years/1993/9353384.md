9353384 Reynolds The Chabot Observatory and Science Center Leadership Institute
Planning Project will provide the cornerstone for restructuring science
education in a major urban district. During the project, planning will be done
to develop a multi-year proposal for a Leadership Institute with a focus on
Vertical Science Curriculum Integration and Staff Development. The Institute
would be a cornerstone in restructuring science education in the Oakland Unified
School District (OUSD). The planning activities will bring together OUSD science
teachers, administrators and school board members; other planning partners come
from local universities, national laboratories, industry and the community.
Planning activities will also determine the science equipment and supplies
requirement for OUSD. Preliminary planning has surveyed the current status and
needs of the OUSD and supporting programs for their teachers in the San
Francisco Bay Area. The Institute will serve elementary science teachers. ***
