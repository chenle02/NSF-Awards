This research concerns two areas in geometric algorithms, including the
exploration of some promising connections between them. One area is the
application of random walk techniques in the design of algorithms for sampling
from a convex body, volume computation, and related geometric problems like
bringing a convex body to isotropic position. The key technique is using a
random walk to generate sample points, and the analysis of mixing and other
properties of this walk. Further improvements depend on a number of unresolved
technical questions, mostly in geometry but also connected with Markov chains.
The other topic is geometric representations of graphs, and the application of
such representations in the design of graph algorithms. This has surprising
connections with graph properties and parameters like chromatic number, cliques,
connectivity, cuts, and topological embeddablity. Representations with favorable
properties can be used to design exact or approximation algorithms for many such
problems. There are geometric representations connected with random walks on
graphs, and geometric properties of these representations reflect mixing
properties of the random walk. Applications of these representations in the
analysis of random walk techniques are being studied.
