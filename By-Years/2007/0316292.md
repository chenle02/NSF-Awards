This project will produce (1) a high-resolution portrait of genetic population
structure for a federally Threatened bird, the Florida Scrub Jay and (2)
detailed models of how genetic material moves within and among populations via
dispersal by individual jays. Two independent genetic marker systems
(microsatellites and single-nucleotide polymorphisms) will be used to measure
genetic similarities and differences among populations, using blood samples
drawn from 3,000 individual birds across Florida and analyzed in the DNA-
sequencing facilities at the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology. Statistical
models will predict the level of genetic divergence between any two populations
based on their current and historic geographic relationships, and a simulation
model will predict the genetic fate of a focal population following its
isolation from other populations.

Rapidly declining throughout its remaining range, the Florida Scrub-Jay is much-
loved by the general public and a key "umbrella" species within a dwindling
ecosystem. Public agencies, land managers, and conservation organizations are
eager for results from this project to help select those "habitat islands" that
are critical for continued dispersal and genetic health of the species. The
study has unique value for basic research as well, for it will be the first to
integrate theoretical models of gene flow, field measurements of dispersal,
quantitative estimates of population structure, and a detailed landscape model.
Gene flow models will be refined and tested for application to numerous other
species, including those much less easily studied.
