This project improves instructional capability of computer science and security
faculty with respect to emerging sociological, ethical, linguistic,
communication, and educational issues associated with information assurance and
security. This project provides an intensive institute accommodating groups of
faculty members for two years. Participating faculty develop a portfolio of
educational materials for use in both their own and other educational programs
with the help of subject matter experts. The program objectives are designed to
help improve the capability of participating computer science faculty to teach
effective security practice and design. These include developing a core of
multi-disciplinary subject-matter expert mentors; producing research based
curricular materials; recruiting undergraduate and graduate computer science and
security faculty; developing subject-matter and pedagogical knowledge and skills
of faculty attendees; and facilitating adaptation and implementation of
curricular materials. There are plans to evaluate project outcomes and the
impact of the project model and activities and to disseminate curricular
materials to the broader community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
