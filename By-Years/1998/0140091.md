Previous investigation into the dynamics of a gaseous Bose-Einstein condensate
has revealed a number of interesting phenomena such as solitons and vortices.
The current research is designed to examine the validity of the mean-field
approximation previously employed by including correlation effects using a
multi-configurational approach well known in quantum chemistry. The new method
will be applied to condensates in optical lattices where transitions from
delocalized to localized states are known to occur.
