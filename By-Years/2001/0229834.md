Geometrical and material heterogeneities in faults have long been viewed as a
crucial feature affecting earthquake behavior. More recently, the role of stress
heterogeneities has begun to be recognized as a potentially central feature,
particularly with the demonstration that stress heterogeneities alone already
can produce a remarkably rich and complex set of earthquake-like behaviors on
uniform planar faults. What is missing is an understanding of how the two types
of heterogeneities, the static geometrical and material heterogeneities, and the
dynamic stress heterogeneities, might combine and interact to produce even more
realistic behavior. Building from earlier work in which we successfully
integrated physical models of complex fault systems with the elastodynmics of
repeating events, we are working to continue this line of research of the
interaction of geometrical and dynamical heterogeneities. We are working to both
further develop the theory, by further developing the modeling capability to
extend from the scalar to the tensor case, and to further develop our ability to
test the theory, by exploring the observable consequences.
