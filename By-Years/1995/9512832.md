9512832 Lee Research will be carried out in accelerator physics. The work
focuses on beam dynamics in circular accelerators with emphasis on the effects
of non-linear guide elements and on coherent instabilities associated with high
beam intensities. The Indiana University Cyclotron Facility (IUCF) will be used
for this research. It provides a particle beam which is very well defined in
terms of position in phase space and tracking of individual beam packets can be
done for thousands of turns. Studies will also be carried out in high-energy
electron-proton cooling and in beam emittance growth and halo development. In
addition, the high intensity polarized beam will be used in polarized-beam
transport studies, with emphasis on avoidance of depolarization resonances.
Benefits of the research will extend from improved performance at IUCF for
nuclear physics experiments to high performance in future colliders, neutron
spallation sources, and synchrotron light sources. Research in the above areas
will advance our understanding of the performance and limitations of high
intensity circular particle accelerators. These are high priority topics in
accelerator physics. Education of graduate students and postdocs is integral to
this activity. ***
