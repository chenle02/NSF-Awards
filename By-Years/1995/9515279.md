This project examines a series of political ideas that bear on science: the
political meaning of the neutrality claim in science; the nature of decision-
making and discretion with respect to science; the problem of meaningful
discussion, especially in relation to democratic procedures; the nature of
scientists' actions as representatives of science to other scientists and to
external audiences; and the problem of agency, which is in part the problem of
assuring the funders of science that what they are funding is valuable. Agency
relationships involve persons acting as agents for others, where the special
knowledge and conduct of the agent cannot be readily judged by the buyer of the
services. The research will identify and compare historical alternatives with
respect to the delegation of decision-making power, and the general constraints
on the political organization of science and its relation to users, particularly
the state. Sources of authority and constraint, under the headings of
neutrality, agency, and representation, will be examined The overall goal is to
identify the political means by which science constructs a domain within which
these claims are recognized as legitimate. This award supports the aspect of
that research focused on the problem of agency in relationship to neutrality and
representation, that is to say the contract between science and society,
including the problem of the justification of a state role in science and the
implications of this relationship for the internal organization of science and
the self discipline of science. The project is directed at the production of a
major book that will update the political theory of science in the light of
later criticisms of science and the literature of science and technology
studies, recent work in the history of science, and current changes in the
political atmosphere for science.
