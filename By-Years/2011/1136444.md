The Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans (SACNAS), a
non-profit organization, has been instrumental in improving and expanding
opportunities for underrepresented groups in the science, technology,
engineering and mathematics (STEM) workforce. At the core of the SACNAS' mission
is the organization's marked focus on encouraging students to pursue advanced
degrees in STEM through mentoring, exposure to cutting edge science, and
professional development training offered at the SACNAS National Conference. In
addition to attending scientific symposia, receiving information on various
graduate and internship programs, student participants have the opportunity to
submit abstracts on and present their academic research at poster sessions,
which are judged by professional research scientists and
engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds will be utilized to support the attendance
of students and post-doc in NSF-supported disciplines to attend the National
conference as a vehicle to increase the diverse participation of students in
STEM, particularly in the fields of the biological sciences, geosciences,
mathematics, chemistry, physics, computer science,engineering and the social and
behavioral sciences. The activity creates a unique opportunity for the National
Science Foundation, in partnership with SACNAS, to meet goals aligned with the
America Competes Act, as well as to assist in the development of the
intellectual capital of young professionals in the quest to achieve excellence
in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded by contributions from the
Directorate for Biological Sciences, Directorate for Engineering, Directorate of
Mathematics and Physical Sciences, Division of Earth Sciences, the Division of
Human Resource Development, and the Office of Integrative Activities.
