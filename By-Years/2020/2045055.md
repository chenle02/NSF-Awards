This research seeks to understand and develop remedies for a set of very
difficult problems that face peer production information resources and that have
kept many from achieving high goals that were originally set for them. Digital
knowledge commons like Wikipedia, open source software, and collaborative
filtering systems like Reddit produce enormous social and economic value and
serve as critical information infrastructure. Decades after many of the most
important peer produced knowledge commons were launched, many are under attack
by vandalism, disinformation campaigns, and a range of special interests. At the
same time, many of the largely volunteer-based groups who sustain mature
communities have been stable in membership or shrinking for years. A body of
research suggests that these patterns of decline are due, at least in part, to
commons becoming increasingly closed to contributions. Integrating and building
on a body of social computing and social scientific research, this research will
study why knowledge commons increasingly reject the work of volunteers and
analyze how these communities should structure themselves to better manage
growth. In doing so, the work will advance our general understanding of the
relationship between collective action, public goods, and common pool resource
governance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In four parts, the project will attempt to (1)
develop a theoretical framework to explain why online communities follow regular
patterns of growth and decline and (2) conduct a series of empirical studies of
wikis, open source software, and collaborative filtering sites. Using insights
from the first two parts, the work will seek to (3) identify a set of strategies
for the effective management of lifecycles in a knowledge commons. Finally, the
work will (4) create tools and datasets to help researchers and practitioners
manage online community lifecycles. This work will be conducted in close
collaboration with community managers and disseminated through a series of
outreach-focused meetings, workshops, and information resources as well as
through scholarly publications and university classes. Managers of knowledge
commons can use the strategies developed in this research to navigate tradeoffs
between openness and closure across their communities' lifecycles. By better
supporting the work of peer production organizations, the broadest impacts of
this work are the indirect effects it will have on nearly all Internet users who
rely on peer produced software and information to conduct their business and
personal lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
