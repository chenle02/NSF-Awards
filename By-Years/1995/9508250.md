9508250 Karson This project will conduct mapping and paleomagnetic studies of
the East Greenland rifted margin along the northeast branch of the Atlantic
Ocean, a uniquely uplifted and exposed area of rifted continental margin. The
basaltic lavas of rifted margins are typically imaged on seismic reflection
profiles as a series of seaward-dipping reflectors that record a progressive
subsidence and flexure of the continental edge during the transition to seafloor
spreading. Surface mapping will document the interaction of faulting and basalt
intrusion, and the large fjords will afford natural cross sections of key parts
of the major structures. The onshore data will be integrated with offshore data
to provide a comprehensive view of the internal structure and composition of
this continental margin. Logistical support is being provided by the Danish
Geological Survey. The results of this project will provide a comprehensive view
of the internal structure and composition of this continental margin, and will
be applicable to other rifted margins in a variety of tectonic regimes.
