This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
novel electric-field-controlled magnetic memory devices, where switching of the
nonvolatile memory bits is performed by voltages (i.e. electric fields), rather
than spin-polarized currents or magnetic fields, for extremely low energy
dissipation applications. These memory devices will be used in a Magnetoelectric
Random Access Memory (MeRAM), providing significant advantages in terms of
energy efficiency (up to 100x), density (up to 10x), and scalability (down to
&lt;10nm) compared to state-of-the-art magnetic memories (MRAM) such as spin
transfer torque (STT-MRAM). The improved energy efficiency results from the
suppression of Ohmic losses (heating) since no currents are used. This project
will focus on development and optimization of magnetic bit designs for MeRAM.
Their performance will be tested and compared to identify the most promising
candidates for product development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
impact/commercial potential of this project will be in the broad area of
advanced low-power electronics. In particular, the high memory density allows
for MeRAM to be used as a nonvolatile alternative to replace dynamic random
access memory (DRAM, a $37B market), making it nonvolatile and improving its
speed, energy efficiency, and scalability. Additionally, the excellent energy
efficiency of MeRAM allows it to be integrated with CMOS, potentially resulting
in revolutionary new applications in ultralow-power logic for mobile systems on
chip (SoC). This will result in instant-on nonvolatile electronics, which can be
powered on/off instantaneously without the loss of information. It allows for an
entirely new user experience where traditional boot-up and shut-down times are
eliminated, and provides energy savings by eliminating standby power,
representing a new paradigm in electronics. MeRAM is the only nonvolatile memory
technology that meets all the requirements for such applications.
