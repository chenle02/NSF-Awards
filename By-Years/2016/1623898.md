Within the study of animal behavior questions remain concerning why population
variation in behaviors exist, why individuals sometimes show consistent behavior
across time while at other times they do not, and last why we see certain
behaviors occurring together within individuals, or the expression of animal
personalities. Behavior is controlled by genes and there are a number of ways in
which researchers can ask questions about behavior and the genes that control
their expression. However some of our most valuable investigative techniques,
and the data they produce, are not easily integrated. This is a significant
missing piece to our full understanding of how genes control behaviors. Here a
workshop will bring together researchers from a wide variety of areas within
behavior and genetics to address this missing integration to determine how data
can be brought together and develop training plans and recommendations for
current and future researchers in the area of genetics and behavior. Outcomes
from this workshop will be broadly disseminated to the scientific community
through publications and are of benefit not only to the behavioral sciences but
to studies of ecology, evolution, neuroscience, and physiology - including human
health.
