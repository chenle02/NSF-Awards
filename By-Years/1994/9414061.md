9414061 Guilbeau This proposal from Arizona State University requests partial
support for the 1994 Annual Fall Meeting of the Biomedical Engineering Society
(BMES) to be held on October 14-16, 1994 on the Arizona State University Campus
in Tempe, Arizona. Funding from the NSF will be used for travel support for
invited speakers to the special sessions on Cost Effective Health Care Delivery
Through Engineering and Rehabilitation Engineering. The symposium focuses on
cardiopulmonary engineering, cardiovascular science and engineering, cellular
and tissue engineering, medical imaging, neural engineering, orthopedic
engineering, and rehabilitation engineering. The aim of the conference is to
bring together biomedical engineers to promote the increase of biomedical
engineering knowledge and its utilization. Presenter participants in the
symposium are world leaders in biomedical engineering. Funding requested from
the NSF would provide partial support for invited participants in Cost Effective
Health Care Delivery Through Engineering and the Rehabilitation Engineering
sessions. The results of the conference will be recorded in a Proceedings, which
will be sent to all conference participants and to related organizations and
agencies, thereby making symposium results available to a large audience. ***
