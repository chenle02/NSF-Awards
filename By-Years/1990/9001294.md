This research will study the processes that generate overdispersed
distributions of the hematophagous ectoparasite Oeciacus vicarius (Cimicidae) on
it's colonial host, the cliff swallow (Hirundo pyrrhonata). The study will
combine observations on the spatial and temporal pattern of parasitism with
field and laboratory experiments on the movement of individual parasites. By
fumigating cliff swallow nests to remove parasites and reintroducing fixed
numbers of marked bugs, the study will investigate how factors such as host
quality, host nest density, and conspecific density affect the dispersal
activity of individual bugs. Female swallow bugs will be fed on swallow
nestlings of various ages to determine the advantage of feeding on hosts of
different quality. The dispersal paths of individual swallow bugs under natural
conditions and laboratory arenas will be observed to see if their movements are
random or conform to theories of directed dispersal on a signal gradient
(kinesis). In order to understand the importance of intercolony dispersal of
bugs, whole colonies will be fumigated and recolonization rates recorded. The
predictions of mathematical models will then be compared, based on individual
movement data to observed parasite distributions. The goal is to understand how
the movement behavior of individual bugs translates into an emergent pattern of
parasite infestation.
