Many economic relationships involve one party enlisting another to perform an
action for a fee. An obvious example is employment relationships between a firm
and its workers. Incentive contracts in the workplace make financial reward or
punishment dependent on job performance. Economists have developed an extensive
set of theories to understand the optimal structure of such
contracts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One concern about the use of such contracts is
that they may actually reduce the behavior they are supposed to encourage. Field
studies have compared firms that use formal incentive contracts to firms that
employ implicit contracts, trusting the workers to cooperate in the firm's best
interest. The evidence from these studies suggests that incentive contracts
actually inhibit desired cooperative behavior. Other scholars have suggested
that implicit relationships encourage a greater sense of trust, which then
induces cooperation. Formal incentive contracts reduce trust, and therefore
reduce the actual level cooperation even when they reward cooperative
behaviors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study consists of a series of economic
experiments. In each experiment, participants are matched and given the
opportunity to cooperate in an investment task. The experimental design varies
the contracting environment along two dimensions. The first is the type of
contract between the two parties, and the second is whether participants work
with each other just once or on a repeated basis. The goal is to observe what
contract structure and level of repetition does the most to encourage productive
cooperation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is exploratory. The results will
be of potential benefit to many audiences. In particular, the results will help
managers, employers, and others decide how to encourage cooperation in a variety
of employment settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
