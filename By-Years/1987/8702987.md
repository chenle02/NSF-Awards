This research program is a study of qualitative features of the solutions of
nonlinear partial differential equations and integral equations which are
mathematical models of a number of application areas in mechanics and biology.
Within the broad area of mechanics, the research program focuses specifically on
flows of miscible compressible gases in porous media, equilibrium problems of
phase interfaces, mixture theory and nonlinear viscoelasticity. In the area of
biology, the research program focuses specifically on the dispersal of
interacting populations, the dynamics of aged-structured population and muscular
contraction.
