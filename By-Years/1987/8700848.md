This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the
research of Dr. Blair which is aimed at the preparation and study of the
chemical properties of positively charged halogen complexes. Positively charged
halogen atoms play a significant role in human biochemistry and they function as
reagents used in the preparation of a variety of halogen-containing molecules.
Despite the importance of positively charged or 2-coordinate halogen atoms, they
have not been extensively investigated and they are difficult to isolate. Dr.
Blair has recently circumvented these problems, characterizing such complexes by
X-ray analysis. He now plans to prepare several new types of 2-coordinate
halogen complexes, to examine the chemical properties of this unique type of
complex and to find novel uses for these highly reactive salts. More
specifically, the proposed work entails the synthesis and characterization of
new 2-coordinate complexes of positive bromine and iodine and their application
as new reagents. Complexes to be investigated include bis(quinuclidine)Br+ and
I+ as well as the related complexes of 1,4-diazabicyclo?2.2.2! octane.
Quinuclidine complexes of N-bromosuccinimide and N-iodosuccinimide will also be
studied. New complexes will be characterized by X-ray crystallography, proton
and carbon NMR spectroscopy, and UV-Vis spectrophotometry. The dynamics of the
formation of bis(quinclidine) Br+ from the rearrangement of the dibromo
quinclidine complexes will be probed by NMR and UV-Vis techniques. Refinements
in the application of bis(quinclidine)Br+ as a new agent for the oxidation of
alcohols will be sought to reduce costs and increase the utility of this stable
and conveniently handled source of active bromine. Initial studies to determine
the potential of bis(quinclidine)Br+ and I+ as new agents to introduce radio-
bromine and -iodine into aromatic acids will be undertaken.
