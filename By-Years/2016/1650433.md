The National Science Foundation's (NSF) Inclusion across the Nation of
Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and
Science (NSF INCLUDES) intiative supports models, networks, partnerships and
research to ensure the broadening participation in STEM of women, members of
racial and ethnic groups that have been historically underrepresented, persons
of low socio-economic status, and people with
disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Cincinnati, lead for a tri-
state (OH, KY, IN) project, will convene a three-day conference to convene
national and local experts to explore the best practices that support the
development of a backbone organization in the context of using a social
innovation model for broadening participation in STEM. The intent is to
strengthen the network among participants and leverage learning from the
Cincinnati Strive experience with collective impact across the Midwest and
beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from the NextLivesHere: Social Change
Innovation Summit, will be disseminated in the tri-state region through the
Greater Cincinnati STEM Collaborative (GCSC and the Ohio STEM Learning Network
(OSLN). National dissemination will occur through informal and formal STEM
professional organizations and publications as well as through participation in
the NSF-developed national backbone organization.
