Shapiro 9513728 "Physiological control of Mu-dependent DNA rearrangements" E.
coli and Mu genetics will be used to dissect the araB-lacZ fusion system, the
first rigorously documented example of physiologically-regulated mutation in
bacteria ("adaptive mutation"). In this system, a Mu prophage forms a hybrid
protein coding sequence by joining portions of the araB and lacA cistrons.
Fusion studies using a non-lethal Mu B-KAN(7701 prophage have uncovered evidence
for an activated state preceeding actual fusion formation and suggested that
fusion kinetics are determined at two different levels: (1) Mu
activation/derepression and (2) differential processing of the strand-transfer
complex intermediate in Mu-promoted DNA rearrangements. This project will
capitalize on molecular genetic technology and our ability to manipulate both
the bacterial and Mu prophage genomes to accomplish two specific aims: (1)
identify the nature of pre-fusion intermediates formed by thermal derepression
of B-KAN(7701 strains, and (2) identify molecules in the signal transduction
system controlling fusion formation. These studies will extend our understanding
of how bacteria and other living cells are able to modify the structures of
their genomes. In particular, it will illuminate how differences in cellular
growth conditions activate and influence the natural genetic engineering systems
which all organisms possess. This research will shed new light on evolutionary
processes and our ability to modify cells for use in biotechnology. ***
