9708211 Sanders The grant is for partial support of the 1997 FASEB Conference on
Smooth Muscle held June 22 to June 27. This conference is held every three years
and is an update of our understanding of smooth muscle structure and function.
New developments in molecular biology, patch clamping and imaging have
contributed exciting new insights into mechanisms which control myofilament
interaction, ion channel activity, Ca signaling and cell-cell communication. It
is important to bring together experts in these fields to ask critical questions
related to smooth muscle. In addition to lectures, there will be poster
presentation, and nine young investigators selected from those submitting poster
abstracts will give short presentations in each of the sessions. This conference
will review recent progress in the field and permit extensive interaction
between participants. ***
