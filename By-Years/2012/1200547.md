The research objective of this grant is to determine the atomic-scale mechanisms
responsible for high-temperature surface stability of catalytically-active
transition-metal oxides such as titanium dioxide (TiO2). Since catalytic
performance depends critically on the surface atomic structure and composition,
a stable surface with desired stoichiometry is critical for superior lifetime
performance. Relatively little is known concerning the effect of gas chemistry
on high-temperature surface composition and defect structure of TiO2. This
investigation will use in situ high-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy
and low-energy electron microscopy techniques and establish the dynamics of
surface morphological, structural, and compositional evolution on rutile-
structured TiO2(110).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research program
will lead to the development of high-performance transition-metal oxide
catalysts and catalyst support materials, thermophotovoltaics, and other
devices. The project will encourage the participation of underrepresented
students and promote awareness among high-school students to pursue higher
education in science and engineering at UCLA. Research results will be
integrated into courses for the benefit of students and disseminated through
presentations and publications. A focused session emphasizing in situ microscopy
studies of surface and interface dynamics will be organized to enhance awareness
about this topic.
