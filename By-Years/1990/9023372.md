Using the (VLA) Very Large Array, the astronomers at Northwestern University
have obtained radio observations of the galactic center region and prominent
galactic HII regions that constitute some of the largest continuum and spectral
line data bases in radio astronomy. A large amount of optical spectroscopic data
has also been acquired in the application of high signal-to-noise techniques for
the study of interstellar and Quasi-Stellar Object (QSO) absorption lines. The
image processing tasks required for the optimum reduction and analysis of these
enormous data sets make the ready availability of substantial computer
capabilities essential. This award will provide support for the acquisition of a
mini- supercomputer (IBM RS/6000 powerserver 540) and its peripherals so that
mosiac images of some of the most complex regions of the galaxy can be made and
numerous other research projects currently being carried out by the PIs be
facilitated. Northwestern University has already contributed over $130,000 in
purchasing computer equipment for the PIs and will contribute another $47,000 to
this facility.
