This project will explore a fundamental re-think of robot hand and gripper
design. Current designs use gears to produce large grip forces. Unfortunately,
gears lead to slow, stiff, unreactive behavior, due to friction and reflected
inertia. Gears limit the robot's ability to feel the contact with a task. The
remedy is to eliminate the gears, and couple the latest generation of high-
torque motors directly to the fingers. This direct coupling not only improves
the responsiveness of the gripper, it provides additional perceptual information
to support more intelligent behavior. At the same time, the robot can use more
intelligent behaviors to reduce the required forces, or reduce the duration of
high-force behaviors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The foundation of the work is a two-
port dynamic system model of the coupling between motor and effector. This model
will provide a comparison with competing approaches, including series-elastic
actuators, high gear ratios, strain gauges, and soft fingers. The results will
guide the design of direct-drive hands and controls. Besides exploring the
design principles, the project will develop the controls, perception, and
behavior planning, exploiting direct drive to provide smarter and more dexterous
behaviors. The project will evaluate these concepts experimentally using tasks
typical of key robot applications. The project will publish designs and
software, some aimed at commercial applications, and some aimed educational
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
