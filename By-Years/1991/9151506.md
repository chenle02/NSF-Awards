The aim of this project is to improve the computational and data manipulation
skills of students in biology and mathematics. The purchase of computer hardware
and software enhances the laboratory skills of biology majors and non-majors by
allowing the simulation of actual experiments such as genetics crosses. The
results are analyzed using interactive computer software. By planning biology
and mathematics instruction cooperatively, problem solving, graphics and
statistical inference skills are also enhanced when mathematics students analyze
biology problems
