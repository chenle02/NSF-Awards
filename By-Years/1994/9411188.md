A pressing problem in efforts to improve numerical extended range weather
forecasts is to better predict the establishment and breakdown of persistent
weather regimes. While much effort has been devoted to studying the maintenance
of these regimes, less is known about their life cycles. The principal
investigator will conduct a comprehensive diagnostic study of weather regime
transitions in version 2 of the Community Climate Model (CCM) of the National
Center for Atmospheric Research. Specifically, the PI will attempt to identify
the dynamical and physical mechanisms responsible for regime transitions in the
midlatitudes. The first task will be to validate the statistics, structure and
time evolution of persistent large-scale flow anomalies occurring in extended
integrations of the CCM2. Characteristics of the simulated events then will be
compared with observational analyses. Using model "data" allows the PI to avoid
the problems inherent in observational studies as nonconservative processes and
secondary circulations which are known explicitly in the model and there are no
difficulties with sparse or uncertain observations. ***
