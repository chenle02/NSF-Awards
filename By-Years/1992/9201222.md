The principal investigator will study models of physical systems involving a
large number of components. Many of these components interact and some
interactions are stochastic. Generally there are quantities which are conserved
when the system is viewed globally, and partial differential equations can be
used to describe the evolution of these quantities. Euler's equations for fluid
flow can be derived from classical laws of motion that conserve mass, momenta,
and energy. The principal investigator will study similar types of equations for
other physical systems involving a large number of components.
