Postdoctoral Fellowship: High-resolution imaging of starch utilization proteins
in live human gut bacteria using small fluorescent tags

Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron is one of the most abundant inhabitants of the
mammalian gut. This obligate anaerobe is capable of degrading numerous
carbohydrates, including those that are resistant to digestion by the host. This
process occurs via substrate-specific polysaccharide utilization systems. The
best studied of these is the starch utilization system (Sus). The aim of this
research is to label the Sus proteins with fluorescent unnatural amino acids
(UAAs). The small size of these UAAs means that they are minimally disruptive to
the labeled protein and are conducive to live-cell imaging. Strains with two
labeled Sus proteins will be constructed, and single-molecule fluorescence
microscopy will be employed to observe and quantify the localization and
dynamics of individual proteins and protein complexes on the nanometer scale.

This research will improve understanding of the role of starch breakdown by
symbiotic bacteria during normal human digestion, as well as the process of
carbohydrate metabolism by bacteria in general. The main challenge in this
proposal will be adapting fluorescent amino acids for use in a non-model system
and for investigation by single-molecule fluorescence microscopy. Success would
demonstrate that the promising technique of fluorescent amino acid incorporation
into living organisms is truly generalizable. This project will also provide a
platform for outreach through the UM Women in Science and Engineering (WISE)
Girls in Science and Engineering (GISE) summer camp. Students at the camp will
receive hands-on laser and microscopy demonstrations and learn to use these
tools to examine the behavior of proteins inside cells.
