9632880 Christensen In comparison with plants and animals, fungi are poorly
known and little studied. Taxonomic or systematic organization of our knowledge
of fungal diversity is still rudimentary for many groups, one of the more
conspicuous being the genus Penicillium, the source from some of its species of
the first penicillin antibiotics. Recent taxonomic monographs have varied
greatly in recognizing from 97 to 227 species of Penicillium in the world, most
of which inhabit soil or plant and animal debris. This taxonomic disarray
impedes other important studies in ecology, molecular biology, and evolution of
these fungi. Dr. Martha Christensen of the University of Wyoming, in
collaboration with Dr. Jens Frisvad in Denmark, is studying the morphology,
secondary metabolite chemistry, and growth features of several hundred
laboratory-grown isolates of Penicillium, collected from throughout the world.
Morphological studies of hyphae, spores, and spore-bearing (conidial)
structures, of numerous isolates, will assess the variability and reliability of
key diagnostic features used to identify Penicillium to species. Chromatographic
analyses for secondary metabolites will yield new characters to supplement
traditional morphological features in constructing coherent assemblages of
similar forms, that operationally qualify as species in these asexually
reproducing organisms. Species-level descriptions with notes on habitat and
geographical distribution, keys for identification, and illustrations of
micromorphological features will be brought together in taxonomic monographs as
part of the research. The biodiversity of soil organisms remains poorly studied,
yet ecological and taxonomic investigations affirm the high numbers of species
and their importance in nutrient cycling and other functions. Focusing on one
major fungal genus of soil organisms, Penicillium, this work will lead to
improved taxonomic recognition of species and thus facilitate ecological and
evolutionary studies as well as pharmace utical bioprospecting.
