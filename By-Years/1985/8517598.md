Research will be conducted on factors that affect the dispersion and diffusion
of groundwater contaminants in subsurface flow. The investigator plans to work
on methods to calculate the probabilities of obtaining particular concentrations
of pollutants at selected locations based on information from other locations
where the concentrations are known. This work will be applicable to engineering
design of groundwater supply systems in regions subject to contamination of the
water by substances leaching from landfills and similar sources of pollutants.
