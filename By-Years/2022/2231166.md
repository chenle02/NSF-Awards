A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the
science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and
research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the
Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the research capacity at these
institutions expands the opportunities for students to pursue challenging,
rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that
may be locally relevant, and encourages a faculty community to look beyond the
traditional classroom for intellectual and professional growth. This project
aligns directly with that goal, allowing the institution's faculty and
administrators to design and develop a comprehensive plan for improving and
expanding STEM instruction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Little Priest Tribal College
(LPTC) serves the Winnebago Tribe in Nebraska. The project leaders are
conducting a cohesive set of activities that inform the design of a
cyberinfrastructure upgrade, with the ultimate goal of completely upgrading the
college’s cybersecurity profile. The project will entail the key activities of:
assessing the current cybersecurity profile; identifying potential
vulnerabilities; consultation with experts who are conversant with the profiles
at similarly situated TCUs; and determining specific actions and equipment
necessary to rebuff hackers and avoid data failures. At the end of the planning
period, LPTC should have a concrete plan upon which to develop a stronger
cybersecurity network that will serve the college’s advancing STEM instructional
and research capacity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
