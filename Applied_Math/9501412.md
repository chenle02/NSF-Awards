9501412 Yi This project is focused on problems in dynamical systems and
differential equations originating in science and engineering problems. Its
primary goal will be to study almost periodical phenomena and complicated
dynamics arising in ordinary and parabolic type of differential equations.
Particular attention shall be given to problems of perturbation of invariant
tori, quasi-periodic bifurcations, dynamics of almost periodical parabolic
equations such as asymptotical behavior of solutions, structure of invariant
sets and existence of a global attractor, etc. Techniques from topological
dynamics and nonlinear analysis as well as those found by the PI in his previous
works shall be employed to the current studies. %%% This project is focused on
