Under this grant, the researchers will create a detailed framework for
designing teacher induction programs that emphasize learning about mathematics
and science teaching. The framework will be derived from the profiling of 25
induction programs for middle and high school teachers. Based on this profile,
seven to eight intensive case studies will be conducted, collecting data on
context, content, effects on teacher behavior and on student outcomes. The set
of programs selected for study will represent a variety of induction strategies,
activities and providers.
