The proposal is funded to reconstruct at seasonal resolution the Interdecadal
Pacific Oscillation (IPO) using trace elements and stable isotopes from a number
of 300- 400 year old coral colonies. These presently live in the South Pacific
Convergence Zone near the islands of eastern Fiji, Tonga, American and Western
Samoa. Duplicate cores will be drilled during a single 4-week cruise.
