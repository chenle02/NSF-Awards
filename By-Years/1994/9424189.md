Dr. Margaret V. Merritt and other members of the Chemistry Department of
Wellesley College are being supported to provide a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 1995-97, nine
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a
variety of research projects selected from topics in surface, synthetic,
analytical, and physical chemistry and others. The student participants will be
predominantly women, including rising sophomores who were members of a first-
year minority science mentoring program. At least half of the students will be
non-Wellesley participants, recruited from New England area institutions with
limited research opportunities for students.
