The Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary international
organization in the field of natural language processing. The ACL's annual
conference is the major international conference in this field. This project is
to subsidize travel, conference, and housing expenses of students selected to
participate in the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational
Linguistics: Human Language Technologies Student Session. This session is part
of the ACL HLT conference to be held on June 19-24, 2011 in Portland, Oregon,
USA. The Student Session includes two separate categories of submissions: thesis
proposals and research papers. The goal is to provide a forum for students at
different stages in their research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Student Session
provides a valuable opportunity for the next generation of natural language
processing researchers to enter the computational linguistics community. It
allows the best students in the field to take their first important step toward
becoming professional computational linguists by receiving critical feedback on
their work from external experts, and by making contacts with other students and
senior researchers in their field. The students who are involved in running and
selecting papers for the session also gain valuable opportunities for
professional growth and interaction with the researchers on the organizing
committee of the main conference. The Student Session contributes to the
maintenance and development of a skilled and diverse computational linguistics
and natural language processing research community.
