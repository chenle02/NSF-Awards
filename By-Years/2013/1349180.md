The principal investigators of this proposal are a collaboration of
seismologists, computer scientists, and structural geologists who are developing
computational platforms that can combine seismological and geological
information into three dimensional (3D) representations of Earth structure. They
derive the seismological information from earthquakes, controlled-source
experiments, and observations of the ambient seismic field generated by ocean
waves and other near-surface disturbances. They derive the geological
information from an even wider variety of sources: field mapping,
electromagnetic remote sensing, geotechnical measurements, drilling and well-
logging, fault trenching, and laboratory measurements of material properties.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The systematic integration of such diverse datasets into
unified structural representations (USRs) is a key problem of geoinformatics.
The goal of this project is to develop for community use the complex
cyberinfrastructure needed to manage the ?USR lifecycle?, including the
effective application of high performance computing (HPC) to invert joint
datasets in the iterative improvement of USRs. The lifecycle is initiated by the
integration of several components into a starting model; the starting model is
refined by full-3D tomographic inversion of seismic waveform data; the refined
model is validated for its proposed applications and then disseminated to user
communities. This new model becomes the main component of the starting model for
the next lifecycle.
