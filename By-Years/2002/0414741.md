Ongoing research at Cornell University and the Cornell Center for Materials
Research (CCMR) will greatly benefit by the addition of a MALDI/TOF mass
spectrometer to the CCMR's Shared Experimental Facilities. Research groups in a
number of departments will take advantage of this useful instrument and its
ability to obtain accurate mass spectral data for a wide array of materials,
including organic-inorganic composites, polymers, dendrimers, textiles, and
peptides. A wide variety of interdisciplinary research fronts will be explored
with the help of MALDI/TOF mass spectrometry. These endeavors include: (a) the
development of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs); (b) surface structure and
phase behavior of polymers and macromolecules; (c) immune receptor signaling;
(d) environmentally friendly polymers and plastics, (d) cellulose dissolution
and processing; (e) peptide-dye conjugates as biosensors; (f) fiber morphology
and structure; (g) photopolymer and photoresist development; (h) polymerization
processes and organic-inorganic hybrids; and (i) nanoparticles and mesoporous
materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The geographic location of the Cornell
University campus relative to other major research institutions and metropolitan
areas imparts a growing need for on-campus, centrally located analytical
instrumentation for all departments, units, colleges, and affiliated businesses.
Access to the CCMR's Shared Experimental Facilities to regional colleges and
universities allows for intensive research collaborations to be fostered among
the Cornell faculty and those appointed at other schools and departments. The
acquisition of a state-of-the-art MALDI/TOF mass spectrometer on the campus will
greatly benefit the many researchers working at or with Cornell University that
are involved in materials science research and instruction.&lt;br/&gt;
