The oceanographic instrumentation program supports requests to acquire
instrumentation for the collection, processing and analysis of oceanographic
data. This proposal from the University of California requests funding for
equipment that will be used to support NSF-funded research cruises aboard the
R/V's MELVILLE, NEW HORIZON, THOMAS WASHINGTON, and SPROUL. The former two
vessels are owned by the Navy, while the latter two are owned by the University.
All are operated by the University and provide extensive support to NSF funded
oceanographic research projects.
