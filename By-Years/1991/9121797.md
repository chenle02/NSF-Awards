This award is to purchase a Salisbury dextrous robot hand and a VPL Dataglove
to support research on assembly systems. The addition of the robot hand to
Carnegie Mellon's existing PUMA arm will form a powerful testbed for research
requiring flexible assembly operations. The research projects will be examining
issues surrounding the kind of information that should be collected from vision,
the kind of suitable description methods, and the kind of assembly operations
that can be achieved by an assembly system. In robotic assembly systems, a
dextrous hand is essential to extend the research to a wider range or realistic
assemblies. An example of such a research project is how to represent a human
hand, how to recognize a hand configuration from observation, and how to map
such a configuration to a robot hand configuration. Other projects in robotic
assembly systems involve evaluating at the design stage, how easily products can
be assembled, assembly planning and execution, and establishing a design
methodology for computer vision systems with respect to hand-eye systems.
