Simulation is potentially the most important computing application in modern
scientific and engineering research. There are two broad classifications of
simulation models: continuous simulations and discrete event simulations.
Continuous simulations are the more popular of the two approaches largely due
their explicit mathematical structure in the form of differential or difference
equations. While discrete event simulations have some advantages in terms of
generality and computational efficiency, they do not yet have an explicit
mathematical representation with anywhere near the generality and utility of
differential equations. The lack of mathematical structure for discrete event
simulations accounts in part for the apparent ad- hoc and complex nature of
these models. Discrete event simulations are typically very difficult to program
correctly. The ultimate research goal is the development of a mathematical base
that will have practical applications in developing and experimenting with
discrete event simulation models.
