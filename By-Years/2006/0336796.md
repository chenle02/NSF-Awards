National Academy of
Science&lt;br/&gt;SRS-0336796&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In response to a
formal mandate from Congress, the Committee on Women in Science and Engineering
(CWSE) and the Committee on National Statistics of the National Research Council
will conduct a study to assess gender differences in the careers of science,
engineering, and mathematics (SEM) faculty, focusing on four-year institutions
of higher education that award Bachelor's and graduate degrees. The study will
build on the Academy's previous work and examine issues such as faculty hiring,
promotion, tenure, and allocation of institutional resources including (but not
limited to) laboratory space.
