The research objective of this award is to determine the phase diagram of
biomimetic membranes under tension. Membranes in eukaryotic cells are mixtures
of hundreds of lipid species. The lipid diversity enables membranes to phase
separate and form domains, called rafts, which play a critical role in cell
functions such as signaling and trafficking. The phase transitions underlying
raft formation have been extensively studied as a function of temperature and
composition. However, the third dimension of the phase diagram, i.e., the
tension, is still unexplored because membrane tension is difficult to control
and quantify. To overcome this challenge, the PI will develop two novel
approaches, capillary micromechanics and electrodeformation, in which the
tension is regulated by the area dilation accompanying deformation of a vesicle
(a closed membrane). These experimental tools will be applied to study the
tension?induced domain formation and evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If
successful, the new tension-control techniques would allow to determine the
complete phase-diagram of ternary biomimetic lipid bilayers. The knowledge
gained from this work could lead to potentially transformative insights into the
biomechanical signal transduction mechanisms that couple changes in membrane
tension to changes in cell shape and motility. This will benefit the development
of bioengineering applications that exploit the cell signaling and trafficking
machinery, e.g., targeted drug delivery. The educational component of this award
will involve the introduction of membrane biophysics topics into the traditional
engineering curriculum. In particular, the PI will incorporate the results from
this research in the graduate course Complex Fluids and Interfaces. The PI will
also leverage successful outreach programs at Brown University to communicate
the relevance and significance of the work to the general public and attract
students from underrepresented groups in science and engineering.
