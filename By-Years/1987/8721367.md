The species of North American Vitus are economically important as rootstocks
for the commercial grape (Vitus vinifera L.) and as a germ source for production
of new hybrid cultivars. For native species of grapes to be most effectively
used in the development of new cultivated grapes, their genetic diversity and
relationships must be adequately assessed. Chemical analyses of leaf pigments
(flavonoids) and anatomical characteristics will be used to infer relationships
among species in two genera of Vitus from eastern North America. Results from
this analysis should help determine the most likely evolutionary history of the
species and produce a classification that will prove useful from an agricultural
and systematic standpoint.
