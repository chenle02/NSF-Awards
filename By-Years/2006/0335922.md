0335922&lt;br/&gt;Ishii&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a short-term
U.S-Japan Planning Visit in preparation for development of a NSF Research
Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. The collaborators are
Professor Yoshitaka Ishii and Michael Trenary at the University of Illinois at
Chicago and Professor Kiyonori Takegoshi at the Kyoto University in Japan.
Professor Kazunari Domen at the Tokyo Institute of Technology and Professor
Yoshinori Yamamoto at Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan will also be involved
in the planning. The expected collaboration will impact a variety of fields
including solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), surface
spectroscopy, coherent control and organic synthesis. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The
collaborators have complementary scientific expertise in the field. The broad
impact of the REU program will be to produce scientists with an international
research background from early in their careers. The exchange of ideas and data
with Japanese experts in the field will enable U.S. participants to advance
their own work, and will set the stage for future international collaborative
projects. &lt;br/&gt;
