This award is for partial support of United States scientists participation in
the International Conference on Mechanics, Physics, and Structure of Materials
to be held at Aristotle's University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece in
August 1990. The main objective of this interdisciplinary meeting is to bring
together specialists from various fields such as engineering, physics, materials
science, and mathematics and contrast their views on mechanical behavior with
emphasis on plastic flow and fracture. Emphasis will be put on nonlinearity and
pattern forming instabilities, as well as their implications into the
understanding of the mechanical behavior of novel high-technological materials.
The relevance of the notions of bifurcation, self organization, fractals, and
chaos will critically be examined for the case of solids and the their
microstructures. In this connection, the outstanding problem of the transition
from microscales to macroscales will again be addressed.
