This research project lies in a subfield of mathematics known as arithmetic
geometry. Many of the questions in the project are motivated by the philosophy
that information about algebraic equations over the integers can be obtained by
geometric methods. Solution to the problems under study in this project will
have substantial impact on research in cryptography, theoretical physics, and
quantum computing.

In more detail, the investigator will study the connections between arithmetic
on a Shimura variety and L-functions and Eisenstein series. In different
projects, he aims to prove various arithmetic Siegel-Weil formulas, determine
when a special divisor is cohomologically trivial but not rational trivial in a
Picard modular surface, prove a conjecture of Gross and Zagier on algebraicity
of CM values, continue to work on Colmez conjecture, and study the rationality
and integrality of unitary modular forms in terms of their Fourier-Jacobi
coefficients.
