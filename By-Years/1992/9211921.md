The National Research Council (NRC) will continue its activities in support of
the U.S. Global Change Research Program and related international research
programs, through its Committee on Global Change Research (CGCR). This Committee
will advise Federal agencies through the interagency Committee on Earth and
Environmental Sciences (CEES) Working Group on Global Change on scientific
planning for the U.S. Global Change Research Program. The CGCR will: (1)
formulate scientific recommendations for coordinating the U.S. Global Change
Research Program with internationally planned activities; (2) provide liaison
between international and U.S. planning efforts by serving as the U.S. national
committee for the international programs on global change; and (3) hold frequent
meetings with representative of the CEES Working Group on Global Change to
assure coordination of NRC activities and to communicate science needs of the
U.S. Global Change Research Program. The CGCR will coordinate its activities
with those of other NAS/NRC boards and committees working in related areas, and
will develop a comprehensive NAS/NRC proposal, to be submitted to the Federal
agencies for FY 1992 funding, that will encompass all NAS/NRC activities
undertaken primarily for issues related to global change.
