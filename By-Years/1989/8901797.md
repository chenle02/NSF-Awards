Dr. Schiffer and his colleagues will conduct research in experimental
archaeology to determine the effects of various surface treatments on a number
of important performance characteristics of low-fired, traditional ceramics. The
relationship between such treatments as burnishing, smudging, corrugation, cord-
marking, and stuccoing and the dependent variables including thermal shock
resistance, heating effectiveness of cooking vessels, abrasion resistance,
firing success, impact resistance and permeability, and evaporative cooling
effectiveness will be examined. Experiments will be conducted on replicas
(vessels and briquettes) using behaviorally relevant testing procedures. In a
final stage of the project, predictions based on the experimental studies will
be subjected to tests using ethnographic evidence. Two years of support will
allow Dr. Schiffer's Laboratory of Traditional Technology to continue innovative
studies of traditional ceramics. Although archaeologists have focussed on
surface treatments of pottery for decades and devised elaborate typologies to
categorize them, they have always assumed that variation reflects "style" and
does not serve a functional purpose. Dr. Schiffer has argued that, to the
contrary, seemingly insignificant differences may affect the functional
characteristics of a vessel and that traditional potters realized this and
designed pieces with such considerations in mind. Because standard techniques of
ceramic analysis were not developed for pottery fired at low temperatures and
not directed towards such functional questions, Dr. Schiffer has devised and
applied a series of behaviorally relevant techniques. This research is important
because it will allow archaeologists to analyze pottery in a new and potentially
significant way. Potsherds preserve well in archaeological sites and in many
regions constitute the major class of data recovered. Therefore, they are the
focus of much archaeological attention. With the techniques developed by Dr.
Schiffer, these remains should yield new classes of information.
