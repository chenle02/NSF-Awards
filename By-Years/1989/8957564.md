Professor Sibert is a Presidential Young Investigator awardee. His research is
in the Theoretical and Computational Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division. He will study the mechanisms and pathways of intramolecular energy
flow. These studies play a vital role in unimolecular rate theories, laser
induced dissociation, mode selective effects, and the determination of potential
energy surfaces. Alternative quantum mechanical approaches will be explored and
developed for systems with more than two degrees-of-freedom. Effective
Hamiltonians will be developed for vibrational problems using canonical Van
Vleck perturbation theory to understand the complex nature of excited states.
Application of this theory in an operator framework obviates the need for large
basis sets in the analysis of spectra and dynamics by including only the most
central rotation-vibration couplings.
