This award supports the development of methods to determine paleo-elevations
from the physiognomy of fossil plants and to apply the methods to constrain the
history of regional elevation changes of western North America. Using
multivariate statistics, correlations will be sought among physiognomic
characteristics of plant assemblages, various average temperatures (mean annual
temperature, mean daytime temperature, mean summer temperature, etc.), and
various average moisture parameters (relative humidity, vapor pressure, or
mixing ratio of vapor to dry air). The goal is to determine what average
temperature and what moisture parameters can be determined from fossil
assemblages, and what uncertainties characterize such determinations.
Simultaneously, meteorological data will be used to search for thermodynamic
variables of the atmosphere that are as independent of altitude and longitude as
possible. Specifically, the moist static energy and the equivalent potential
temperature will be calculated using mean temperatures and corresponding mean
mixing ratios for meteorological stations in North America. In combination,
these parameters will determine paleo-altitudes and allow a better determination
of climate and environmental history.
