9307105 Cheng Three cohesive experiments are proposed to study rhizosphere
processes in natural soil conditions. In the first experiment, root respiration,
rhizosphere microbial respiration and root exudate composition will be measured
via an isotopic trapping method under both gnotobiotic and natural soil
conditions. In the second experiment, the effect of soil faunal grazers on the
assimilation efficiency of root exudates will be assessed using both an isotopic
trapping and filter-out-grazers techniques. In the third experiment, the
proportion of rhizosphere microbial respiration from associative N2-fixation
will be measured by an isotopic trapping plus soil nitrogen manipulation method.
%%% Results from the first experiment will answer the question: how relevant are
values of rhizosphere measurements obtained from gnotobiotic conditions to the
real soil environment? Results from the second and the third experiments will be
used to test the hypothesis that rhizosphere associative N2-fixation and faunal
grazing of rhizosphere bacteria are two important biotic factors controlling the
microbial assimilation efficiency of root exudates in situ. Findings from this
proposed research will not only enhance general understanding of rhizosphere
processes, but also help to build a dimension of ecological reality to
rhizosphere research. N2= Nitrogen
