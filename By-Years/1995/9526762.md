9526762 Barnes The PI proposes to determine the rate constants and activation
energies of the growth of pyrite from aqueous solutions. Measurements will be
made at 100-300(C and pH from 2 below to neutrality. The flow-through method
will be used where pressure vessels containing polysulfide or ferrous ammonium
sulfate solutions, will be pumped into a reaction vessel containing pyrite seed
grains about 1 mm in diameter. Reaction rate constants and activation energies
will be measured as function of temperature, degree of supersaturation,
polysulfide and other aqueous sulfur species, and pH. Applications of the
resulting data are broad. They supply a quantitative basis for evaluating the
flux of Fe and S into sediments, a major stage of their global cycles. The data
also constrain the rates of formation of strongly magnetic greigite and of its
reaction to form pyrite. From this information, the interpretation of
paleomagnetic characteristics of sediments can be better understood where
magnetite is absent to determine, for example, when the magnetic state was set
and how it was preserved. An especially valuable application is to mineral
exploration due to the high abundance of this mineral in ore-containing
environments.
