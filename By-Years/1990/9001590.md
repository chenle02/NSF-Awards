Dr. Erwin D. Poliakoff is supported by a grant from the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to study synchrotron radiation induced fluorescence from
molecular ions. These measurements give valuable insight into how electronic and
nuclear motions are correlated in excited molecules; moreover, these results
will also tell us about the origins of various light sources in the galaxy. This
work focuses on the correlation of electronic and nuclear motion (Franck-Condon
breakdown), as well as related electron correlation effects (continuum
coupling). Dispersed fluorescence has been used in previous work to demonstrate
that resolution is not limited by the excitation band width. This capability
will permit studies that would not otherwise be feasible, including work on the
photoionization of van der Waals species, transfer of shape resonant character
between ionization continua and fluorescence from doubly-charged diatomic ions.
