This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to study
the feasibility of a&lt;br/&gt;simple and practical narrow-bandwidth vacuum
ultraviolet (VUV)laser light source,tunable&lt;br/&gt;around 157 nm.This work
will combine recent advances in laser technology and
nonlinear-&lt;br/&gt;optical techniques with previously-studied frequency-
conversion schemes.A doubly-resonant&lt;br/&gt;four-wave mixing in a guided-wave
geometry will be used to convert UV light into the VUV.&lt;br/&gt;Extrapolation
from previously observed conversion efficiencies shows that the
overall&lt;br/&gt;conversion efficiency of this process may be increased by
100-1000x,from ~10 -4 to near-unity&lt;br/&gt;efficiency.The laser system that
will be developed to drive this process will be small-scale and&lt;br/&gt;all
solid-state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial potential for such a device
promises to radically-improve the practicality of VUV light sources over current
laser systems,and will find immediate application as a tool for development
of&lt;br/&gt;157nm lithography for manufacturing of integrated circuits,and well
as in a variety of other&lt;br/&gt;basic science and technological applications.
