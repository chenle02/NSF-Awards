This experimental nuclear physics research program is focused primarily on
determining the properties of neutron-rich exotic nuclei at or just beyond the
neutron dripline. In the lightest mass region (Z &lt; 9) relatively little is
known about the properties of unbound nuclear ground and excited states.
Experiments designed to determine these properties are carried out using the
Coupled Cyclotron Facility (CCF) at the National Superconducting Cyclotron
Laboratory at Michigan State University, along with the coupled MoNA-LISA arrays
(Modular Neutron Array and the Large-area multi-Institutional Scintillator
Array) in conjunction with the Sweeper Magnet. A central component of this
research program is undergraduate student participation in every aspect of the
research. Students participate in the experimental runs, including in
preparation beforehand and in the analysis afterward.&lt;br/&gt;Results from the
this research program will advance knowledge of nuclear structure far from
stability. Opportunities for undergraduates to participate in this cutting-edge
research, and to interact with the larger nuclear physics community, provide the
kind of experiences that help recruit future generations of nuclear scientists.
