9308415 Seales This is the first-year funding of a three-year continuing
Research Initiation Award. The long-term goal of this research is to develop and
implement new strategies for building complete models of three-dimensional
objects from video sequences. Efficient 3D model-building capabilities are
fundamental for mobile robot vision tasks such as learning new shapes,
manipulating intricate objects, navigating around obstacles, and recognizing a
known shape. A central focus of this project is the analysis of the problem of
recovering global three-dimensional shape information from an image sequence
under minimal viewing conditions using image curves that are formed from both
smooth and non-smooth components of three- dimensional shapes. The viewing
situations include two main scenarios: active feedback strategies where
information in the image sequence is used to control the camera system; and
uncalibrated camera rigs where camera parameters are unknown. This work is based
upon an analysis of the behavior of projected curves in image sequences and
their relationship to three-dimensional shape. This research will provide a
deeper theoretical and empirical understanding that will lead to the development
of efficient, implemented and tested strategies for building detailed models of
three-dimensional objects under minimal viewing conditions.
