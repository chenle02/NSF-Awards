This award provides funding for the third edition of the Conference on Modeling
High Frequency Data. The conference is a joint effort between Stevens Institute
of Technology (Ionut Florescu), University of Texas at El Paso (Maria C.
Mariani), and Purdue University (Jose E. Figueroa-Lopez). The purpose of the
conference is to improve the models used to analyze data sampled with high
frequency. Tools available from a variety of areas such as statistics,
stochastic processes, statistical mechanics, clustering, and systems will be
exposed. Academics, industry professionals, and government regulators will meet
to collaborate, with the goal of advancing the quality of research currently
under development in the field. The previous editions were instrumental for the
development of the field by bringing attention to important problems in high
frequency data modeling and proposing cutting-edge solutions to some of these
problems.

The scientific motivation for the conference arises from the fact that
organizing a conference in the trade capital of the world has the potential of
bringing together the best mathematicians, practitioners and regulators to help
developing and improving the modeling aspect of the marketplace. The main
training objective of this meeting is to continue exposing today's economic and
modeling problems to current graduate students in the hope that this will
improve the quality and impact of their research.
