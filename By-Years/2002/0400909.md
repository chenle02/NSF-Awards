Problems in three directions of geometric complex analysis are considered. The
first collection of problems comprises basic research in sampling and
interpolation, the theory that underlies the current technology of storing and
retrieving information digitally. The second collection of problems studies a
certain class of metrics for holomorphic vector bundles on compact complex
manifolds, and is connected to a complex analog of Hilbert's 17th problem. It
also ties in with current work by algebraic and analytic geometers on multiplier
ideal sheaves. The third collection of problems concerns the so-called Density
Property for complex manifolds, introduced by the PI in his PhD thesis and
developed significantly since then. The three directions are intimately related,
and cannot be completely separated.

The main goal of the work on sampling and interpolation is to use the geometry
of the space under consideration to determine the density of points needed to
sample functions sufficiently so that they are faithfully stored in some digital
incarnation. Conversely, the reconstruction of the functions from their digital
realization requires the use of sufficiently few points. The geometric
information that comes into consideration is the curvature of the metrics on the
space. This idea was already considered by Einstein in his work on the General
Theory of Relativity. The need to understand metrics rather well brings us in
contact with the second circle of problems; here we consider certain metrics
that arise naturally in problems of complex and CR geometry. Finally, the ideas
considered have a completely different nature when discussed on spaces with the
density property. These spaces, which are highly symmetric, have incredible
flexibility properties, and enable one model to rather diverse dynamical
phenomena, while still being able to use the complex structure to impose certain
constraints on the results of the dynamics.
