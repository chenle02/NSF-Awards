This project will examine changes in gender differences in victimization of men
and women by lethal violence, including suicide, homicide, and accidents. The
theory motivating the research leads to several predictions: (1) Regarding time
trends, gender differences in lethal violence first narrow and then widen with
continued change toward gender equality; (2) regarding age, the reversal in the
direction of the trend in gender differences occurs more quickly and with a
smaller narrowing among younger groups; (3) regarding national differences, the
adjustment occurs more quickly and with a smaller narrowing among nations with
collectivist political institutions. The project will gather data on: mortality
from suicide, homicide, and accidents for men and women of all ages in 18
nations between 1953-1992; over-time female labor force participation, national
product, unemployment, marriage, divorce, fertility rates, public spending for
children, social protection, and maternity care; national indicators of
institutional structures promoting collective social protection, social
equality, and women's participation in the economy and polity. With these data
we can describe trends, patterns, and variation in gender differences in lethal
violence using measures of mortality from suicide, homicide, and accidents for
each age group, year, and nation, and study the effects of dynamic and
institutional variables. Although focused primarily on macro-level processes,
the findings should provide a more detailed understanding of the consequences of
changes in gender inequality, and shed light on the experiences of gender
equality in the United States compared to the experiences of similar high income
democracies with different policies and structures of collective social
protection.
