This research is concerned with automated theorem proving in type theory, which
is also known as higher-order logic. The basic purpose of this research is to
automate and facilitate the use of rigorous logic. Rigorous reasoning plays (or
should play) an important role in a wide variety of intellectual endeavors, and
computerized systems which facilitate the use of logic have many important
potential applications. The focus of this research is on proving theorems of a
formulation of higher-order logic known as the typed lambda-calculus. This
formal language includes first-order logic, but in a practical sense it has
greater expressive power, and it is particularly well suited to the
formalization of mathematics and other disciplines and to specifying and
verifying hardware and software. Part of this research involves continued
development of an existing computerized theorem proving system called TPS, which
can be used to construct and check formal proofs (in natural deduction style)
interactively, semi-automatically, and automatically. In automatic mode, TPS
first searches for an expansion proof, which expresses in a nonredundant way the
fundamental logical structure of proofs of the theorem in a variety of styles,
and then transforms this into a proof in natural deduction style. The
interactive commands for applying rules of inference are available in a related
program called ETPS (Educational Theorem Proving System), which is used
interactively by students in logic courses to construct natural deduction
proofs. The possibility of using TPS in a mixture of automatic and interactive
modes makes it an attractive tool for working on complex logical problems in a
variety of disciplines. Research will continue on methods of searching for
expansion proofs, methods of translating back and forth between expansion proofs
and natural deduction proofs, on higher-order unification, on enhancement of TPS
as a useful logical tool, and on related problems and question s. ***
