0116234&lt;br/&gt;Dias&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation award to
Old Dominion University will provide support for acquisition of a stable isotope
ratio mass spectrometer and related instrumentation for researchers in three
departments. It is expected that the new instrumentation and the
interdepartmental research and training that it offers will foster inter- and
multi-disciplinary approaches to a broad range of problems in marine chemistry,
biology and related environmental sciences. Old Dominion University will
contribute cost-sharing of more than 47% of the cost of this project from non-
federal funds. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
