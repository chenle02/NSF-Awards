This theoretical research grant is jointly funded by the Divisions of Materials
Research and Physics. It provides support for four researchers who are applying
field theoretical techniques to a variety of condensed matter and particle
systems. Topics to be studied lie in the following areas: low temperature
physics including transport and thermodynamics of many-particle systems, the
quantum Hall effect, strongly correlated Fermi systems, mesoscopic systems,
superconductivity and superfluidity; field theory; complex fluids; neutron
stars; the early universe; and, matter under extreme conditions. %%%
