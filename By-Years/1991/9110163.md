The objective of this research is to develop polymers which will selectively
bind specific metal ions from aqueous solutions containing many ions, and may be
reversibly regenerated without creating additional ionic wastes. A potential
application of these polymers would be removal of heavy metal ions from aqueous
waste streams. The use of macrocytic ligands for the design of such polymers is
investigated. Polymer-bound crown ethers, coronands, podands, and cryptands
characterized. A series of experimental studies are performed to establish the
optimal polymer design. Polymer structural features are characterized using 13C
NMR, while NMR relaxational studies provide information about the
microenvironment of the polymer-bound ligand. A novel synthetic technique for
producing polymer-bound pseudocrown ethers in situ during free radical
polymerizations is also investigated. Theoretical analyses including Monte Carlo
and molecular simulations are performed to provide insight into the underlying
interactions among the macrocytic ligands, the polymer backbone, and the ions.
