The gap between what is known to be effective in STEM education and what is
actually practiced in U.S. schools and colleges is growing. The present research
applies concepts drawn from theorizing about the external validity of programs
and pairs them with diffusion of innovation theory to conceptualize and
operationalize the Model for Accelerated Diffusion. This model will be applied
to the topical domain of effective STEM education programs as a promising means
to close evidence-practice gaps.

After conceptualizing a best fit between program external validity and diffusion
theory, the research team will define an applied field test of the new model's
predictive utility for effective STEM education programs. The team will then
specify a STEM topic of study, identify the program population, derive a
purposive sample of effective STEM education programs, identify STEM teacher
networks, and determine the research design for a field test. The research team
will also seek out STEM education researchers as potential collaborators for a
follow-up field test of the model and its approach for accelerating the
diffusion of proven pedagogical innovations.
