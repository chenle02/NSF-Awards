This effort will acquire and install compute cluster components to support
several research activities at Caltech's Applied and Computational Mathematics
(ACM) department. The components will be used to expand the Shared Heterogeneous
Cluster (SHC) at Caltech's Center for Advanced Computing Research (CACR). SHC is
a teraflops class machine that is optimized for high precision parallel codes.
The additional components will increase its peak capacity by about 400 gigaflops
and 160 gigabytes. The expansion of SHC will provide computational support to
the research of three faculty members in ACM: Drs. Oscar Bruno, Emmanuel Candes,
and Tom Hou. These faculty members and their ACM colleagues work on some of the
most intellectually challenging problems in mathematical algorithms. These
problems are characterized by multiple scales, inhomogeneity, and the sampling
of very complex spaces. The applications are wide ranging, including
electromagnetic modeling, optimal sampling for MRI biological imagery, and
computing underground material flows for geophysics problems. In each case,
progress in algorithmic development depends on access to large-scale computer
resources.

This effort will expand an existing shared compute cluster (named SHC) to
support several research and education activities at Caltech's Applied and
Computational Mathematics (ACM) department. The expansion of SHC will provide
computational support to three faculty members working on some of the most
intellectually challenging problems in mathematical algorithms. The applications
are wide ranging, including electromagnetic modeling, optimal sampling for MRI
biological imagery, and computing underground material flows for geophysics
problems. The expansion will have broader impacts in education and, potentially,
public outreach. ACM has a vital educational role at both the graduate and
undergraduate level at Caltech. As computational science emerges as the third
pillar of scientific discovery, this role will increase. SHC will also be used
to produce compelling images of numerical calculations to help better explain
the science. The SHC expansion leverages significant existing resources and will
support several promising research areas, provide students with advanced
computational capabilities, and help show the public the value of computational
mathematics.
