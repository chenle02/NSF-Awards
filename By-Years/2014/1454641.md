Dynamic social networks have the potential to revolutionize the way social
networks are used. Event/context-based social networks can be used to not only
connect with friends to share content such as pictures and videos for fun, but
can also be used in commercial settings such as enterprise, education, training,
agriculture, and healthcare. In dynamic social networks, peers belonging to an
event can be people attending a conference, students in a classroom, employees
of a company, farmers in different parts of the world. However, today's plethora
of social networks mostly have a flat structure centered around the user. This
hinders many users from posting content of certain events/activities to such
social networks as the content may be accessible by many irrelevant peers. For
example, in social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, content posted is
shared with all the users' connections. Even if a facility to organize friends
into groups is available, it is highly static and cumbersome. In group-based
social network such as Google Circles, a user can add another user to his/her
circles without the consent of the latter, thereby compromising privacy and
content security. Services such as Whatsapp have an over-simplified interface
with content being pushed to users in a group, even if the user is not
interested in it. In file-sharing/collaboration services such as Dropbox or
Google Drive, all members of a "shared folder" have control over others' content
if they are allowed to contribute. They can delete or modify others' content,
thus compromising content security. Also these services do not have a user-
friendly interface. Hence, there is a strong commercial impact for cloud-based
dynamic social networks such as eCloud.

This team developed cloud-based service architecture where users can communicate
and collaborate using their devices, similar to human interaction. Their
research explores two architectures: (a) User devices act as thin clients, using
the broadband access networks to access the data residing in the cloud, and (b)
Decentralized architecture where devices collaborate with each other within the
local area (access) networks while in proximity. As an extension of this
research activity, they have developed a prototype dynamic social network
application called e-Cloud and made it available for public use. The proposed
innovation improves content visibility, facilitates content isolation, and
enables users to search for relevant content efficiently. With event/context-
based social networks, users can share content in the relevant social network in
the cloud and make it available for people interested in the content. By
streamlining content sharing with the help of context, dynamic social networks
prevent overwhelming users with irrelevant content.
