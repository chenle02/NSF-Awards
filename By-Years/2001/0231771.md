It is a common intuition that one of the best ways to learn something is to
attempt to teach it to others. The research project is testing this intuition
and its usefulness for educational practice. Central to the work are web-based
"teachable agents" that students teach as a way to learn themselves and that
permit studies of the active ingredients of learning by teaching. The project
will use the agents to help students learn science and mathematics content and
help teachers learn content-specific pedagogy. The intellectual merit of the
work is that the agents provide a method for developing and testing a learning
theory that helps explain the motivational and cognitive benefits of learning by
teaching. By manipulating a teachable agent's available features and use
(something that is hard to do with actual pupils), it is possible to
experimentally isolate different components of the learning by teaching
interaction. A primary measure used to evaluate whether students learn by
teaching includes assessments of students' abilities to subsequently learn from
resources once they have completed their teaching activities. The broader
impacts include a new way of helping teachers understand the learning of their
students, and the development of easily distributed, software that embodies new
learning principles so that others in schools and industry can learn from those
artifacts and create new ones of their own.
