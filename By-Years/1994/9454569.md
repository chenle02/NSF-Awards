The primary purpose of this project is to create a model technology educational
program beginning with one selected discipline and adapting it to other
engineering technologies. The project will also create a model of collaboration
between secondary schools, two-year and four-year colleges, educational and work
force agencies, professional organizations, and private industry. This project
proposes an informal consortium between Houston's Spring Branch Independent
School District, the Northwest College of the Houston Community College System,
the College of Technology of the University of Houston, and selected private
industry partners. The project will encompass 1) a needs assessment of
industrial educational and training requirements, 2) curriculum development at
the secondary, community college, and four-year college levels, and 3)
faculty/student development through educational and industry
mentor/apprenticeship opportunities, and 4) and evaluation of the projects
