This project is mathematical research in the representation theory of Lie
groups. A suitable example of the latter is the group of rotations of a sphere.
Groups like this are important because they occur in many areas of mathematics
(e.g. geometry, differential equations, algebraic number theory, mathematical
physics) as groups of symmetries. Representation theory allows one to take
advantage of symmetries in solving problems. More specifically, Professor Wolf
will complete work on an extension of the theory of Harish - Chandra to general
real semisimple Lie groups. He will complete the development of certain
important consequences of the recently developed duality between two
constructions of Harish - Chandra modules. He will complete and apply the
results of a project that shows in a rather explicit way how all the usual
analytic and geometric constructions of admissible representations are
equivalent for reductive Lie groups. A further aspect of his research plan
concerns the interplay between representation theory and complex analysis.
