9400276 Patton Technical abstract: Microwave magnetic envelope solitons will be
investigated in thin magnetic films. The work will cover: (1) the role of the
dispersion time, the nonlinear response time, the relaxation time, and the
propagation time on soliton evolution, (2) dipole-exchange spin wave solitons,
(3) differences between optical and magnetic solitons, (4) damping, (5)
eigenmode and non-eigenmode solitons, (6) the control of interactions by means
of the carrier phase, (7) profiling of microwave magnetic solitons by inductive
probes and Brillouin light scattering, and (8) solitons at millimeter wave
frequencies. Non-technical abstract: Solitons are nonlinear pulses which
propagate without changing shape and which can pass through each other. Optical
soliton research is important for a fundamental understanding of nonlinear
optics and for communications technology. This program concerns microwave
solitons in magnetic thin films. Such magnetic solitons are of fundamental
interest in the field of nonlinear high frequency magnetics and for microwave
and millimeter wave signal processing and communications technology. The goal of
the work is to reach a basic understanding of nonlinear magnetic wave packets in
thin films. The work will utilize microwave and optical measuring techniques.
