This National Science Foundation Young Investigator project is in the general
area of analytical chemistry, with a specific focus on the characterization of
environmentally relevant aerosols. During the five-year tenure of this award,
Professor Prather and her students will carry out fundamental studies on aerosol
particles that are thought to participate in a number of environmentally
important reactions. The size and composition of individual particles are
measured using a laser-based gating system in conjunction with laser desorption
and time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Particles composed of inorganic salts and
polyaromatic hydrocarbons will be investigated. The goal is to identify the
particle characteristics important in controlling atmospheric reactions. This
project should advance the state-of-the-art of environmentally relevant
analytical measurements, and will provide a more thorough understanding of
chemical processes affecting air quality. Additionally, this award will enable
Professor Prather to further her overall professional development as a
researcher and educator at the University of California at Riverside.
