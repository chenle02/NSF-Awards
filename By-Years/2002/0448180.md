The Board on Earth Sciences and Resources is the focal point for National
Research Council activities related to the solid Earth sciences and resources.
This award continues support for the Board's program of advisory activities.
Most of the Board's programs, whether requested by Congress, requested by
federal agencies, or self-initiated, are conducted by six specialist standing
committees; others are conducted by ad hoc committees. The resulting reports
provide science advise for decision-makers.
