University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SoD: Design Locality: A Concept for Controlling
the Design Complexity of Large Software Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Large
software systems are extremely difficult to design correctly. This difficulty
stems largely from the exponential number of ways in which components can
interact. This project's objective is to develop a design methodology for
constraining interaction in large complex software systems. The central idea is
design locality: synthesis, verification and analysis are applied to small
subsystems; local properties are verified for subsystems in isolation and then
combined to deduce global properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our approach is
``design for verifiability'': design a large system so that verification is
tractable. A mixed methodology will be developed: top-down for design, bottom-up
for analysis and verification. A well-designed system can be decomposed top-down
into small subsystems while its global properties follow bottom-up from
subsystem properties.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;A goal is systems representation in
"pairwise normal form": code that synchronizes a pair of components is cleanly
separated from code that synchronizes other (even overlapping) pairs. Pairwise
composition is a separation of concerns solution that facilitates modularity,
modifiability, and maintenance, applicable to component assembly. Our test cases
are aspect-oriented programming and the SCIRun software, which builds dataflow
networks of components for integrated and interactive scientific computation and
visualization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
