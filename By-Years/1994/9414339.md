9414339 Chang This combined theory-experimental program is to study impact-
induced damage in composite structures. A damage detection technique based on
structural vibratory response to locally controlled excitations will be used.
This methodology requires the integration of sensors and actuators into the
design of the structure. They are interconnected to form a network of multiple
element units. The development of the technique involves the selection of the
excitation signals, damage identification method and development of the
diagnostic element units. ***
