The Atlas of North American English, based on the study of cities over 50,000
population, shows that American regional dialects are becoming increasingly
different as a result of ongoing changes in their vowel systems, leading to
considerable miscomprehension across dialects. An understanding of this process
calls for studies of many more communities and speakers. However, currently used
methods of analysis require several days or weeks to accurately define the vowel
system of a single speaker. This project is based on an accelerated method that
produces ten times as much data in one hundredth of the time required, using
automatic alignment of the sound wave and transcriptions. Methods will be
developed for automatically measuring each vowel in the transcript with an error
rate equal to or lower than that of manual measurement. These techniques will be
tested on a very large database on change in the speech of a metropolitan
community, a series of interviews recorded annually in Philadelphia
neighborhoods from 1973 to 2008.

Dialect diversity is one of the major factors limiting the success of automatic
speech recognition and provides a major challenge for our understanding of the
causes of language change. The methods developed in this project will serve to
accelerate sociolinguistic analysis across other communities and other
languages. Findings from the analysis of the Philadelphia database will
contribute to the understanding of gender differentiation in language change in
progress, the reversal of the direction of change, and the diffusion of change
across neighborhoods.
