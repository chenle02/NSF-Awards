An analytical and experimental study of the dynamics and post-local buckling
behavior of the plastic hinges of steel members under nonproportional loading is
unloaded, and their influence on the earthquake-resisting strength of structures
is investigated. A series of experimental studies are conducted on the inelastic
behavior of structural subjected to selected load combination applied cyclically
and non-proportionally under quasi-static, as well as dynamic, loading
conditions. Two high-speed actuators which are controlled independently are
used. Local instability of the structural members at plastic hinge locations are
observed and recorded by computer-controlled optical device. Based on these
results, an effort is made next to formulated an analytical model similar to the
two-surface materials model to describe the "plastic hinge" behavior of thin-
walled structural members.
