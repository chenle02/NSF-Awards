The Tulane VIGRE project has as its goal the integration of research and
education at all levels above calculus. The mechanism by which this will be
achieved is the formation of Integrated Research Groups within the mathematics
department all of which build on existing strengths. There will be four of these
groups, one in Algebra and Theoretical Computer Science, one in Applied
Mathematics and Scientific Computation, one in Geometry and Topology and one in
Probability and Statistics. Each faculty member will be associated with at least
one such group and graduate students will choose among these groups during the
early years of their graduate career. Postdoctoral fellows will be hired into a
group and that group will be responsible for mentoring. Mentoring will be
vertically integrated, with faculty bearing the primary responsibility for
mentoring all department members. Postdoctoral fellows will mentor graduate
students and undergraduate students. Undergraduate research will be coordinated
through the different Integrated Research Groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
vision of the Tulane VIGRE program is the creation of a department where
research is seamlessly integrated into courses at all levels above calculus and
where students see research as an exciting way to learn mathematics. Students
and postdoctoral fellows will be broadly educated and well prepared for further
education and employment in the mathematical sciences or for academic,
industrial or government careers. Students will have a much better perspective
into how mathematical ideas are used and how mathematics is done than they would
if they just followed a traditional curriculum of listening to lectures and
doing homework exercises. The scholarly life and productivity of the Tulane
Mathematics department will be significantly enhanced by the funding of this
grant.
