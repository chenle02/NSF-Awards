The 8th Lake Michigan Workshop on Combinatorics and Graph Theory will be hosted
by the Department of Mathematics at the University of Notre Dame on May 13--14
2023 (Saturday--Sunday). This annual workshop is targeted towards researchers in
discrete mathematics at institutions in the Great Lakes area. The workshop will
be centered around two series of three tutorial lectures each, focusing on
state-of-the-art techniques in combinatorics and graph theory. There will be
closely related short talks by students and early-career researchers, and a
problem session. There will be ample unscheduled time during the workshop to
allow new research collaborations to commence and active collaborations to be
continued. The workshop will particularly benefit undergraduates, graduate
students, and early-career researchers by introducing them to new research
directions and helping them establish valuable connections with more senior
colleagues. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combinatorics and Graph Theory are two very
active areas of research within the broader field of Discrete Mathematics, with
important ties to disciplines such as statistical physics and algebra. The
confirmed tutorial speakers, Will Perkins (Georgia Institute of Technology) and
Stephanie van Willigenburg (University of British Columbia), will speak about
some of their own recent breakthroughs in these areas. Perkins will speak about
the interactions between combinatorics, statistical physics and theoretical
computer science, while van Willigenberg will speak about the classical topics
of the chromatic polynomial and symmetric functions, and then about a recent
notion, the chromatic symmetric function, that unites these ideas from graph
theory and algebra. For more information please consult the workshop website,
