9502234 Agah This award supports a 24-month Science and Technology Agency of
Japan Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Arvin Agah of the Institute for Robotics
and Intelligent Systems of the University of Southern California. This
fellowship opportunity will enable Dr. Agah to begin a collaborative research
effort with Dr. Kazuo Tanie, the director of the Biorobotics Division of
Mechanical Engineering Laboratory. The investigators plan to study multi-robot
systems, biologically-inspired robotics, autonomous robots, applications of
virtual reality and multi-media to robotics, and computer simulation of
intelligent robots. The proposed project will help develop a scientific
collaboration with a leading robotics researcher in Japan. As a postdoctoral
fellow, Dr. Agah will have the opportunity to become familiar with the research
projects, both in theoretical and engineering terms, at Mechanical Engineering
Laboratory, while contributing to the overall research effort. Therefore, this
proposal fulfills the objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of
scientific knowledge through an international collaboration. ***
