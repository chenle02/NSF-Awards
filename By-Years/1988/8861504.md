This is an SBIR Phase I award for investigation of the construction of a
particle detector using a high temperature superconductor. The new material will
be utilized to fabricate a superconducting tunnel junction device, anticipated
to operate at temperatures attainable by a relatively modest commercial closed
cycle refrigerator. At the present, nuclear radiation detectors with extremely
good energy discrimination have been developed, but they must be operated within
about 1 degree of absolute zero. If successful, this sensor would represent a
major advancement in the art of radiation sensors. It would find immediate use
in many critical fields presently limited by sensor performance.
