9705558 Daehn This integrated program of experimentation, simulation, and
analysis is aimed at a fundamental understanding of powder consolidation by
pressure cycling. The FRG investigates mismatch plasticity in heterogeneous
powder systems induced by cyclic pressure application which induces an
equivalent effect via Eshelby mismatch, albeit at rates suitable for mass
production. Recent experiments demonstrate the dramatic impact of cyclic
pressure on consolidation densities and the even greater impact on green compact
strengths. The former allows processing of powders with high reinforcement
fractions while the latter introduces the possibility of secondary processing of
highly reinforced green compacts, both of which are very challenging with
traditional processing. A series of 2-D and 3-D experiments using real and
idealized powders are compared with analysis and finite element modeling (FEM).
A robust contact algorithm for large-strain FEM is developed for application to
a wide range of micro-mechanical simulation. For each combination of experiment
and simulation, compact densities and strengths are compared as functions of
cyclic pressure application. An improved understanding of mismatch plasticity
via pressure cycling and a robust numerical method for simulating
micromechanical problems involving real contact properties should be developed.
These advances eliminate the need for questionable assumptions inherent in
today's theories and simulations. %%% The impact to the FRG is in several
technological areas. Results from the project will demonstrate methods for
producing powder-processed parts with greater consistency and shape accuracy,
with or without secondary processing. New techniques for processing reinforced
metal matrix composites via powder metallurgical routes will be identified. ***
