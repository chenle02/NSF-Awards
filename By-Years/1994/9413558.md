9413558 Schwab This is an award to provide support for purchase of equipment to
be used in conducting research on the fate and transport of organic compounds of
pollutional significance in the environment. Projects in which the equipment
will be used include the feasibility of using plants to accelerate the
dissipation of potentially toxic contaminants in the environment, especially in
soil. A major use will be in the study of vegetation-mediated removal of
polycyclic and aliphatic hydrocarbons from petroleum contaminated soils. This
proposal was submitted in response to the Instrumentation Development and
Acquisition Solicitation, NSF 93-172, Academic Research Infrastructure Program.
Results of this award are expected to improve the accessibility of modern
research instrumentation for use by this institution's faculty in educating
students and in conducting research on important topics of environmental
significance. ***
