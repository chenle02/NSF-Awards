This award supports participation in the Fourth Mile High Conference on
Nonassociative Mathematics which will take place at the University of Denver,
Denver, Colorado, on July 29--August 5, 2017. Approximately 90 researchers from
20 countries are expected to participate. The conference will bring together
scientists from all areas of nonassociative mathematics and is intended to
promote cross-disciplinary research. The conference will be accessible to
graduate and post-doctoral students and will provide a forum for these beginning
researchers. The organizers are committed to encouraging and supporting
participation of researchers from underrepresented and underprivileged groups.

Nonassociative mathematics is a broad field that interacts with many traditional
mathematical disciplines. The following areas of mathematics will be featured at
the conference: the algebraic theory of quasigroups, loops, Lie algebras and
Jordan algebras; the combinatorial theory of latin squares and triple systems;
the geometric theory of 3-nets and latin square designs; applications of
octonions and related structures in physics; applications of quandles in knot
theory. The meeting will begin with a full day of expository lectures on the
connections between low-dimensional topology and related self-distributive
algebras. Further information can be found on the conference website:
