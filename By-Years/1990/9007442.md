Zwitterionic surfactant solutions consisting of dimethyl betaines in water and
salt-water will be studied using light scattering techniques. Micellar solutions
will be investigated over a broad range of conditions to include varying
amphiphile concentrations, temperature and pressure. The shape, size and
flexibility of grown micelles will be examined together with a search for
micellar liquid crystalline phases formed from worm-like micelles.
