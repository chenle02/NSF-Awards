The principal investigator intends primarily to pursue the goal of
&lt;br/&gt;attacking some of the fundamental problems of the Langlands program
by &lt;br/&gt;means of analytic methods. He is most interested in the case of
base &lt;br/&gt;change for holomorphic forms on GL(2) where a non-soluble base
change is &lt;br/&gt;involved, but the proposed methods should work much more
generally. &lt;br/&gt;At present the intention is to permit the use of the
Riemann Hypothesis &lt;br/&gt;(in an appropriate setting) to achieve this goal.
A second goal of the &lt;br/&gt;proposal is to study some of the fundamental
analytic questions on &lt;br/&gt;L-functions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This
proposal is ultimately concerned with finding methods to solve
&lt;br/&gt;equations. Since the nineteenth century it has been known that
certain &lt;br/&gt;equations have formulas (like the quadratic equation and the
cubic &lt;br/&gt;equation) but that most do not. The cases that interest me are
the &lt;br/&gt;equations with ordinary integer coefficients. It has become
apparent in &lt;br/&gt;the last fifty years that there should be a completely
different way of &lt;br/&gt;studying these general equations by using methods
from analysis &lt;br/&gt;(i.e. derived from calculus) rather than by using
methods from algebra. &lt;br/&gt;The idea is to describe and prove many
properties of the solutions (which &lt;br/&gt;still exist even though there may
be no formulas for them). &lt;br/&gt;
