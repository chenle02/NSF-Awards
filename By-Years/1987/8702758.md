The topic of this research is the algebraic and geometric structure of
integrable systems and the role of Lie algebras. An analytical interpretation of
the bilinear identity, which plays a fundamental role in the theory of tau
function, vertex operators, and field theoretic methods of the Kyoto school in
integrable systems is sought. The investigator will study the relationship
between the tau method and the dressing method of Zakharov and Shabat. Possible
applications are an extensions of the theory of tau function to other integrable
systems, including multidimensional problems. The study of integrable systems is
aimed at improving our understanding the nature of certain physical phenomena
that have the properties of energy preservation, such as solitons.
