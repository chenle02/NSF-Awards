This research program is concerned with some of the physical processes that
occur in thin electrical current sheets and plasma boundary layers in the
Earth's magnetosphere. Special emphasis is placed on the magnetopause current
layer, which forms the outer boundary of the magnetosphere and separates it from
the rapidly streaming solar wind, and the adjacent boundary layers which contain
plasma of solar-wind origin that has penetrated the magnetopause. These boundary
layers are magnetically connected to the auroral-zone ionosphere and thus
provide an important channel for the transport of solar-wind energy from the
outer reaches of the magnetosphere to the ionosphere where it is dissipated. A
second area of emphasis is the current sheet in the geomagnetic tail and the
adjacent plasma sheet boundary layers which play an important role in magnetic
storms and substorms. In both of these locations the magnetic-field reconnection
process is believed to occur and to be of dominant importance. For this reason,
the primary focus of the research is to study reconnection, both at the
magnetopause and in the magnetotail. Steady and nonsteady reconnection will be
examined by use of spacecraft data, analytical modeling, and computer
simulation. A secondary focus of the project is a study of the structure and
stability of the low-latitude boundary layer, located just inside the equatorial
magnetopause, and its coupling to the auroral ionosphere via field-aligned
currents and associated field-aligned potential drops in which particles may be
accelerated to kilovolt energies.
