ABSTRACT

Nanoindentation is an ultra-low load indentation technique that is widely used
to probe the mechanical properties of materials of small volume. This project
aims to extend our understanding of the mechanics and mechanisms of
nanoindentation on a variety of small material structures, including carbon
nanotube forests, thermal barrier coatings, dielectric and metallic thin films,
and polymer films. Reverse analysis algorithms will be developed to extract the
intrinsic mechanical properties of small material systems. The proposed research
develops new and improved understanding of the microstructural mechanisms,
provides new methodologies of determining the mechanical properties through
simple tests, and results in better models for thin film and other small
systems. The broader impacts are through the potential significance of the
research effort in multi-scale modeling and implementing nanoscience and
technology. In addition, the proposed research fully integrates with an
education program that includes undergraduate and graduate enhancement, and the
project is further bolstered by collaboration with industry and other
universities.
