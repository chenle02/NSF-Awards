White This research is on three topics in modeling, analysis, and simulation of
high-frequency circuits and devices: 1. Multipole accelerated 3-D interconnect
analysis; 2. Simulation of clocked analog circuits; and 3. Simulation for micro-
electro-mechanical (MEM) devices. For the interconnect analysis, multipole-
accelerated approach to circuit analysis is being applied to problems of
determining effective and accurate methods to simulate cross-talk effects, and
perform inductance extraction. In simulation of clocked analog circuits,
algorithms for detailed simulation of switched-capacitor filters and switching
power converters are being developed. Initial work in MEM device simulation
explores simulating interactions between mechanical, electrostatic and fluidic
forces, while simultaneously accounting for the behavior induced by the external
circuitry. Algorithms for analyzing both static and transient behavior are being
investigated.
