Technologies powered by big data and artificial intelligence are ubiquitous in
our daily lives. However, their sole reliance on data correlations implies an
inability to reason about cause and effect, and the consequences of their own
behavior. As human interactions and decision making are increasingly supported
by automated digital platforms, there is an urgent need for causal inference
techniques to adapt to the inherently relational data that these platforms
produce and to support responsible data-driven technologies. This project
introduces relational causal inference as the theory and algorithms that address
this need. Through interdisciplinary collaborations, the project will
demonstrate the applicability of relational causal inference to answering
scientific questions from multiple disciplines. Through curriculum development
and mentorship, it will equip high school, undergraduate, and graduate students
with the skills necessary to develop modern-age data literacy and research
skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate relational causal
inference as the theory and algorithms for causal inference from observational
data with underlying interference between units. The goal of this project is to
identify and resolve barriers to relational causal inference from noisy,
heterogeneous, relational data and to make causal inference practical and
accessible for real-world applications. To achieve this goal, the project will
integrate data-driven causal methods with relational learning and structural
causal modeling and it will encompass the full data science lifecycle, from
processing raw relational data to creating robust causal models and extracting
actionable knowledge. The project has four main thrusts: 1) developing robust
and scalable tests for relational dependence, 2) enabling relational causal
discovery with latent variables and selection bias, 3) developing algorithms for
heterogeneous peer effect estimation, and 4) enabling domain-specific discovery
through relational causal inference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
