ABSTRACT This project will construct a camera for the near infrared region of
the spectrum (1 micrometer to 2.5 micrometer wavelength) for use with the 100
inch Hooker telescope and adaptive optical system, and the CHARA array at the
Mount Wilson Observatory. The camera will be applied to three complementary
imaging techniques: interferometry, speckle imaging, and lunar occultation.
