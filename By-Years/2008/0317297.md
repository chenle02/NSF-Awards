The New England Aquarium Corporation has been awarded a grant to integrate,
extend and modify their Right Whale Photo-Identification Catalog database.
Specifically, they will develop a database management structure and related
software that will: 1) archive and link digital images to the sightings
database, 2) track images and their matching status, 3) provide a matching
system to search, identify and catalog digital images, 4) allow web access to
these images and the matching system and 5) provide a software template for
other institutions to use and/or modify. This database already plays a
fundamental role in Right Whale research and conservation and this project will
significantly augment its functionality and utility in those respects.
