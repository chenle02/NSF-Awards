Two central questions facing numerous fields will be addressed by this award: 
"How does one reach rigorous quantitative conclusions when the science involves
complicated numerical models and large scale data sets?" and "How can one use
computational methods to point out new insights into what are the most important
features, parameters and data?". To this end, a generalized statistical and
visualization structure will be developed for the purpose of comparing and
analyzing large-scale computational models to large heterogenous data sets.
The codes, techniques, algorithms and methodologies applied to this project will
be applied to critical problems in four different fields:  high-energy nuclear
physics, astrophysics, meteorology and biology. By devising a flexible open-
source framework, the products of this award will be extendable to numerous
other problems in the natural or social sciences involving sophisticated
simulations and complicated data structures.

The way in which simulations and data are analyzed will be revolutionized by the
capabilities developed by this work. Fundamental model parameters related to
each of the four problems, such as the percentage of the dark matter in the
universe or the viscosity of the quark-gluon plasma, will be stated with
rigorous uncertainties. Methods will be developed and implemented for
quantitatively stating which data were most important for constraining
parameters or validating model assumptions. Furthermore, these same
methodologies will be applied to assess the value of additional data, making
it possible to quantitatively assess the potential of experimental upgrades or
additional statistics. Students and postdocs will be trained in an emerging
science centered around the analysis of complex systems. In addition to their
own scientific discipline, they will be exposed to 21st century tools in
statistics, computation and visualization.
