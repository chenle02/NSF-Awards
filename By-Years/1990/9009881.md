Physical controls for most devices are either "one size fits all" or require
custom hardware for each user. Cost often prohibits custom design, and each user
must adapt to the standard device interface, typically with a loss of precision
and efficiency. When user abilities vary widely, such as in the disabled
community, devices often become unusable. The goal is to create a system that
will track user gestures and interpret them as control signals for devices.
Existing gesture recognition research converts continuous body motion into
discrete signals. The approach is to map continuous motions into a set of analog
device control signals. The system will allow us to quickly tailor a device
interface to each user's best physical range of motion. The first application
domain is a speech synthesizer for disabled users. Results are expected in two
major areas of applicability for non-disabled users: in telemanipulator
interfaces, and as a design tool for creating biomechanically efficient
interfaces.
