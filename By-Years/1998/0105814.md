This award supports preliminary site investigations and logistics planning for
an ambitious drilling project to recover a series of ~400 meter-long continuous
sediment cores from Lake Malawi at the southern end of the East African Rift
Valley. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous studies from the region show the area to
be a unique outdoor laboratory and archive for the study of tropical
paleoclimatology, tectonics, and evolutionary biology. Consequently, Lake Malawi
holds the promise of providing a high-resolution paleoclimate record of
unparalleled antiquity in a region highly sensitive to climate change and
critical for understanding the dynamics of the Earth's climate
system.&lt;br/&gt;
