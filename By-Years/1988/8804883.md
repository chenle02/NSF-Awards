Earthquakes occur in clusters. This fact provides fundamental information on
the rupture process, and the relationship between earthquakes and stress. It
also provides the most useful method presently available for earthquake
prediction. We plan to quantify the tendency for earthquakes to cluster by
extending probabilistic models of earthquake occurrence, including stress as a
variable. Short term models by Jones (1985) and Kagan and Knopoff (1987)
successfully represent the immense increase and rapid decay of seismic risk
following a moderate earthquake in California. Extending the relationship to
larger events have been recorded in California. Thus, we would model Chinese,
Japanese, and global earthquake catalogs to quantify the triggering
probabilities of large events, and to understand regional variations in
clustering. We would also generalize present short term and long term
statistical models to include stress as a variable. By so doing we hope to
integrate the long and short term models, so that quantitative assessments of
earthquake risk can include tectonic setting, strain rate, location, and focal
mechanism of previous earthquakes.
