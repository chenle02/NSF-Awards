Light propagation in periodic media and media with balanced gain and loss is at
the frontier of research in optics and applied mathematics. Periodic media, such
as photonic crystals or media with periodically changing refractive index, can
be manipulated to control light's propagation and achieve, for example, light
trapping and routing. Progress in this area of research has promising
applications for on-chip data processing at microscopic scales. By judiciously
balancing the gain and loss in the so-called parity-time-symmetric
configurations, one can induce the light to behave in novel ways, giving rise to
a possibility of "optical diodes." Such an optical diode that is capable of
transmitting a signal in only one direction would be an elemental base of
optical computers. In this project, novel nonlinear behavior of light in
periodic media and gain-loss-balanced media are theoretically investigated. By
developing new mathematical methodologies, new insight will be gained on the
nonlinear propagation of light in such media, so that their application for data
processing can be assessed. From a broader perspective, this project will
facilitate training of a graduate student in this important interdisciplinary
area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problems undertaken in this project are at the
cutting edge of applied mathematics and optics. On the mathematical side, this
project will develop novel mathematical methodologies for the treatment of
contemporary nonlinear optics problems, such as a sophisticated exponential
asymptotics technique for the bifurcation and linear stability of lump solitons
in two-dimensional periodic media. On the physical side, the mathematical
results from this project will allow us to assess the potential of optical
solitons for various physical applications such as data processing on
microscopic periodic structures. In addition, the theoretical investigation of
actual parity-time-symmetric single-mode lasers could directly impact the
nonlinear operation of those lasers and may lead to more advanced laser devices.
