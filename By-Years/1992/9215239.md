This supplement augments the research program at the University of California,
Berkeley's Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Sensors and
Actuators by cost- sharing a joint collaborative "TIE" project to be performed
with Northwestern University's Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
for Tribology. The "TIE" project is a joint synergistic effort to study and
model the friction occurring with extremely small devices and loads. The
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Sensors and Actuators is
studying friction in very small devices under extremely small loads. The
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Tribology is developing
relevant solid mechanisms models that satisfy its collaboration's observations.
The Program Manager recommends the University of California, Berkeley be awarded
$50,000 for a two-year "TIE" project to be performed collaboratively with
Northwestern University.
