This project will supply shipboard scientific support equipment for the research
vessel MOANA WAVE, operated by the University of Hawaii, and dedicated to use in
support of ocean science research. The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment
Program provides funds for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and
safe conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support for such
items as deck equipment including winch systems for the deployment and retrieval
of scientific instruments, navigational equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and
earth satellite receivers to pin point the location of research sites,
communication equipment including radio transceivers and satellite transceivers
for voice and scientific data communications and other equipment such as
motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval
sites. The Project Director, Dr. Charles Helsley is fully qualified to direct
this project having had considerable experience in overseeing the acquisition
and installation of shipboard equipment. This project will allow the institution
to install a coring system for improved safe handling of cores, and to replace a
damaged work boat.
