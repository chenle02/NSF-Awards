This project investigates the educational value of scientific simulations for
learning engineering through engaging high school students in designing and
building an energy-efficient scale model house with the aid of computer
simulations and probeware measurement in order to test the assertion that
simulations and hands-on projects are mutually beneficial. The project is
developing an education-oriented, student-friendly simulation tool, SimEng,
which is capable of accurately modeling the engineering problems students
encounter in this project. Four instructional units are being developed: an
introduction presenting science concepts and engineering principles;
fundamentals of designing and building energy-efficient houses; exploring
natural heating; and inventing natural cooling devices. Simulations and hands-on
projects are being developed for each unit. Student learning and performance are
being studied under two conditions: the experimental treatment utilizing hands-
on experiences supplemented by the SimEng simulation software; and the control
treatment consisting of the identical hands-on experiences and traditional
curriculum materials.

The research explores potential learning enhancements using simulations, which
are critically important in design-based learning, engineering education, and
cyberlearning. Although this project focuses on engineering design of thermal
systems, the research methodology is broadly applicable and the outcomes have
important implications for engineering education in general. This study also
explores critical cyberlearning questions such as the relationship of learning
through virtual labs and learning through physical labs. The instructional
materials and the simulation tool are open source and freely available online.
The materials are being tested with socio-economically diverse groups of
students to ensure that the outcomes of the research apply to all students.
