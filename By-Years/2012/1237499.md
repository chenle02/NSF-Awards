This award will support student travel to the ACM SIGPLAN International
Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP 2012) and associated workshops. The
conference is being held in Copenhagen, Denmark. ICFP is the premier conference
on all topics related to functional and higher-order programming. Supporting
student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very
important mission of the NSF. Broader impacts include building the next
generation of researchers in this research area, as well as providing
international experiences to build a globally-aware workforce.
