This REU site is in Environmental Science and Engineering at Florida
International University. The objective is to stimulate and promote interest,
curiosity, creative and critical thinking of undergraduate students in
environmental science and engineering during their early years in the
undergraduate program. This work involves students in a comprehensive research
program relative to movement and dispersion of oil spills and treatment of
contaminated media to minimize potential damage to the environment.
