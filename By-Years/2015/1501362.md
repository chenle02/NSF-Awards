This project concerns investigations in the theory of numbers and arithmetic
geometry. This is an area of research which has applications to cyber security,
through cryptography, and to some aspects of coding theory. The research
includes a number of projects in arithmetic geometry and transcendental number
theory that focus on understanding how values of special analytic functions
convey fundamental information about fields of algebraic numbers and geometric
objects defined over them. The investigator plans to study quantities associated
to Anderson-Drinfeld motives and to Mahler measures of multivariable polynomials
in order to exhibit concretely this interplay between analytic and arithmetic
information. Several parts of the project lead naturally to problems for student
research.

For problems on special values over function fields, the investigator will study
periods and logarithms of Anderson-Drinfeld motives in positive characteristic
so as to discover new results about values of zeta functions, multiple zeta
functions, Goss L-functions, and Drinfeld polylogarithms. One line of inquiry
will be to apply the Galois theory of Frobenius difference equations to find new
results on algebraic independence of L-values and multiple zeta values over
arbitrary base rings. Another path of investigation will be to uncover log-
algebraic power series identities for Drinfeld modules and their tensor powers
so as to produce new formulas for values of Goss L-functions and their twists
that illustrate their connections with Taelman class modules. The investigator
will also pursue research on Mahler measures of multivariable polynomials over
the complex numbers in terms of special values of L-functions of classical
modular forms.
