With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Missouri in St. Louis will upgrade
its CCD-based X-ray diffraction laboratory. Faculty at Washington University and
St. Louis University will also have access to this resource. This equipment will
enhance research in a number of areas including studies on a) the development of
new copper-based radiopharmaceuticals; b) the synthesis of neutral multimetallic
arrays; c) formation of bimetallaboranes containing widely differing transition
metals; d) metallabenzenes and other benzenoid metallacycles; e) Si-H bond
activation by electron-rich transition metal complexes; f) chemistry and biology
of steroids; g) the study of electron-deficient species; h) the supramolecular
chemistry of alkali metal cations; and i) the synthesis of organometallic
complexes with interesting optoelectronic properties. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three
dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and it
provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of the molecule
relative to the neighboring molecules. These studies will have an impact in a
number of areas, especially synthesis of important inorganic chemicals and
medicinal chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
