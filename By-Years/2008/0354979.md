This research will focus on fundamental processes in plasmas and will emphasize
problems for which precise experimental tests of theory can be obtained. The
research program represents a long-term theoretical and experimental
collaboration between 3 senior faculty. Experiments will be performed on non-
neutral plasmas, utilizing three existing electron traps and one ion trap with a
broad range of operating regimes and diagnostics. The simplicity of these
systems allows a depth of understanding and a precision of comparison between
theory and experiment which is rarely possible for neutral plasmas in complex
geometry. Moreover, the strong interaction between theory and experiment
provides an exceptionally rich environment for training students and post-
docs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
