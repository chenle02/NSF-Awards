With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Beak will utilize the
"endocyclic restriction test" to investigate allowed geometries for reactions
that occur at atoms which lack stereochemical features. In this approach,
transfer of non-stereogenic heteroatoms is performed in systems wherein the bond
forming group and the leaving group are joined by a chain. The size of the
endocyclic ring required for intramolecular transfer limits the available
reaction geometry. When taken in combination with other mechanistic tools,
application of this approach should provide important, detailed information
regarding the geometry of the transition states in atom-transfer reactions. The
geometries of reactions at oxygen, nitrogen, halogen, sulfur, and hydrogen will
be investigated. Mechanisms involving concerted, associative and/or dissociative
steps are to be evaluated for each case. Other mechanistic probes, e.g.,
crossover experiments, kinetic studies, and determinations of intra- and
intermolecular isotope effects, will be used to supplement results obtained via
application of the endocyclic restriction test.
