Auburn University proposes the African American Researchers in Computing
Sciences (AARCS) program to broaden African American participation in tenure
track faculty and research scientist positions within the education pipeline.
African American undergraduate students across the nation will be exposed to
role models, research, and graduate school opportunities that are specifically
designed to address disbeliefs, concerns, and misunderstandings about computing
sciences faculty and research. This will be accomplished through targeted
presentations by African American computing science faculty and graduate
students, a Future Faculty/Research Scientist Mentoring program, and an annual
AARCS mini-conference. The AARCS program will serve as an empirically-based and
tested model that can be incorporated into larger Alliance projects. In
addition, it will serve as a model that can be used to target other
underrepresented groups.
