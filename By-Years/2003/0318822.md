0318822&lt;br/&gt;Springer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leaves and other lateral organs
initiate from the flanks of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), and forming lateral
organs develop axes of asymmetry in response to positional cues from the SAM.
The LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES (LOB) gene is expressed in a band of cells between
the SAM and initiating lateral organs. LOB expression is regulated both by genes
that are important for SAM formation, and genes that are important for leaf
development, suggesting that LOB may be involved in signaling between the SAM
and organ primordia. LOB encodes a novel protein that is unique to plants and
defines the conserved LOB domain. Forty-three Arabidopsis genes encode proteins
that contain a LOB domain. Among these, ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2 (AS2), LBD10, LBD25,
and LBD36 are most closely related to LOB. Of the LOB-domain genes thus far
analyzed, only AS2 results in a visible phenotype when mutated. These
observations suggest that the members of the LOB-domain gene family exhibit
functional redundancy. Ectopic expression of AS2 results in the formation of
lateral organs that have abnormal abaxial-adaxial polarity, implicating AS2, and
perhaps closely related genes, in the establishment adaxial cell fates. This
research focuses on understanding the developmental role of LOB and related
genes. LOB and closely related genes will be characterized by genetic analyses.
Plants that carry single or multiple mutant combinations will be identified to
uncover the developmental roles each gene plays. The role of AS2 in polarity
determination will be investigated. LOB cis-acting regulatory sequences will be
characterized. Proteins that interact with LOB will be identified. The long-term
goals of this research are to understand the mechanisms of lateral organ
formation from the shoot apical meristem, and in particular what role LOB-domain
genes play in this process. The project will provide training for undergraduate
and graduate students and a postdoctoral associate in a high minority-enrollment
institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
