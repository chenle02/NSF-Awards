The objective of this project is analyze experimentally the actions and
interactions of cell organelles and regions that are required for animal cell
division. Normal and chemically treated cleaving eggs and dividing cultured
vertebrate tissue cells will be used in experiments in which their shapes are
changed, parts are removed and substances are injected. In animal cell division
the mitotic apparatus (which also sorts and transports chromosomes) establishes
a superficial contractile ring that constricts the cell into separate parts. The
results of the experiments will yield information concerning: (1) The
geometrical relations between the mitotic apparatus and the surface needed for
cell division, (2) the nature of the immediate response of the surface to
themitotic apparatus, (3) the time relations of the furrow establishment
process,(4) the relation between the contractile ring and the surface, and
(5)polar body formation. The cell division process is essential for the normal
development and maintenance of animals, including man. The aspects of the
process to be studied are fundamental, and expanded knowledge of it should
increase the possibilities of control, as well as enhance understanding.
