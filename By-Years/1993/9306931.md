9306931 Chan In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of
the Chemistry Division, Chan will study the pressure dependence of a number of
dynamical processes in low-temperature solids using ESR techniques. A diamond
anvil cell (DAC) will be used to generate very high pressures at temperatures as
low as liquid helium. Processes such as spin diffusion, libration, exciton
transport, and reaction rates in quantum tunneling systems will be examined.
Systems to be examined include organic, biochemical, and fullerene molecules.
%%% In this project Chan will apply high pressure to various solids in order to
elucidate the nature of both physical and chemical processes which occur as a
result. The pressure provides a method of modifying distances and orientations
on a molecular level, and thus affects dynamic processes such as chemical
reactions. This work will lead to new knowledge and insight which is
unattainable otherwise. ***
