Modern machine learning algorithms often encounter a trade off between
scalability and modeling power. For the problem of data clustering, Bayesian
approaches enjoy numerous modeling advantages over classical methods, but hard
clustering methods such as k-means are often preferred in practice due to their
simplicity and scalability.

This project explores bridging the gap between classical hard clustering methods
and clustering models based on Bayesian nonparametrics. The first step is an
asymptotic result connecting the Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model with a
k-means-like algorithm that does not fix the number of clusters in advance.
Using this key result, the PI and his team will explore four related research
directions which collectively demonstrate the utility of this asymptotic
approach: (1) extensions of the analysis to hierarchical Bayesian models,
leading to scalable hard clustering methods over multiple data sets; (2)
connections to spectral methods and graph clustering, leading to novel and
flexible graph clustering methods; (3) extensions beyond the Gaussian setting,
leading to new approaches to topic modeling and other discrete-data clustering
problems; and (4) extensive experiments in both the computer vision and text
domains.

Given that k-means is truly a workhorse of machine learning, these four
directions have the potential to impact a wide array of large-scale applications
including computer vision, bioinformatics, social network analysis, and many
other domains. Furthermore, the research will benefit the broader community
through released software and integration into coursework at Ohio State
University.
