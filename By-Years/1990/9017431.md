This proposal represents a novel approach to room temperature growth/deposition
of semiconductor materials. The method is based on electrochemistry, and is
named ECALE--Electrochemical Atomic Layer Epitaxy. Polycrystalline materials
have been deposited by electrochemical means previously; this project will
employ alternated electrodeposition of monolayers in an attempt to achieve
epitaxial growth. Specially processed and cleaned single crystal substrates will
be used; the substrates and the deposited films will be characterized by LEED,
AES, HREELS, and STM along with more routine optical and electron microscopy.
