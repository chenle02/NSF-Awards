9552974 AUDET Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have a very high potential
for changing the way students learn in schools. However, since the use of GIS
requires new pedagogy, new content and new ways of using instructional
technologies, GIS may be very difficult to implement in the classroom. The
introduction of NSF-funded GIS materials in the Chelsea School District is
studied to provide materials and software developers, teacher educators, school
districts, teachers and commulity members information about implementation
issues and their mitigation.
