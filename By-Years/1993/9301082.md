Lin will work to obtain an extension of the Weyl-von Neumann theorem which will
be used to give a complete classification of C*- algebra extensions of C(X), X a
compact subset of the plane, by a sigma unital simple C*-algebra. He will also
investigate whether every C*-algebra of real rank zero has weak (FN), as has
been shown by Lin in many cases. A final problem to be studied is that of
classifying certain equivalence classes of homomorphisms from one C*-algebra to
another. The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis in the
theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators. Operators can be thought of as
finite or infinite matrices of complex numbers. Special types of operators are
often put together in an algebra, naturally called an operator algebra. These
abstract objects have a surprising variety of applications. For example, they
play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is currently being used to study
the structure of DNA, and they are of fundamental importance in non-commutative
geometry, which is becoming increasingly important in physics.
