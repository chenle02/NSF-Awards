The application of 'omics' (next generation nucleic acid sequencing, proteomics
etc.) approaches in the study of multicellular organisms have generated an
enormous amount of data that is difficult to comprehend visually. This proposal
outlines a strategy to create a novel, high resolution graphical interface to
display 'omics' data in a scalable format that will allow easy visualization and
interrogation in four dimensions (three dimensions through time). In this
project tomato fruit development will be studied as a model system to generate
tools to project data sets onto a digitized computed tomography (CT) composite
image of the fruit and, thereby, create a 4D platform to spatially and
temporally examine the regulatory and structural pathways underlying fruit
development and metabolism. An important utility of this platform is that it is
readily adaptable to any complex multicellular organisms (plants, animals etc.)
whose structure is amenable to CT scans. The specific aims are to (1) generate a
digitized CT based profile of tomato fruit development and ripening at the
micron and/or submicron level of resolution, (2) develop laser capture
microdissection RNA-Seq profiles of the five principal cell/tissue types in
tomato fruit pericarp across the same developmental gradient and, (3) create a
bioinformatics/analytical pipeline to integrate the data sets derived from aims
1 and 2.

The project will train two postdoctoral research associates in modern
biological and bioinformatics approaches. If successful, the imaging and RNA-Seq
data will be combined with existing proteomic and metabolomic data and made
publicly available as a Tomato Expression Atlas, which will be accessible
through the Sol Genomics Network website (http://solgenomics.net). Opportunities
for training in the use of the bioinformatics tools developed by the project
will be made available at the annual Workshop in Plant Genomics and Systems
Biology held at Cornell University.
