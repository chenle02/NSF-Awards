9401751 Gruissem Organellar genetic systems are found in all eukaryotic cells.
Investigations into their functions and regulatory processes are critical to the
understanding of eukaryotic cell biology. Increasing evidence points to
mitochondria in animals, and to mitochondria or chloroplasts in plants, as the
underlying cause for clinical myopathies and plant diseases. In addition several
important processes that affect RNA processing and protein function have emerged
from the study of animal, yeast, and plant mitochondria, as well as plant
chloroplasts. %%% The May, 1994 Gordon Research Conference on Mitochondria and
Chloroplasts in Volterra, Italy, will bring together an international group of
geneticists, molecular biologists, biochemists, and cell biologists to exchange
ideas and information on a wide range of problems in these organelles. It will
be the first time that this meeting is held outside the U.S. This biannual
gathering has become a principal meeting ground for those interested in
organelle biogenesis and function. It is the only meeting with the express
purpose of integrating knowledge from the chloroplast and mitochondrial fields.
Significant new developments have occurred in the field since the last meeting
in 1992. ***
