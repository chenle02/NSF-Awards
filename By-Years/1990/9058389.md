The purpose of this research is to develop and apply efficient methods for
computing radiant energy transfer. The methods are being developed by drawing on
an expanding concepts and techniques from both engineering and computer science.
The ultimate goal is to develop methods which allow the simulation of radiant
transfer in geometrically complex, dynamic environments. A variety of issues are
being considered. The accuracy required in the modelling of environment geometry
and material properties is being studied. The potential for speeding up the
calculation of the effects of scattering by Monte Carlo and finite are
(radiosity) methods is being explored. The use of specialized and/or parallel
computer processors is being considered. The nature and format of output
available during the solution process is also being studied. The new
computational methods are being applied to several different types of problems
including the generation of photorealistic computer graphics images, the
calculation of infrared signatures, and the simulation of illumination for the
design of computer vision systems.
