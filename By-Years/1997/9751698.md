This project is modernizing the institution's instructional capability in the
area of instrumentation and measurement by introducing both computer controlled
and virtual instruments into the curriculum. In order to effectively use the
power of computer controlled and virtual instruments, the student should be well
grounded in the fundamentals of electronic instrumentation and basic computer
tools. The use of computer controlled and virtual instruments is being
introduced gradually as select experiments in sophomore- and junior-level
courses. New courses are being developed at the advanced junior- and senior-
level, specifically oriented toward the use of computer controlled and virtual
instruments. It is important that students become familiar with these powerful
concepts by first using these systems in essentially turn-key operations, in
introductory course experiments, and progress to planning experiments and
writing control software as they gain experience and confidence. Students are
developing the experience to make rational judgments as to whether to use
traditional instruments, computer controlled instruments, or virtual instruments
in a particular industrial application. This skill is invaluable to future
employers of graduates and to the graduates themselves during their careers. *
