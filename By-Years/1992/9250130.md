The acquisition of a steady state porometer, portable leaf area meter, portable
photosynthesis system, and accessories for these instruments plus a portable
computer will provide the students with an opportunity to utilize state-of-the-
art instrumentation to measure and analyze growth, productivity, and
photosynthesis data in freshman, junior, and senior laboratory courses designed
to teach plant physiological and ecological principles as well as enhance
undergraduate research projects in the plant sciences. Experiments are designed
so that students use the new instrumentation to make transpiration, leaf area,
and photosynthetic measurements on a number of different plants grown under a
variety of different environmental conditions in both the laboratory and field.
In each experiment the instrumentation will provide a means by which students
can: (1) formulate and test hypotheses related to important physiological and
ecological concepts; (2) gain hands-on experience with state-of-the-art
equipment; (3) conduct experimentation which reinforces important physiological
and ecological principles; (4) examine the proper methods of experimental
design; (5) gain first-hand experience in the collection, analysis, and
interpretation of scientific data; and (6) report on the experimentation in a
scientific journal format.
