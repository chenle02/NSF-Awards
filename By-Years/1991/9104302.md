This award provides partial funding for a technician's position in the
Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Texas-Austin. The funds
will be used to support a technician who will assist in the operation of the
Department's mass spectrometer laboratory. The mass spectrometer laboratory at
Texas provides isotope analysis for a group of active researchers in the
Department of Geological Sciences as well as off-campus collaborators. The
laboratory's capabilities are needed in a range of research projects in
tectonics, igneous and metamorphic petrogenesis, sedimentary geochemistry,
hydrology, and ore genesis.
