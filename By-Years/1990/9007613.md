The Oncobothriidae comprises a family of parasitic cestode tapeworms. Members
of this family infect the intestines of sharks and other elasmobranch fishes.
Dr. Janine Caira will be investigating the evolutionary relationships among the
species of several genera of oncobothriids, and establishing their preferred
attachment sites within the spiral valves of the fish intestines. Evolutionary
relationships among the tapeworms will be reconstructed using data from electron
microscopy, amino acid analysis of attachment hooks, and adult tapeworm
morphology. The data gathered on the morphology and protein chemistry of the
attachment hooks will advance our understanding of the systematics and evolution
of the parasites, and of possible coevolutionary mechanisms that affect hosts
and parasites. A well-documented evolutionary reconstructions of the tapeworms
can be compared to the ancestor-descendant relationships of the host fishes.
Coevolution among hosts and parasites is a phenomenon with implications for many
branches of biology.
