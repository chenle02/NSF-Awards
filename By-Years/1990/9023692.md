The present research program involves modelling and testing of cellular solids
and the design of sandwich panels. This research plans to achieve two goals: to
broaden research interests by studying interpenetrating composites, a new class
of materials related to cellular solids; and, to apply the understanding of
cellular solids to natural materials, in particular, to cancellous bone. The
study will begin by characterizing the various cellular structures of cancellous
bone and suggesting appropriate models for each. The modelling will first focus
on the uniaxial behavior; if successful it will be applied to multiaxial failure
criteria and fatigue, both areas of interest to the orthopaedic community. The
models will be compared with data from mechanical tests done in the lab and with
data available in the literature.
