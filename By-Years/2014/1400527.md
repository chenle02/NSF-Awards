The Application-Based Curriculum in Advanced Manufacturing (IACAM) project
prepares students with integrated-manufacturing skills and enables them to meet
21st century workplace competency requirements. The project is developing an
Integrated Manufacturing Technician curriculum model, creating a 'real-world'
manufacturing-environment learning-lab, to provide development opportunities for
college faculty through mentoring opportunities with secondary school teachers
and guidance counselors who are working together to gain a better understanding
of manufacturing technician needs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The curriculum model
features a student-centered program, which recruits, retains, and facilitates
program completion, and tracks and measures enrollment, completion, and
placement data. Students are advancing through their educational pathways by
finishing courses, completing certificates, earning associate degrees, and
achieving a transfer option into a bachelor's degree program. Within the
curriculum, students begin by studying specialized machines performing complex
tasks; electricity's role as the single largest provider of power; and
controlling, collecting, processing, distributing and storing critical
information about machines and processes. The automation's role is taught
through integrating of Programmable Logic Controllers, computer networking
systems, and robots. Teaching these skills is facilitated through integrated,
applied projects-based and real-life knowledge and experience of employers and
faculty. Intellectual merits are rooted in the comprehensive and integrated
nature of the curriculum that is to bring all stakeholders together.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project materials and results, including student learning
outcomes, are being disseminated through presentations at state and national
conferences, through the College website, and through mainstream media
advertising. Broader impacts are evidenced in the dissemination efforts and
appropriate training of the workforce.
