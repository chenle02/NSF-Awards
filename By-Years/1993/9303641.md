9303641 Kerfeld This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Plant Biology. The applicant received her Ph.D. from University of
California at Los Angeles. Her Ph.D. research was in the area of photosynthesis
with a focus on membrane biochemistry. She plans to carry out her postdoctoral
fellowship research in the laboratory of Dr. Todd Yeates also at University of
California at Los Angeles although at a different department. The proposed
research entitled "Crystallization and structure determination of the
photosynthetic pigment-proteins of Chromatium" will expand the scientific
experience of this Fellow into structural biology. This is an area of science
not many plant biologists choose to go into, and in need of study. The proposed
plan also includes extended foreign research experience at Max Planck Institute
in Germany. ***
