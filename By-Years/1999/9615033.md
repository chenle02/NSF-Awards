Abstract 9615033 Goodman This award provides funding for an
NSF/Industry/University Cooperative Research Center on Wireless Information
Networks (WINLAB) at Rutgers University and support of an undergraduate student
to participate in the research of the Center. The research activities of the
Center will contribute to the rapidly expanding technologies of wireless
communications and mobile computing. The research proposed for the next five
years of support is motivated by an analysis of personal communications in the
year 2010. Projects that will be undertaken will build on research conducted in
the first five years of WINLABOs operation and are in the categories of network
architecture, mobile computing, radio resource management, access technologies,
and mobility management. The Center will continue to collaborate with its thirty
corporate and government sponsors and it is expected that this support will
grow. Additional funding is provided in this award to support a minority
undergraduate student for the summer to conduct a study on an ongoing research
project within the Center.
