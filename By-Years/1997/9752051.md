Two existing modules are being modified to integrate the national science
education standards with the national industry-based bioscience skill standards.
A module from a high school biology curriculum developed to address academic
standards is being modified to include skill standards and vice-versa. A
partnership of personnel from the Education Development Center (EDC), Baltimore
City Schools, bioscience industry, and two year colleges is developing, testing,
and evaluating the materials and appropriate assessments. The purpose of the
materials is to enable high school and two-year college students to achieve both
high level academic mastery and preparation for advanced technological careers
in the bioscience industry. The development of the materials elucidates the
issues of combining career and academic education.
