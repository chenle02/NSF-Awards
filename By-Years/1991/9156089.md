In response to the perceived need to improve the quality of science instruction
and the public's scientific literacy, a model introductory course sequence is
being developed as part of a new comprehensive undergraduate Program in
Environmental Science and Policy. An integrated series of "magnet' courses for
undergraduates is being created that consists of freshman seminars, which will
broaden opportunities for the non-major and major alike, and a new one-semester
introductory course based on case studies, which will provide a more interactive
entry into science. Graduate and undergraduate students are participating in the
development of both types of courses and testing their efficacy, and the effort
is being evaluated by an outside consultant. The new comprehensive program will
serve as an important model for the further development of the entire science
curriculum, both for the non-major and major.
