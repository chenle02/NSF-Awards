This is a project to continue the Berkeley Geochronology Center's (BGC)
radioactive Argon dating of hominid and hominoid fossil localities in East
Africa. This is being done as a collaborative effort together with other
scientists conducting studies in paleoanthropology, archaeology, and geology at
the same fossil- bearing localities. The BGC's previous dates have provided
important age results for Olduvai Gorge, among other important East African
sites. This dating technique provides the basis for understanding the
stratigraphy and paleoenvironment of the hominid fossil record.
