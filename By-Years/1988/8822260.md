This award supports cooperative research in earth crust deformation. The work
will be performed by Steven N. Ward of the University of California, Santa Cruz
and Sergio Barrientos of the University of Chile in Santiago. They propose to
study the coseismic displacement field of the 1960 earthquake in southern Chile
and the postseismic crustal deformation of that event and the 1985 earthquake in
Central Chile. Geodetic elevation changes, triangulation measurements and tide
gauge observations will be used to indicate the location and intensity of
coseismic slip and interseismic creep in great detail. There is important
geodetic and seismic data available for Chile. The U.S. training and Chilean
contacts of Barrientos will facilitate the utilization of these datasets and the
collection of new measurements. This is an excellent opportunity for mutually
beneficial scientific cooperation between U.S. and Chilean scientists. The
Chileans will be able to use the advanced techniques of the U.S. scientists to
handle this data and the U.S. scientists will learn the details of stress
accumulation during the earthquake cycle. This award will help maintain a useful
and productive international scientific relationship and thus further the goals
of the Science in Developing Countries program.
