9700474 Rapinchuk This award provides funding for a continuing of the
congruence subgroup problem for S-arithmetic subgroups of linear algebraic
groups over number fields. The principal investigator will attempt to prove the
centrality of the congruence kernel for some new classes of groups using a
variety of techniques such as different boundedness conditions (bounded
generation and similar properties), methods of representation theory (property
(T) of Kazhdan), etc. He will also study the properties of groups having finite
representation type and the representation varieties of some finitely generated
groups. This research falls into the general mathematical field of Number
Theory. Number Theory has its historical roots in the study of the whole
numbers, addressing such questions as those dealing with the divisibility of one
whole number by another. It is among the oldest branches of mathematics and was
pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within the
last half century it has become an indispensable tool in diverse applications in
areas such as data transmission and processing, and communication systems.
