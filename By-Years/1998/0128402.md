The automated interaction of computers with humans and the biosphere in which
they reside represents an increasingly important attribute of computing in the
information age. Identification is a critical component of this interaction
whether the application be projection of human identity at a distance over the
internet, criminal justice and forensics, or medical diagnostics and therapy
delivery. Defined across this application spectrum, automated biometric
identification systems measure a physiological, behavioral, or biological
"signature" from the human body or environment, process and
recognize&lt;br/&gt;classifiable signal components, and then renders an
identification decision based upon the parameters of a given application.
Effectively addressing the breadth of needed biometric identification system
research from the life sciences to the computing sciences represents a
significant challenge to industry and government. Cohesive university faculty
groups are particularly well suited to address innovations at this intersection
of disciplines. The Center for Identification Technology Research (CITeR)
organizes the activities of faculty groups at four universities spanning the
physical, health, and computer sciences and&lt;br/&gt;engineering, to
effectively address the cross-cutting research needed to address automated
advance biometric identification technology and systems. CITeR will serve an
enabling role in the technical and economic development of this area through
research of new enabling technologies, the integrative training of scientists
and engineers across its breadth, and the facilitation of the transfer of this
technology to the private and government sectors. &lt;br/&gt;
