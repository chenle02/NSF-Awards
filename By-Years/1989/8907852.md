The pion-nucleus interaction is investigated using a field theoretical,
microscopic approach, and used to investigate the reaction dynamics of a pion in
the nucleus, and to study new nuclear structure questions. In addition, work is
beginning on a study of the pure electromagnetic phenomena arising from the very
strong, Lorentz contracted, electromagnetic fields in relativistic heavy ion
collisions.
