The importance of relative dependency of plants on root- symbiotic
(mycorrhizal) fungi may be critical to plant succession on new soils, but this
area of ecology has received little attention. Glaciers of the North Cascade
Mountains of Washington suit this purpose. In receding, they deposit rubble
initially devoid of symbiotic fungi, which increase in time of exposure with
distance from the glacier terminus. Plants that colonize these glacier
forefronts over time will be compared with the same species in adjacent,
undisturbed communities for mycorrhiza formation. The three major groups are
plants that (1) survive without the symbiotic fungi, (2) depend on mycorrhizal
fungi dispersed by air, and (3) depend on mycorrhizal fungi dispersed with
moving soil. Plants in group 1 are predicted to be first colonizers, followed in
turn by groups 2 and 3. Field sampling and greenhouse and growth chamber
inoculation experiments will test the hypothesis. If true, it will explain why
only a few of the many seed-producing plants adjacent to glaciers are initial
colonizers. This contribution to ecological theory has many applications in
interpreting successional phenomena and in rehabilitating disturbed or degraded
ecosystems.
