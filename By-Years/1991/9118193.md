This award will support a U.S.-Mexico scientific collaboration between Professor
Jorge Jose of Northeastern University and Professors G. Monsivais, E. Cota, and
G. Ramirez of the Universidad Autonoma Nacional de Mexico (UNAM). The main
objective of the research is to study electronic and superconducting properties
of systems of restricted dimensionality. The proposed study will be divided into
two parts: 1) transport in quasi-one dimensional electronic systems with and
without interactions, disorder, and time-dependent potentials, and 2) studies of
the metastable magnetic properties of random arrays of Josephson junctions as
well as high temperature superconductors. The proposed research will rely on the
use of numerical simulation techniques, as well as analytic techniques, and will
build on previous successful work of the collaborators. This research is likely
to lead to the development of new devices within the realm of mesoscopic quantum
effect electronics.
