The objective of this research is to introduce a new design paradigm in
structural engineering that employs topology optimization for generating optimal
structures that are resistant to multiple forms of damage and thus lead to
robust designs. Previous topology optimization research has generally ignored
the topic of damage, and assumed purely elastic behavior, thereby limiting the
applicability of this technique to a relatively narrow class of engineering
materials and structures. This objective will be achieved through (i) creation
of a novel computational framework that simultaneously combines topology
optimization and continuum damage mechanics, considering a wide range of
material damage models such as brittle damage, creep damage and damage due to
impact loading, (ii) application of these algorithms to existing structural
design problems to uncover novel design concepts not seen in conventional
designs, and (iii) development of an educational program for students and
postdoctoral fellows focused on damage modeling and structural optimization.

This research will expand the range of applicability of topology optimization to
a wide range of disciplines, leading to more robust structures that are less
susceptible to failure due to material damage. Educational activities and
dissemination of the research will impact the engineering community by
generating interest in engineering design and promoting creativity and
innovation in the next generation of engineers.
