Sensors on mobile phones can enable attractive sensing applications in different
domains such as environmental monitoring, social network, healthcare, etc.
However, fundamental energy-efficient resource management problems have not been
well studied for mobile phone sensing. In addition, how to provide incentives to
attract user participation has not been well addressed. The objective of this
project is to develop a unified and green platform for mobile phone sensing,
optimize its performance by designing energy-efficient algorithms for sensing
task management, and develop game-theoretic incentive mechanisms to attract user
participation. The proposed research is organized into four cohesive research
thrusts: 1) Design and implement a unified software architecture to enable
support for various sensing applications. 2) Develop both platform-centric and
user-centric incentive mechanisms to attract user participation. 3) Develop
energy-efficient algorithms to manage sensing tasks. 4) Test the developed
platform and algorithms via simulation and real experiments. This research will
result in a unified and green mobile phone sensing system. Fundamental resource
management problems will be solved by theoretically-sound and practical
algorithms. The project will also result in novel incentive models and
mechanisms for mobile phone sensing. In addition, the proposed platform can
create a completely new type of online marketplace. The proposed energy-
efficient algorithms can benefit both mobile users and the environment. The
project is also expected to advance public understanding of mobile phone sensing
via publications, seminars and workshops.
