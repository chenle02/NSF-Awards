This EAGER project explores the feasibility of a consortium-based program of
research and evaluation to support ongoing reforms in the DC public schools and
to ensure a high priority for STEM education policy and practice in the emerging
design of the consortium. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building on several recent NRC
reports, the project will support (1) the improvement of the infrastructure for
collection and analysis of STEM-specific transcript data so that it becomes an
integral part of the data and indicator system for DCPS; (2) an exploration of
the effectiveness of a consortium in determining priority topics for evaluation
and research; and (3) ensuring that the new consortium produces new knowledge
useful to other consortium-based efforts underway across the nation.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The notion of a university-based consortium as a strategy
for improving DC public schools is both bold and innovative and warrants
exploration, development and monitoring. There are also significant risk factors
reform in the DC public schools takes place in a highly charged political
environment where 17 different management structures have been tried since 1804.
However, the notion of a consortium that provides accurate evidence and data is
a vital one, as the District attempts to sustain the momentum of reform that was
initiated by moving to Mayoral control.
