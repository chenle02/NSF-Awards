In order to test three hypotheses regarding petrogenetic processes below the Izu
arc, the PIs will analyze submarine rocks collected by dredging, ALVIN and ODP
legs, and from a future IFREE/JAMSTEC cruise. Under this award, the PIs will
study the petrography, mineral chemistry, major and trace elements (XRF, ICPMS),
and Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotopes of 50-100 basalts, mostly from the extensional region,
but also from the volcanic front and rear arc seamount chains. They will also
measure 187 Os/ 188 Os ratios and Re-Os concentrations for a suitably mafic
subset of these samples, and for the high-priority subset of sediments and
basalts from ODP Site 1149 in the Pacific ocean crust outboard of the Izu
arc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
