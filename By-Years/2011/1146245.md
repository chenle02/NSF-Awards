All organisms are made up of collections of cells, or bags of material that each
carry out essential processes for life. Each cell has a program that can be
influenced by the environment to enlarge, divide, and form specific shapes. The
ultimate shape, size and function of a plant is therefore determined by the
nature of each individual cell. Plant cells are surrounded by structurally
strong but plastic material called the cell wall, that includes the
carbohydrates cellulose and pectin. The cell wall has a direct influence on the
size and shape that each cell reaches as it acts as a cage around each cell, and
hence modification of the cell wall has a direct affect on cell shape and size.
The cell surface contains a protein molecule, called a wall-associated kinase
(WAK), that binds to the cell wall pectin and senses the structure and relays
this to the inside of the cell to cause changes in growth and responses to the
environment. Indeed, pathogens and wounding directly affect pectins, and WAKs
aid in the sensing of this damage. WAKs are also required for normal plant
growth. This project will concentrate on the mechanism by which WAKs bind and
sense pectin changes so as to play a dual role differentiating growth from the
stress response. Genetic and biochemical analysis using the model plant
Arabidopsis will generate paradigms likely applicable to all types of flowering
plants. Undergraduate students involved in the work will be provided with an
integrative approach to science, and will be prepared for the challenges of
graduate and professional schools and the private sector upon graduation.
