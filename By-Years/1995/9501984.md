The proposal calls for a study of cold atoms at high density, aiming at
elucidating a new quantum regime, possibly including Bose-Einstein condensation
(BEC), a macroscopic population of bosons in a single-quantum state.
Alternatively, cold Li will be used with the ultimate goal of observing a
degenerate fermi sea of atoms. The most striking novel property of cold fermions
is the suppression of collisions due to the Pauli exclusion principle.
