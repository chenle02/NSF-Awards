Unprecedented levels of seismic isolation are required to achieve the
sensitivity necessary to observe gravitational waves in Advanced LIGO. This
award supports the development of instruments and techniques to ammeliorate the
effect of seismic vibrations on the overall detector performance. The active
seismic isolation stages in Advanced LIGO employ seismometers located on the
ground and on the isolated platform to measure and subtract ground motion.
However, horizontal seismometers cannot distinguish between ground tilt and
horizontal acceleration. Tilt-horizontal coupling complicates the feedback and
is a significant noise source for seismic isolation in Advanced LIGO. This award
supports the development of a high precision inertial sensor to measure
horizontal tilt independently from horizontal acceleration. Removing tilt and
tilt noise from the horizontal seismometer channels will improve Advanced LIGO
seismic isolation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tiltmeters we are developing are
unique and not commercially available. These instruments may have applications
in other fields of science such as in geophysics, well beyond gravitational wave
research. This award not only supports the development of a device for Advanced
LIGO but it also serves to maintain and strengthen synergistic activities of our
table-top gravity group with the gravitational wave detection community. The
technical developments and experiments are carried out by a university-based
research group, which has a strong tradition of educating undergraduate
students, graduate students and postdocs in building precision mechanical
instruments. With the expertise gained through projects, such as developing a
one-of-a-kind tiltmeter, our students fill positions in academia as well as
highly skilled positions in industry. Our group is strongly committed to
outreach on all levels.
