This research examines the contributions of task cues and dominance cues to the
attainment of status in groups. Results of the Phase I Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) study indicate that females may gain influence in mixed-sex task
groups by enacting high task behaviors, but that dominance behavior is an
ineffective and poorly received strategy. However, although research indicates a
strong negative group reaction to dominance attempts, it is not understood why
this occurs. Furthermore, given that there are numerous instances in the applied
work world in which females as well as males must direct others through implied
threat, it is important to examine conditions under which dominance behaviors
may be exhibited without negative sanction. The overall goals of the Phase II
SBIR research are: (1) to understand the basis of the normative reactions to
dominance attempts, and (2) to examine strategies to overcome these effects,
especially attempts by females and other low status individuals to to direct
others in task group environments.
