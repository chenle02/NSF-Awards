This work regards the use of clathrate hydrates as dielectrics in high energy
capacitors that would operate reliably to temperatures below -100oC. Clathrate
hydrates are highly structured complexes of water as host and organic or
inorganic guest molecules. j Their dielectric properties are function of
temperature and composition. Phase I research seeks to demonstrate clathrates
with the low conductivity of ice, but with large advantages over ice itself.
These advantages include tunable dielectric relaxation times for high frequency
applications, extended operating temperature range, and possibly minimized
volume change during freeze/thaw cycles. The clathrate-based capacitors would
also be preferable over conventional capacitors because they are easy to scale-
up, preserve capacity at low temperature, and are independent of polarity. The
configuration chosen for Phase I is of plane parallel plates. Phase II would
demonstrate prototypes with different geometry and optimized material.
