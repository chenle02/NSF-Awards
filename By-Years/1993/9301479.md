Benjamin J. Schwartz has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Schwartz's doctoral degree was from the University of
California/Berkeley under the supervision of Professor Charles Harris. Dr.
Schwartz intends to continue research at the University of Texas/Austin under
the sponsorship of Professor Peter Rossky. Dr. Schwartz's postdoctoral training
will provide him with experience in theoretical techniques such as high quality
molecular dynamics simulations which will allow him to simulate the observables
in femtosecond laser experiments. Longer term he plans to employ new theoretical
algorithms and emerging femtosecond technologies to probe details of the
microscopic physics underlying condensed phase reactivity of polyatomic
molecules. %%% The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an
important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and
experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in
contemporary chemical research and teaching.
