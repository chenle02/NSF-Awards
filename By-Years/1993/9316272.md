Nishiizumi 9316272 This award supports a project to measure 36Cl and 41Ca in
Antarctic meteorites in order to estimate terrestrial ages of the meteorites.
This work is a collaborative effort between the University of California,
Berkeley, and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. When combined with
other chemical and isotopic data on the meteorites, the terrestrial ages allow
inferences about solar system history and orbital trajectories of the meteorites
prior to collision with Earth. The terrestrial ages are also valuable for
glaciological studies of the Antarctic ice sheet, or geomorphological studies of
the ice-free areas, on which the meteorites are found. For ice sheets, they
provide an estimate of the time that the ice sheet has been concentrating debris
and ice in the particular ablation region in which the meteorite is found. This
information is useful input to dynamic models of the ice sheet. For ice-free
regions, the meteorites, provide an estimate of the antiquity of the geomorphic
surface. In conjunction with exposure ages, the terrestrial ages provide useful
information about past glaciation of the presently ice- free areas. The
terrestrial ages that this work will produce represent a useful investment in
baseline data for research in geomorphology and glaciology.
