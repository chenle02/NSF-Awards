New nonlinear spectroscopic techniques (interferometric and multi- color
degenerate four wave mixing), together with femto and pico second conventional
nonlinear and electro-optic modulation measurements, with be used to define
mechanisms of optical nonlinearity in newly synthesized metal free and
metallated ladder copolymers, metallated macrocyclic polymers, thienylpolyene
copolymers, mixed valence molecules (in solution) and polymers, the
photosynthetic reaction center and related model compounds, and in fullerenes.
Copolymer synthesis techniques are used to overcome intrinsically poor
solubility of ladder, macrocyclic, and thienylpolyene materials, to retard
photochemical degradation of mixed valence and thienylpolyene materials, to
control intermolecular interactions and to permit measurement of materials under
comparable local field conditions. Treatment of electronic and nuclear dynamics
as well as the details of the applied electromagnetic fields by density matrix
methods permits characterization of multiple mechanisms of optical nonlinearity
in a single material. Preliminary realization of large optical nonlinearities
suggest that, with further optimization of material properties device
application of organic, inorganic and mixed valence polymers, may be practical.
This research on nonlinear optical materials combines synthesis, state-of-the-
art characterization and measurements, and study of the mechanisms of optical
nonlinearity. The grant is supported jointly by the Polymers and the Solid State
Chemistry components of the Solid State Chemistry and Polymers Program.
