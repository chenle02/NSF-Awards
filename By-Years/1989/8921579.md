The proposed research is a fundamental study of diamond synthesis in flames.
Diamond growth in low-pressure, one- dimensional H2/O2/Ar-CH4 and C2H2/O2/Ar
flames will be investigated and the conditions for which growth occurs will be
determined. The experiments are designed to provide a well-characterized growth
environment with known chemistry. Growth experiments will be carried out using
both thin-wire micro-substrates which do not perturb the flame significantly and
large-area substrates designed to maintain a one- dimensional flowfield in the
gap between the burner and substrate. The one-dimensional flowfield is predicted
to result in uniform large-area film growth. The flames will be thoroughly
characterized. Stable species profiles will be measured using a quartz probe and
an on-line sampling mass spectrometer, and radical profiles (H, CH3, C, OH, CH,
and C2) and temperature profiles will be measured optically using laser-induced
fluorescence, resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization, and vibrational Raman
scattering. The measurements will be made both with and without the substrate,
and will be compared to the predictions of a one-dimensional reacting flow model
with detailed kinetics. These experiments will be the first study of diamond
growth in a truly well- characterized environment, and will yield significant
information on the processes responsible for diamond growth.
