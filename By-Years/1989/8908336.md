Large vertebrate herbivores are believed to play an important role in
regulating primary production of terrestrial ecosystems. However, the specific
form of their regulating influence and its mode of action have emerged as the
focus of a significant, unresolved controversy in contemporary ecology. It has
been observed that experimentally imposed increases in the population density of
a large, generalist herbivore during winter can stimulate production of
perennial grasses in shrub.grassland ecosystems during spring. It is
hypothesized that this stimulation may result from (1) the effect of browsing on
competitive interactions between shrubs and grass, (2) the effect of grazing on
standing dead grasses and its consequences for availability of nitrogen and
water and (3) fertilizing effects of urine and dung. Plot level experiments will
be conducted to examine these mechanisms and seek support to plan those
experiments. The investigator and her colleagues are well qualified and form an
excellent team. The institutional environment is first. rate for the project as
planned. Research results should be significant in the area of basic ecology of
browsing and grazing as well as to the area of wildlife and forage management.
