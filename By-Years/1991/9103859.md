The morphological transitions involved in the origin of mammals, and the
composition changes in tetrapod faunas during the Late Triassic, are the foci of
this research. This award supports the retrieval of material critical to
addressing the problem of mammalian origins in association with fossiliferous,
continental sediments; such an association has been discovered in the Late
Triassic Fleming Fjord Formation of Jameson Land in East Greenland, an area that
offers a greater range of stratigraphic and lithologic exposures than those in
which Late Triassic mammals have previously been found. Several localities with
dense concentrations of well preserved bones of smaller vertebrates have been
identified. This award will support field investigations of microfaunal
localities which may provide evidence critical to understanding mammalian
origins as well as evaluating current hypotheses of vertebrate faunal evolution
during the Late Triassic.
