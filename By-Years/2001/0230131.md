Building on the existing framework at St. Louis Community College that supports
recruitment and retention, we are developing an integrated program, Pathways to
Success in STEM, to increase recruitment and retention of students seeking STEM
degrees at the College. Through piloting the program at the SLCC Florissant
Valley and Meramec campuses, we are focusing our efforts on both increasing the
number of students entering STEM programs as well as increasing the number of
students completing STEM degrees. Our efforts are also expanded to recruit
traditionally underrepresented students in STEM areas by reaching to school
districts with 50% or more minority student populations. The project activities
include: (1) Windows to STEM Opportunities program--designed to bring high
school students and parents to the college campus to meet faculty and to be
introduced to STEM laboratories and to career opportunities, (2) Gateway to Math
and Science program-designed for under prepared students to gain skills and
knowledge in math, reading, writing, and science needed to enter college-level
STEM programs, (3) Advising/Career Counseling Workshops--given to STEM faculty,
support staff in academic advising, counseling, and the ACCESS office (whose
personnel work with students with disabilities), (4) Models of Success seminars
--developed to bring STEM professionals to the campus to meet with STEM students
in small groups to share experiences in pursuing STEM education and careers, and
(5) Expanded Articulation Agreement-- to ensure seamless transitions for
students from their two-year STEM programs to four year institutions. Our
overarching goal is to develop an innovative, sustainable structure for on-going
recruitment and retention efforts across all disciplines within the STEM
division in the College.
