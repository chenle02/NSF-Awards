The major strength of relational databases lies in their ability to process data
in a set-at-a-time manner. An important drawback, however, is their inability to
handle rules. Aninformation system must allow users to define, represent and
manipulate rules just as easily as data and treat them in a common framework.
Such a system is called a knowledge-based system. The objective of this research
is to investigate the feasibility of developing such a framework for integrating
rules and data within a relational database system. This research develops and
evaluates techniques for integration in this manner, and highlights the
strengths and weaknesses of such an approach. Consequently, it focuses on the
following issues: extending a relational language like SQL to express rules,
storing and manipulating rules in an efficient manner, developing query
processing algorithms (this will also involve designing new data structures),
implementing the algorithms and evaluating their performance. This work draws to
a large extent on existing literature and theory in the area of relational
database systems, deductive databases, and also on existing work in the areas of
artificial intelligence and expert systems. The findings will be useful for the
designers of next-generation database systems.
