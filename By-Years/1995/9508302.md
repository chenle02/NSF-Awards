9508302 Herrero-Bervera The PI will, in collaboration with scientists from the
University of Miami, sample, by drilling, two magnetic polarity transitional
sections from Iceland in detail, carry out the necessary laboratory measurements
(both magnetic and dating), and complete the analysis and interpretation of the
results. These data may provide important additional information on polarity
transitions, which are important in our understanding of the influence of the
lower mantle structure on the geodynamo. ***
