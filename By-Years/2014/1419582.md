Technical and Non Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;The Gordon Research Conference
(GRC) on Polymer Physics has been held in alternate summers since 1969. It is a
premier venue for exchange of scientific thought and advances in the field. The
program is designed to extend the well established topics in the field and to
introduce the community to emerging areas. The 2014 GRC will include twenty-five
lectures grouped in five areas: dynamics of polymer melts and glasses;
crystallization and self-assembly; interfacial, surface, and nanoconfinement
effects; interactions in biomacromolecular systems; and polymers for energy and
electronic applications. The associated Gordon Research Seminar provides a
complementary venue for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to
present their work, interact with one another and senior mentors, thus
cultivating scientific exchange and their development towards fruitful careers
in the field.
