Understanding the dynamical evolution of dense stellar systems, such as
globular clusters and galactic nuclei, is one of the most fundamental problems
of gravitational astrophysics. Substantial progress towards this goal has been
made in recent years as a result of both theoretical and observational advances.
Frequent star-star gravitational interactions cause a profound evolution of the
overall structure of these systems on astrophysically interesting time scales.
Powerful computer simulation methods have firmly established the inevitable
evolution of globular clusters of stars toward the collapse of the core of the
cluster. The advent of new observing instrumentation and the ability to achieve
high angular resolution from ground based observatories have both led to
significant advances in the observational study of globular clusters and
galactic nuclei. Drs. Cohn and Lugger at the University of Indiana will continue
their research program of theoretical and observational investigations of the
dynamical evolution of globular clusters. The principal goals are: to develop
realistic, evolving, dynamical models for globular clusters; to carry out large
scale optical observational studies of globular cluster structure, kinematics,
and stellar content, using both ground-based telescopes and the Hubble Space
Telescope; and to fit observational data for globular clusters with numerical
models.
