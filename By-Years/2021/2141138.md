The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation -
Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to address an unmet need in the
regenerative medicine and therapeutic cell market. If successful, the proposed
technology will boost cell and drug manufacturing for biomedical applications.
The proposed program will provide training opportunities in the areas of
engineering of functional soft materials and entrepreneurial skills for the
commercialization and development of startups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed project aims at developing robust and cost-efficient cell culture dish
inserts with thermos-responsive coatings for enzyme-free detachment of high-
quality cultured cells with no enzyme contaminations nor damage to the cells and
their environment. The product will secure improved efficiency and productivity
of cell manufacturing along with the high quality of the products for end-user
applications. The research program is designed to address knowledge gaps and
technical barriers through the (i) development of a cost-efficient scalable
method for the fabrication of micro-structured thermo-responsive thin-film
coatings; (ii) identification of the optimal dimensions of the adhesive and
repulsive patterns to enable adhesion, proliferation and enzyme-free harvesting
of different cell lines; and (iii) study of the cultured and detached cells to
assess potential cell damage for optimization of the adhesion
level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
