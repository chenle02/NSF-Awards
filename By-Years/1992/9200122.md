The project is directed at the properties of weak-coupling effects in
superconductors, with emphasis on two-dimensional (2D) superconductivity, vortex
pinning and dynamics, and chaos. Two categories of experiments are planned: a)
measurement of the dynamical properties of superconducting arrays of Josephson
and proximity-effect junctions; b) measurement of vortex and flux- pinning
effects in 2D granular indium/indium oxide super- conductors.
