The goal of this project is to explore and push forward some of the major issues
at the interface of algebraic geometry with string theory and quantum field
theory. The research will employ and combine a variety of techniques from
algebraic geometry, topology, integrable systems, string theory, and quantum
field theory. The project also includes many broader impact activities such as
curricular development at the graduate and undergraduate level, and research
training opportunities for postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students.

Exploration of the interactions of string theory and quantum field theory with
algebraic geometry has been extremely productive for decades, and the power of
this combination of tools and approaches only seems to strengthen with time. In
this project, the PI plans to carry out: (1) a quantum field theory-inspired
attack on the geometric Langlands conjecture via non-abelian Hodge theory; (2) a
mathematical investigation of the recently discovered physical theories of class
S in terms of variations of Hitchin systems; (3) applications of ideas from
supergeometry to higher loop calculations in string theory; (4) exploration of
moduli questions in algebraic geometry, some of them motivated by a quantum
field theory conjecture, others purely within algebraic geometry; (5) extension
of his construction of Calabi-Yau integrable systems realizing Hitchin's system
to meromorphic and parabolic versions; and (6) further exploration of aspects of
F-theory and establishment of its mathematical foundations. Each of these
specific research areas represents a major open problem in math and/or in
physics, whose solution will make a major contribution to the field.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
