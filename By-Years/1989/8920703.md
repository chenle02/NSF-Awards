The major objective of this research effort is to develop a pre- fabrication
engineering model of a high throughput VLSI systolic array processing chip (or
chip set) based on least-square (LS) QR decomposition algorithm. This chip is
being developed for general systolic Kalman filtering applications. An immediate
application is to improve the tracing accuracies and throughput currently
achievable in commercial Global Position Systems (GPS) receivers. In Phase I,
the feasibility of developing systolic array LS architectures for high
throughput rate signal processors has been successfully demonstrated. The
systolic array design in Phase II is based on the modified Fast Givens algorithm
developed in Phase I. The novel algorithm-based fault- tolerant approach
identified in Phase I is further developed to include fault-identification and
automatic reconfiguration based on inherent parallel processing characteristics
of the QR systolic arrays. Development of the pre-fabrication chip model
requires determination of the following VLSI design technologies for systolic
processors: dependence graph mapping of algorithms to architecture, partitioning
of large size problems to fixed size architecture; tradeoffs on internal and I/O
lines; and software simulation of data flow and computations. This Phase II
research effort develops methodologies which can be extended to general VLSI
systolic LS processors and thus allow easy future commercialization of this
technology to other signal processing applications.
