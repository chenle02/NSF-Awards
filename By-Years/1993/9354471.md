9354471 McGowen The project is a collaborative effort between two-year college
and four-year college and university faculty in the preparation of curriculum
materials, teacher supplements, and workshop materials for a developmental
algebra reform curriculum. In addition, the project leaders are engaging in
dissemination activities to determine the effects of implementation of these
materials. The curriculum materials are designed to provide students with
greater mathematical literacy and a stronger foundation to bridge the gap to
calculus. The project is investigating the adaptability of current calculus
reform dissemination models for use in an algebra reform curriculum. They are
also designing a model for evaluation of student attitudes and performance in
comparison with students taking introductory and/or intermediate algebra in a
traditional setting, as well as an instrument to document pedagogical changes in
teachers trying to implement a non-traditional curriculum. A proposed outcome of
the project is a model for implementing a reform algebra curriculum and the
establishment of a network of two-year and four-year college developmental
mathematics implementers for a particular curriculum reform project. ***y
