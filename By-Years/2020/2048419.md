The Engineering Research Visioning Alliance (ERVA) is established through a
Cooperative Agreement between the National Science Foundation and the University
Industry Demonstration Partnership (UIDP). This newly formed ERVA organization
will serve to identify and develop bold and societally impactful new engineering
research directions and thereby catalyze the engineering research community’s
pursuit of innovative, high-impact research. The ERVA will seek, obtain and
integrate input from all stakeholders with interest in engineering research,
including academia, industry, professional societies, government agencies, and
the public. Robust, multi-modal communications will fuel consistent, effective,
bidirectional flow of information across the engineering research stakeholder
community to ensure broad input and impact. Through its activities, the ERVA
will strengthen connectivity across diverse stakeholders and increase
coordination among engineering disciplinary communities. The ERVA ideation and
visioning engine will drive new initiatives that advance the frontiers of
engineering and science to maximize potential for economic growth, national
security and societal benefit and strengthen U.S. leadership in the technology-
based global economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The newly formed ERVA is a
partnership of the Big Ten Academic Alliance (BTAA), the Established Program to
Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR)/Institutional Development Award (IDeA)
Foundation (EIF), and the University Industry Demonstration Partnership. The
American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) is ERVA’s Affiliate Partner.
Leveraging this expansive cross-sector partnership network, the ERVA will
establish a national, independent, agile engine to CONVENE an inclusive
representation of academic, corporate, community, professional society, and
public stakeholders; IDEATE and articulate bold new engineering research
visions; CATALYZE development of new programs, policies, and models of
connectivity, together with investments that address critical national and
global challenges; COMMUNICATE findings, directions, and opportunities to
diverse stakeholders; and EVALUATE the outcomes and impacts of its work.
Professional contractors will be engaged to optimize communication and
evaluation strategies and outcomes. The ERVA seeks to foster a diverse,
inclusive and engaged engineering community committed to realizing societal
needs through collaborative and convergent research, technology innovations, and
community engagement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
