Incorporation of Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry and Fluorescence
Spectroscopy into the Environmental Science Program. The project will purchase a
new computer driven data station to upgrade the GC/MS spectrometer and a
spectrofluorometer. The equipment will improve the recently initiated
Environmental Science Program by strengthening the laboratory portion of
introductory and advanced chemistry courses. The rationale for these
acquisitions is twofold: 1) to support interest development and early
experimentation in environmental science, and 2) to modernize the introductory
and advanced chemistry laboratory program. The instrumentation is vital to the
long range plan to offer students modern instrumental laboratory experiences and
to reinforce their interest in considering science as a career.
