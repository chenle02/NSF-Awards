Laboratory experiments and numerical modeling will be combined to study the
shoaling-induced wave breaking in the near-shore environment. The main focus of
the study is the region where sustained breaking occurs after breaker onset and
is the spatially dominant mechanism for wave dissipation on natural beaches.
