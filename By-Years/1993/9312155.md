MOREnet state network. The new institutions connect to a hub located at the
University of Missouri at Columbia. Faculty and students at the institutions
will benefit from access to the resources of the Internet, including libraries
and supercomputers. In addition, they will be able to communicate and
collaborate with colleagues at other campuses in pursuit of research and
educational projects. The award provides partial support of the project for two
years. ***
