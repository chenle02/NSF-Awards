Nonlinear stochastic models, especially those which are either Markovian or may
be analyzed by Markovian methods, are the main focus of the proposal. Among
these are nonlinear autoregressive (-moving average) processes of much interest
in time series analysis, and random perturbations of dynamical systems and flows
which exhibit various phase transitions as a parameter changes. The interplay
between Markov processes and dynamical systems that this proposal explores has
significant consequences to both fields. For those Markov processes which
approach a unique steady state as time progresses, a further object of study is
the central limit theorem and its refinement by asymptotic expansions. These
refinements have applications in diverse areas such as bootstrapping in time
series, and singular perturbation expansions of large time solutions of a class
of partial differential equations which arise in the prediction of the spread of
contaminants in an aquifer. Random processes which occur in nature may often be
regarded as a deterministic system perturbed by random noise. Just as the nature
of the deterministic part greatly influences the behavior of the random process,
the statistical behavior of the random process may also be used in predicting
the large time behavior of the deterministic system itself. This latter study is
particularly useful in analyzing complex deterministic systems such as those
arising in the study of turbulence. The present proposal seeks to explore this
interplay between deterministic and random processes. Another object is the
refinement of precise statistical laws governing the long-run average behavior
of many important random phenomena. Among diverse potential applications are
bootstrapping in time series and the prediction of the spread of contaminants in
an aquifer.
