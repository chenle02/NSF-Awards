The proposal calls for the development of a versatile high- repetition rate
short-pulse laser system and the associated ability to carry out correlation and
coincidence measurements on electron and ion time-of-flight signals. These tools
will be applied to a wide range of problems including: Correlation techniques to
unambiguously determine dissociation pathways of highly ionized diatomic
molecules in strong laser fields, Curve crossing in transient states of
molecular ions, and Fundamental measurements in the above-threshold-ionization
of atoms by strong laser fields. ***
