The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to address a key challenge in the response
to COVID-19, namely manufacturing sufficient quantities of novel therapeutics
and vaccines. This project can shorten the development times of drugs by as much
as 6 months, accelerating translation of new therapeutics. This technology will
also enable more testing, thereby increasing the performance and potentially
reducing the side effects of these drugs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I
project advances the manufacturing of biologics, which starts with a high
performing clonal cell line derived (by definition) from a single cell.
Developing such a cell line today takes up to 6 months due to iterative
screening and testing to assure quality and performance. The proposed project
aims to enable selection of a high performing cell clone in one day compared to
many months by using a proprietary single cell proteomics platform, at an
unprecedented throughput rather than lengthy, iterative selection, clonal
expansion and analytics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
