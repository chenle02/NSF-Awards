The Vermont Information Technology Project-Foundations for the Future, (VTF3),
is a comprehensive information technology education and training improvement
project. It is increasing the pool and expertise of Vermont's IT technicians by
changing information technology education and training network into a new model
to meet future economic growth and development needs. Guided by a structured
partnership of employers, secondary and postsecondary educators, and government
agencies, the VTF3 project is developing a more flexible, responsive IT
curriculum lattice model of self-contained education, training and work
experience modules, recognized by both academic credit and industry skill
standards certifications, that allows student flexibility to move across area
specialties as well as to increase expertise in a given specialty.&lt;br/&gt;
VTF3 engages faculty and teachers in a faculty development effort to research
and develop a new pedagogy to increase the motivation and retention of potential
students. By focused attention to the recruitment and retention of women,
minorities and students with disabilities, the VTF3 Project is broadening the
base of the potential IT workforce.&lt;br/&gt;
