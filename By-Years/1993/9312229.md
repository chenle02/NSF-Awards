Professor Paik will continue his program of research in experimental
gravitational physics. His group will design and construct electromechanical
transducers to measure extremely small signals in current and future
gravitational wave detectors. Professor Paik's devices will be used in the new
receiver nearing completion at Stanford University. He will also carry out a
design for transducers associated with a large spherical detector planned for
the future.
