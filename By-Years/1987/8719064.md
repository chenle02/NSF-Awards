This research, by a team of cognitive scientists at the University of Texas at
Austin, develops a theory of attitudes. The theory is based on logical and
computational models. In particular, the dynamics of attitudes, the mechanism by
which they change in response to information input, are being investigated.
Modeling of attitudes is important to knowledge and database systems since
automated natural language processing systems have proved unable to understand
unrestricted narrative, exposition, or dialogue without additional contextual
information such as the attitudes of speaker and listener. Models and systems
which bring this additional context to bear are therefore crucial.
