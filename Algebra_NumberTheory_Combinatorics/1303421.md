The proposer K. Kato constructed moduli spaces of degenerating mixed Hodge
structures in joint works with C. Nakayama and S. Usui. This extends the
classical theory of toroidal compactifications of Hermitian symmetric domains.
He also obtained the p-adic analogue of it. These works on period domains are
related to many interesting areas. Asymptotic behaviors of regulator maps and
local height pairings, degeneration of motives, asymptotic behaviors of
divergences which occur in physics, Hodge conjecture, and also to Iwasawa
theory. The relation to Iwasawa theory comes from the fact that the regulator
maps and zeta values are related, and also comes from the fact that the boundary
of the compactifications of modular varieties play important roles in the
generalization of Sharifi conjectures which give refinements of Iwasawa main
conjecture. The study of degeneration is also related to ramification theory of
schemes. The proposer wishes to study these areas. In the generalization of
Sharifi conjectures, he collaborates with the co-principal investigator T.
Fukaya.

This study provides new interactions between Hodge theory, arithmeticand
physics. People in different areas can enter the other fields via this study.
The proposer anticipates that many graduate students will choose to write theses
in areas related to the materials in this proposal.
