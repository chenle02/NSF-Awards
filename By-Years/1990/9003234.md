The sea snail Aplysia possesses very large nerve cells which enable researchers
to study the nervous system at the molecular and cellular level. Analytical
techniques are used to study the cellular changes which form the biological
basis for habituation and learning in this mollusc. Aplysia, and other related
species, have been useful in the investigation of the neurological basis of
complex behavioral patterns. A conference, under the auspices of the Cold Spring
Harbor Laboratory, has been planned to assemble researchers studying the cell
and molecular biology of Aplysia. The intent of this meeting is to discuss new
methods and findings that have emerged from the successful utilization of the
Aplysian nervous system.
