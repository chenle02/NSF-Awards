The Department of Mathematics will host the summer program Iowa State University
Mathematics Research Experiences for Undergraduates three times over five years.
The goals of the ISU Math REU are to provide a supportive environment where
students can discover the excitement of mathematical research, to increase the
number of US citizens including women and minorities receiving Ph.D.s in the
mathematical sciences, and to produce high quality research suitable for
publication. The REU will conclude with a symposium of student presentations;
each team also prepares a final report. Many teams submit papers for publication
and most REU students present their work at national conferences. Participants
will be provided a stipend, accommodation in University student housing, and
some travel and meal expenses, and will have the opportunity to participate in
social activities for REU students. Women and minorities are particularly
encouraged to apply to this REU. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each year the program is
offered, twelve students will be selected to spend eight weeks working on
research projects in teams as part of active research groups at ISU. The
projects are in a variety of mathematical areas, representing the diverse
research interests of the ISU Mathematics Department, such as matrix theory,
graph theory and combinatorics, modeling and numerical analysis, and
probability. Current and previous projects are described in more detail on the
website http://orion.math.iastate.edu/reu/. The ISU Math REU also serves to
develop the next generation of undergraduate research leadership by involving
ISU junior faculty in both mentoring and co-directing the REU, welcoming ISU
postdoctoral fellows and faculty at area colleges as additional research
mentors, and by selecting graduate research assistants who are interested in
college teaching.
