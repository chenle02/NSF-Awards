This doctoral dissertation improvement project will study the loss of nitrogen
from soils to the atmosphere, a process called denitrification. Traditionally,
denitrification was thought to occur mostly in surface soils, but recent
evidence suggests that deeper soils can also play an important role in the
nitrogen cycle. This project will conduct a series of experiments to assess the
rates of denitrification from deep soils and how this affected by specific
agricultural practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Denitrification represents one of
the major pathways that biologically available nitrogen leaves terrestrial
ecosystems, along with leaching, volatilization, and runoff, and is the only
process capable of returning nitrogen to its inert form of dinitrogen gas.
Understanding where and at what rate dinitrification occurs is fundamental to
understanding the nitrogen cycle.
