Acid rain has become a major concern during the past decade. Rain has a natural
acidity due to dissolved carbon dioxide. The acidity of rain is made even
greater by the emission of certain gases from human endeavors. Coal burning
power plants emit substantial quantities of sulfur dioxide and high temperature
combustion processes, such as automobile engines, yield nitrogen oxides. These
gases are eventually converted into acids. A description of the chemical
processes involved in changing these gases into acids and the speed of these
reactions are important keys to understanding the geographic distribution of
acid rain and the impact of particular sources of the precursor gases. Sulfur
dioxide dissolves into water droplets which provide a chemical medium for the
oxidation of sulfur dioxide into acid. A vital species in this reaction is
hydrogen peroxide. It is therefore important to understand the mechanisms by
which hydrogen peroxide is formed and destroyed in the atmosphere. Hydrogen
peroxide is highly soluble and is known to have deleterious effects on plants.
In contrast to the gas phase chemistry of hydrogen peroxide, the chemistry in
droplets is not well understood. This project focuses on examining the aqueous
chemistry of hydrogen peroxide with emphasis on laboratory studies of the
reactions that form and destroy hydrogen peroxide under conditions approximating
those found in cloudwater. The chemistry will be investigated by the technique
of radiolysis in synthetic precipitation, i. e., aqueous solutions of known
composition approximating that of cloudwater. These laboratory studies will
provide data to test the applicability of various models of cloud chemistry.
