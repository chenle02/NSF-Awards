With this CAREER Award, the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division
is supporting fundamental research of Professor Jimmie D. Weaver at Oklahoma
State University. Professor Weaver will study photoinitiated electron transfer
as a means of activating halogenated arenes, heteroarenes, and polyfluorinated
arenes towards carbon-carbon bond forming reactions. This research will provide
fundamental understanding of the reactivity of transient radical and radical ion
species as well as new methods for the construction of important chemical
motifs. Proposed routes are shorter, more efficient and allow the syntheses of
previously inaccessible structures. In addition, Professor Weaver will integrate
the research and educational components of this project by providing a
nontraditional based lab experience which exposes undergraduates to cutting edge
research, as well as an outreach program aimed at stimulating curiosity in
science among elementary students. His research group will develop a database of
essential information on the relevant electrochemical properties of molecules in
an easily accessible online platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research, new
methods will be developed for the photochemical synthesis of alkylated,
arylated, and alkenylated arenes, heteroarenes and polyfluorinated arenes by
formation of strategic carbon-carbon bonds. Changes to the leaving group, the
electronic structure of the arene, and the photocatalyst all factor into the
nature of the observed reaction. A variety of mechanistically distinct reactions
will be developed. This research will facilitate: 1) the design of safer
reactions that do not involve highly reactive chemicals, 2) the use of less
expensive chemical processes for which no prefunctionalization is needed, and 3)
the development of reactions with high chemoselectivity and functional group
tolerance.
