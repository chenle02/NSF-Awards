Intellectual Merits: One of the central issues in the evolutionary field is to
understand the impact of duplicate genes on evolution. The proposed research
will contribute to this understanding by demonstrating how gene duplication
contributes to metabolic innovation and specifically to aerobic fermentation in
yeast. The research builds on a kinetic modeling framework to investigate how
gene duplication contributed to the evolution of novel metabolic functions. One
aspect of the research will explore also the evolutionary connection of gene
duplication and novel gene regulatory mechanisms and how these contribute to
cellular metabolic innovation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This
research will have important broader impacts. It will train students, including
graduate, undergraduate and high school students. The PI is involved in multiple
activities to include minority students with the hope to encourage and support a
diverse next generation of evolutionary scientists. Aerobic fermentation in
yeast has broader implication for agricultural and industrial industries. The
link between nutrition and evolution itself represents an attractive case study
for the edcuation of the public on the subject of evolution.
