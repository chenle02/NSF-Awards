ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geoscience Education in Public Parks: Harriman
State Park,&lt;br/&gt; New York&lt;br/&gt;A universal model is being developed
for Geoscience education in public parks near urban centers. This phase of the
project will be to develop an educational videotape and a website. The model is
being developed in the 75,000 acre Harriman-Bear Mountain-Sterling Forest State
Park, 25 miles to the north of New York City in the Hudson Highlands. The park
now&lt;br/&gt;receives 4.2 million visitors annually including a large
proportion of groups who are traditionally underrepresented in the sciences.
Outstanding roadside and trailside rock exposures beautifully illustrate
fundamental principles of Geology, Mining, Environmental Science, and Civil
Engineering. Through them, visitors will be provided with an exciting, hands-on
science education experience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One area of geology that is
especially well illustrated is that developed during the Rodinian tectonic
cycle. An ongoing research project on this aspect of the geology involves five
researchers from different schools and their students. The results of these
ongoing investigations will be integrated into both the videotape and website.
The videotape will be made using new footage from the park as well as film
resources donated by ABC Inc. and will be widely distributed to participating
museums,schools, and recreational groups. Interlinks within the site will
explain the science and scientific data that leads to the explanations
presented. Topics for field trips will be largely based upon NJ and NY Science
Educational Standards for ready use in K-12 curricula.&lt;br/&gt;
