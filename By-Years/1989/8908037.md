The Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) Attenuated Total Reflectance
(ATR) capability purchased with this award will be used primarily for three
projects: (1) thickness determination of thin-film composite membranes for gas
separations, (2) determination of crosslink density and its variation with depth
for thin-gel composite membranes for bioseparations, and (3) determination of
the mechanisms of interfacial polycondensation. The latter two projects are
novel applications that take advantage of the depth-profiling capability of ATR-
FTIR spectroscopy. Thin film, solution-diffusion, composite membranes are an
attractive and versatile alternative to integrally-skinned asymmetric membranes.
In-situ, interfacial polycondensation is one method of producing the selective
film and has been used to produce composite membranes for reverse osmosis. It is
currently being used to produce thin-film composite membranes for gas
separations and thin-gel composite membranes. The ATR-FTIR capabilities will
greatly improve the productivity of the group working on these projects.
