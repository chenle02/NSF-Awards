A hardware Lisp Accelerator will be designed for solving the requirement to do
both numeric and symbolic processing in the same computer system. The need is
particularly acute with real time systems, such as expert systems for pilot
aiding, where vast amounts of numeric data must be processed, while multiple
expert systems operate simultaneously in real time. Coventional numeric computer
systems incur large software overhead while processing Lisp programs, and are
thus very slow by comparison to specialized artifical intelligence (AI)
computers known as Lisp Machines. Conversely, Lisp Machines are severely
deficient when applied to numeric tasks. Neither type, therefore, performs well
if required to handle multiple expert systems in real time. The research
approach is to develop a hardware Lisp Accelerator - functionally similar to a
numeric co-processor in a PC or an array processor in a scientific computer -
able to operate within the architecture of a conventional numeric computer
system. Multiple Accelarators as well as host-configurable, special-purpose
Accelerators will be explored. The conceptual design and necessary licensing are
done. Phase I will be a detailed analysis and simulation of the design. Phase II
will result in a working prototype.
