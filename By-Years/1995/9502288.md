9502288 Green The program of research is intended to strengthen the country's
research infrastructure through the education of M.S. and B.S. level engineers -
those engineers who are necessary for day-to-day operation of industrial and
research environments - in an emerging field of technology. The proposed
research topic, "Self-Aware Optical Elements," will result in advances in
technology for optical systems. The unifying feature of the various sub-projects
described is that they are all intend, as a whole to advance the state of the
art in manufacture of optical components with integrated sensors and actuators.
Through the success of this project, optical systems will become more robust
because of elements which can measure their own performance. Optical technology
will therefore become more readily available bringing the vast powers of optics
for signal processing, computing, sensing and communication further from the
laboratory table-top realm into everyday use. Resulting advances in MEMS
fabrication and device design techniques will be important to the emerging MEMS
technology field. Course development efforts will be directed towards the
integration of engineering design skills within the framework of laboratory
instruction. Early efforts in course development have resulted in an
undergraduate laboratory sequence which teaches engineering design as a series
of exercises covering fundamental skills necessary for successful projects.
Fundamental design skills include communications skills, data interpretation
skills, and significant practice in approaching open-ended problems. It is
emphasized to students that engineering is a creative discipline, and solutions
to difficult problems come from a combination of technical training and ability
to anticipate and interpret the vast sea of the unknown. ***
