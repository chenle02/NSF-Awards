9404481 Getzler The research entails a number of topics in the relatively new
area of topological field theory with applies methods of homological algebra and
algebraic topology to concepts in modern quantum field theory and superstrings.
Particular importance will be paid to the development of the cyclic Chern
character and the index of classes of pseudodifferential operators in the
setting of non-commutative differential geometry. The topics studied here are
considered as fundamental in modern mathematical physics. ***
