This is a proposal to invite a group of 20 solid state chemists, materials
scientists, physicists and engineers to a 1 1/2 day workshop to be held at Brown
University sometime in September or October of 1987 to investigate various modes
of funding for the purpose of providing materials for the physics and
engineering community.
