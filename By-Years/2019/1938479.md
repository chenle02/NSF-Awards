The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the reduction in single use plastics
contributing to landfill waste and ocean pollution by replacing them in
packaging with a fully biodegradable and naturally sourced alternative. With its
water-based proprietary technology, the material developed in this project will
transform shrimp shells into foam to replace conventional single-use packaging.
The advantages of this material include mechanical properties competitive with
non-sustainable alternatives at cost-competitive production.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
will develop the basic technology to scale the production of a compostable and
recyclable foam made of chitin. Chitin is a polysaccharide derived from shrimp
shell waste. The material has the same mechanical properties and thermal
insulation as polystyrene foam. Currently, this material is made with a hot
molding process that creates high-quality foam, but it is challenging to scale
for mass production of the volumes required to service the packaging industry.
With this project, the company will develop a process that is fully scalable and
uses existing equipment for the production of polystyrene foam for quicker
adoption. The goals of the new process are to generate the same mechanical
strength, thermal insulation, and density as polystyrene foam. The team will
vary the foam composition and processing parameters to achieve the desired
properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
