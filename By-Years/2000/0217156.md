Our world is composed of many ethnic communities in diaspora, each maintaining
to a different degree a sense of identity related to their culture of origin.
This research by cultural anthropologists studies patterns of variation in the
cultural identity of Welsh communities. The current research adds two
communities, one in Patagonia (Argentina) which retains the Welsh language and a
variety of other cultural practices, and one in Ohio where Welsh-Americans live
in self-consciously Welsh communities, but without retaining the language. The
new information from this project will be integrated with that from previous
studies of Welsh communities in Australia and Iowa as well as Wales. Hypotheses
dealing with the importance of language, ethnic museums, performances,
innovation in traditional institutions, and cultural exchange with Wales will be
tested. Using a variety of methods including in-depth interviews and consensus
analysis, a statistical technique that describes patterns of agreement and
disagreement among individuals, the study will advance our understanding of the
cultural construction of identity among diaspora communities. The broader
impacts of the research will be important as the project will allow us to better
understand how identity politics works in relation to cultural visibility.
