This project is intended to study the power of parallel computation by comparing
complexity classes defined on parallel models of computation with those defined
on sequential models. As a parallel model, we use logical circuits that operate
very quickly and that may have either bounded or unbounded fan-in. These yield
the classes NC and AC, respectively. Relativized methods and a decomposition
technique are both used to look at the structure of these classes and to compare
them to sequential classes such as L, NL and P. This project will also
investigate the structure of space bounded nondeterministic hierarches.
