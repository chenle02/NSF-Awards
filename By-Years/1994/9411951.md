9411951 Delph The study of plant-disease interactions is of fundamental
importance for improving our ability to control plant diseases and our
understanding of host-pathogen coevolution. Two areas of little previous
research are addressed by this project: to what extent does variation in genetic
and environmnetal factors explain the patchy distribution of disease in nature,
and how does disease influence the evolution of the host's breeding system? This
project examines the relationship between Silene acaulis and a pollinator-
transmitted fungal disease, Microbotryum violaceum to address these questions.
This research will improve our understanding of host-pathogen ecology and
coevolution. The results of this study may have application to the field of
plant pathology, specifically disease prevention and control in crops.
