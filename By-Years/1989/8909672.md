One of the most essential issues in a shared memory multiprocessor system isthe
so called memory latency that includes both the main memory access timeand the
interconnection network (IN) contention. The introduction of cachememory into
parallel computers has been widely accepted as an efficient way ofimproving the
system performance. However, multicaches create a cachecoherence problem which
must be solved in order for a computer to workcorrectly. Traditional solution
techniques for the cache coherence problem inshared memory multiprocessor
systems have a potential bottleneck problem whichsignificantly restricted the
scalability of multiprocessor systems. This pasresearch project investigates new
distributed cache coherence protocols basedon high bandwidth, packet.switched
multiple.bus INs. Two configurations ofthe multiple.bus will be considered in
this research: hierarchicalstructures of buses and homogeneous single.level
multiple buses. It alsoinvestigates analytical models for the cache protocols
based on the twostructures to show the performance improvement of the new
protocols. Theresearch thus involves (a) study of the correctness and efficiency
of the newprotocols; (b) development of analytical models for the systems;
(c)performance comparison of the two structures based on different
applicationsoftwares; (d) examination of the effects of system parameters on the
systemperformance including number of buses, cache block size, number of levels
in ahierarchy, and number of modules connected to a bus at each level.
