This workshop on the Neurobiology of Stress, to be held in Philadelphia, PA June
12-15th, brings together researchers (principal investigators and trainees) who
study stress-brain interactions and the basic neurobiology of these
interactions. In recent years there have been significant advances in the
neurobiology of stress research. Those advances include new understanding of the
neurosystems, neurochemistry, and cellular biology that supports stress
responses and stress adaptation. Session topics and speakers for this Workshop
have been selected to cover many of those exciting new advances. The Workshop
will provide an important forum where new advances can be critically evaluated
and integrated into the collective knowledge and perspectives of active basic
stress researchers. Moreover, it is expected that the intensive scientific
exchange will generate new ideas and collaborations that support future
advances. There are significant broader impacts that will emerge from this
meeting. The results will be widely disseminated in two premier journals.
Assessment tools will be developed to determine the extent to which scientific
exchange occurred, to assess the value of the scientific knowledge and content
acquired, and any resultant collaborations or exchanges. These multifactorial
tools can be broadly disseminated to organizers of other conferences. Finally,
multiple opportunities exist for trainees to become engaged in the scientific
program, including a specific plan to recruit female and minority students to
attend the meeting. A significant portion of the requested funds will be used to
fund meritorious trainees. This will help expand diversity and encourage
trainees to stay in science careers and this is important for generating new
ideas and new approaches towards solving problems that have plagued American
society for decades.
