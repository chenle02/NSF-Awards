This research is concerned with linear and non-linear optical properties of
colloidal microparticles. The microparticles are prepared by methods such as
condensation, oxidation-reduction reaction, and electrical dispersion. The
nonlinear optical properties are investigated using the frequency-doubled output
of a Nd:YAG laser at 532 nm for degenerate four-wave mixing. A determination of
the third-order susceptibility is made from the intensity of the optical phase
conjugate signal generated in the four-wave mixing. The nonlinear optical
property of the microparticles is determined as the function of cluster size and
composition. These studies are of interest because they: a) will allow a direct
test of the predictions of theory, b) will enhance the current understanding of
the quantum size effects, c) have possible application in new optical switches,
optical gates, etc. and d) will enhance quality of education at a minority
undergraduate institution.
