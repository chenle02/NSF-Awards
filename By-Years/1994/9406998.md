Marker-propagation networks (MPNs) represent a powerful computational model
especially suitable for artificial intelligence and other applications where
information is often uncertain and incompletely specified. MPNs refer to
networks of active nodes and labeled links. The power and novelty of this model
derives from the fact that the processing instruments are programmable data
patterns of flexible length called markers. Node processing is activated by the
arrival of markers. Marker propagations through the network are not driven by
destination addresses, instead, they depend on local conditions in the nodes,
network topology and the information programmed in each marker. This is a major
difference between MPNs and other parallel processing models, and it is the
reason why MPNs are capable of handling weakly or incompletely specified
applications. Previous work in the area of marker--propagation processing
assumed much simpler models. The model studied in this project operates
asynchronously, and is highly programmable. Some of the critical issues related
to the implementation of MPNs on existing parallel computers are possible
programming paradigms, sources of parallelism, load balancing, design tradeoffs,
and others. The approach taken in this project is a quantitative one, meaning
that the model is implemented on several parallel computers, performance is
measured and the results compared. The MPN model offers scalability and has the
potential of being a preferred architecture for future supercomputers dedicated
to knowledge processing applications.
