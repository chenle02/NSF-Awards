This Empirical Implications of Theoretical Models training award affords the
student the opportunity to take a year of courses at Columbia University in
formal and empirical training. His dissertation asks the question: how does the
introduction of the news media as a strategic actor affect the political
representation process. Further training in game theory will allow him to apply
formal logic to a number of understudied questions within political
communication and congressional scholarship. The training will strengthen the
dissertation and will strengthen the research and teaching skills of the
student.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award has the broader social value of
enhancing understanding about legislator, news media and constituency
interaction. It also strengthens the research and teaching skills of this member
of the professorate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
