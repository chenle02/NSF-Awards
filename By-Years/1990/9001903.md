The principle investigator will study the inverse scattering problem by using
two mathematical methods called the Wiener-Hopf factorization of operators and
the generalized Muskhelishvili-Vekua method. Besides being powerful tools to
solve an important problem in physics, the methods of this proposal will also
contribute to various pure and applied areas of mathematics such as operator
theory, functional analysis, partial differential equations, integral equations,
and complex analysis.
