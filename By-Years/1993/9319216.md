9319216 Abolins This grant supports a program of research in elementary-
particle physics with an international collaboration that studies properties of
proton-antiproton interactions produced in the Fermilab Tevatron colliding-beams
accelerator complex. Topics of interest include a continuing search for the
elusive top quark, precision measurement of parameters important for detailed
investigation of the validity of the "standard model" theoretical framework.
Included is support for further instrumentation development to improve the
capability of the detection apparatus. ***
