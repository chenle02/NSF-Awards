Jerome 9704458 The investigator develops, analyzes, and computes with models of
biological transport for ionic channels. Ionic channels are now known to mediate
significant electrical activity through cellular membranes. The discovery of the
patch clamp has made experimental verification of such electrical currents
possible. Theoretical predictions proceed through a hierarchy of models. For the
simpler models, categorization of possible behavior is sought, and the dynamics
carefully studied. In particular, gating is analyzed in great detail; this
includes both regular and anomalous behavior. An understanding of the relation
of the channel to its ambient environment is achieved through the calculation of
the heat exchange of the protein. In addition, a complex asymptotic procedure
yields a high field model, particularly appropriate for channels, yet originally
developed for semiconductors. This proposal benefits from the investigators'
previous experience in semiconductor modeling. The common thread of electro-
diffusion leads to mathematical models of surprising similarity. This analogy
has facilitated some interesting studies, as well as some provocative
conjectures. One of these deals with the role of temperature in channels.
Another deals with so-called active transport, and the association with the
molecule ATP. Ionic channels are protein molecules in cell membranes, and have
been linked to such diverse applications as drug receptors on the one hand, and
irregular gating in the brain and mental illness on the other hand. The
investigator and colleagues in mathematics and biology model the electrical and
energetic activity of channels. The project greatly benefits from the similarity
in the mathematical models developed for both ionic channels and semiconductor
devices. Whereas electrical currents are induced by ions in channels, a similar
role is played by electrons and holes in semiconductors. Powerful electric
fields coexist with int ense biological activity in the channel pore. The
principal investigator and his colleagues study these analogies, as well as
separate issues of biological import, including the possibility of explaining,
in mathematical terms, the pulses associated with the opening and closing of
channels and the energetics associated with active transport, including the
action of various ion "pumps." The work aims to clarify details surrounding
energy exchange, heating, and temperature variation. The project uses both
mathematical analysis and extensive computer simulations.
