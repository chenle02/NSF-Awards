This study will investigate public response to an HIV crisis communication
occasioned by the disclosure that a local emergency room physician carried the
HIV virus. A probability sample of households in the hospital's service area
will be surveyed. The project will attempt to identify factors associated with
the public's differential response to this announcement. Among other issues, the
process whereby individuals construct definitions of personal risk and the role
of social networks as "decision framers" in this process will be studied.
