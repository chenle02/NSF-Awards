With the addition of new faculty in 1990 and 1993, the Department of Biology
began an effort to expand its educational and research programs in organismal
animal biology. Laboratory courses in Neurobiology and Advanced Physiological
Ecology (Seminar) were added to the curriculum in 1993 and changes in the
Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy and Animal Physiology courses increased students'
experience with investigational laboratories. These changes have been
accompanied by a tremendous increase in students enrolling in these courses
(from 38 in 1990-91 to 88 in 1994-95). The need for laboratory equipment to
support and continue these curriculum improvements has been intensified by the
increase in student enrollment. This project obtains the equipment necessary to
provide modern investigative laboratory experiences for two courses in
vertebrate form and function (currently Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy and
Animal Physiology) and to supplement the offerings in neurobiology and advanced
physiology seminar. The equipment allows increasing numbers of students the
opportunity to work in small groups to design and carry out meaningful
investigations using an array of basic laboratory techniques. These laboratory
courses each reflect the investigative nature of biology, as well as promote the
integration of information and research methods used to study animal biology on
numerous levels of organization. The Biology Department has a vital and rigorous
program, and a large proportion of students continue their education in
professional and graduate programs. The department also emphasizes the potential
vocations in biological industries through vigorous career counseling. The
investment in high-quality investigative laboratories in organismal biology that
this project provides ensures that students will be better prepared to meet
their own educational objectives with problem-solving and investigative skills.
