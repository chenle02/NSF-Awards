With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at James Madison University will acquire a thermal
gravimetric analyzer - mass spectrometer (TGA-MS) instrument. This equipment
will enhance research in a number of areas including a) investigating the
kinetics of decomposition reactions that occur on volatile organic compounds
catalysts; b) studying the stability andpotential catalytic activity of novel
framework phosphates and phosphonates; and c) determining the mechanism for the
decomposition of precursors during the formation of thin films with low and high
dielectric constants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The TGA-MS instrument will enable
researchers to conduct high-quality research that will increase the knowledge
base in several areas of materials chemistry that could lead to the development
of better catalysts. The instrument will also play an important role in the
design and development of new project-based laboratories that emulate the
research experience in traditional classroom environments. &lt;br/&gt;
