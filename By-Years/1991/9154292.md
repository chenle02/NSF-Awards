Many institutions of higher learning that provide instruction in astronomy do
not possess modern, well-equipped facilities. Further, many introductory
astronomy courses are taught by individuals whose professional training is in
another field. We particularly seek such persons, frequently found at community
colleges, for participation in a three-week workshop in which they are exposed
to: (1) observing with astronomical telescopes; (2) devices, including portable
equipment, that can be used to stimulate student interest in the cosmos; (3) a
variety of additional activities that illustrate the methods of astronomy and
that can be used to enhance undergraduate teaching programs. Participants reside
on Tufts' residential campus in Medford, Massachusetts, and have access to the
facilities of the Witin Observatory of Wellesley College, some 20 miles distant,
for observing sessions. A large portion of the remainder of the time is devoted
to involving participants in the types of "laboratory" exercises they might use
with their students. Other activities include a field trip to a nearby radio
observatory; discussion of classroom techniques, and discussions of current
research in relevant fields.
