Biologists know a great deal about how the process of development makes a brain,
but less about the mechanisms employed during the evolution of brain diversity.
The proposed research integrates the disciplines of ecology, evolutionary
genetics and molecular biology to determine how some of the earliest events in
an organism's lifetime lead to differences in brain organization, and ultimately
to differences in behavior. Expected outcomes include the identification of
developmental signaling pathways that organize embryonic brains and the means by
which changes in these pathways drive ecologically relevant brain
diversification.

Broader impacts include (i) an integrative understanding of the relationship
between animal development and behavior, (ii) the training of female and
science-minority postdoctoral scientists, and (iii) creative educational
programs for inner city Atlanta elementary schools.
