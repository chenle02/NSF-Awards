Ichiba&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1615229&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The project sheds light on
mathematical aspects of information in financial markets. Here information
signifies the data that are observations of a random process, for example the
price of a stock over time. In the era of information technology more financial
information is available about markets and each investor needs to process the
flooding information. Precise mathematical understanding of information provides
some criteria to decide which information is more important than other
information in the financial market. Sharing this mathematical idea among
investors would provide efficiency of information processing, enhance
transparency of financial trading, and possibly increase the stability of the
financial markets. The project also has potential consequences in other fields
of research where data arise from observations of random processes, such as
economics, statistics, engineering, and physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In
approximating random phenomena in financial markets, financial information is
understood as a set of filtrations generated by continuous-time stochastic
processes. The investigator studies rank-based diffusion market models -- these
are systems of stochastic partial differential equations with singularities of
various sorts -- that may better represent market information. In order to
quantify and better understand the information in these processes, he examines
them in two different information settings, non-Brownian filtrations and
information drifts, In the first setting he considers existence of solutions,
from which he can work to separate non-Browwnian noise from observable
information. In the second he examines the information drift when the filtration
is enlarged, which can introduce arbitrage opportunities. The consequences of
emerging non-Brownian filtration and information drifts are examined in the
context of stochastic portfolio theory. These two problems are closely related.
