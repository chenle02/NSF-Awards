Through this project, Lamar University will develop physics demonstrations to
constitute a "lending library" for physics and physical science teachers in
schools located near the University. Each packaged demonstration will reinforce
a single concept in physics and will be used to supplement the usual
lecture/demonstration format. Members of the Lamar University physics department
will design, build and maintain the demonstrations, and expect to produce 20
packages during the period of this project. The implementation of the project
will be carried out in the frame work of four components. (1) the design and
construction of self-contained demonstration packages; (2) the maintenance of
these single concept demonstration packages at Lamar University, to be checked
out by area precollege teachers; (3) the presentation of workshops on the
effective use of the demonstration; (4) follow-up visits to the schools where
the demonstrations are being used. This project is developing an innovative
approach to enhancing instruction in phyics, an approach with good potential for
serving as a model for other institutions and disciplines.
