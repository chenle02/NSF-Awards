This research deals with scheduling algorithms for parallel execution of tasks
in parallel computations. The project develops innovative scheduling schemes for
parallel loops in numeric computations and dynamically spawned work in AND and
OR parallel symbolic computations. The work focuses on the design and
implementation of scheduling algorithms for shared and distributed memory
machines in the framework of the Chare-Kernel parallel programming system. The
schemes is evaluated with a comprehensive set of benchmark programs for both
numeric and AND/OR computations
