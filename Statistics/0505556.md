The investigator studies several problems in the theory of fractional factorial
design. Some recent results in finite projective geometry provide powerful tools
for characterizing the structures of regular fractional factorial designs of
resolution IV in certain important cases. One major research activity is to
expand these tools and apply them to develop a comprehensive theory for the
determination and construction of optimal regular fractional factorial designs
of resolution IV under the criterion of minimum aberration. The results are
further extended to nonregular designs and the situation where the experimental
units are divided into more homogeneous blocks to improve precision. The
research on nonregular designs provides new methods for constructing orthogonal
arrays of strength three. Hidden projection properties of multi-level designs
are also investigated. Under the assumption of effect sparsity, a design with
good projections onto small subsets of factors can provide useful information
after the small number of active factors have been identified.

Experimental design is used extensively in a wide range of scientific and
industrial investigations. In industrial experiments, often a large number of
factors have to be studied, but the experiments are expensive to conduct. In
this case, only a small fraction of all the possible combinations can be
observed, and how to choose a good fraction is an important issue. In recent
years, such fractional factorial designs have received considerable attention,
mainly due to the success in applying them to conduct experiments for improving
quality and productivity in industrial manufacturing. This research is to study
the construction of efficient designs to extract more information. Experimenters
will be benefited by having a rich source of new and good designs, and will be
able to run their experiments more efficiently. Better industrial experiments
can improve the quality of products and reduce production cost.
