Multiscale Systems Engineering for Nanocomposites&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Multiscale Systems Engineering for Nanocomposites (MSEN) project will address
advanced modeling, simulation, optimization, and control technologies to provide
the basis for nanocomposite design where the systematic exploration of
alternatives is supported by a hierarchy of models that provides a consistent
description of multiscale phenomena. These technologies will build upon adaptive
simulation methods that account for scale interactions, employ parameter
optimization, and operate using computationally efficient parallel software.
Working with industrial partners, the MSEN project will clearly demonstrate the
role of multiscale system engineering in the development of nanocomposites
applications beginning with indicating basic materials development
needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MSEN project education and outreach program will
involve undergraduate and graduate students in multidisciplinary research and
include student and faculty exchange between Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
and Howard University to foster diversity of participation of minorities. An
interactive tool demonstrating the concepts of multiscale systems engineering
applicable in K-12 demonstrations, undergraduate and graduate education will be
developed. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This award is jointly funded by the NSF
Divisions of CMS, DMII, EEC and DMS and monitored by CMS and DMII .
