The primary objective of the project is to develop a competitive research
proposal on "The Social Psychological Consequences of Underemployment." Support
of the project will assist a well trained black sociologist to improve her
research capability and to complete the planning and development of a regular
MRI proposal. The planning activities, if successful, will significantly enhance
the potential of the investigator to compete for MRI and other research support.
