The LI-6200 portable photosynthesis system and plant water status console will
be used to study whole plant function in the laboratory, greenhouse, growth
chambers, and in the field. The equipment will be used primarily in the Plant
Physiology and Ecology courses. Previously, basic principles of stomatal
function, photosynthesis, and water relations were taught using plant parts and
traditional techniques. Now, using the recently developed technology, students
will be able to extend the principles from those simple systems to growing
plants. They will design and conduct experiments enabling them to observe
effects of plant growth regulators, temperature, soil moisture, and nutrient
availability on whole plant function. The college will provide 50% matching
funds.
