High performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE) offers important advantages
over conventional gel electrophoresis in the characterization of proteins and
nucleic acids. It is much faster than the gels and can be fully automated and
instrumented with sample injection, detection and collection. In addition, HPCE
can separate solutes with a resolution which is one to two orders of magnitude
greater than high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using sample sizes
four orders of magnitude smaller than HPLC. However, single-capillary HPCE can
only handle solutes loadings of less than 1 ug. It cannot be used at preparatory
scales to provide material for further analysis, clinical research or
therapeutic application. Most scientists familiar with this technology believe
that, if HPCE could be scaled to preparative levels, it would become an
indispensable laboratory tool. Unfortunately, scale-up to preparative HPCE is
not simple: a preparative HPCE column must dissipate Joule heat effectively
while maintaining the extraordinarily high plate efficiency routinely observed
in ug. HPCE. To reach the goal of 1 mg HPCE, a study is proposed which combines
both theoretical and experimental analyses of single and multiple capillary
HPCE. The objectives of this research are to (1) elucidate the mechanisms of
heat transfer, separation and dispersion in single capillaries and to apply this
knowledge in the (2) design of a preparative-scale HPCE column.
