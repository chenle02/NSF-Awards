UCLA has a unique environment for advancing the careers of young researchers.
State of the art research in applied mathematics, including image processing,
materials science, and fluid dynamics is developed with full participation of a
vibrant group of graduate students and postdocs. We propose to build on this
program to provide an exceptional training and mentoring experience for younger
students at the undergraduate and early graduate level. This program will
support, over five years, up to 60 REU students from both UCLA and Harvey Mudd
College. Proposed research projects include spatio-temporal pattern analysis in
crime data, experimental and analysis of slurry flows, imaging processing, and
cooperative control of robotic vehicles. An additional group of 15 PhD students,
in the early stages of their career, will develop a research career in applied
mathematics. These students will have the opportunity to participate in summer
internship projects with faculty from other departments and with industry and
national laboratories. Students will receive additional training in computation
as well as mathematical analysis skills necessary to succeed in a top PhD
program.

The investigators propose a research training program to enhance the workforce
of US citizens and permanent residents entering research study applied and
computational differential equations. This program is designed for undergraduate
students and graduate students in the early part of a research career. They will
work both one-on-one and in small research groups with faculty mentors on
cutting edge research problems in an immersive research environment. This
program will support, over five years, up to 60 REU students from both UCLA and
Harvey Mudd College. These students will have the opportunity to be part of a
research team in a large research university. Proposed research projects include
modeling of crime in Los Angeles, laboratory and mathematical studies of mud
slides, medical imaging, and coordination and tracking of autonomous vehicles.
In addition, up to 15 PhD students, in the early part of their careers, will
participate in this program, which includes summer graduate internship projects
with faculty from other departments and with industry and national laboratories.
All students in the program will have the opportunity to participate in new
curricular activities aimed at developing the mathematical and computational
background necessary to succeed in a top PhD program in computational and
applied mathematics.
