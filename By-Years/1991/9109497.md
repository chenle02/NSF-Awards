An implementation of a shared data object is wait-free if the operations of the
data object are implemented without any unbounded busy-waiting loops or idle-
waiting primitives. Wait-free shared data objects are inherently resilient to
fail-stop faults: a process that fails (i.e., stops its execution) while
accessing such a data object cannot block the progress of any other process;
intuitively, a faulty process has the same effect on other processes as a very
slow one. Two research projects are contained herein, both of which extend
previous work on wit-free shared data objects. The first project considers the
implementation of wait-free shared data objects with read-modify-write
operations. Such operations lie at the heart of many transaction processing
applications; thus, because wait-free shared data objects are inherently fault
tolerant, this work offers an attractive alternative to more traditional
transaction processing schemes, such as checkpointing, logging, timeouts, etc.
The second project considers the construction of wait-free shared data objects
in message-passing systems. Such data objects provide the illusion of a fault-
tolerant, virtual shared memory machine, and thus allow programmers to think in
terms of shared memory when designing fault- tolerant algorithms for message-
passing systems.
