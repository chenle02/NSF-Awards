ABSTRACT: CMS-9613906, Ronaldo Borja, Stanford U. The objective of this research
program is to develop a mathematical model for analyzing the problem of lateral
flow and liquefaction-induced large ground movement during and following an
earthquake. The model is based on a two-phase mixture theory, and involves the
development of a finite element code capable of representing the behavior of
saturated soils prior to and during liquefaction. Prior to liquefaction, the
soil is represented by an already- validated effective-stress phenomenological
constitutive model based on an elastoplastic formulation with nonlinear
kinematic hardening. During liquefaction, the liquefied soil is represented by a
total-stress viscoplastic model whose viscosity is determined from extensive
numerical simulations with random suspensions of spheres. The two constitutive
models are developed within the framework of a finite deformation theory based
on multiplicative plasticity. The resulting finite element model is used to
study the mechanism of liquefaction-related large ground displacement, including
the lateral flow and prediction of the free ground surface resulting from such
flow. Two case studies are considered in order to validate the model. The first
involves a loose saturated sample of Toyoura sand submerged in water and sloped
inside a test subjected to dynamic excitation, causing the soil to liquefy and
flow like a viscous fluid. The second study involves a re-analysis of the
nonlinear ground response recorded by a downhole array in Port Island (reclaimed
ground near downtown Kobe City, Japan) during the earthquake of January 17,
1995, focusing on the impact of this changed soil behavior during liquefaction.
The ground response is simulated assuming a condition of vertically propagating
seismic waves, with a full kinematical coupling of the three components of
motion.
