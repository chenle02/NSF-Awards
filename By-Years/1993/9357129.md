This study in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division is supported through the NSF Young Investigator Awards
Program and involves the formulation and implementation of new electronic
structure methods for calculating electronically excited states for both
molecules and gas-surface systems. Further, connections are being sought to
dynamical theories to allow first-principles predictions of energy flow in, and
the chemical reactivity of, such excited states. %%% In this study supported by
the NSF Young Investigator Awards Program new theoretical and computational
methods are being developed for describing the excited electronic states and the
chemical reactivity of molecules in the gas phase or on surfaces.
