This research represents an investigation of the dynamics of electrons in
disordered metals where the electrical properties are determined primarily by
quantum mechanical interference effects. The objective is to reach an
understanding of the frequency- dependent conductance in the regime where the
measurement frequency is greater than the quantum dephasing rate. Disordered
two- and three-dimensional samples and also submicron samples. The electrical
conductance and susceptance will be measured for frequencies from dc to 20
GigaHertz, for temperatures down to 0.02 Kelvin, and for magnetic fields up to
10 tesla. The sample composition and geometry will also be varied. In addition
to adding the determination of a new experimental parameter in the study of
quantum transport these studies are in an important regime for the technology of
mesoscopic systems.
