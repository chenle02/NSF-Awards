This award supports cooperative research in heterogeneous catalysis to be
conducted by Prof. Eduardo E. Wolf of the University of Notre Dame and Mr. Paulo
Araya of the Chemical Engineering Department of the University of Chile. The
work will be mainly experimental studies using infrared techniques developed at
Notre Dame to verify theoretical work now in progress. Heterogeneous catalysts
are used to accelerate chemical reactions. Studying these reactions can be
crucially important to the petroleum and chemical industries. Infrared
spectroscopy has shown that the catalysts' microstructure is important in
determining the dynamic response of the catalyst to changes in operating
conditions. The theoretical models of catalytic surfaces have been developed by
Mr. Araya at Notre Dame in collaboration with Prof. Wolf. Now the experimental
work to verify them will be carried out by extending Mr. Araya's stay. This work
will be part of his Ph.D. thesis at the University of Chile and will form the
basis of beginning a research group in this area in Chile which will develop and
continue the collaboration between the two countries. In this way this support
will help fulfill the goals of the Science in Developing Countries program.
