Animals (including humans) require selenium to make the amino acid
selenocysteine, which is used in the synthesis of essential selenoproteins. In
contrast, plants do not require selenium or make specific selenoproteins.
Nonetheless, plants can accumulate selenium and play a vital role in providing
most of the dietary selenium consumed by humans. However, an excess of selenium
leads to toxicity in plants when selenocysteine is incorporated into proteins.
Selenoproteins in plants are likely misfolded, and are therefore removed by the
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The goal of this project is to understand the role
of the proteasome and glutathione in removing selenoproteins and alleviating
their toxicity in plants.

Broader Impacts. The project will directly allow the training of ten
undergraduate students, including students with disabilities, at Coastal
Carolina University. This project will also facilitate the development of an
upper-level laboratory-based class "Plant Adaptations to Stress" which will
integrate this research with teaching.
