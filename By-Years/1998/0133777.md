The gap between microprocessor and memory system cycle times has been
increasing over the past 15 years. In practice, because of the many levels in
the memory hierarchy and interconnection busses between the processor and DRAM,
a primary memory access may take 200 processor clock cycles from request to
response; more than 50% of this latency is due to the memory hierarchy and
interconnect. This research will focus upon the reduction of this fraction by
novel interconnect techniques and increased focus on the DRAM controller
management policies. As the amount of state present in DRAM devices increases,
the available set of memory controller policy decisions also increases; this
increased flexibility allows an intelligent memory controller to optimize
controller policies to achieve increased performance. This research will examine
the potential for improved performance when the memory controller changes from a
static control policy to a dynamic control scheme. This impact will be simulated
over a variety of interconnection topologies from the current NorthBridge to a
CMP architecture with multiple DRAM busses.
