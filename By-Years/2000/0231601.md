Designer Molecules for Biosensor Application

A two-day workshop to explore the feasibility of the state-of-the-art and
potential short-term and long-term technology that can be used to quickly detect
pathogenic microorganisms is being held at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. In
particular, merits of various technologies, based on genomic-expression (mRNA),
genome structure (DNA/RNA), protein structure an other physical and geometric
properties are compared. The multi-disciplinary collaborations of computer
scientists, biologist, engineering, and biochemist is expected to in order to
facilitate and advance in science of protein arrays for understanding cellular
processes, detectors for monitoring single cells, and monitoring of pathogenic
agents.
