The goal of this research program is to develop and refine an instrument for
the study of epitaxial magnetic thin films. Phase transition measurements will
be used to determine the critical exponents of the films. This group is working
to modify the physical properties of matter that affect the magnetic behavior of
materials through a study of the relation between atomic level structure and
magnetism. The instrument being developed will combine two complementary spin-
sensitive spectroscopic techniques (Kerr effect and spin-polarized secondary
electron emission) with MBE and thin film structure analysis capabilities (spot-
profile analysis LEED and electron forward scattering spectroscopy). Scanning
tunneling microscopy carried out on a separate system will be used to
characterize the substrates.
