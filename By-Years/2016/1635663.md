The objective of this project is to enable the improved design of human-machine
systems that use virtual and mixed-reality (i.e., "immersive") environments.
Immersive environments are used broadly, with applications from entertainment to
design. They provide a safe training environment for high-risk scenarios faced
by soldiers, pilots, and surgeons. They are also used to assess potentially
risky behaviors in human-machine systems (e.g., distracted driving) and
potential interventions (e.g., collision avoidance, surgical planning). As
immersion varies from purely virtual to purely real, the behavior of the human-
machine system changes, particularly when the designed artifact exposes humans
to risk. Design decisions focused on preventing human danger are made by using
risk-free virtual interactions. As a result, risk compensation and other effects
can confound the results of design assessments, training, and remote operator
performance. This effort will identify and model these effects, providing
guidance to engineers and designers working with immersive
technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work leverages advances in simulator
hardware and data rendering to deeply investigate behavioral changes due to
perceived risk within digitally-mediated man-machine systems. To isolate and
investigate these behavioral changes, three research objectives are identified.
First, determine the degree to which simulated and augmented reality
environments are comparable surrogates for predicting risk in live, in-use
behaviors. Second, identify the biases in risk perception between different
immersion modalities and boundaries where biases are so large that simulations
become deficient in evaluating risky behaviors. Third, quantify variance in risk
compensation behavior. Collectively, this effort will correlate the effects of
using digitally-augmented and/or virtual environments to behavioral changes,
with the goal of understanding how immersion changes decision making and
performance.
