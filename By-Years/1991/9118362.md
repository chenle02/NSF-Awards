This award is for support of a project to develop and test a three-dimensional,
time-dependent simulation of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). The model will
be used to test hypotheses for ice sheet behavior and to predict the future of
the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. The simulation will combine the high speed of
finite difference models and the high and variable resolution of finite element
models. The simulation will have the capability to dynamically follow features
of the ice sheet with the grid, which will provide a powerful tool for ice sheet
prediction.
