This award is to partially support a conference on AIDS epidemiology which will
be jointly sponsored by NSF, the Department of Health and Human Services, the
Center for Disease Control and the Department of Energy, and is in response to
President Reagan's request that an integrated scientific modeling effort be
undertaken. Scientists from the private sector, academia, national laboratories
and government agencies will be invited. The goal of the conference is to
develop a national plan for an intensive AIDS epidemiological study leading to
effective measures of interdiction.
