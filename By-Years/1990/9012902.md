This work studies non-monotonic logics and their application to common sense
reasoning about knowledge and belief. It addresses both theoretical and
algorithmic issues of non-monotonic modal logic. The results will increase
understanding of non- monotonicity and will be applicable to non-modal formalism
of non-monotic reasoning such as default logic, logic programming, and truth
maintenance systems.
