CISE Research Infrastructure: Infrastructure for Research in Collaboration
Systems This award is to support an established, on-going program of research in
distributed, collaborative, and multimedia systems. The infrastructure will
enable new basic research in system support for distributed collaboration.
Projects include: Multimedia Networking, Hypermedia Systems, Application-
Sharing, Collaborative Virtual Environments, and Interoperable Collaborative
Environments. In addition, researchers at the University of North Carolina will
also work with a group of forensic pathologist, located at the Armed Forces
Institute of Pathology to build a digital library of `pattern-injuries`
containing text, images, audio/video sequences, charts, diagrams, and numerical
data. This testbed will enable groups of forensic pathologist to consult a large
repository of case data as well as consult with one another, and jointly create
new cases using conferencing and collaboration tools.
