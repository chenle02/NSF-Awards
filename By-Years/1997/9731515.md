9731515 Knox This award to the University of California at San Diego will
provide instrumentation for oceanographic research on R/V Revelle, R.V Melville,
R/V New Horizon and R/V Sproul, the four (4) research vessels operated by
Scripps Institution of Oceanography as part of the University-National
Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. It also provides instrumentation
to the Scripps Oceanographic Data Facility, which will be used to support
oceanographic research on various US and foreign vessels, and archive those data
and maintain instrument calibration capabilities. Specific instruments to be
acquired include shipboard computers, disk drives for onshore archiving, tape
systems for data archiving, instrumentation for supporting dissolved oxygen
measurement, a synchronizer for seismic sources, a seismic sound source,
streamer sections for seismic reflection recording, a pinger for locating the
ocean bottom, slip rings, and calibration systems for pressure and temperature
sensors and for meteorological sensors. The shared-use instrumentation supported
here will assist marine scientists conduct studies from the SIO vessels, support
instrument calibraitons and archive data from throughout the world ocean in 1998
and in future years.
