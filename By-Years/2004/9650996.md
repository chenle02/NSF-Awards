This project, Applying Instrumental Analysis to a Computerized Process, seeks
to improve the instructional methodology by which analytical instruments are
taught. Students have been receiving training in the Chemical Technology program
with regard to performing analysis of a sample, but they also need the ability
to evaluate the analytical results in terms of what they indicate about a given
chemical process. The objectives of the project are to set up a complete
computerized process in glassware, providing a lab environment for teaching
instrumental analysis in which the student learns not only to operate the
analytical instruments but also to interpret the analytical results in the
context of a multistep process; enhance computer skills through a computerized,
controlled lab process, data collection, calculation, and analytical instrument
control; provide students with an overview of an entire multistep process on a
small scale, and of how these operations are linked together and how one
operation affects succeeding operations; provide students with a representative
sample of the analytical instruments used in the local chemical industry; and
provide the organic lab students with instruments with which to do product
analysis, giving them feedback on the purity of the products they are
synthesizing. This project also provides students with hands-on experience at
interpreting spectra. To accomplish these objectives, the department is using
Fourier-transform-infrared and ultra-violet spectrophotometers to provide a
representative sample of the instruments used in the chemical industry. Assembly
of a computerized, small-scale, glassware, multistep process is used to
illustrate the interrelation of processes and how the analysis is tied to a
particular operation. As a result of the project, other colleges may be able to
design a lab facility that better meets the need of the chemical industry.
Information on the project can be disseminated through journal articles,
conference presentations, and lab tours. The project is evaluated based on
enrollment and input from instructors, students, and industry.
