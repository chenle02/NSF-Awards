This award will support collaborative research between Drs. A.K. Pradhan and D.
Mihalas, Ohio State University, and two groups of British astronomers under the
direction of Dr. P.G. Burke, Queens University, Belfast and Dr. M. Seaton,
University College, London. The objective of the proposed research is to carry
out accurate large scale calculations of atomic data and stellar opacities. For
the last seven years a major international project has been underway to carry
out large scale atomic calculations with the final aim of calculating stellar
opacities of unprecedented precision. The opacity of stellar material plays a
fundamental role in the structure and evolution of stars, as it controls the
transport of radioactive energy in some regions of virtually all stars. The
stellar opacity is also intrinsically involved in the instabilities that give
rise to stellar pulsation, which are important in a number of respects in
current astronomical research. The aim of the proposed research project, which
is a joint collaboration between atomic physicists and astronomers in the
United- Kingdom, the U.S., the Federal Republic of Germany, France and
Venezuela, is to employ state-of-the-art atomic physics methods that are capable
of yielding the basic atomic parameters, such as oscillator strengths and
photoionization cross sections, to a high degree of accuracy in the range of
5-10%. The project is being led by Drs. M. Seaton and P.G. Burke. This award
will permit the participation of members of the U.S. team. The collaboration
will benefit from the extensive expertise of Dr. Mihalas in stellar atmosphere
theory and Dr. Pradhan in atomic physics.
