9216970 Samet Spatial Query Processing: A Sorting Approach This is the first
year funding of a three-year continuing award. An investigation is being
conducted into the efficient processing of spatial data as arising in problems
involving scientific data. Instead of using standard database methods which
represent spatial data as points in a higher dimensional space, and then storing
the coordinate values in a relation (equivalent to mapping the data into points
in a higher dimensional space), the data is organized by sorting it in such a
way that the space it occupies is taken into account. Particular attention is
focused on the spatial variant of the range query. Algorithms for such queries
are being developed in the context of spatial data corresponding to road
networks and topography both above ground and underwater (represented both as
contour lines and surfaces). Their performance is being evaluated by examining
factors such as buffer utilization, page sizes, page faults, data distribution,
etc. in environments where the data is spatially sorted and where it is not. The
evaluation is in terms of real data obtained by cooperating with the US Bureau
of the Census and the US Geological Survey. This information is being used to
pinpoint where the algorithms can be improved. Appropriate models for generating
the queries rather than the underlying database (which consists of real data)
are also being investigated. ***
