9628156 Kent This grant provides $41,125 as one-half support of the costs of
acquiring a direct-current (DC) SQuID upgrade for an existing 2G Model 760
superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM) as well as a new impulse magnetizer for
the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. The greater sensitivity afforded by the
DC-SQuID upgrade will allow this lab to measure previously unobtainable
paleomagnetic records from very weakly magnetized sediments and the impulse
magnetizer will allow the generation of very high magnetic fields (up to 5
Tesla) for use in rock magnetic research. This equipment will allow this
laboratory to continue and expand their cutting-edge paleomagnetic and rock
magnetic research. ***
