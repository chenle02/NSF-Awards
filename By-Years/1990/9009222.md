This research project outlines studies designed to evaluate developmental
expression of IGF-I and IGF-II and their receptors in the rat hippocampus. The
presence of the IGFs and their receptors in the fetal brain suggests a role for
these peptides in the development of the CNS. Careful correlation between the
morphological stages of rat hippocampal development and the time course of IGF
protein and receptor expression will provide insight into a potential role for
this system during development. These studies will provide the first available
information on developmental expression and localization of the IGFs and their
receptors in a defined brain area as well as defining changes in IGF expression
in response to a stimulus known to induce neural plasticity: limbic seizures.
