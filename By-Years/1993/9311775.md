9311775 Yuan Theoretical and experimental studies GaAs optoelectronic devices
BiCMOS circuits and HBT's will be undertaken. The optoelectronic device research
will study GaAs photoconductors and phototransistors, developing large-signal
and small-signal heterojunction phototransistor and photodiode models for
optelectronic circuit design. MEDICI will be used for obtaining physical insight
into photon and electron properties in GaAs materials, and the effect of
different light illumination on a number of device parameters will be
investigated both experimentally and theoretically. The study of BiCMOS research
will focus on effects of radiation and scaling on BiCMOS circuit performance.
BiCOMS test circuits will be exposed to gamma and neutron radiation and post-
irradiation performance will be characterized. A model to predict the onset of
the 'failure mode' of a BiCMOS inverter circuit will be developed. In the
heterojunction bipolar transistor research the theory of intermodulation based
on device transconductance. Early voltage heterojunction depletion capacitance,
and heterojunction diffusion capacitance will be studied. The phase noise of the
HBT oscillator will also be studied. Coupling effects of avalanche breakdown,
band discontinuity, negative collector current, and surface recombination on
phase noise will be investigated. Furthermore, the impact of supply voltage
scaling on the performance of communication circuits like the pager and the
transmitter will be examined. ***
