This project provides students with the opportunity to take advantage of
computer-aided instruction in chemistry. Equipment and software is available for
both; lab simulations and tutorial activities. Students are able to run
simulations of laboratory experiments which otherwise could not be provided
because of equipment and materials constraints. The students are exposed to new
concepts and methods. These lab simulations are used to augment currently
assigned coursework in Organic Chemistry, General Chemistry, and Introductory
Chemistry courses. Students conduct self-paced tutorial sessions to improve
understanding of fundamental concepts. This project allows Yuba College to
incorporate currently available technology into the program and better prepare
students to compete more effectively with students at other colleges and
universities. The institution is matching the grant with an equal amount of
funds.
