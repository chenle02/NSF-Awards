This program expands upon the "Chemistry in Motion" project. The plan is to
include biology and the life sciences and extend the training to include pre-
high school teachers and additional territories. The broad goal is to provide
training and support for about 120 chemistry teachers, 80 biology teachers and
40 middle/junior high school teachers among a network of 45 to 50 school
districts in two multi county regions of Pennsylvania. A series of 2-week summer
workshops will update knowledge content in biology or chemistry and give
teachers the pertinent theory and practical use of modern science
instrumentation. Teachers typically attend the summer workshops for a minimum of
3 years. As teachers become more capable the emphasis shifts to focus on
developing laboratory materials and exercises appropriate for use in school
classrooms and labs. The introduction of outcomes based education in
Pennsylvania will allow teachers more freedom to write their own curriculum.
Participating schools are visited by the science van bringing instruments to the
school 12-15 times per year. A certified biology/chemistry teacher drives the
van and acts as a resource for teachers. Additional follow up includes special 1
day seminars, an annual science fair and the development of an active network of
science teachers. Cost sharing amounts to 81%.
