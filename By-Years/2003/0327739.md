This study will focus on the physical phenomena that give rise to a signature in
the population of solar wind electrons commonly referred to as a "heat flux
dropout" (HFD). Understanding what causes HFDs is important because the degree
to which magnetic field lines are disconnected from the sun is a diagnostic tool
capable of distinguishing between competing models of how the sun's magnetic
field reverses over the course of the 22-year solar cycle. A program of data
analysis and theory will be performed. A survey of HFD data from the Wind
spacecraft will provide a base for statistical studies of HFD frequency and
morphology in the context of solar wind structures. A complementary
collaborative theoretical study will address the question of whether pitch-angle
isotropy in the HFDs is attributable to instabilities sensitive to the plasma
beta, independent of variations in the total flux.
