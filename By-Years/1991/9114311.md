A high resolution, time dependent, nonlinear, two- dimensional gravity wave
model will be used in a series of investigations to understand the dynamics of
gravity wave forcing, propagation, breakdown, and their role in modifying larger
scale motions in the atmospehre. These studies will use simulations of idealized
flow situations to clarify basic dynamical processes in parallel with more
realistic simulations to understand the magnitude and distribution of gravity
wave effects in the atmosphere. Our numerical studies will be guided by
estimates of mountain wave generation and propagation determined from NMC global
wind and temperature analyses and global topographic data. These investigations
will also involve use of observational data from the Flatland radar system as
well as NASA's aircraft experiments to verify model results. The ultimate
objectives of this project are to estimate the amount of gravity wave flux
escaping from the troposphere as a function of mean flow conditions and
topography and to develop parametrization schemes for gravity wave stress and
transport to be used in general circulation models. Results from this
investigation may also help to clarify the effect of small-scale (less than 100
km) variability on the transport and microphysics of aerosols and PSC's in the
stratosphere. A second objective of the proposed research will be to investigate
the dynamics of large amplitude atmospheric solitary waves with a series of
numerical experiments. The PI's experiments will be guided by both theoretical
analyses of solitary wave properties and by direct observations of atmospheric
solitary waves from the Flatland Radar. The PI's studies will be especially
concerned with examining the sensitivity of solitary wave structure of the
background atmospheric flow.
