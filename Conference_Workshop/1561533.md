A workshop on geometry of groups will be held at Universidad de la Republica in
Montevideo in April 2016. The workshop will bring together researchers from
Uruguay, Europe and the United States. The workshop will foster international
collaboration and aid in the dissemination of recent advances. The funding
provided will be focused on the support of U.S.-based early career
mathematicians who are in an especially strong position to benefit from exposure
to recent advances and a broader mathematical community.

This conference will bring together researchers from the emerging research group
in hyperbolic geometry, geometric group theory and Lie groups in Uruguay with
U.S.-based and European mathematicians in these fields. The workshop will
include three minicourses and 10-12 research talks which will focus on important
new results in these fields and the powerful interactions between these fields.
One aim of the workshop is to instigate collaborations between researchers from
these varied mathematical communities. Early career mathematicians will benefit
from the opportunity to participate in a school on Hyperbolic Groups and their
Representations, aimed at graduate students and those in postdoctoral positions,
which will be held the preceding week in Piriapolis, Uruguay.
