9304844 Henry The enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA), which catalyses the reversible
hydration/dehydration of CO2 has been known for many years to function in the
systemic transport and excretion of CO2. Recent work, however, has shown that
the limiting step in CO2 transport occurs at the cellular level (i.e., diffusion
across individual membranes). CA, localized on the "upstream" side of the
membrane, facilitates CO2 transport via the catalyzed dehydration of HCO3-,
maintaining a high PCO2 in the boundary layer and thus driving CO2 diffusion
across the membrane. Therefore, Ca within metabolically active tissue (i.e.,
muscle) is important for the initial step of CO2 transport form the
intracellular compartment to the blood. While this process has been studied in
mammalian systems, there is a complete void of information for evolutionarily
more primitive organisms. This is a major gap in our understanding of both the
evolution of CO2 transport and the evolution of CA function, because
metabolically active, contractile tissue (muscle) evolved long before the
development of complex respiratory systems. It is quite plausible, therefore,
for Ca to have had its evolutionary origins in metabolically active tissue for
the purpose of cellular CO2 elimination. This hypothesis will be tested in a
number of invertebrate species using a combination of biochemical,
physiological, pharmacological, and histochemical techniques. If widespread
support for this idea is found among the invertebrates, it will form the basis
for a potentially unifying hypothesis for the origin of cellular CA function and
the near universal distribution of the enzyme in metabolically active tissues.
These experiments will also form the database upon which future experiments on
even more primitive organisms will be designed and performed. ***
