In this project, scientists from the State University of New York at Albany, Old
Dominion University, and the University of Washington will participate in a
series of cruises with scientists from the National Institute of Oceanography in
Goa, India, to study nitrogen cycling in the water column of the Arabian Sea.
Because of a spatially extensive and seasonally changing suboxic zone, the
Arabian Sea is a region of major global significance for denitrification and
nitrous oxide formation. This American contribution to the joint Indian-American
effort would endeavor to (1) estimate the significance of the Arabian Sea in
global denitrification, (2) determine how the rate of Arabian Sea water column
denitrification varies spatially and temporally, (3) determine the relative
importance of nitrification and denitrification in producing high effluxes of
nitrous oxide from the Arabian Sea to the atmosphere.
