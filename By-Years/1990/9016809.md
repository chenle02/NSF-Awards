The matter of how energy dependent proteolysis regulates cellular response to,
and recovery from, stresses will be studied by examining the functions of
specific proteins in Bacillus subtilis. The "Lon" class of proteases will be
studied using both genetic and biochemical analyses of proteolytic activities
that are characterized by ATP-dependent stimulation. The regulatory aspects of
these proteases and the functions they regulate will be examined. The research
planned is aimed at understanding how energy dependent proteolysis functions in
a cell's response to, and recovery from environmentally imposed stresses.
Bacteria of the genus Bacillus are the focus of the experimental undertakings.//
