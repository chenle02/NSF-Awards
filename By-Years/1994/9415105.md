9415105 Ioannou This research presents the modeling language and overall
structure for an object-oriented simulation system for construction with a
dynamic decision-making inference engine. At the center of the system is a new
programming language for simulation modeling. This language will be able to
directly model uncertainty in any process variable and not just time (e.g.,
material quantities required, resources produced, distance traveled, equipment
productivity, cost, etc.) It will eliminate the need for data pre-processing and
the post-processing of simulation results before management decision can be
made. It will allow conditional (derived) distributions for the duration of
activities based on the current state of the system and the availability and
type of resources (resource-driven simulation). It will also allow modeling bulk
and characterizable resources with resource tracking. Resource consumption and
generation as well as the routing of resources (resource flow) will be able to
be modeled as stochastic processes. In order to model real-life decision making,
resource flow will also be able to be modeled dynamically based on the qtate of
the system by using a user-defined value-system.
