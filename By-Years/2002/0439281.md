This 16-month project focuses on exploring the use of Kegan's adult
developmental theory to explain the important differences teachers experience in
the same mathematics professional development. The only current measure of this
developmental difference, the Subject-Object Interview, is expensive and labor-
intensive to administer. This project will develop a written instrument and
methods that would provide a more economic and less labor-intensive measure of
adult developmental theory and would allow for future study of the impact of
developmental differences on teachers' experiences within and across
professional development programs.
