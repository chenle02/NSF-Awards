This project focuses on the reliability evaluation of building systems designed
according to the current U.S. specifications. Knowledge obtained from recent
analytical and laboratory investigation and from experience on building
performance in actual earthquakes will be the basis of this study. Special
attention is paid to quantification of the effect uncertainties encountered in
loads and system modeling. Performance and safety evaluation of low and medium-
rise buildings will be emphasized. The research will lead to development of
consistent reliability-based design methodology and to improved procedures for
damage controls under seismic or nonseismic loading conditions.
