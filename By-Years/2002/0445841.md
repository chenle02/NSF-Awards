Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project addresses the
biological functions of a unique domain within the cell nucleus - the nucleolus.
The nucleolus has long been known as the seat of ribosome biosynthesis. However,
a few years ago Dr. Pederson proposed in a semi-speculative essay (Pederson, T.
1998. The Plurifunctional Nucleolus. Nucleic Acids Research 26:3871-3876) that
the nucleolus has other functions as well. This idea was greeted receptively and
before long, increasing evidence began to be obtained as several groups turned
their attention to the concept of a plurifunctional
nucleolus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Pederson's work on this concept has centered
on the hypothesis that the nucleolus is a key station in the assembly of the
signal recognition particle (SRP). His laboratory has identified both the RNA
and certain protein components of the SRP in the nucleoli of cultured mammalian
cells, as well as in the amplified nucleoli of frog oocytes. However, whether
these components are actually in molecular contact with one another in the
nucleolus has not been established, and this is one of the major objectives of
the present project. Dr. Pederson has also speculated that the nucleolus may
serve as a center for the coordinated co-regulation of SRP and ribosome
synthesis (Pederson, T. and Politz, J.C. 2000. The Nucleolus and the Four
Ribonucleoproteins of Translation. J. Cell Biology 148:1091-1095.) This
hypothesis is also addressed in the present project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In
relation to the broader aspects of the field, it is to be borne in mind that
numerous other functions have been suggested for the nucleolus recently,
particularly relating to cell cycle progression. In addition, it has been
claimed that some translation occurs in the nucleus, including in the nucleolus.
The evidence for this is provocative but not definitive (Pederson, T. 2001. Is
the Nucleus in Need of Translation? Trends in Cell Biology 11:395-397), and
contradictory results have been obtained subsequently. However, neither of these
additional putative functions are addressed directly in this
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr.
Pederson is committed to the scientific education of both young students and the
public at large. The project will serve as a platform for summer research
training for undergraduate students drawn from a variety of colleges in the
Worcester area, including members of underrepresented groups. &lt;br/&gt;
