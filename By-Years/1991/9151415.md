A 200 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectrometer for carbon and hydrogen
nuclei will make possible improvement of instruction across the chemistry
curriculum. New instruction will occur in organic, analytical, and physical
chemistry laboratories, and the undergraduate research program will be enhanced.
Modern techniques for structure elucidation, analysis of complex mixtures, and
studies of dynamical processes in solid and liquid phases will be taught. The
grantee will match the NSF award from non-Federal sources.
