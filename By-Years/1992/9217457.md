9217457 Hughes The goal of this research program is to combine multi-user coding
and collision resolution to design multiple-access communicati on systems which
convey data efficiently, reliably, and with tolerable delay. Two general issues
are addressed. The first concerns the assignment of codes to a group of M
potential users which permit any subcollection of up to T of these users to
transmit reliably at the same time. This work will explore the limits imposed by
information theory as well as the design of new codes. The second part of this
research introduces a new multiple-access scheme called protocol division
multiple-access which combines aspects of mutiuser coding, collision resolution,
and code division multiple-access. Preliminary results suggest that, for a given
throughput, PDMA can significantly reduce message delay on channels with long
propagation delays (e.g. satellite links). ***
