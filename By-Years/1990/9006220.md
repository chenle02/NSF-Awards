This research involves the efficient and accurate numerical solution of inverse
problems by means of the construction of improved potential functions and the
application of wavelets. In an inverse problem one tries to reconstruct an
equation from information about its solutions, and this leads to difficult
problems in numerical linear algebra, since for a large system the
reconstruction must be done on a computer. It may seem strange but very often
one has solutions to a problem without knowing exactly what the problem is
itself. Think of the case where your doctor takes X-rays of you during an
examination in order to find out if anything is amiss. The data from the X-rays
are essentially like the solutions, whereas the problem in this case might be an
unknown malady. Your doctor tries to determine what particular condition
ıequation! is producing the data ısolutions!. In much the same spirit the
principal investigator will study numerical techniques for determining the
equations that are producing certain types of solutions.
