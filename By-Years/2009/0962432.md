The purpose of this research is to add to our knowledge about how social safety
sets should be designed. These always involve an important trade-off--we have to
balance the benefits gained from providing benefits to those individuals in
society who are unfortunate against the costs from discouraging people from
working because taxes are too high. The specific issue that this research
focuses on is how family size should enter into the equation.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;This is important because it will help us understand how key features
of the tax code should be constructed. Examples include setting the size of tax
deductions for children, the treatment of child care costs and the deductibility
of expenses for post secondary education. On top of this, new methodological
techniques will be developed that will improve our understanding of the way that
labor and capital income tax systems should be designed to manage this trade-off
between social risk sharing and economic
efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The research will involve
significant methodological improvements over existing methods for analyzing the
right amount of social insurance. Currently, these methods either restrict
themselves to static settings (so that dynamic variables such as savings,
education and family size cannot be included) or rely on assumptions that
society values future generations more highly that parents do themselves. While
both of these currently available methodologies are useful, they are also
limited because of their implicit strong assumptions. This research will provide
a useful additional tool to help understand these problems
better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The development of methods like
these are critical to our understanding of broader policy issues. For example:
Should government policies explicitly encourage savings above and beyond what
individuals would normally undertake on their own? And if so, what form should
these policies take? How is the answer to this question tempered by the need to
other succient incentives for individuals to work hard? Since private savings
decisions are intimately related to the design of Social Security and Medicare
systems, the development of these new techniques should also prove useful for
policy debates concerning those systems. In addition to this, the methods
developed should be useful for a variety of other, related, research programs in
economics, including, but not limited to the study of the family (i.e., wife,
husband and children) allocation of labor supply, home production and
consumption.
