0947684&lt;br/&gt;Monk&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is for partial support
of a workshop on water-related sustainability to be held on August 13, 2009, in
Cincinnati, Ohio as a part of the First International Congress on Sustainability
Science and Engineering. The funds will be used primarily to support the travel,
registration, and lodging of invited U.S speakers to participate in the water
workshop, and also for publication costs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop
will provide a forum on the science and technology required to sustainably
manage the nation's water resources. A cross-section of Federal, municipal,
academic, and water provider and user communities will convene to identify
challenges, knowledge gaps, and research needs as well as to discuss the most
effective means of translating research into sustainable water management.
