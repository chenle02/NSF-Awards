9320949 Mills The purpose of the Agile Manufacturing Research Institute (AMRI)
is to develop an understanding of agile manufacturing enterprise and system
performance based on quantitative data; to structure a program of research to
meet aerospace industry-defined needs; and to move emerging technology which has
a potential for impacting agile manufacturing into the next stage of functional
prototyping or proof-of-concept test beds. The AMRI will include the following
tasks: research team building for the specific industry, quantitative analysis,
advanced agile manufacturing projects, education, training, dissemination, and
documentation of agile manufacturing research results. Attaining agility in this
industry is seen as a key to US manufacturing leadership and global
competitiveness. This AMRI will help provide a solid knowledge base for this
transformation.
