9513412 Denis The goal of this research is to elucidate the mechanisms of
eucaryotic gene regulation. The system chosen for study is the transcriptional
activator ADR1 in its control of gene expression in the yeast Saccharomyes
cerevisiae. The ADR1 protein contains four transactivation domains (TADs) and at
least one inhibitory region (residues 227-229). The function of the TADs has
been found to be highly dependent on the ADA2 coactivator complex. Moreover,
ADA2 components interact specifically with individual ADR1 TADS, suggesting the
ADA2 complex is a coactivator for ADRl. In addition, the 227-239 region of ADRl
has been implicated in binding a repressor protein that inhibits ADR1 function
independent of the promoter context. The central focus of this grant is to
determine hmw the ADR1 activation and inhibitory domains interact with
coactivators and repressors in bringing about the control of ADR1 function. The
physical association of the ADA2 complex with ADRl will be explored
biochemically, and the regions of the TADs required for binding this coactivator
complex will be identified. The regions and residues of the ADRl TADs required
for transactivation will be determined and correlated to those regions required
for binding to the ADA2 complex. Using several complementary approaches, the
putative repressor that binds the ADR1 inhibitory region will be cloned and
characterized. These studies will help elucidate the complex interplay of a
number of factors that can be involved in the control and action of
transcriptional activators. %%% The focus of this project is a protein
activator, ADRl, which stimulates the gene expression of certain proteins in the
yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. ADRl binds to the DNA next to genes that produce
enzymes that allow yeast to metabolize certain compounds when they are growing
in air. The investigator has shown that ADR1 stimulates the production of RNA
messages that produce the enzymes. ADR1 is a large protein containing four
unique amino aci d segments that are required for the activation activity. His
laboratory has found these segments must bind to certain other proteins to
produce activation of gene expression. These other protein "coactivators" are a
complex consisting of three proteins, ADA2/ADA3/GCN5. Proteins ADA2 and GCN5
specifically touch the sequences mentioned above. Another segment of ADR1 binds
another protein that inhibits ADR1 activity. The investigator will characterize
the contact areas between ADR1 and other proteins that are involved in
regulating gene expression by ADR1. ***
