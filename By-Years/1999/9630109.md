Abstract This award supports a collaborative program to enhance education in
nondestructive evaluation/nondestructive testing (NDE/NDT) that builds upon
prior work by the Center for Nondestructive Evaluation, College of Engineering,
Department of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics at Iowa State
University and selected community and technical colleges. Students and
instructors in two year NDT/NDE programs at Cowley County Community College
(Kansas), Hutchinson Technical College (Minnesota), Moraine Valley Community
College (Illinois), Northeast Iowa Community College, and Southeast Community
College (Nebraska) will be eligible for competitive selection into structured
summer and transfer programs at Iowa State University. Two primary thrusts of
this program are: 1) Enhance and encourage transfer of two year NDE/NDT program
students to Iowa State University engineering programs. 2) Provide professional
development opportunities for community/technical college NDE/NDT instructors
that are aimed at upgrading technical and educational skills of the instructors
and improving articulation from the two year NDE/NDT programs to undergraduate
engineering programs at ISU and elsewhere.
