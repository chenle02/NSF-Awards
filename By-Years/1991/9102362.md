This award will support a U.S.-Mexico workshop on materials science and
engineering to be held in Ixtapa, Mexico during September 24-27, 1991. The
workshop, organized by Professors Juan Sanchez and John Tien of the University
of Texas, Austin for the U.S side and Professor Jose L. Moran-Lopez of the
Universidad Autonoma de San Luis de Potosi for the Mexican side, will serve to
foster direct interactions between U.S. and Mexican scientists, engineers and
research administrators; will explore areas of common interest in materials
science and engineering; and will produce a materials treatise that is expected
to offer important guidelines for the development of advanced materials
research. The three day meeting will consist of five technical sessions and one
half-day panel discussion. Participation by university and industry-based
scientists and engineers, as well as from the government, will ensure that the
meeting will be of wide scope, covering pivotal topics in materials, their
science, their properties, and their processing and uses.
