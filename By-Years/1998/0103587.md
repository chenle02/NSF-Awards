This multi-disciplinary proposal will unite researchers from physics, chemistry,
and biology to work synergistically on a coherent project that involves one
basic concept, the development and synthesis of novel materials from self-
assembled magnetic nanostructures whose configuration and/or functions can be
tuned and controlled by external fields. We will demonstrate that, by
understanding physical mechanism of self-assembly and field-controlled phenomena
and by bringing together two frontiers of the new century---the nanoscale
science and the field of soft matter, we will be able to develop functional
materials that enable new technologies ranging from memory devices, drug
delivery agents, field-controllable nanomachines, magnetically actuatable
polymers, and many other liquid, gel, or solid devices.&lt;br/&gt;We propose to
perform experimental and theoretical research to study the conditions for self-
assembly phenomena in surfactant-stabilized magnetic fluids. Experimental
observations using scattering techniques such as neutron and light scattering,
imaging (Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)/Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM)), and
thermodynamic measurements (e.g. heat capacity) will be supported and evaluated
by using computer simulations. We propose to use realistic quaternion molecular
dynamics simulations in viscous media to study the dynamics of isomer
transitions under varying conditions and to present a correct interpretation of
the experimental results. Based on the configuration of self-assembled
structures in zero field and its response to external fields, novel structures
can be synthesized that have important applications.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
research will provide the basis for the design of new, smart materials and
externally controlled systems that can respond to an external environment
through the unique combination of theory, computer simulations, and experimental
investigations. This work will have an important impact in applied physics,
chemistry, material sciences, biology and medicine, and device industries. Our
approach aims to facilitate the education of tomorrow's scientists in
nanoscience and technology through the involvement of students in every aspect
of proposed research.&lt;br/&gt;
