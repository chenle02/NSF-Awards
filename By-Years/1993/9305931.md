9305931 Real This research project investigates the biological basis of
decision-making. All people and other animals are faced with having to make
choices about alternative actions where the outcomes of their choices are not
certain. The dominant model for human decision-making under uncertainty has
recently been extended to include aspects of human information-processing and
cognition. People often misperceive the probabilities associated with
alternative outcomes and, therefore, appear to act "irrationally" in certain
choice situations. Dr. Real is exploring the biological basis and ecological
implications of animal information-processing under uncertain choices and
gambles. He will carry out experiments to determine if animals are similar to
people in their perceptions of probabilities, and to determine if the patterns
of information-processing that generate misperception can be explained as a
result of the evolution of organisms for efficient use of resources.
