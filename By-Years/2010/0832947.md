New Mexico State University Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation
(NM-LSAMP) Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Program is a collaborative effort
between the National Science Foundation and New Mexico higher education
institutions to increase the quality and quantity of underrepresented minorities
matriculating to completion of the doctoral degree in science, technology,
engineering and mathematics fields (STEM) fields. The 2008-2010 program, the
first at the University of New Mexico, prepares students to meet the challenges
of completing master's and doctoral programs of study preferably for academic
careers in higher education. In addition, the program develops leadership skills
necessary for success in the STEM workforce nationally and
internationally.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Integrating research and education, the
BD fellows will be nurtured over two years as a cohorted community that will
benefit from a program of academic and personal development activities as well
as social support to sustain their commitment and success to the terminal Ph.D.
STEM degree. Program activities include linkages to the University of New Mexico
Integrated Graduate Education in Research and Training (IGERT) as well as other
NSF-funded research and education projects, including programs that provide
mentoring opportunities for undergraduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A
total of 12 students from underrepresented minority populations in STEM fields
will participate in the program at the University of New Mexico during the
2009-2010 academic years. Results from this support will broaden the
participation of Hispanics and Native Americans in the STEM pipeline, U. S.
workforce and abroad. Results from rigorous evaluation of the project will add
to the body of literature in successful recruitment and retention of
underrepresented minority students in STEM fields. &lt;br/&gt;
