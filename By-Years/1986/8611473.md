Plasma-enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) techniques are used to deposit
thin films as passivation coatings and for electronic and optical device
structures. The PI proposes a fundamental study of correlating deposition
parameters with morphology, structure, and adhesion of the films to the
substrate. Si3N4 will be used as substrate in view of its wide application base.
The PI is a competent researcher and the proposed study has potential for
advancing the fundamental knowledge and the technology base. This project will
be jointly funded by the Thermodynamics and Transport Phenomena Program and the
Materials Engineering and Processing Program.
