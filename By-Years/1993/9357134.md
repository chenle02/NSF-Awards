9357134 Ellman The focus of this research is the simultaneous and combinatorial
synthesis of 1,4-benzodiazepines, prostaglandins and beta-turn mimics using
solid-phase synthetic methodology. The resulting compounds will then be screened
against specific receptors or enzymes to gain insight into structure versus
recognition. The speed of the technique could revolutionize the ease of carrying
out such analyses. %%% With this NSF Young Investigator award, the Synthetic
Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Jonathan A. Ellman of the
Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley. Dr. Ellman
will focus his work on the simultaneous and combinatorial synthesis of libraries
of important classes of nonpolymeric organic compounds on solid support. The
compounds will then be screened against specific receptors or enzymes to obtain
structure versus recognition information. ***
