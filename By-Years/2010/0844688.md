Professor Daniel T. Chiu of the University of Washington is supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to study
chemical reactions in femtoliter-volume droplets. Surfactants with varying
concentrations, immiscible oils, and interior solute ionic strength will be
varied and tested to determine their exact effects on droplets. The experimental
information obtained will be used to synthesize a model to allow prediction of
droplet confined chemical reactions, and how they are affected by the choice of
surfactant and immiscible oil as well as the concentration and ionic strength of
the solutes contained within the droplet. While droplet microfluidics are
beginning to find broad use in diverse areas, such as biological assays, protein
crystallization, DNA sequencing, and chemical synthesis, the fundamentals of
chemistry in droplets, in particular, how the high surface-to-volume ratio
environment affects the chemistry, is still relatively unexplored. Students will
be trained in interfacial chemistry as well as microfluidics and cutting-edge
optical techniques for manipulating and analyzing the contents of droplets. The
predictive model and associated software will be made available on the PI's
laboratory website.
