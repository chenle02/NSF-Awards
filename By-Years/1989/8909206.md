This research involves the application of heuristic search techniques including
neural nets, genetic algorithms and TABU search to the quadratic assignment
problem. The goal is to design an intelligent system, using AI tools, to select
a search method as a function of problem structure and problem data. This
research area has potential for enormous pay off. Interfacing AI techniques with
nonlinear integer programming is in its infancy and should be fully explored.
