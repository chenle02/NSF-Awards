Through integration of advanced gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-
MS) detection across the chemistry curriculum and into the biology and
geoscience curriculum, student understanding of complex environmental issues is
being expanded. A spiraled approach starting in General Chemistry and continuing
with guided-inquiry, project-based laboratory experiences throughout the
curriculum is developing student expertise using this powerful hyphenated
technology toward solving important issues. The topics and the experiments are
being adapted and implemented from the chemical and research literature and
include multiple uses for the GC-MS. The GC-MS is also being used across
discipline lines (ecology and geoscience) to strengthen existing collaborations
and to encourage additional ones and to illustrate the interdisciplinary nature
of scientific inquiry.
