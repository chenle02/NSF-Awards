The Wildlands Project is producing a four-hour television series for PBS and the
CBC. The television series, "The Sacred Balance," will feature geneticist and
environmental scientist David Suzuki as he examines a new vision of the human
place in nature. The series aims to enrich and expand the scientific world view
by looking at traditional knowledge, myth, literature and art, and by
incorporating aspects of human spirituality into the insights presented by
science. The aim of the project is to show that the world-view human beings have
celebrated since ancient times is reemerging, transformed, from the laboratories
of modern science. Moving away from reductionist techniques, researchers from
many different disciplines are studying diversity, whole organisms, systems and
relationships that begin in the individual cell and extend to the entire planet.
The television series is designed to change the way the public acts in the world
by demonstrating that what we do to the Earth we do to ourselves.

Dr. Suzuki will work closely with an advisory committee in shaping the series.
The members of this committee include:

Lane Lubchenco: Professor of Marine Biology and Zoology, Oregon State University
David Schindler: Environmental Ecologist, Department of Biological Sciences,
University of Alberta E. O. Wilson: Biologist, Harvard University Sylvia Earl:
Marine Ecologist and "Explorer in Residence" at the National Geographic Society,
Washington, DC James Parks Morton: Former Dean, Cathedral of St. John the
Divine, currently at the Interfaith Center of New York

The television series will be supplemented by a new, interactive Sacred Balance
website and a teachers guide. Ancillary material also will include Dr. Suzuki's
trade book, "The Sacred Balance."
