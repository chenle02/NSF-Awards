Confident but mistaken eyewitness testimony is one of the leading causes of
wrongful convictions. Recent published research by the investigator suggests
that older adults are particularly prone to make high confidence memory errors
in a variety of tasks, including tests of eyewitness memory. This project
investigates this age-related increase in high-confidence errors with two series
of studies. The first series focuses on suggestibility errors, that is,
instances in which persons assert that they have actually encountered an event
that has only been suggested to them. These studies examine: 1) the generality
of the age-related increase in suggestibility errors in a more ecologically-
valid paradigm; 2) whether older adults can resist making high confidence
suggestibility errors when the source of the suggested information has been
discredited; and 3) whether distractibility at encoding is a mechanism that
contributes to making errors with high confidence. The second series of studies
focuses on memory for faces, as assessed with a lineup identification test. This
series examines: 1) the hypothesis that older adults are prone to make high
confidence false lineup identifications; and 2) whether the vulnerability to
making high confidence errors persists regardless of the strength of older
adults' memory for the target face (i.e., it is not a consequence of older
adults' poor memory). The need for this research is particularly important given
that (1) older adults will comprise an increasing proportion of the US
population: from 12% of the population in 2000 to an estimated 20% in 2030; and
(2) despite the aging of society and the large amount of research on eyewitness
memory, relatively little research has investigated the eyewitness memory of
older adults.
