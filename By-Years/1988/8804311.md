The Los Angeles area's Hispanic population was the largest group directly
affected by the Whittier earthquake which struck on October 1, 1987. This
project is designed to provide information to disaster assistance organizations
and agencies on how best to serve this diverse population before and after
future earthquakes. Attention will be given to earthquake preparedness as it
concerns ethnic populations as well as their need for emergency and recovery
assistance.
