This project continues on ongoing study of the design and analysis of
sequential, parallel, and distributed algorithms. The research will include both
attempts to develop new general tools and techniques as well as solutions of
specific problems in five areas: algorithms on strings, dynamic programming,
problems on dynamic graphs, competitive analysis of algorithms, and problems in
cryptography.
