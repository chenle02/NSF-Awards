Abstract for Minority postdoctoral fellowships This action funds an NSF Minority
Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for 1995. This program of fellowships is a
joint activity of the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate
for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences of the National Science Fundation.
Two-year fellowships are offered each year in a effort to increase the number of
research scientists from underrepresented minority groups, i.e., Native
Americans (including American Indians and Alaskan Natives), Blacks, Hispanics,
and Native Pacific Islanders, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the
Nation's research enterprise. The goal of the program is to prepare minority
scientists for positions of scientific leadership in academia and industry. The
fellowships are designed to permit Fellows to choose the research and training
environment most beneficial to their scientific development. The research and
training plan supported by this fellowship is entitled: Cell Cycle Dependent
Expression of the Catalytic Submit (M2) of Ribonucleotide Reductase.
