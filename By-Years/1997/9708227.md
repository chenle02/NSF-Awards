ABSTRACT CTS-9708227, Seton Hall University Prof. Augustine is being funded by
the Chemical Reactions Program (Kinetics and Catalysis) to continue his prior
work on enantioselective heterogeneous catalysis (NSF grant 9312533) in two
directions: develop more general chiral modifiers for supported metal catalysts,
and support chiral homogeneous complex catalysts. The modifier to be developed
is based on amine derivatives of naphthyl binaphtol acetal, and so provide
binding groups and molecular orientation to favor enantiomeric resolution for
the hydrogenation of alpha-methyl butenoic acid. For the second part of the
project, phosphotungstic heteropolyacid anions will be loaded on a modified
support (clay), or included during sol-gel synthesis of another oxide. Support
modifiers will be vanadyl alkoxide, titanium tetraethoxide or aluminum
isopropoxide. The oxide-heteropolyacid combination will be used as support for a
chiral metal complex such as RhDIPAMP. Preparative variables will be studied in
detail. The hydrogenation of prochiral acrylates will be used as test reaction
for activity and enantioselectivity. The expectation is that the electronic
effects introduced by heteropolyacids can be used to fine-tune the activity and
selectivity of the chiral modifier. Spectroscopy (UV, VIS, IR, XPS, 31P, 13C,
and 1H MAS NMR) will be used for catalysts characterization. The research will
have major significance in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries.
