This is an award resulting from a submission in response to Program
Announcement NSF 88-28, Research Experience for Undergraduates. Under this award
Clemson University will provide ten undergraduate students with training and
support while they participate in ongoing research projects in the University's
Computer Science Department. The award recognizes the importance of hands-on
experience in active research for training undergraduates for careers in
mathematics, science and engineering, and that too few such experiences are now
available. The University recruited most of the students from other
institutions, in order to broaden the base for attracting students to scientific
careers.
