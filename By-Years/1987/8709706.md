The general problem addressed in this research is the irreversible brain damage
resulting from short exposures to anoxia/ischemia. The problem will be studied
in a model system, the rate hippocampal slice preparation. Irreversible damage
in this system is the permanent blockage of synaptic transmission following 10
minutes oxygen deprivation. The research will address two basic questions about
the mechanism of this permanent damage: 1) Is increased cytosolic calcium during
anoxia, a major initiator of the damage? and 2) How does glutamate or aspartate
release during anoxia contribute to causing the damage? With regard to the last
question, the work is designed to test the hypothesis that this amino-acid
toxicity during anoxia occurs because of binding to NMA receptors and the
subsequent release of calcium from intracellular organelles, probably mediated
by increased production of inositol-3-phosphate. The studies address the two
questions, and the hypothesis, largely by estimation of changes in cytosolic
calcium, made by measurements to tissue regions which are damaged and by
correlating damage with changes in calcium and with changes in IP3 in different
conditions. Significant advances should be made towards dealing with these two
very important issues.
