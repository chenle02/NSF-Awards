*** 96-61185 Kowbel This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will investigate a low cost process to produce silicon carbide/silicon
carbide (SiC-SiC) composites. These composites exhibit excellent mechanical,
thermal, and corrosion properties. Their applications in aerospace and energy-
related areas are greatly hindered by high manufacturing costs, lack of
oxidation stable interfaces, and selectively poor creep resistance of the SiC
fibers. Phase I will study a unique way to produce pure beta-SiC/beta-SiC
composites via a direct chemical vapor reaction (CVR) of low-cost carbon-carbon
(C-C) composites. CVR-derived fibers are expected to exhibit excellent creep
resistance, while an in-situ generated porous SiC interface is expected to
provide good fiber pull-out and good environmental stability. Lowering the cost
of SiC-SiC composites not only will expand applications in aerospace industries,
but also provide opportunities in civilian industries such as automotive,
burners, combusters, process equipment, heat recovery equipment, and
separation/filtration. ***
