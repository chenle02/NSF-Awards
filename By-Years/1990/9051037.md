This award provides funds to the Psychology Department at SUNY, Stony Brook to
help purchase equipment to develop a computer- laboratory classroom in which
students will perform statistical simulations and run experiments that can help
develop conceptual understanding of the lawfulness underlying random phenomena.
Experiments performed on the computers will provide concrete experiences
illustrating probabilistic and statistical principles which, with traditional
modes of instruction, are often only poorly understood by students lacking
mathematical sophistication. The grantee is matching this award with non-Federal
sources.
