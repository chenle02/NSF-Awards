This award provides 73% of the costs of an instrument development project to
design and build a high-pressure experimental system capable of exerting
simultaneous conditions up to 20 GPa and 1600K on cubic centimeter sized samples
and measuring their physical properties such as electrical conductivity,
viscosity, and density. The University is committed to providing the remaining
funds necessary for this project. The high-pressure system will be developed and
installed in the Department of Geology at Arizona State University and will be
used in research investigating the geophysical properties of the Earth's mantle.
