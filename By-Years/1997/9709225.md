This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
(CRIF) and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) will help the
Department of Chemistry at Indiana Ubniversity upgrade their Molecular structure
Center by aquiring a CCD and CID systems. The equipment will enhance research in
a number of areas including the following: (1) bioinorganic chemistry of Mn4
clusters, (2) transition metal cluster chemistry, and (3) unusual unsaturation,
and consequent binding of very weak ligands. The X-ray diffractometer is used to
make accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure
of a molecule. The information obtained gives the precise values of all the bond
distances and bond angles of a given molecule and it gives accurate information
about the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring
molecules.
