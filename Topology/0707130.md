Danny Calegari will study the relationship between geometry, group theory and
dynamics in a number of contexts where the common theme will be the use of
homological tools. Low dimensional topological spaces can be very effectively
probed by maps of surfaces. The linearization of this study leads to homology
and its variants (rational homotopy, algebraic K-theory, etc.); the interaction
with geometry leads to further refinements (bounded cohomology, quasimorphisms)
which are at the heart of phenomena such as universal circles, Thurston norm,
the 11/8 conjecture, etc. The interaction of bounded cohomology with number
theory leads to new and largely unstudied phenomena, with connections to fixed
point problems in dynamics, and topological problems like the simple loop
conjecture. By exploring these phenomena in terms of a single underlying
abstract tool (namely stable commutator length) Calegari intends to develop
machinery with which to explain their unity, and to settle several open
conjectures. The main objects of study are spectral gaps and rationality of
stable commutator length in word-hyperbolic (and CAT(0)) groups, and central
limit theorems for quasimorphisms on arbitrary groups.

Topology is the qualitative study of geometry. After centuries of work, and
some spectacular progress in recent years (especially Perelman's proof of the
Poincare Conjecture, and Brock-Canary-Minsky's proof of the ending lamination
conjecture) some very fundamental questions are still very mysterious. If you
pull a loop of string tight on a surface, how will it cross itself? What is the
most efficient (abstract) way to encode a data structure in a computer program?
How do vortices in fluids or strands of DNA in a cell become knotted, and how
does this knottiness affect their structural stability? Sometimes the best
"metrics" are qualitative; this project studies such qualitative metrics of size
and efficiency in the simplest possible topological contexts, since the results
we obtain will be universal in their applicability to other, more complicated
contexts.
