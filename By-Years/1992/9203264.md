The proposed research is to support numerical simulations and theoretical
modelling of the low latitude thermosphere and ionosphere as part of the
proposed MISETA initiative. MISETA (Multi-Instrument Studies of Equatorial
Thermosphere Aeronomy) seeks to carry out measurements at Jicamarca and
Arequipa, Peru, by coherent and incoherent scatter radar, digisonde, spaced
scintillation reciever, Fabry Perot interferometer and all-sky imager. These
instruments will provide data on the neutral and inoized atmosphere including
measurements of vertical and zonal drifts, electron densities, ion, electron,
and neutral temperatures, zonal and mericonal neutral winds, and spread_F and
electrojet observations. Emphasis is on the coupled thermosphere- ionosphere
dynamics; topics to be explored include the role of atmosphereic gravity waves
in seeing spread-F phenomena, the importance of latitudinal gradients in the
zonal neutral wind and interhemispheric transport for equatorial
electrodynamics, the significance of the midnight pressure bulge in
understanding the onset of spread-F and its dependence upon season, and
geomagnetic storm effects at low latitudes. This particular proposal seeks
funding to allow participation of a graduate student at Dartmouth College in the
MISETA initiative. The student would participate in numerical simulations of the
MISETA data sets and theoretical studies with the NCAR thermosphere-ionosphere
general circulation model (TIGCM) and the thermosphere-ionosphere-
electrodynamics general circulation model (TIEGCM).
