In this proposal, the PI plans to study various problems at the intersection of
low dimensional topology and low dimensional dynamics on the one hand, and
symplectic geometry and topology on the other hand. The purpose is to improve
our understanding of certain objects, which appeared recently in the symplectic
world (such as Hofer's metric) and to apply them to attack some old problems of
geometrical and dynamical nature. Specific directions include the study of
actions of higher rank lattices on surfaces, following Zimmer's program, of the
simplicity of certain groups of transformations, and the existence of quasi-
morphisms.



The last twenty-five years have witnessed the birth of a remarkable
mathematical field, namely symplectic topology. This field is connected to many
areas of pure mathematics and modern physics. Some historical developments are
associated to the name of Gromov, who introduced the concept of pseudo-
holomorphic curve, as well as to the name of Hofer who introduced a remarkable
new metric invariant in the classical field of Hamiltonian dynamics. In this
project the PI plans to use these new objects and techniques, which are now
already unavoidable, to establish new connections with other areas of pure
mathematics such as geometric group theory.
