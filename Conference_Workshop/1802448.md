This award supports participation in a series of summer schools in computational
number theory. The upcoming summer school, to be held at the University of North
Carolina - Greensboro, summer 2019 we be on the topic of Buildings. The aim of
the one-week summer school is to complement the traditional training that
graduate students receive by exposing them to a constructive and computational
approach to many objects in number theory. This furthers their knowledge and
gives the students additional tools for their research. Furthermore, the school
provides the students the opportunity to work closely with experts in the field.

The Bruhat-Tits building associated to a p-adic reductive group is a simplicial
analogue of the classical symmetric space associated to a semi-simple Lie group.
The study of these buildings has been an important tool in understanding p-adic
groups as well as arithmetic lattices. Buildings have enjoyed playing key roles
in several areas, including number theory, geometry, algebra, and combinatorics.
The summer school is valuable to students for their careers as researchers and
in their post-doctoral lives, since the event helps to create research
communities. By meeting and working with other graduate students in their field,
the students lay the foundation for future collaboration. In the years after the
summer school, they will have opportunities to meet again at one of the regional
conferences, including the Palmetto Number Theory Series and the South Eastern
Meeting on Numbers. Additionally, by introducing the students to a computational
approach to number theory, this project will enhance the next generation of
mathematicians by increasing their ability to use computing technology in their
research.
