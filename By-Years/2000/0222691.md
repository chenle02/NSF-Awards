The overall objective of this project is to develop an integrated quantitative
framework, consistent with existing mechanistic knowledge and well-designed in-
house experiments, for the study and eventual enhancement of the Escherichia
coli oxygen and redox sensing/regulatory system. Experimental data will be
obtained from the literature and the investigators' laboratories. The specific
goals are: (1) to construct an experimentally verifiable model of the genetic
network of the oxygen and redox sensing/regulatory system; (2) to develop a
scheme for distilling maps of metabolic pathways from the network models
achieved in (1); (3) to generate metabolic patterns based on the predicted
metabolic pathway maps using standard metabolic flux analysis techniques; (4) to
construct mutant strains to be used in bioreactor experiments to support the
modeling effort; and (5) to perform bioreactor experiments to generate
quantitative data to be used to refine and validate the network and pathway
models.
