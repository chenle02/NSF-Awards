Structure Theory Abstract

This conference is intended to foster the mathematical issues that are
important to present day graph theory, along the lines pioneered by Prof. W. T.
Tutte and continued by G. Neil Robertson and his coworkers. As such, fundamental
topics in graph theory like connectivity, surface and spatial embeddings, well-
quasi-ordering, chromatic theory, infinite excluded minors, and directed graphs
find common links through their structural features. Moreover, within the
conference framework the organizers intend to include close subjects such as
matroid theory and ties through polynomial-time graph algorithms to
combinatorial optimization and computational complexity.

Large-scale practical computational problems such as job scheduling,
transportation networks, and data encryption for the purpose of secured secret
communication can often be formulated as problems in the branch of mathematics
called graph theory. Graph coloring problems are of particular practical
interest. The structure theory of graphs developed by Robertson and Seymour has
solved important problems with practical applications in these areas. This
conference will bring together experts to foster interaction and advances in
research of problems of graph theory and a related theory called matroid theory
