The Marquette University Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering has a
REU Site program involving eight students. The students have a research
experience working on one or more research projects which involve the
examination/modification/improvement of existing algorithms and the
development/implementation of new algorithms for speech feature extraction in
noise, antenna design and scattering analysis, solid state system modeling,
power device and system design, and neural network modeling. The research
experience includes individual instruction in necessary background information,
participation in regular seminars of their active research groups, familiarity
with the research literature in their areas, oral communication of their
research results in appropriate seminars, and a final written research report.
The goal of the Program is to start the participants on the path to become
independent researchers and to motivate them to pursue graduate studies.
