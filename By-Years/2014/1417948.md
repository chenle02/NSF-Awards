Data facilities provide a key resource in the pursuit of innovative scientific
research by&lt;br/&gt;aggregating, preserving, and disseminating large
quantities of data sets, including highly&lt;br/&gt;complex petabyte scale data
to more simple metadata catalogs. The proposed workshop provides&lt;br/&gt;a
forum for leaders from these facilities, regardless of scale, type or format of
data, to&lt;br/&gt;gather and discuss commonalities and collaborative solutions
to the increasing challenges&lt;br/&gt;associated with providing data access for
researchers. In addition, this workshop will act&lt;br/&gt;as a key end-user
Assembly Group during the EarthCube Test Enterprise Governance process
to&lt;br/&gt;identify decision making processes and governance models that are
most applicable to the geoscience&lt;br/&gt;data
facilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A steering committee of experts from across the
Geosciences, including Atmosphere, Oceans,&lt;br/&gt;and Earth Sciences will act
to identify key participants and create a quality agenda.
Social&lt;br/&gt;scientists will be utilized to ensure developmental evaluation
and learning loops are incorporated&lt;br/&gt;into the agenda; this includes the
construction of key scenarios and exercises for discussion&lt;br/&gt;and
breakout groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results of the meeting will include a set
of common and unique requirements and challenges&lt;br/&gt;associated with the
communication, collaboration, interoperability, and governance
structures&lt;br/&gt;required to ensure that the capabilities and opportunities
of existing and emerging NSF/GEO&lt;br/&gt;facilities are incorporated into the
EarthCube concept.
