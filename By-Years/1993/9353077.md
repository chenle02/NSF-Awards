9353077 Butts Using systemic reform in mathematics and science education as the
catalyst, the Atlanta Public Schools propose to initiate a self- study planning
process that will examine all aspects of its public school education system. The
effort will build upon the strong partnerships that currently exist between the
school system, local businesses, service organizations, institutions of higher
learning and the Mayor's Office. The focus of the self study will be to identify
structural changes needed to significantly improve the delivery of mathematics
and science instruction to all Atlanta Public School students. The study will
identify steps that need to be taken to effect comprehensive and coordinated
improvement in student achievement. Six task forces, comprised of
representatives from key stakeholder groups, will gather data for the self
study. This data will serve as the basis for developing a five to seven year
plan for revamping the system's overall instructional program to produce not
only improved mathematics and science achievement, but to better integrate
instruction among all core disciplines. Critical information will be used to
initiate comprehensive change in the Atlanta Public School System's overall
instructional program. ***
