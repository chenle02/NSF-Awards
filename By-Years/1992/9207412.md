The American Academy of Underwater Sciences is a self regulating organization
of active diving scientists. The organization provides consensual, operational
and management guidelines for the implementation and conduct of scientific
diving operations. The Academy's objective is to promote safe diving procedures
for scientific divers using state-of-the-art technology and techniques. The AAUS
will provide the UNOLS vessel operators with the technical infra-structure and
expertise to assist the scientific diving community in the review of diving
procedures, provide guidelines for establishing diving safety regulations,
provide expertise on diving accidents, state-of-the-art technology and forums on
new techniques.
