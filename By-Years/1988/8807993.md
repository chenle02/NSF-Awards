Dr. Chen will study the forcing of stationary waves in both Northern and
Southern hemispheres using a steady state model. The model employs a lower
boundary condition (LBC) which incorporates what is probably the most important
nonlinear effect, namely, allowing flow to go around as well as over the
orography. The specific objectives are: 1. to further explore the dynamics and
the responses of the planetary waves by the more complete LBC (wave.coupled LBC)
in the linear model used by Chen and Trenberth (1988a,b) and the issue of flow
going "around" or "over" a mountain from both theoretical and computational
point of views; 2. to elaborate on the interpretation of the wintertime Northern
Hemisphere (NH) subtropical jet streams by momentum budget studies and the
theory relating the "rotational and divergent geopotentials and planetary
vorticity advection potential" in a linear balance system (Trenberth and Chen,
1988); 3. to simulate the observed planetary waves in the NH summertime and
Southern Hemisphere wintertime, and to explore the reasons for the observed
differences in planetary waves between the two hemispheres in wintertime; 4. to
investigate the kinematic destabilizing effect of the Himalayas on the abrupt
onset of the southwest.Asian monsoon.
