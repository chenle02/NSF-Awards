Dramatic increases in computing power and storage capacity have allowed
scientists and engineers to model nature in more detail than ever. However, such
models often require massive input and output datasets, and the size of these
datasets is outpacing our ability to manipulate and use them. In response, the
project is developing a novel approach (Computational Database Systems) for
exploring and understanding massive scientific datasets. The basic idea is to
integrate scientific datasets stored as spatial databases with specialized,
tightly-coupled, and highly-optimized functions that query and manipulate these
databases. In particular, the project is developing computational database
systems for building and querying the massive datasets produced by unstructured
finite element simulations. The project expects to make the following major
contributions that span scientific computing, database systems, and storage
systems: (1) New algorithms for balancing linear octrees based on new techniques
known as "balance by parts" and "prioritized ripple propagation". (2) Efficient
new sorting-based techniques for extracting mesh structure from linear octrees.
(3) Minimizing output data volume through compression of "near zero" simulation
outputs. (4) New techniques for indexing compressed spatio-temporal datasets.
(5) Storage management techniques that automatically determine the best layout
for data at each level of the system's memory hierarchy.
