This is a grant to support a professor and a postdoctoral research associate in
three separate activities. The primary one involves the SMC experiment at CERN
in Switzerland in which the spin properties of the neutron and proton are
studied using a beam of polarized muons. In another experiment, the Large Volume
Detector (LVD) is being assembled in a large underground laboratory in Italy
(Grand Sasso). This experiment is intended to detect neutrinos from space, and
to search for effects due to changes (oscillations) in their identities. In the
third effort, the investigator plans to join with other investigators from
Northeastern physics department in the SDC detector experiment to be built and
run at the SSC in Texas.
