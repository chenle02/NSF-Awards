The scientific names of plants and animals ideally remain stable in usage over
the years, and thus serve as efficient and effective indexing devices for
knowledge of the biological world. Disputes do arise from time to time, but
these are settled largely through the application of the so-called "type"
method, the identification of a particular specimen in a museum collection as
the type of a particular name, for each and every published scientific name.
Question or confusion about the applicability of a name can thus be resolved by
reference to an actual specimen. For the majority of Carl Linnaeus's 8,900 named
species and varieties of plants, unfortunately, there are no clearly fixed type
specimens, despite the importance accorded Linnaeus's publications as the
universal starting-point for scientific naming of plant and animal species. The
Linnaean Plant Name Typification Project is designed to provide a thorough
assessment of the typification (assignment of type specimens) of all of the
plant names published by Linnaeus (1707-1778). Drs. Porter Lowry and James
Reveal and a post- doctoral associate will work with Dr. Charles Jarvis of the
British Museum (Natural History) where Linnaeus's collections and library now
reside. The results will be published in an annotated catalogue that will also
contain detailed taxonomic notes and the complete citation of all relevant
nomenclatural literature. Results will also be incorporated into computer
databases maintained for the Flora North America project and other floristic
enterprises. This will establish a basis for the consistent and stable
application of these important and widely used plant names, many of which apply
to crop plants and other economically significant species, and will serve as an
essential reference for all botanists who must deal with Linnaean species names.
