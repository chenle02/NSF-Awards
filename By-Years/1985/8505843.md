Equipment including a VAX-11/750 computer and a second PUMA 560 robot will be
acquired. This equipment will support research on the automatic control of one-
and two-arm robot systems using differential geometric system theory and
techniques, and experimental implementation and evaluation of the related
advanced task-level feedback control systems for such robots using high speed
computers in the real-time control. The ultimate thrust of this research is the
development of a solid systems and control-theoretic foundation for an efficient
digital hardware/software implementation of advanced feedback control of robotic
systems, leading to "intelligent" task-level automation.
