9407009 Abruna This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface
Chemistry Program, is directed at developing an understanding of the process of
underpotential deposition of metals on metals. The effects of surface morphology
and potential dependent distributional changes of interfacial species will be
probed using a combination of dynamic electrochemical methods, X-ray scattering
probes such as EXAFS and X-ray reflectivity, and UHV electron spectroscopic
methods. Growth modes in the deposition of silver and copper on platinum
electrodes will be examined, and the effect of the structure of the adsorbed
layer on the metal deposition process will be characterized. This information is
crucial to the understanding of electroplating and thin film growth. %%% The
detailed mechanism of the electrochemical deposition of thin metal films on
metal substrates is the focus of this research project. A unique combination of
X-ray and electrochemical methods will be used to provide insights into the
effect of surface morphology and electrode-solution interfacial structure on the
deposition process. This information is useful for understanding technologically
important processes such as electroplating and corrosion inhibition.
