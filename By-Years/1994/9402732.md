The research covers a number of problems in the area of billiard dynamical
systems, differential topology and the theory of knots. Particular problems
include the classification of Legendrian knots in contact 3-manifolds and the
classification of smooth immersed plane curves. Knot invariants arising in
modern quantum field theory will also be studied. The research covers several
topics which have potential applications to dynamical and and mechanical
systems, and some areas of mathematical physics. Besides the mentoring of
graduate students, the investigator's work is partly accessible to undergraduate
students. Expository lectures and instruction to the latter are anticipated.
Thus the investigator's research carries an educational component which would be
in line with the categories of the current SMET initiative. ***
