The investigator plans to study two problems. The first problem of large
deviations has deep theoretical consequences as well as applications in
statistical physics and mathematical statistics. The investigator hopes
eventually to prove a general result on lower bounds for large deviations in
case of vector- valued functionals of Markov chains. He has already established
several links necessary to prove this result. The second problem hopes to settle
the major open question in the field of the law of iterated logarithms in Banach
spaces viz., the identification of the limits and the underlying problem of
obtaining sharp exponential bounds for sums of independent random vectors.
