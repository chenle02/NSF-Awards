The GMI Engineering and Management Institute will initiate a three- week,
commuter Young Scholars project in Physics for 30 students entering grade 9. The
selected students will participate in classroom discussions about various
sources of energy such as coal, gasoline, nuclear and solar. Through hands-on
experiments they will learn about the basic properties of light and electricity;
these concepts will be used in understanding solar power. They will perform
several experiments to understand solar motors and solar cell efficiency. Hands-
on experiments will also be performed in environmental chemistry where students
will learn about carbon dioxide gas emission, the greenhouse effect, ozone layer
depletion and toxic waste. Principles and operations of computers (both PC and
mainframe) along with BASIC programming skills will be developed. Students will
undertake research projects in physics and chemistry and write research papers
about their findings.
