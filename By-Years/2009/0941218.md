The Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network will conduct a two-day
outreach forum and related follow-up activities to provide information and
gather input from Hispanic-serving Institutions (HSIs) regarding program
components and requirements for a proposed NSF HSI-STEM initiative focused on
STEM education and research capacity building for HSIs. Seventy-five (50 four-
year/university and 25 two-year) High Hispanic Enrollment (>25%) higher
education institutions will be invited to send a two-member STEM faculty team to
the outreach forum Following the Forum, QEM will draft, distribute for comment,
revise, and provide a report to NSF's Division of Human Resource Development
(HRD) on information, concerns, and recommendations gathered at the Forum. The
goal of the Forum is to assist HRD in gathering broadly representative,
informed, and comprehensive input regarding essential program components and
requirements for an HSI-STEM initiative. The Forum will actively engage teams
from HSIs in plenary and breakout sessions to: (1) ensure that faculty at HSIs
have an opportunity to inform the development of an NSF STEM education and
research capacity-building program to address their needs; and (2) identify
critical needs in STEM undergraduate education and research at HSIs.
