This grant is to assist in the support of an international symposium (The
Fifteenth Boundary Element Method International Conference, BEM 15) on boundary
element methods to be held August 10 - 12, 1993 at Worcester Polytechnic
Institute, Worcester, MA. The aim of the symposium is to appraise the state-of-
the-art and set directions for new research in the field of boundary element
methods for the year 2000. It will facilitate a dialogue between engineers and
scientists working in a variety of technological fields that employ boundary
element methods. The conference will result in an authoritative high quality
proceedings volume which will serve as a basic reference on this subject.*** //
