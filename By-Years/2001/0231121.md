For engineering students in introductory system dynamics and controls courses
that need to gain intuitive feel for physical systems, our distributed
laboratory is a way to explore basic concepts through a hands-on experience that
uses inexpensive, custom hardware and software kits. Unlike traditional
laboratory experiences, our distributed lab kit is brought home by each student
and tackled on a self-paced schedule in much the same manner as a homework
assignment, thus allowing each student to customize the laboratory experience to
his or her learning style. In our pilot project, lab kits whose parts cost are
less than $100 when purchased in lot sizes of 100 will be designed and tested.
Our kits contains a controller board based on a standard microcontroller chip
that implements real-time control and data acquisition software and communicates
with a host over a serial port. The systems under study will be hardware modules
that connect to the controller board. The host computer will be the student's
home PC running a Visual Basic application for experiment control. Twenty-five
kits with a motor-driven inertia hardware module, an electrical network plus
speaker module and a cantilever beam module will be constructed and given to
undergraduate mechanical engineering students in the beginning system dynamics
course as part of their regular curriculum. Our evaluation plan will assess
project progress, views of the students and other stakeholders about the
distributed lab, and the impact of the lab on student learning.
