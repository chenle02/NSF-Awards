This project will investigate the molecular mechanism of the nonsense-mediated
mRNA decay (NMD) pathway in mammalian cells. mRNA decay plays a prominent role
in regulation of gene expression. Specific cell signals can transiently
stabilize unstable mRNAs or destabilize stable mRNAs to regulate protein
expression. NMD is a specific mRNA decay pathway that rids the cell of aberrant
mRNAs, which by mutation or erroneous processing fail to encode full-length
protein. In human cells, this pathway is dependent on three hUpf proteins and a
protein complex (called the exon-junction complex) that is deposited on mRNAs
after pre-mRNA splicing. Assembly of the exon-junction complex and the hUpf
proteins onto mRNAs with premature termination codons and their subsequent
targeting for NMD will be studied with the goal of understanding the molecular
mechanism of the NMD pathway in mammalian cells. The findings should provide
valuable information about mRNA decay in mammalian cells, an important process
in regulation of gene expression that is currently poorly understood. This
project will result in generation of several valuable reagents, useful for
studies of translation and mRNA decay. These will be freely available to
researchers after publication. In addition, female graduate students as well as
undergraduates will be directly involved in the latest techniques in gene
expression research, and the research in this project will be invaluable in the
PI's undergraduate teaching at University of Colorado at Boulder.
