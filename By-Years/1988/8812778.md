A three-year (1983-1986) record of temperature, conductivity and water velocity
has been obtained from seventeen moorings over the Middle Atlantic Bight slope
and outer shelf. Subtidal motions are vigorous, topographic Rossby waves are
absent, and strong velocity oscillations, with a 10-day period have been
discovered, which were previously unknown. Relatively small eddies have also
been found to contribute to velocity variance. These data will be combined with
satellite sea surface temperature imagery to investigate the 10-day
oscillations, as well as other features near the inshore edge of the Gulf
Stream.
