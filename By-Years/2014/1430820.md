The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a new Distal Locking Hemodialysis Catheter
System that will be the first to provide clinicians with a tool to manage the
most significant complications (infection, thrombosis, and loss of lock
solution) associated with chronic hemodialysis catheter use. More than 430,000
Americans currently receive hemodialysis treatments, and this prevalence is
expected to grow 3-5% each year. A significant portion of the $29 billion spent
annually treating ESRD patients in the U.S. is dedicated to managing
complications with vascular access ? many of which are associated with
catheters. It typically costs between $2,000 and $40,000 per patient to treat a
blood-borne infection, which translates to more than $3 billion each year in the
U.S. There is a need for this product to allow physicians to confidently use
whatever lock therapy is clinically best on a per-patient basis. The catheter
system will enable for the development and FDA approval of new, non-antibiotic
antimicrobial agents, which have been unable to gain/maintain approval due to
concerns of leakage. The device has the potential to be a market leader in the
$3 billion U.S. market for vascular access devices and accessories.

The proposed project shall improve and further evaluate a Distal Locking
Hemodialysis Catheter System. Over 400,000 Americans undergo hemodialysis
annually. Common complications are catheter-related bloodstream infection,
thrombosis and thrombotic occlusions, each of which can be fatal. The primary
solution to these complications is the use of heparin and antimicrobial lock
solutions. However, existing catheters present the possibility of accidental
infusion of these highly concentrated solutions into the circulation during the
locking procedure or during the locked period between uses of the catheter.
These leakages increase the risk of toxicity, and FDA-approved anticoagulants
that leak into the systemic circulation can cause minor or major bleeding. The
catheter system being developed in this project will significantly decrease
complications tied to the loss of lock solutions, such as life-threatening
infections, toxicity and bleeding events. The research shall include refinement
of the catheter?s design (material selection and mechanical tests); ensuring
that manufacture of catheters is consistent; and additional testing in vivo. The
project is expected to demonstrate that the catheter system is compatible with
lock solutions, shows adequate flow rate, has sufficient mechanical integrity,
can be manufactured consistently, and is demonstrated to be biocompatible with
an in vivo model.
