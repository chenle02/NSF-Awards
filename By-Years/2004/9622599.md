9622599 Milkey The American Astronomical Society (AAS) will lead its membership
in an examination of the goals for graduate education in astronomy. The
scientific community is entering an era in which public investment in basic
research and higher education is projected to decrease significantly. As a
result, opportunities for new PhDs to follow traditional academic research
careers are also expected to decrease. Given these realities, it is both
essential and timely to re-examine the role of graduate schools in serving our
discipline, our students, and the society which supports the discipline of
astronomy. Central to the discussion are the questions: (1) What should be the
goals, and content, of an astronomy graduate education in view of (a) the
discipline's need to continue a tradition of carrying out world class research,
and (b) our nation's need for imaginative, scientifically capable and adaptable
young people, both in the technical workforce and as teachers in the nation's
schools? 2) Should we consider changing academic institutions' admissions
policies, graduate curricula, funding patterns or academic culture to meet the
needs of (a) the discipline of astronomy, and (b) the nation? The AAS will open
this dialog at the upcoming bi-annual AAS meeting. The AAS will 1) conduct three
regional workshops during 1996 with astronomy department chairs, selected
graduate students, invited members of the education and industrial communities,
and representatives from the physics community involved in similar self-
examination; 2) publish and disseminate a report summarizing the discussions,
outlining possible models for restructuring graduate curricula, and suggesting
changes in funding patterns to stimulate or facilitate restructuring; and 3)
design an employment database to help graduate students make realistic and
informed career choices, and to help graduate departments guide admissions,
funding, and curricular policies. ***
