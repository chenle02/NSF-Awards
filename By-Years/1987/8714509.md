The project investigates the feasibility of extracting mineral species from ores
using supercritical fluid (SCF) technology. Because of their unique solvating
properties, supercritical fluids have been extensively applied to the
extraction, separation, and purification of organic materials. In contrast, very
little work has been reported describing SCF processing of inorganic mineral
species. The object of this investigation is to perform "proof-of-concept"
experiments for selective extraction of mineral-containing ore samples with
supercritical fluids. The core samples required for the tests will be supplied
by the mining companies. If successful, the SCF technology has potential for
application to both in situ mining and above-ground mineral processing.
