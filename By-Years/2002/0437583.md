ABSTRACT

Proposal Number: CTS-0437583 Principal Investigator: Freund, Jonathan B.
Affiliation: University of Illinois-Urbana-Champaign Proposal Title: The atomic
detail of evaporating menisci

Evaporation that takes place at the junction where a solid-liquid-vapor co-
exist, the so-called tri-junction, plays a critical role in multi-phase heat and
mass transfer. In nucleate and other phase-change heat transfer applications, it
accounts for a significant fraction of the overall evaporative mass and heat
flux. Since the junction is frequently the endpoint of a thin liquid film on a
surface, its behavior alters the dynamics of the entire thin film. Modeling of
evaporation and boiling is primarily handled using continuum models with
empirical closures. Promising continuum models of the tri-junction have been
developed that couple for example hydrodynamics to kinetics. Agreement with
experiment has been encouraging. It is generally known that in the thinnest
liquid regions such as evaporating menisci, additional molecular effects will
become important. This project will undertake the first ever atomistic
simulations of evaporating menisci near solid-liquid -vapor-tri-junctions in
order to observe their atomic detail. In the tri-junction, sub-scale focused
atomistic simulations will be performed to investigate the local flow and fluid
properties used in the unified meniscus model, namely viscosity, surface
tension, thermal conductivity, and evaporation kinetics. The atomistic
simulations will be interpreted in the context of a continuum lubrication model
previously developed by the PI, and improvements to the overall meniscus model
will then be made and validated against the full-scale atomistic simulations of
the evaporating meniscus. The award has been funded by the Thermal Transport and
Thermal Processing Program of the Chemical and Transport Systems Division.
