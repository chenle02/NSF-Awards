Dealing with big data is formidable when attempting to solve computations in
which both the inputs and outputs are large. Nonetheless, frequently it is the
case that only small parts of the solution are needed at any stage. Local
computation algorithms were recently introduced in order to allow a user to
quickly access the portions of the output that are required, without performing
the full computation. The aim of local computation algorithms is to provide
useful answers to the user in a manner that is significantly faster than what is
required even for the simple task of viewing the whole input or output.

The proposed research will expand the scope of local computation algorithms to
allow such fast processing for new problems from combinatorial optimization. One
class of local computation algorithms that will be studied are those that
provide query access to a sparse subgraph of the input graph which preserves
connectivity and distance properties of the original graph. A second class of
local computation algorithms "clean up" data to have certain desirable
properties, such as graph connectivity. New techniques will be developed to
approach basic computational problems that can be used as tools in solving a
wide array of other problems.

The broader impacts of this project are in the education and mentoring of young
researchers. The PI will engage in Computer Science Unplugged activities at
local elementary schools. The PI will work actively to ensure greater
participation of women and minority students in the project. Material from sub-
linear time algorithms will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate
algorithms courses.
