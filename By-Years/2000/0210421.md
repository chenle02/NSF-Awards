&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CCR-0210421&lt;br/&gt;Wolfgang Porod and Gary H.
Bernstein&lt;br/&gt;"NER: Computing Architectures for Coupled
Nanomagnets"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We explore the feasibility of
developing computing architectures&lt;br/&gt;implemented in magnetically-coupled
arrays of nanometer-sized dots and&lt;br/&gt;pillars. Similar to the electronic
Quantum-Dot Cellular Automata (QCA)&lt;br/&gt;scheme, which was previously
developed by the Notre Dame group,&lt;br/&gt;information is encoded in the
magnetization of single-domain&lt;br/&gt;permanent-magnet structures, and the
physical interaction between&lt;br/&gt;neighboring magnets provides the local
connectivity. The main goal of&lt;br/&gt;this project is to investigate how
logic functions can be realized in&lt;br/&gt;structured arrays of coupled
nanomagnets. We propose a joint theoretical&lt;br/&gt;and experimental approach
to explore the feasibility of such magnetic&lt;br/&gt;QCA-like architectures for
computing and signal processing. Once&lt;br/&gt;feasibility of elementary logic
functions is established, one may&lt;br/&gt;envision special-purpose cellular
processor cells composed of coupled&lt;br/&gt;nanoscale magnetic sensors and
memories. The robustness of such magnetic&lt;br/&gt;systems opens the potential
for applications where nanometer-sized, yet&lt;br/&gt;rugged, systems are
required with a wide range of operating&lt;br/&gt;temperatures.&lt;br/&gt;
