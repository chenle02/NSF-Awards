The semantically-motivated database models provide constructs for structuring
data which correlate with the ways that database users think about it. Prominent
examples are the semantic models, the non-first normal form relational model,
and data models for supporting the engineering design life-cycle. The research
proposed here will focus on the development and theoretical study of access
mechanisms for these models. These will include a variety of mathematically
defined query langauges for semantic models, including generalizations of the
relational calculus and algebra, and of deductive databases. Mechanisms for
reducing the inherit complexity of these query languages will be explored.
