9314542 Edmond This award will support a collaborative study by Woods Hole and
MIT scientists of hydrothermal circulation at the TAG area on the Mid- Atlantic
Ridge. Instrumentation and sampling will be done at TAG prior to Ocean Drilling
Program drilling into the hydrothermal system. Water column instrumentation will
be used to measure the change in total heat output from the system, while
chemical measurements on venting fluids will provide additional constraints on
changes in subsurface flow. This work being done in collaboration with Japanese
scientists who will provide the submersible for the initial work. Work in the
area subsequent to drilling will be from the Alvin. ***
