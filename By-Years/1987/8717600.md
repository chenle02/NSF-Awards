Dr. Jeffrey Palmer and colleagues at the University of Michigan are studying
evolutionary relationships among flowering plants at two distinct taxonomic
levels. At one level, they plan to investigate relationships among the 50 or so
families that comprise the subclass Asteridae, the second largest subclass of
dicots. Although Asteridae are generally considered to be the most highly
advanced and recently evolved of dicots subclasses, outstanding questions and
controversies remain concerning the relative placement and relationships of most
of the families in this group. In addition, there are fundamental doubts about
whether the group as a whole is a natural, monophyletic one or an assemblage of
parallel derivatives. Palmer will address this controversy by constructing a
detailed phylogeny for the subclass using recently developed techniques of
molecular systematic analysis. He will examine the distribution within this
group and determine the phylogenetic significance of a number of defined
chloroplast DNA rearrangements. He will also examine sequence variation in the
chloroplast gene encoding the large protein subunit of the key photosynthetic
enzyme, ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase. The second set of studies involves
construction of a detailed molecular phylogeny for genera and tribes of the
family Solanaceae of subclass Asteridae. This will greatly aid our understanding
of evolutionary trends and relationships in this, the economically most
important family in the subclass and also one of its largest. Despite the wide
range of studies conducted on the biology and systematics of this important
group of plants, which includes such vital crops as potatoes, tomatoes, and
chili peppers, fundamental disagreements still exist regarding taxonomic
relationships in the family. Palmer's approach here will involve comparative
mapping of chloroplast DNA restriction site mutations and computer-assisted
construction of phylogenetic trees based on these chloroplast DNA mutations.
