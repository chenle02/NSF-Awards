The goals of this ten-week summer REU site at the University of Colorado Boulder
and partner institutions is to provide undergraduate students with the
opportunity to conduct research in solar and space physics, including space
weather, the Sun-Earth connection, solar physics, magnetospheres, Earth's upper
atmosphere, the solar wind, and their impacts on society. A diversity of
projects will be undertaken ranging from purely theoretical studies to
observational data analysis to instrument design and calibration. Students will
gain experience in doing authentic research that will prepare them for graduate
school and careers in science, conducted under the guidance of experienced
mentors in the field of space physics. Understanding the Sun-Earth system is
particularly important to our technological society where solar events can
potentially disrupt satellite communication, power grids, and GPS technology.

This program will target students from small liberal arts colleges and
community colleges where research opportunities for undergraduates are often
limited. This site leverages the combination of two previously run programs; one
at the National Solar Observatory and one operated by CU-Boulder in conjunction
with the Boulder Solar Alliance. Participants of this program will participate
in an introductory week long summer school to prepare them for their research
experience. They will also participate in training on sexual harassment
awareness, ethics training, weekly brown bag seminars, a cohort building group
project, individual research projects, and a final presentation at a research
symposium. These activities support the 3 primary goals of the program: 1)
introduce students to authentic research in solar and space physics, 2) give
students valuable job skills in the sciences, and 3) provide an environment
where long-term relationships between students and their science mentors can
develop. Partner institutions (the Boulder Solar Alliance) include the
Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at CU, the National Solar
Observatory, the High Altitude Observatory at the National Center for
Atmospheric Research, NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center, Southwest Research
Institute, Northwest Research Associates, Space Science Institute, and
Atmospheric & Space Technology Research Associates.
