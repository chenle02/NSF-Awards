Graduate student J. F. Smith proposes a monographic revision and evolutionary
study of the neotropical plant genus Columnea section Pentadenia. Under the
direction of his major professor K. J. Sytsma, Mr. Smith will collect
representatives of the South American species and characterize their
reproductive morphology, chloroplast DNA sequences, and nuclear ribosomal DNA
restriction patterns. The molecular data will be used to establish the
evolutionary relationships among living species, and the reproductive structures
will be interpreted against this evolutionary framework. The proposed study will
increase our understanding of a poorly known tropical plant genus, and will use
the most advanced means for unravelling their evolutionary history. By combining
molecular approaches to evolutionary history with morphological data on
functional characters, the project will illuminate the broad question of
adaptation.
