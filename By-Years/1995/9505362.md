Concerns about the effects of human interference in the oceanic environment upon
the life and habits of marine mammals have been recently raised. In response,
researchers have taken interest in processing all relevant information to better
understand this interference with the hope and goal of protecting marine life.
In this context, the development of signal processing methods for the
exploration of sounds generated by marine mammals in the ocean is being pursued.
Success of this research will enable the tracking of mammals, and the
reconstruction of the signals they produce, through remote acoustic sensing.
Localizing marine mammals in the ocean and identifying the sounds they generate
requires the establishment of a link between physics (acoustics) and signal
processing. The normal modes approach is being adopted for modeling the acoustic
signal propagation in the oceanic environment Models will then be sought that
capture the time and frequency structure of biological signals. The combination
of acoustics and signal analysis is expected to facilitate inversion of the
acoustic field measured at an array in the ocean for the estimation of the
location of sound-transmitting marine mammals and the actual form of the signals
they transmit.
