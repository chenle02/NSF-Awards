9320944 Devor The purpose of the Agile Manufacturing Research Institute (AMRI)
is to develop an understanding of agile manufacturing enterprise and system
performance based on quantitative data; to structure a program of research to
meet machine tools industry- defined needs; and to move emerging technology
which has a potential for impacting agile manufacturing into the next stage of
functional prototyping or proof-of-concept test beds. The AMRI will include the
following tasks: research team building for the specific industry, quantitative
analysis, advanced agile manufacturing projects, education, training,
dissemination, and documentation of agile manufacturing research results.
Attaining agility in this industry is seen as a key to US manufacturing
leadership and global competitiveness. This AMRI will help provide a solid
knowledge base for this transformation.
