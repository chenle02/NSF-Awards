This award supports the renewal of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(RE) site in Physics at the University of Rochester. The site supports twelve
undergraduate students per year for ten weeks of summer research in topics
including Physics, Astrophysics and Optics. Many of the research projects in
which students have participated are attracting growing interest from the
scientific community. The faculty's research group's combination of enthusiasm
and discipline motivates students and contributes to the quality of their
research. Individual guidance and mentoring fosters each student's skill at
navigating the world of science - giving talks, writing articles - and as well
as his or her intellectual development as an independent
researcher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the REU is to offer
undergraduate students nationwide the opportunity to take part in Physics,
Astrophysics and Optics including: particle/nuclear/cosmic ray physics,
optics/quantum optics, condensed matter/biological physics, and plasma
physics/astrophysics/geophysics. Each student works with a faculty adviser on a
specific project within the context of the overall research focus of the group.
The program includes a mini-course in Linux/Unix. REU students attend weekly
presentations by University faculty, tours of University research facilities,
and social outings and may also take part in the Department's summer outreach
activities. The program concludes with a student symposium, at which each
student speaks on his/her research project; students submit written abstracts
and reports of their research experiences. Students are strongly encouraged to
continue their projects toward publication and are eligible for additional
support to present their results at national student and professional
conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
