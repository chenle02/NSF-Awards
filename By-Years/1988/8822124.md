This project is for a workshop to be held at the University of Texas on the
reliability of computational results in mechanics. The evaluation of the
accuracy of numerical schemes is an ongoing process. This workshop will
sensitize researchers to current methodologies for evaluating reliability as it
applies to mechanics problems.
