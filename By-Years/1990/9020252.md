This is a joint research effort between Clemson University (Dr. Juang) and
University of Washington (Dr. Holtz) to develop a new procedure for an
"intelligent" and systematic processing of geotechnical information generated
from in situ tests for determination of design parameters. Methods developed in
Artificial Intelligence and Operations Research, knowledge-based systems, and
fuzzy set theory will be utilized for dealing with incomplete and uncertain data
and information
