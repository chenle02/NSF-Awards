The focus of the Enzyme Function Initiative (EFI, enzymefunction.org) is to
devise bioinformatic tools and bioinformatic databases that facilitate the
assignment of functions to uncharacterized enzymes discovered in genome
projects. To assist in achieving that goal, this project will use the Blue
Waters petascale computing facility to precompute libraries of sequence
similarity networks (SSNs) for the protein universe and to make these available
to the community. The SSNs will be used to 1) analyze sequence-function
relationships in large protein families and 2) generate strategies to assign
functions to uncharacterized members of those families. The libraries of SSNs
will be updated regularly and be disseminated to the scientific community via
website maintained by the EFI (http://efi.igb.illinois.edu/est-precompute/).

This project will use the Blue Waters petascale computing facility to enable
large-scale generation of complete libraries of sequence similarity networks
(SSNs) for the complete set of protein families and superfamilies (the 14,831
homologous sequence-based families described by Pfam (http://pfam.xfam.org/) and
the 2,738 homologous structure based superfamilies described by Gene3D/CATH
(http://gene3d.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/Gene3D/), thereby providing the community with
easy access to sequence-function space. The conservative estimate is that no
more than 50% of the proteins that have been discovered in genome projects have
reliable functional annotations that can be accessed by the community using the
UniProtKB database (http://www.uniprot.org/). In the absence of reliable
functional annotations for all proteins, the biomedical, pharmaceutical, and
commercial potential provided by genome sequences cannot be realized. The EFIs
goal is to provide tools and strategies that will allow the community to
efficiently determine the functions of uncharacterized enzymes. The library of
sequence similarity networks (SSNs) to be generated and regularly updated using
Blue Waters will be an invaluable bioinformatics database/resource for focusing
and guiding those experimental efforts.
