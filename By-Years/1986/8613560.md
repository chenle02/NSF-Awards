With the end of the Paleozoic most major seaways had closed and an enormous
landmass "Pangea" had developed. Little detail of the environment of this land
mass is known for the following period (the Triassic). The Principal
Investigators propose here a collaborative approach using both paleontology and
sedimentology to examine one of the classic formations of this land mass, the
Moenkopi. The study is set apart from others in this area by the collaborative
effort. Study of sediments as well as fossil vertebrates is an excellent
approach to understanding paleoenvironments. Curiously, although the presence of
vertebrate fossils in this formation was recorded late in the 19th century, only
sporadic work on the faunas has ensued. Similarly, after initial work on the
stratigraphy beginning with its description, only limited detailed work has been
completed.
