The generation of rhythmic movement is essential to locomotion and many other
activities in most animals. The pattern-generating networks in the brain that
control these movements are efficient and reliable, and so provide a platform to
study a critical set of biological control paradigms, and offer the potential to
inspire engineered systems that exploit these underlying principles.
Neuromorphic engineering is the development of hardware-based systems that are
inspired by circuit architectures found in biological nervous systems. The goals
of this collaborative project are to develop neuromorphic systems that emulate
the control and production of such rhythmic movements, and to use nonlinear
dynamical analysis to gain a better understanding of the production of these
movements. Building on prior development of very large-scale integrated (VLSI)
circuits that mimic motor patterns, and channel-based model neurons using such
circuits, this project will create neuromorphic oscillators based on the
dynamics of ionic channels in biological neurons, combine these oscillators with
mechanical actuation and sensory feedback, and expand these systems to include
heterogeneous populations of neurons. The models will test the engineering
validity of some principles inferred from biological designs, and will in turn
allow quantitative testing of how varied parameters, sensory feedback, and
heterogeneous model populations may have effects in actual complex biological
systems.&lt;br/&gt; Results from this work will extend beyond neuroengineering,
to a better understanding of motor control and feedback in neurobiology, and to
potential applications in robotic design. This collaborative project also
continues training of students from various backgrounds and at various levels in
laboratories with a solid history of interdisciplinary
training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
