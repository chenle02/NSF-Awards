The proposed study will conduct several magnetic lines across the Cretaceous
Quiet Zone (KQZ) seafloor in the south Pacific between Samoa and New Zealand.
Magnetic data will be collected by a ship and with an autonomous aerial vehicle
(AAV) will be launched and recovered from the ship to cover a swath of magnetic
lines. The objective is to collect closely spaced magnetic tracks that will show
correlatable magnetic anomalies within the KQZ. The ship's magnetic gradiometer
will allow external field variations to be quantified and removed from the data.
Vector magnetic data will also be collected to define the three-dimensionality
of the magnetic anomalies. The data will allow the determination of the nature
of the magnetic anomalies in the KQZ and reveal more about magnetic field
behavior and/or crustal accretion processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
impacts include the potential of clarification of a long-standing issue
concerning the higher resolution details of the Cretaceous Magnetic Quiet Zone.
Graduate students will be involved at both institutions.&lt;br/&gt;
