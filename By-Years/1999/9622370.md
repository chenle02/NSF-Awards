9622370 Anderson The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Chemical
Engineering, and Physics will purchase equipment to conduct research in
engineering requiring microelectronic fabrication. The equipment will be used
for several research projects including in particular: metal-semiconductor
contacts for photodetectors and field effect transistors; electro-optic effects;
dielectrophorectic filters; and far infrared effects in semiconductors. The
equipment will greatly improve our overall capability in microelectronic
fabrication which is utilized by many faculty, many students, local industry and
in teaching. The primary focus is to achieve repeatable 1-2 um patterning for a
variety of applications. To complement the proposal, the University will provide
sole funding in expanding the Clean Room to house the new equipment. The
University provides 1/3 cost sharing for the equipment. University personnel,
skilled in electrical work, plumbing, air conditioning and electronics will
assist in setting up the new equipment and in subsequent maintenance. The new
equipment will also support the 15 faculty from our Center for Electronic and
Electro-optic Materials (CEEM). This Center represents 5 departments and
includes over 40 graduate students, some of whom will use the new equipment. ***
