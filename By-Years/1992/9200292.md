The problem of hub location can be viewed as a nonconvex optimization problem
which has parallels in other applications as well. Here, the critical input
parameters may be dynamic, so this work will consider sensitivity analysis for
heuristic solutions. This award supports the cross-disciplinary efforts and the
development of a research collaboration involving quantitative modelling in the
geosciences. In particular the mathematicians and the geographer will focus
their attention on the development of new optimization algorithms for the
problem of assigning hub facilities when these are restricted to specific
available locations and when the flow of activity from one point or node to
another is known or can be modelled mathematically.
