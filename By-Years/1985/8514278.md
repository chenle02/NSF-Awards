This research project will study quantitatively the response elicited by a
stimulating electrode on a representative nerve trunk. The model will include
fiber caliber and distribution through the nerve trunk. The goal is to achieve
selective activation of only the target neurons (either sensory or motor) with
currents which are low enough to avoid unacceptable electro-chemical processes
at the electrodes. Little is presently known about how current from point or
cuff electrodes distribute to individual neurons in a nerve bundle. This
information is important in the design of electrodes for neural prostheses - an
area of great important to neurologically handicapped people.
