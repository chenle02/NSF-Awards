Abstract Keller 9316552 To identify the DNA sequences that coordinate flagellar
gene expression, the genes for @ 1 tubulin and RSP 3, another flagellar protein,
have been modified for identification, deleted to retain varying lengths of 5'
and 3' flanking regions and intervening sequences, and introduced into
Chlamydomonas cells. Expression of the modified genes is being analyzed in
control and stimulated cells. An element regulating expression of the @ 1
tubulin gene has been located by correlating loss of inducibility with specific
deletions, and the function of this and other putative regulatory elements will
be correlated with specific responses to stimulation. This characterization of
possibly multiple DNA control elements regulating Chlamydomonas flagellar gene
expression will add to our general understanding of coordinate gene expression
and organelle biogenesis. *** In eukaryotes, mechanisms that coordinately
regulate expression of functionally related but structurally distinct genes are
largely unknown. The Chlamydomonas flagellar regeneration system is ideal for
studying coordinate gene induction. Stimulation of cells causes detachment of
Chlamydomonas flagella, and rapidly and transiently induces transcription of
tubulin and other flagellar genes 10-20 fold above basal levels of expression.
Our previous work suggests that flagellar gene expression is regulated by Ca2+
-controlled events associated with flagellar regeneration - cellular
stimulation, flagellar excision, and flagellar regrowth. To determine if the
flagellar genes are coordinately induced by each of these events, we will
measure mRNA abundance changes of an expanded set of flagellar genes after
stimulation in conditions that uncouple the normal program of events. Results of
these studies will indicate whether the flagellar genes are coordinately induced
through similar or distinct control mechanisms. %%%
