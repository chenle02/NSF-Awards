Fractals, largely characterized as structures that look the same at different
scales, are ubiquitous in nature and the sciences. They are intriguing for both
their aesthetic appeal and for the fact that despite their high complexity they
often arise as the result of very simple mechanisms. On the mathematical side,
such structures arise when repeatedly applying a simple rule such as a quadratic
polynomial. In nature and in statistical physics models, very similar patterns
and shapes emerge from randomness. The Principal Investigator's research is
mostly concerned with two-dimensional fractals that possess some form of scale
and rotation invariance, both in the deterministic and in the random setting.
Using methods from complex analysis, the principal investigator and his students
will work towards answering foundational questions and an understanding of why
the deterministic and random patterns are so similar. The project also supports
the training of graduate students.

Conformally self-similar two-dimensional sets can often be described through
conformal welding. Conformal welding is the process of gluing two Riemann
surfaces along their boundaries to form a new surface. It is instrumental in
Teichmueller theory, of independent interest in geometric function theory, and
has recently been intensely studied in the context of the Schramm-Loewner
Evolution (SLE) and Liouville Quantum Gravity (LQG). The PI will explore the
recently found connections between Teichmueller theory and Loewner theory. He
will apply his new conditions on weldability to the setting of SLE and LQG,
aiming at an analytic construction of SLE by gluing quantum discs. He will also
apply this technique to obtain conformal spheres from matings of trees, both in
the deterministic setting of conformal mating of Julia sets and in the
probabilistic setting of the Brownian map as the gluing of two continuum random
trees.
