Many physical phenomena in continuum mechanics and materials science are modeled
by partial differential equations. The challenge of understanding the different
behaviors observed from experiments can be posed as understanding the behavior
of the solutions of the corresponding partial differential equations. This
project involves the mathematical analysis of nonlinear models that originated
in active fields of physics and materials science. The emphasis is on the study
of the limiting behavior of nonlinear models for smectic A liquid crystals and
of the symmetry properties of layer solutions to thin film equations, so to add
insights to classical models from materials science and help explain some long-
observed phenomena in experiments. The project will offer cross-disciplinary
training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students.

The project is divided in two main parts. In the first part, the investigator
will study nonlinear models for smectic A liquid crystals. Starting from a
nonlinear approximation energy model the investigator will address the
compactness of sequences with bounded energy and consider the gamma limit of the
model when sending the liquid crystal penetration length to zero. The
investigator will next extend these results to the fully nonlinear energy model
and study the properties of some explicit examples which are solutions of the
associated Euler-Lagrange equation. The second part addresses layer solutions
for two-dimensional thin film models, with an emphasis on their one-dimensional
symmetry. This study is closely related to De Giorgi's conjecture on the one-
dimensional symmetry of layer solutions to the Allen-Cahn equation. The
extension to the thin film models is challenging due to the vectorial and
nonlocal feature of the phenomena.
