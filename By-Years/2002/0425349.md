ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;OPP#0425349&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a dissertation
proposal to study the acquisition of driftwood as a fuel in subsistence
strategies. Using archaeological evidence, contemporary and historic driftwood
surveys, and ethnographic interviews the CoPI will investigate fuelwood
availability and harvesting strategies in the Kodiak archipelago. In addition
the researchers propose to evaluate the possible impacts of climate change,
resource depression and logging, on fuelwood harvesting. In addition to the
research, the project is exemplary in its inclusion of local students in the
research through education projects.&lt;br/&gt;
