"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the world is very much three-
dimensional, most of today's approaches to visual object recognition essentially
reduce the problem to one of 2D pattern classification, where rectangular image
patches are independently compared to stored templates to produce isolated
object labels within the image. This project aims to account for the three-
dimensional nature of the real world by exploring qualitative geometric
reasoning in terms of 3D spatial relationships between scene components,
category-level object models, and global scene
understanding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is organized around two major
research areas. Qualitative 3D scene parsing: A central part of our effort will
be to develop qualitative 3D models of the scene that describe the depicted
objects and surfaces and their physical relations. Grounding objects in the
scene: We integrate the geometric representation of the scene and the
corresponding 3D spatial relations with the object recognition process by (1)
inferring the set of likely object identities based on 3D relations among scene
components; (2) predicting the most likely object locations from the scene
layout; and (3) using the occlusion relations and depth ordering to predict the
parts of objects that may be visible in the scene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project is anticipated to result in major advances in 3D scene understanding
from photographs, a critical enabling technology for a wide range of
applications including autonomous systems, health care, human-computer
interaction, assistive technology, image retrieval, industrial and personal
robotics, manufacturing, scientific image analysis, surveillance and security,
and transportation.
