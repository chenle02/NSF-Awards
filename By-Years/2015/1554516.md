ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Howard, Scott&lt;br/&gt;Proposal:
1554027&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this CAREER proposal is to
study, develop, characterize, and evaluate a fundamentally&lt;br/&gt;new method
for super-resolution molecular imaging in living animals. An approach capable of
visualizing functional and morphological markers of pathological conditions
located deep within the tissue would be a breakthrough in optical imaging and
its applications in biomedical research and the development of novel therapeutic
and diagnostic approaches. Significant efforts will be dedicated to teaching
translational applications of biophotonics with emphasis on helping students
develop entrepreneurship skills in the field of biophonics and
imaging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will provide researchers, for the
first time, a platform for three-dimensional, super-resolution imaging deep in
living animals while simultaneously providing super-sensitivity molecular
measurements in the cellular microenvironment. This new super resolution
molecular imaging modality is based on analyzing harmonic distortions in a
multiphoton microscope. This is an ambitious goal and the idea of using
saturation to further localize fluorescence signals is innovative.
