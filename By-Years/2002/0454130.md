Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Program: NSF 04-588 CISE Computing Research
Infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;Title: CRI: An Open Linguistic Infrastructure for
American English &lt;br/&gt;Proposal: CNS 0454130&lt;br/&gt;PI: Nancy M.
Ide&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Vassar College&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This planning
grant will support the PI in preparing a community resource proposal for further
development of the American National Corpus (ANC) which is currently an 11
million word corpus of contemporary American English. The ultimate goal is to
create a 100 million-word collection that will be an enabling data resource for
research in linguistics, computational linguistics, natural language processing,
information retrieval, machine translation and other areas. The PI will address
the challenging problem of planning a resource that addresses the needs of these
communities with different requirements for their research. The PI will convene
an advisory board, organize a workshop to further define needs, and receive
research community comments. Proof of concept developments will be conducted to
demonstrate the use of annotation tools with different parsers and semantic
taggers, and to augment existing analysis tools, and enhance the ANC web
interface.&lt;br/&gt;
