9410116 Elnozahy The objective of this project is to develop a software
monitoring tool that would allow the collection of performance data under
realistic workloads and network activities. Unlike other hardware and software
monitoring tools, the new tool can collect long execution traces with very
little perturbation to the actual system. The duration of monitored execution is
estimated to be orders of magnitude longer than has been possible using existing
techniques. The implementation takes place entirely in software and relies on
the instruction counters that are increasingly becoming common with modern
processors. Because the execution of the system is not affected by the
monitoring process, the processing can be applied for collecting very long
traces while the system is in use. This will permit more ambitious performance
studies than have been possible today. The monitoring tool can also be used for
debugging purposes during the final testing phases of programs to uncover
intermittent errors. These errors, known as Heizenbugs, are the most difficult
to discover and are the reason for the perceived unreliability of systems
software. ***
