The research is in the areas of knot theory and 3- dimensional manifolds. One
of the problems Thompson will work on is the property-P conjecture. A knot in
the 3-sphere is said to have property P if no non-trivial surgery on the knot
yields a homotopy 3-sphere. It has long been conjectured that all non- trivial
knots in the 3-sphere have property P. Gordon and Luecke have recently shown
that non-trivial surgery on a non-trivial knot cannot yield the 3-sphere itself.
There remains the possibility that one could do surgery on a knot in the
3-sphere and obtain a counter-example to the Poincare conjecture. The suggested
approach to this problem involves a generalization of work of Gabai on sutured
manifolds, as well as considering the equivalent problem of whether one can do
surgery on a knot in a fake 3-sphere and obtain S3. In addition, recent work
with Scharlemann has suggested several interesting questions about imbedded
finite graphs in 3-manifolds. Thompson will try to generalize their work
characterizing unknotted planar graphs in S3 to arbitrary finite graphs in the
3-sphere. These are fundamental questions about three-manifolds. The fact that
they are open points up how much we still do not know about three-dimensional
manifolds. This is so despite the fact that we live in one, and so such
topological questions might even have cosmological significance.
