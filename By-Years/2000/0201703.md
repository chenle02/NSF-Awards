The electromagnetic coupling between the ionosphere and the magnetosphere
ultimately takes place through small-scale currents and fields. Auroral arcs
form on scales smaller than 1 kilometer. This project will investigate the
processes by which electromagnetic energy can be transferred to these small
scales in the topside auroral ionosphere. It will focus on two of primary
processes: (1) linear phase mixing of Alfven waves where there are perpendicular
gradients in the Alfven speed, and (2) nonlinear interactions between Alfven
waves trapped in the ionospheric Alfven resonator. The research will be carried
out by using two and three dimensional simulations of the propagation of Alfven
waves using a nonlinear MHD code. The currently existing linear MHD code will be
modified to include electron inertial effects along auroral field lines. It will
include the effects of the formation of density cavities and the outflow of ions
along auroral field lines.
