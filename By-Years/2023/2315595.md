This project aims to serve the national interest by establishing an
interdisciplinary mixed reality (XR) Engineering curriculum that prepares
undergraduate students for flourishing careers as XR professionals and
researchers. The rapidly evolving field of XR technology presents U.S. higher
education institutions with a unique combination of opportunities and
challenges, as the higher education institutions endeavor to tap into the
potential of the XR domain. This project intends to advance XR engineering
education and foster workforce development, with crafted learning materials and
activities empowering students to create XR applications across diverse
industries, tackle societal challenges, and unlock innovative opportunities. The
project will employ evidence-based pedagogical approaches, such as learning-by-
doing and learning-by-teaching, while integrating recent advances in XR
technology.

The proposed curriculum is designed with adaptability in mind, enabling its
implementation as a new STEM program, minor, or certificate, thereby expanding
participation and bolstering institutional capacity for STEM workforce
development. The curriculum will initially be launched as a pilot program at
Kennesaw State University and Georgia State University, two minority serving
institutions. The study will be conducted using both quantitative and
qualitative research methods, encompassing a review of existing literature,
surveys, expert interviews, and focus group discussions with undergraduate
students. Anticipated outcomes encompass a comprehensive XR engineering
curriculum, enriched learning materials, and engaging activities that boost
student engagement and retention while promoting increased STEM participation
among women and minority students. The project results will be disseminated to
other institutions, particularly Historically Black Colleges and Universities in
the local area to further strengthen the XR education ecosystem and broaden the
impacts of the proposed work. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and
development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all
students. Through its Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the
creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
