Methods of evaluating structural reliability have advanced from member to system
analysis. A nonlinear structural analysis program is utilized to derive ultimate
and serviceability limit states in load space. System probability of failure is
computed by integration of the joint density function of applied loads in the
failure region in a three-dimensional load space. The reduction of load space
dimensions to three is possible by assumption of positive perfect correlation
amongst certain floor loads. Structural variability is modeled by randomization
of the limit state function in load space without requiring any additional
structural analysis. Sensitivity of failure probability to load and resistance
variables are studied and factors with significant contributions are noted. A
systematic load space approach to design, based on applying weights to modes of
failure and minimization of the total expected cost using single and
multiobjective linear programming, is developed. Results are trade-off curves
between future (or failure) cost and initial cost for several realistic
structures.
