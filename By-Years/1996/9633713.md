OCE 96-33713 Flament The project will complete analysis of data obtained during
the Tropical Instability Wave Experiment (TIWE). The analysis will focus on
describing the structure and dynamics of eddies observed in association with
tropical instability waves during the experiment. The eddy kinetic energy budget
will be computed and the conversion of heat and momentum from mean-flow to
eddies will be estimated. Drifter trajectories will be analyzed to determine the
convergent velocities associated with the instability. Numerical model output
will be analyzed and compared with observations in an attempt to generalize the
dynamical understanding gained from the experiment.
