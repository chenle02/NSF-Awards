Hydrothermal plumes, commonly called black smokers, are formed by hot fluids
discharging from seafloor vents on mid-ocean spreading ridges. These fluids
entrain the ambient seawater as they rise and are important to understanding the
global transport of heat and chemicals in the ocean (which is a factor in
climate studies) and to understanding the evolution of marine organisms and
microbes. Currently, there are both remote sensing and in-situ methodologies to
observe plumes including acoustic imaging, temperature sensors, etc. This
proposal combines the data collected by such methods with numerical models in
order to develop new predictive models of entrainment and
transport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A dynamic data-driven analysis model will be
developed and utilized with acoustic imaging instrumentation system in order to
provide the immediate feedback necessary to maximize the utility of field
experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This analysis system will drive predictive
models of the entrainment and transport of biological and geological material by
the observed hydrothermal plumes, which will facilitate the particulate sampling
programs needed to understand larval and chemical transport in the ocean and
validate the accuracy of the acoustic imaging
method.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The VIP system has the
potential to revolutionize the study of hydrothermal plumes by making it
possible to gather data efficiently and site measurement instrumentation
effectively. This is especially timely given that the NSF RIDGE 2000 program is
preparing for an intensive program of studies at the three selected Integrated
Study Sites.The VIP system is also applicable to the study of other phenomena
such as bubble plumes from methane seeps above gas hydrate deposits, and deep
ocean sewage outfall plumes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
