a non-technical explanation &lt;br/&gt;This project will support a team of
scientists from several US universities and research institutes to participate
in a 3-day workshop in France to establish a new international research
collaboration for science of the Tropical Upper Troposphere / Lower Stratosphere
(UT/LS).&lt;br/&gt;The new understanding of the dynamics, chemistry, and
momentum exchange between the troposphere and stratosphere gained from Strateole
2 is critical for the new generation of climate models that extend as high as 1
hPa and attempt to incorporate variability in the stratosphere into our
understanding of climate change. The workshop will also provide an opportunity
for a group of undergraduate physics and engineering students from Puerto Rico
interested in balloon platforms to learn about key motivations for stratospheric
research, and get a new perspective on engineering challenges for making these
types of measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a technical description
&lt;br/&gt;Stratospheric water vapor plays an important role in the radiative
budget of the stratosphere as well as in modulating surface warming. The
tropical tropopause layer (TTL) is often referred to as the gateway to the
global stratosphere, however there are still debates on the chemical transport
pathways and how moist air is transported upward and eventually dehydrated in
the TTL. The objectives of the research are to 1) determine the roles of
tropical waves and deep convection on the transport of water vapor into the
stratosphere and formation of cirrus clouds in the tropical tropopause layer, 2)
understand the relative roles of planetary-scale waves through small scale
gravity waves in the forcing of the quasi-biennial oscillation, 3) characterize
background aerosol loading, aerosol size distributions, and ozone chemistry in
the tropical lower stratosphere to constrain this transport. New superpressure
balloon instrumentation, including a fiber-optic temperature profiler, new pico-
SDLA diode laser measurements of water vapor and lightweight frost point
hygrometers that measure in-situ cold point temperatures and water vapor with
unprecedented accuracy, will be key to new advances in this field.
