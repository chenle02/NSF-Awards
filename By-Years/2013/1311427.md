multimedia educational pilot project will design, develop, and test an
innovative science education model and materials to motivate high school
students in grades 10-11 to become interested in pursuing careers in science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education by learning physics,
astronomy, and cosmology (PAC) in multi-modal innovative ways. To accomplish
this, the PAC - Involved pilot project team is combining the best features of
formal and informal education along with the educative resources offered by
networked computing, popular media, and information technologies. The main goal
of the project is to pilot test key methods and designs to develop a new
learning model that could provide essential science content preparation together
with enhancing students? motivation to enroll and succeed in regular high school
physics and astronomy courses, which are gateways to college level STEM courses
and careers. Over a 2-year period, the PAC - Involved team will design, develop,
and test a new learning environment and will work with 30 high school students
from the Washington Metropolitan Area Public School Systems.
