This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). This award supports the Los Alamos Summer School, a ten week
summer program for undergraduate physics students held in Los Alamos, New
Mexico. The school exposes the students to frontier research and provides
training and encouragement for them to pursue careers in physics and related
areas. Experts from UNM and LANL and distinguished visitors give 8 lectures per
week. The students' remaining time is spent on individual research projects with
mentors from the senior scientific staff of LANL. The students have access to
LANL and UNM library, computational, and experimental resources. Final reports
by the students are published by LANL as a LA-UR Report. Often student projects
lead to publications in refereed journals. Most of the students present their
results in LANL's annual Undergraduate Research Symposium, and many additionally
present at external national meetings.
