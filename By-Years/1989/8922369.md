This grant provides partial support ($90,000 of a total budget of $526,000, or
17%) of the International Seismological Centre (ISC) at the University of
Reading, United Kingdom. The ISC dataset is widely used by U.S. scientists and
has made possible the first large-scale attempts at determining 3-D structure of
the earth. It is an essential resource for the determination of world-wide
seismicity which is a necessary component in earthquake hazard studies
throughout the world. This grant is a component of the National Earthquake
Hazard Reduction Program.
