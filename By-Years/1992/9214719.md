The objective of the project is to integrate the system information generated
at an industry site. The information requirements at the facility are
representative of the information requirements in service-related industries,
which comprise a significant portion of the private sector in the United States.
These information requirements include data pertaining to administration,
accounting, inventory, customers, research, and operations. The project will
involve an analysis of the facility's information flow and needs, and
identification and characterization of the types of information involved, the
formation and implementation of the appropriate solutions, a comparative
measurement of performance, and a provision for documentation and training.
