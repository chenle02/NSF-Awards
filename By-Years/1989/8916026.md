This project involves studies by ultrafast laser techniques of highly optically
excited semiconductor microstructures, based on very recent advances in the
fabrication of new II-VI compound superlattices and quantum wells. These
microstructures have their optical resonances in the visible region of the
spectrum, especially in the blue-green where semiconductor optoelectronics
technology is presently very poorly developed. The work is expected to have
direct impact in developing high speed optical switching and light emitting
devices, based on miroscopic understanding of the physics of highly excited
nonequilibrium electron-hole plasmas and excitonic complexes. A particular
feature of the microstructures to be studied is the incorporation of magnetic
elements in a highly spatially controllable fashion. This will be investigated
from the standpoint of fast optically induced changes in magnetic ordering of
the microstructures, with a view towards exploiting such phenomena in magneto-
optical devices.
