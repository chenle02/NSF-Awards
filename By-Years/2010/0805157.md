Modern science, especially biochemistry, has become dependent on numerical
analysis of large amounts of data generated in most every experiment. Scientific
advancement in biology and in understanding disease pathogenesis will likely
depend on the analysis of the huge corpus of biomolecular data (eg. microarray,
RNA and DNA sequence data). This advancement is linked to the field's ability to
continue developing statistical methodologies capable of identifying a robust
``signal'' which can be reproducibly identified in multiple experiments all of
which generate noisy data. The PI has shown how the theoretical framework of
spectral analysis with Markov chains unifies several statistical methods for
identifying structure in data that is observed with noise: discrete Fourier
analysis, correspondence analysis, principle components analysis, as well as
spectral clustering. This unifying framework also provides insight into, and
generalization of, the more traditional methods listed above. Therefore, the
PI's proposed research has two major directions. In one direction, it will
continue basic methodological development of exploratory data analysis with a
focus on methods capable of identifying biological signals observed in noisy
experimental conditions. In another, it will focus on rigorous statistical
analysis of this methodology which is in wide use in statistics, computer
science and bioinformatics.

Statistical methods developed here will be particularly aimed at the study of
cellular regulation of gene and protein expression. These cellular mechanisms
have wide ranging importance in understanding human disease including cancer and
infectious disease. The data analytic methods developed under this grant will be
implemented and made publicly available through Bioconductor, a package in R.
The broad goal of this proposal is to work towards providing a methodological
unification of methods in statistics, biology and computer science to
biomolecular data. Thus, it falls roughly into the field of bioinformatics.
