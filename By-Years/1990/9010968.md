This is a post-event investigation project to learn engineering lessons from
the Loma Prieta earthquake (October 1989). The objective of this project is to
establish more rational guidelines for the detail and proportion of shear wall
buildings for earthquake resistance. The research conducted involves detailed
analytical studies on two shear wall dominant buildings in the San Francisco Bay
area. The buildings were subjected to the 17 October 1989 Loma Prieta
Earthquake, and suffered no apparent damage. The buildings had been instrumented
by the California Strong Motion Instrumentation Program (CSMIP), and substantial
data was recorded in the event and its aftershocks. In addition, building
responses have been measured in the previous earthquakes of lesser intensity;
therefore, a broad range of data exists to study building performances. The
analytical studies are designed to evaluate current modeling techniques and code
requirements for shear wall buildings in regions of moderate to severe
seismicity. Findings and conclusions of the investigation will be used to
evaluate possible modifications to existing codes.
