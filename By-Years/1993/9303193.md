This proposal entails the interdisciplinary study of multicomponent polymeric
glasses to develop a molecular level understanding of macroscopic materials
properties. It is an industry-university collaboration involving the fields of
chemistry, physics, and engineering. The projects include aspects which range
from the synthesis and preparation of materials through a determination of
engineering properties to advanced spectroscopic characterization with an
overall interpretation assisted by theory and modeling. Systems selected for
study are technologically relevant and suitable for study by nuclear magnetic
resonance, such as polycarbonates and poly(phenylene oxides), in the presence of
diluents. Continued advances in the nuclear magnetic resonance technique allow
for new insights into molecular-level motion and structural interactions which
bear upon the materials properties of these multicomponent systems.
Interpretational frameworks will be sought to relate the nuclear magnetic
resonance data to motion and structure in the glasses. A second tier of
interpretation is required to relate motion and structure to the macroscopic
characteristics of the materials. In both cases, molecular modeling results will
assist in the generation of an understanding and also direct the nature of the
experimental inquiry.
