Past research in atmospheric chemistry has been largely concerned with
"homogeneous" chemical processes occurring among gaseous substances occurring in
trace amounts. Much less attention has been given to "heterogeneous" processes,
defined as those physical and chemical processes occurring at, or across,
boundaries between the solid, liquid, or gaseous media. There is a growing
awareness among atmospheric scientists, however, that the heterogeneous
processes play important roles in chemical transformations occurring in both
natural and polluted atmospheres. A recent example is the crucial role of
heterogeneous chemistry on the ice particles of polar stratospheric clouds in
the depletion of springtime Antarctic ozone. This project will measure mass
accommodation of gaseous species, such as dimethysulfide and organoperoxy
radicals, on surfaces, including carbonaceous soot material, sulfuric acid, and
sea salt. Gaseous and surface reaction products will be determined by mass
spectrometry and thermal desorption. These experiments are designed to yield
data required for developing mathematical models of chemical transformations in
the troposphere, especially in regions of high aerosol loadings.
