Several aspects of the relationship between concurrency and proof theory shall
be investigated in this project. In particular, theoretical connections between
them shall be explored and a programming language based upon the pi-calculus
will be designed and implemented using the techniques of logic programming. This
should result in both a programming language for the implementation of
algorithms centered around concurrency and communication and a logical
specification language for the high-level description and analysis of such
software.
