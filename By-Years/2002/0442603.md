Soil science has traditionally looked to students in agricultural science as its
primary audience and failed to demonstrate the relevance of soil science to
students from other disciplines. This project is developing a set of interactive
web-based lessons on the origins, development, and properties of soils for use
by undergraduates. These freely available lessons are portable and can easily
fit the instructional objectives of many Geoscience and Environmental science
disciplines. The approach is intended to teach fundamental concepts that are
critical for students to understand in introductory college-level science
courses, while still underpinning the instructional objectives of advanced
science courses. The lessons are being developed using case studies or problems
in areas such as ecology, geology, geography, and environmental sciences and are
directly integrated with the same principles or concept lessons. Application of
soil science to case studies in various disciplines will enhance student
appreciation for the importance of soil science in their field of study. These
technology-enhanced lessons are being evaluated for student learning of soil
concepts in various disciplines, as well as for enhanced intellectual
engagement, recruitment, and retention of students in the earth sciences. This
project is multi-institutional (University of Nebraska, Oregon State University,
Colorado State University, Trinity College Pennsylvania) and inter-disciplinary
(Soil Science, Geology, Environmental Science, Ecology), and thus, will benefit
a broad population of students.
