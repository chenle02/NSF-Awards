Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems have recently become a very important part of the
Internet. &lt;br/&gt;Unprecedented popularity, low overhead, and high
scalability of these networks&lt;br/&gt;make them highly appealing to a wide
range of end users. This proposal studies &lt;br/&gt;fundamental performance
limitations of the existing and recently proposed &lt;br/&gt;peer-to-peer
architectures and examines inherent scalability issues of these networks.
&lt;br/&gt;Outside the P2P community, this project provides a better
understanding of &lt;br/&gt;large-scale self-reconfiguring systems and leads to
the development of new &lt;br/&gt;algorithms for future implementation of
various information-centric &lt;br/&gt;routing infrastructures.
