Voles are unique because of their central role in ecosystem food chains, the
density cycles that many populations undergo, their potential to cause human
health and agricultural problems, and their role as a general model of
population regulation. Currently there is no explanation for the vole cycle of
density but there is great interest in understanding this phenomenon from both
the scientific and agricultural communities. In order to test possible
mechanisms of population regulation, Dr. Tamarin and his colleagues have
developed a technique to determine relatedness in field animals using
radioactive isotopes and electrophoresis, a protein separation technique.
Research in the past has resulted in estimates with confidence in maternity but
reduced confidence in paternity because these estimates relied on
electrophoresis that, due to limited marker genes, did not reveal sufficient
variability. Recombinant DNA techniques, now available to overcome these
problems, will be used to give near certain estimates of paternity.
