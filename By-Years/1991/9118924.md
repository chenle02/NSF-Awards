The experiments proposed involve Taylor-Couette flow in superfluid helium,
mutual-friction coefficients at elevated pressures and a study of the
interactions of elementary excitations with each other and with quantized
vortices. A major objective of the work is to lay a solid foundation for
understanding the hydrodynamics of superfluid He flowing at very high Reynolds
numbers.
