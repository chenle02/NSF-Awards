A workshop for recipients of research awards in the Enhancing Access to the
Radio Spectrum (EARS) program is being held at the National Science Foundation
on October 7 &amp; 8, 2013. An important component of the EARS program is
interchange of information among the awardees, and between the awardees and
stakeholder communities, such as wireless providers, spectrum regulators, public
safety, the defense and national security communities, and others. This project
provides travel support to small business and academic awardees under the Small
Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program to attend the workshop, and interact
with their academic colleagues who are performing research in the same domain.
