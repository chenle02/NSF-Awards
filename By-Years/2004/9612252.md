9612252 Moerner This multidisciplinary research project utilizes advanced
optical science methodology to probe individual molecules or ions to explore
quantum properties and interactions with their local environments, and to study
the mechanochemical cycle and dynamics of naturally occurring molecular motor
proteins of the kinesin super family. Low temperature spectroscopy, plasmon
resonant probes, Raman scattering, and transmission electron microscopy
techniques are also included in a broad-based study to gain new knowledge and
understanding about the properties of matter and molecular motors. %%% The
project combines concepts and methodologies from condensed matter physics,
biochemistry and chemistry with advanced optical probes and related
characterization tools to address forefront issues at the interfaces between
these disciplines. The research will contribute basic new knowledge at a
fundamental level to several aspects of matter and molecular structures and
configurations. An important feature of the program is the integration of
research and education through the training of students in fundamental
interdisciplinary research areas. ***
