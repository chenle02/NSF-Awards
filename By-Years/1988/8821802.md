The main objectives of this proposal are: (1) To determine atomic structure of
real quasicrystals; (2) To identify kinetic and equilibrium factors responsible
for quasicrystal formation and stability; (3) To characterize nature of disorder
in quasicrystals. The average quasiperiodic structure of observed quasicrystals
will be determined, and its utility vis-a-vis icosahedral glass models assessed,
using the available diffraction data and novel approach of exploiting structural
similarity of crystal approximants. Accurate determination of the structure is a
necessary prerequisite for calculations of other physical quantities.
Quasicrystal stability and formation will be investigated through classical
cohesive energy, variational thermodynamic potentials, and simulations of
freezing of 2D and icosahedral liquids. The results will also expand the
understanding of kinetic and equilibrium pattern formation in general. Phase
fluctuations and more general disorder in quasicrystals will be studied in the
context of the growth of Penrose tilings, in hard-disk and random tiling models,
and in terms of the freezing of 2D and icosahedral liquids. Understanding of
growth induced disorder and phase fluctuations is not only crucial in the case
of quasicrystals, but will also have important ramifications in theories of
glasses.
