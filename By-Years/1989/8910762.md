Nonlinear phenomena introduce new behavior that is both counterintuitive and
qualitatively different from linear phenomena which had been the focus of most
past plasma research. The unpredictability is manifested by complex problems
unexpectedly becoming simple and vice versa, by new states of matter that
appear, by new methods for controlling or engineering plasmas unexpectedly
becoming possible, or by the plasma spontaneously self- organizing itself into a
coherent structure. The present research concentrates on two areas of nonlinear
dynamics where few results are currently available: (a) the interaction of
intrinsic stochasticity with self-consistent properties; and (b) stochasticity
in multi- dimensional systems. Some progress has been made on the first topic in
applying the ideas to sheath heating in r.f. discharges. This has both led to
new fundamental understanding and practical possibilities of improving r.f.
plasma processing, to new understanding of plasma loss in electron cyclotron
heated plasmas, and to the containment of electromagnetic radiation in periodic
guiding systems. The present work is concentrating on investigation of multi-
degree-of-freedom systems using digital phase locked loops (DPLL). A single loop
has already been studied and shown how it can be designed to optimize locking
ability. Interconnected systems of oscillators have many applications including
achieving higher power from microwave devices by combining the output of several
synchronized oscillators have also been used as models in neurophysiology.
Interconnected systems of DPLLs offer a convenient way to experimentally and
numerically study the phenomenology of these systems since DPLLs are probably
the simplest system with locking behavior. Since digital systems are described
by mappings, it is computationally very efficient to study these systems as
opposed to a system of ordinary differential equations.
