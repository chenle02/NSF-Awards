Monomial (single-termed power function) approximation more faithfully models the
power function behavior of the structural system, while at the same time,
becomes a linear form when transformed into log space. Thus, computational tools
based on linear algebra remain useful and effective. Since the monomial
approximation provides a much higher quality approximation to the nonlinear
phenomena exhibited in structural applications, incremental and iterative
methods become much more effective since the local approximation allows
significantly larger steps to be taken. The net result is an increase in
reliability of the solution process and a significant reduction in computational
effort. The main goal of this research is to develop efficient and reliable
methods for structural analysis and design based on this monomial approximation.
The scope will include treatment of geometric nonlinearities in structures
modeled by finite elements, including trusses, frames and continuation
structures. A general load increment method based on the monomial approximation
will be developed. The project will also consider material nonlinearities. The
typical stress-strain relationship for a nonlinearly elastic material
nonlinearities. The typical stress-strain relationship for a nonlinearly elastic
material is remarkably monomial in shape. The monomial approximation will model
this behavior very well and should produce a very effective analysis tool.
