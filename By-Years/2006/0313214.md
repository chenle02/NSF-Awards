In nature, viruses are self-replicating entities that differ from one another in
their genomic makeup (RNA or DNA), their genome sizes (spanning two orders of
magnitude), and their host-ranges (spanning all kingdoms of life), yet all
viruses share the need to express their own genome-encoded functions as mRNA,
direct the synthesis of their proteins using the translation machinery of their
host, copy their genomes, and assemble their resulting progeny genomes in
protective coatings prior to their release to the extracellular environment.
However, beyond these and perhaps a few other generic attributes, common
features among viruses are not so readily apparent. The most compelling
conserved traits of viruses will be revealed at the integrated process level, by
seeking common patterns in the dynamic networks that direct intracellular
resources toward virus growth. Such patterns will be sought in three ways: by
formulating and refining in-silico models for the intracellular development of
three viruses that represent diverse information-processing strategies: phage
T7, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV);
by identifying common characteristics in the intracellular development of these
viruses, focusing on the dynamics and efficiencies of information, material and
energy flows, and by assessing the feasibility of applying in-silico mutagenesis
to generate and characterize the functional diversity within population
distributions of viruses, so-called quasi-species. At the level of broader
impacts, this is a highly interdisciplinary project that will employ computer
simulations to characterize the dynamics and control of cellular resource
processing during the development of viruses. The cross-disciplinary experience
gained by students and co-workers who pursue this research, as well as the
refereed publications, technical presentations and supplements to course
lectures that result from this work, will contribute toward the advancement of
research and education in biological information processing.
