How nervous systems are assembled and properly wired during development remains
a major question in biology. At the central nervous system (CNS) midline of all
organisms with bilateral symmetry, neurons make the decision to cross or not to
cross from one side of the midline to the other. The CNS midline has served as a
model for the molecular genetic dissection of axon guidance mechanisms. Several
signaling pathways have been identified that regulate this behavior of axons at
the CNS midline, including the Slit-Robo signaling pathway. This pathway is
highly conserved and functions in organisms ranging from worms to humans. While
this core signaling pathway is highly conserved, the regulation of Slit-Robo
signaling varies in different organisms. In the fruit fly, Drosophila, the
Commissureless (Comm) protein is a key regulator of Slit-Robo signaling. Comm
functions by regulating the sub-cellular distribution of the Robo receptor.
While Comm is essential for proper CNS development in Drosophila, Comm-like
genes are not found outside of insects. By examining the sequenced genomes of
diverse insects, Dr. Seeger and his colleagues have found that Comm-like genes
are present in only a subset of insects. Dr. Seeger will test the hypothesis
that Comm-like genes in mosquitoes and body lice regulate Robo receptor
distribution as in Drosophila. They will also address how Slit-Robo signaling is
regulated in insects that lack a Comm-like gene, like beetles and wasps. What
will emerge from these studies is a better understanding of the mechanisms that
regulate the Robo-Slit signaling pathway as well as insights into the evolution
of axon guidance mechanisms. Finally, these studies will provide extensive
research experiences in molecular genetics, cell biology, and developmental
neuroscience for numerous undergraduates and several graduate students within
the Seeger laboratory, helping to provide hands-on training for our next
generation of scientists.
