This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to Mount Holyoke College for the
renovation and repair of Carr Laboratory which houses that institution's polymer
chemistry, physical organic chemistry, biophysical chemistry, and enzyme
mechanisms and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy research and research
training activities. This building was constructed in 1954 and has not been
renovated since that time. The ARFMP grant of $100,000 and $100,000 provided by
the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and
research training facilities. This project will address the need to improve the
research infrastructure by bringing the laboratory benches, cabinets, sinks, and
fume hoods up to modern standards and by making the bench tops chemically
resistant and level once again. The proposed renovation will have a clear and
significant impact on the quality, quantity, and diversity of research and
research training pursued at Mount Holyoke. This award contributes to the
infrastructure of science by providing an improved environment for the conduct
of research and for the training of quality undergraduate students. Mount
Holyoke is regarded as the leading producer in the United States of women
chemists who go on to earn the Ph.D. degree. This renovation will allow Mount
Holyoke College to maintain its long tradition of preparing some of the most
talented young women in the country for careers in chemistry and related
sciences.
