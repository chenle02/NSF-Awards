0321213&lt;br/&gt;Gonzalez&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research
Instrumentation (MRI) Program grant supports acquisition of a stable isotope
ratio mass spectrometer (SIRMS) equipped with an automated carbonate and HDO
equilibration systems for paleoenvironmental and geologic research in the
Department of Geology at the University of Kansas. The newly established stable
isotope facility at Kansas will support studies of continental climates using
stable isotope records in speleothem carbonate, research in sedimentary
petrology, and studies in the hydrological and soil sciences. The facility will
support undergraduate and graduate student research and will be used to foster
environmental research collaborations between Kansas faculty and students and
faculty and students at nearby Haskell Indian Nation
University.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
