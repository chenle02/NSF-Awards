ABSTRACT

In the early nineties, S. T. Yau conjectured that the existence of Kaehler
metrics with constant scalar curvature is related to the stability of the
underlying polarized manifold. In recent years, striking progress has been made
in this direction. In 1997, G. Tian proved that any Kaehler-Einstein manifold
with positive scalar curvature is K-Stable. In 2001, S. K. Donaldson proved that
an algebraic manifold with discrete automorphism group and Kaehler metric of
constant scalar curvature is Chow stable. Very recently, in a joint work with G.
Tian, the proposer proved that the existence of Kaehler metrics of constant
scalar curvature implies Semi-K Stability of the K energy with respect to the
given cohomology class. Inspired by these results, the proposer wants to study a
network of problems centered around the existence of extremal Kaehler metrics
(which includes constant scalar curvature metric as a special case), stability
of polarized Kaehler manifold, and other related problems. The main ideas of
solving these problems consist of improving regularity for geodesics in the
space of Kaehler metrics in the sense of T. Mabuchi, of understanding the long-
time existence of the Calabiflow, and of the convergence of the Kaehler-Ricci
flow. These ideas are related to different mathematical fields but the proposer
believes that they are all very promising to solve the Conjecture of Yau (in
particular to solve the problem of the existence of Kaehler-Einstein metrics on
Fano manifold). The proposer is going to work on the problems through these
ideas.

The problem of the existence of Kaehler metrics of constant scalar curvature,
being the key problem in differential geometry, has strong impact to other
fields of sciences like physics. According to Albert Einstein, the theory of
gravity can be interpreted as the geometry of space-time. Thus the research in
differential geometry is crucially important in physics and cosmology. The
research proposed also has impact in string theory, which is the theory of
unifying all four basic forces of the Nature. The proposer's work, together with
the works of other mathematicians and physicists, helps in understanding our
Universe.
