The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
Transfer (STTR) Phase I project proposes a deep learning approach to predictive
maintenance of industrial and agricultural equipment. High productivity demands
and just-in-time approaches to manufacturing mean that equipment downtime can be
extremely expensive; Research shows that the average manufacturer deals with 800
hours of downtime per year. Further, an increasing quantity of aging equipment
and a maintenance workforce that is largely reaching retirement age have led to
a situation where maintenance staff often lack the knowledge, training, and/or
manpower to address a growing pool of aging assets. This project intends to
bring forward a novel suite of intuitive and explainable technologies that can
help reduce or eliminate unexpected downtime and help digitally capture and
transfer expert knowledge from the retiring workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project proposes a novel, deep
learning approach to machinery prognostics. Many existing deep learning
approaches focus on the most likely failure scenarios given a set of training
data. However, monitored equipment may not exbibit behavior covered in that
training set, leading to low-confidence predictions. This approach will not only
predict the remaining useful life of a machine component, but it will also
quantify the uncertainty of a prediction through an ensemble of models and a
temporal fusion of predictions. As a result, maintenance decisions can be made
from a risk-based perspective, eliminating unnecessary maintenance stemming from
low-confidence predictions. Furthermore, many existing deep learning approaches
lack the ability to intuitively explain their predictions to human users. In
critical applications where bad predictions have serious consequences,
maintenance personnel must understand and trust an artificially intelligent
predictive maintenance partner. The proposed solution produces an intuitive
visual explanation for the modelâ€™s prediction by highlighting and animating the
segments of a raw data signal that are contributing most significantly to the
prediction. This will allow trained personnel to quickly make optimal
maintenance decisions by fusing data-driven insights with their existing domain
expertise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
