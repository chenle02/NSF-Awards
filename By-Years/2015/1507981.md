With this award, the Environmental Chemical Sciences Program of the Division of
Chemistry is funding Professor Huichun J. Zhang of Temple University to examine
the nitrogen-oxygen single bond (N-O) as a reducible functional group toward
reductive transformations under environmental conditions. The introduction of
N-O containing contaminants (NOCs) into aquatic environments is an important
emerging water issue. This project aims to develop accurate environmental risk
assessment of NOCs and to develop advanced technologies to effectively treat
NOCs contaminated water and sites. The findings are expected to help guide the
chemical industry to design more environmentally-friendly chemical products. The
project is expected to broaden participation from underrepresented minorities
and women in environmental chemistry/engineering and to provide training for
future scientists and engineers in this cross-disciplinary
area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on examining reduction kinetics
and mechanisms of a diverse range of NOCs by soluble Fe(II) species through a
combination of experimental and theoretical approaches. Advanced experimental
approaches, including kinetic, electrochemical cell, isotopic, spectroscopic and
chromatographic approaches, are to be conducted to elucidate key elementary
steps in NOC reductions, such as protonation, complexation, electron transfer
and N-O bond cleavage. The most likely rate-limiting step of each subset of NOCs
is to be identified by characterizing all of the stationary points in the
relevant elementary steps along the reaction pathway. Molecular descriptors are
being computed to develop quantitative structure-activity relationships so as to
provide the community with quantifiable and experimentally grounded numbers that
pertain to the susceptibility of N-O bonds to reductive cleavage in the
environment.
