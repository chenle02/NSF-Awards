This project is supporting two cohorts of outstanding mathematics and science
teachers in the San Francisco Bay Area to become Master Teachers. The carefully
organized structure of professional and leadership development activities is
supporting a total of 30 teachers though a variety of experiences, including
becoming a Teacher-in-Residence at UC Berkeley where the Master Teacher Fellows
can take advanced courses in their discipline and engage in research on campus
in mathematics, science or education. The project is building on the growing
program that Cal Teach has created for teacher education of science, engineering
and mathematics students at Berkeley, and on the strong partnerships that have
been established with local school districts and with local research
institutions. The Math for America-Berkeley (MfA-Berkeley) Program, along with
Cal Teach, engages faculty from the STEM content areas as well as from the
Graduate School of Education. This interdisciplinary approach to teacher
preparation and professional support has been shown to be critical in the
context of training secondary mathematics and science teachers for our nation's
urban schools, where high quality teachers are severely lacking. The
professional development, research, educational and leadership opportunities
available within the program provide a unique avenue to develop a cadre of true
Master Teachers who can lead the next generation of learning in the critical
areas of mathematics and science.

The program has a focus on teaching in urban schools that are often under-
served, and reinforces the beliefs that every student has (1) the capacity to
learn both introductory and advanced mathematics and science, (2) the right to a
quality education that supports their learning, and (3) the need for literacy in
mathematics, science and technology so that they have access to every
opportunity that society can provide.
