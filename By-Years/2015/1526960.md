This project develops wearable and functional hand orthoses for stroke
survivors, to act as both assistive and training devices. For daily living, such
a device could provide assistance with manipulation tasks, increasing the sense
of control and the ability to live independently. For rehabilitation, a wearable
orthosis could enable functional training on real-world manipulation tasks,
extend training beyond the small number of sessions performed in a clinical
setting, and provide distributed training during the course of daily activities
rather than block training in designated therapeutic sessions. From a healthcare
perspective, this work will enable a shift from devices used in a clinic under
medical supervision towards unobtrusive functional orthoses used during daily
life. From an engineering perspective, it will advance towards a new class of
active wearable systems, controllable by natural movement or similarly intuitive
interfaces. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New approaches will be required to build a
device that is simultaneously dexterous (for complex manipulation), non-
intrusive (for daily living) and intuitive to control. To achieve this, we
investigate ways to assist joint movement using a network of artificial tendons
routed on the surface of the hand and arm, without adding large structural
components such as an exoskeleton. A key tenet of our approach is that a hand
orthosis can provide meaningful assistance with daily manipulation tasks even
when using a number of actuators far smaller than the number of joints in the
hand. We will also investigate multiple control methods, including unimanual
operation (where endogenous movement of the paretic limb is detected and
enhanced) and bilateral operation (where movement of the less affected limb is
used to generate control signals for the paretic one).
