9457758 Aydil Chemically reactive gas plasma, used in microelectronics
processing, will be studied. The objective of this research is to understand how
the process conditions dictate the properties of the plasmas, the transport
phenomena and gas phase and surface kinetics, which in turn affect the
properties of the materials processed. The research is organized along two
lines: developing and improving new experimental plasma and surface diagnostic
techniques that give fundamental information on the surface and gas phase
chemistry, and using these techniques to study and manipulate processing
conditions and engineering designs in order to produce materials with desired
properties in applications such as plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition.
