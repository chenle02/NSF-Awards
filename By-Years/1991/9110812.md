The architecture of future teraflop computers is under intense study in
universities, government and industrial laboratories. The objective of this
research is to model parallel applications on some of the recently available
commercial architectures. The goal is to develop performance modeling methods
that will scale to future machines. Performance evaluation of parallel computer
systems and applications running on these systems is a complex task because of
the large number of execution parameters involved. This project investigates the
use of robust modeling techniques based on neural networks to analyze the data
and predict performance on current as well as future machines. This analysis
will also be useful in providing information about the relevant measurements to
be stored for useful prediction.
