This award is to continue the activities of the Marine Aspects of Earth System
History (MESH) Office at the University of Southern California. Lowell Stott
will manage the office and will chair the Steering Committee. The primary
activities of the office will be travel and logistical support for the
activities of the MESH Steering Committee and MESH office; support for the
development and coordination of activities related topical workshops and
theoretical institutes that will advance MESH-related research, and support for
U. S. participation and representation in the IGBP-PAGES International Marine
Global Change Studies (IMAGES) program. The development and coordination of
activities related topical workshops and theoretical institutes that will
advance MESH-related research is a critical component of this project. The MESH
office will participate in the coordination of these workshops. The workshops
and institutes will broadly impact the entire MESH community in the U.S. The
MESH office will make every effort to include students and young scientists in
these activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
