The structure and dynamics of liquid crystal phases will be investigated
experimentally using optical microscopy, light scattering, and x-ray scattering
techniques. Systems to be studied will include freely suspended planar films and
strands and ultrathin smectic preparations between solid substrates. This
research will be directed toward elucidating the effects of surfaces and
reduced-dimensionality on liquid crystal fluctuations, ordering, and phase
transitions.
