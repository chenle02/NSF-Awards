ABSTRACT:

The PI continues her current research in algebraic combinatorics, focusing on
topological and algebraic aspects of partially ordered sets and graph complexes.
This involves further development of powerful tools such as shellability and
fiber theorems. Such tools have been used and enhanced by the PI and her
collaborators for the purpose of studying some important examples which include
partially ordered sets related to the partition lattice and graph complexes
related to the matching complex. The study of topological aspects of partially
ordered sets grew out of the famous 1964 paper of Rota on the Moebius function
of a partially ordered set. It provides a deep and fundamental link between
combinatorics and other branches of mathematics such as topology, algebra and
geometry. It also has applications in computer science. Research in complexity
theory, knot theory, group theory and discrete geometry has inspired interest in
studying the topology of graph complexes, a subject closely related to the
topology of partially ordered sets.

This research is in the general area of combinatorics. One of the goals of
combinatorics is to find efficient methods for arranging, enumerating and
manipulating discrete collections of objects. The behavior of discrete systems
is extremely important to modern communications and computer systems. For
example, the design of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone
systems, and the design of algorithms in computer science deal with discrete
sets of objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research.
