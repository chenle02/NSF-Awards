The objective of this research program is to improve the removal of chromate
ions from industrial cooling water and waste water by selecting better chromate-
removing (ion-exchange) agents and by developing models that describe the time-
dependence of chromate removal. This is an important problem from an industrial
standpoint since chromate is an excellent choice as a corrosion inhibitor but
cannot be used unless it can be removed subsequently to avoid pollution.
