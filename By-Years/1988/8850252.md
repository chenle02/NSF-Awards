The NSF-Students In The Sea program will offer 25 high achievers a two- week
exposure to the real world of marine science by working with scientists. These
high school students will participate in the Discovery Hall summer program
focused on the world of oceans. Scientist will take students aboard the 70'
research vessel A. E. Verrill where they will collect oceanographic, geologic,
and biologic data. Ten noted scientists will work directly with the students in
the field and laboratory. The excitement of learning about the sea at the sea
coupled with the exposure of these students to the highly talented men and
women, hopefully will stimulate their career goals toward the sciences.
