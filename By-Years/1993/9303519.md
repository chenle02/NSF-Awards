This is a proposal to characterize stratigraphic heterogeneities and facies
architecture in Pleistocene Lake Bonneville deposits of Utah, in order to better
understand the control of depositional facies and fabrics in ground water flow
through Lake Bonneville and similar older deposits. The established lake
stratigraphy of the climatically sensitive basin provides a framework for
sedimentologic study. The objective of this study are to: 1. Examine and
document facies architecture in select field localities through analysis of
geometries, hierarchical stacking, sedimentary structures, and depositional
fabrics. 2. Compare depositional fabrics of facies on a petrologic and textural
scale, with measurements of porosity and permeability to determine the
stratigraphic heterogeneities. 3. Quantify sedimentary properties, architecture
and stratigraphic heterogeneities with 2-dimensional geostatistical modeling
(e.g. semivariograms). This study is significant in that it will greatly
contribute to understanding problems of surface contamination in Lake Bonneville
sediments and will provide analogues for evaluating flow units (or hydrogeologic
facies) in similar, older basin-fill aquifer facies.
