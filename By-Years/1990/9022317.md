This award is made in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
Program in support of the research of Craig L. Hill at Emory University. The
award provides continued support for Hill's research on hydrocarbon oxidation
catalyzed by transition metal polyoxometallates. Both thermal and photochemical
systems will be studied. The work will address fundamental problems in the
activation and transfer of oxygen from metal centers to C-H bonds and other
areas of relevance to both industrial and biological systems. The objectives of
the research are: (1) to establish the factors which control product
selectivity, catalyst stability, and key mechanistic features in sustained oxo
transfer to alkanes catalyzed by homogeneous, very active and stable,
oxidatively-resistant inorganic metalloporphyrin analogues (IMAs), (2) to
develop chiral IMAs that will catalyze asymmetric hydroxylation of alkanes, (3)
to delineate the factors that affect the quantum yields of competing
polyoxometallate excited state decay processes and the selectivities and
turnover rates in hydrocarbon photooxidation, (4) to convert unactivated C-H
bonds into carbonium ions for useful reactions including the catalytic
production of monofluorinated hydrocarbons directly from hydrocarbons and
fluoride ion, and (5) to rigorously establish the structural, spectroscopic and
photochemical properties of polyperoxo(oxo)tungstates that have potential for
use as negative inorganic photoresists for microlithography and as selective
oxidants for olefins.
