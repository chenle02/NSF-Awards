The HerpNET community project will enable knowledge networking of biodiversity
information about the world's amphibians and reptiles for science and society.
The information store is enormous, acquired during 300 years of biological
exploration of the earth. Access to and use of these data are fundamental if we
are to understand our biological diversity and its functional role in
environmental system. Amphibians are especially sensitive indicators of
environmental quality and change. The project is designed to create a network of
distributed herpetological databases that builds on proven technologies and
scales well. It is also designed to be economical to implement and easily
accessible. HerpNET will help to form the basis on which a largely descriptive
science can become a predictive one. It will provide global access and sharing
of data, data standards, installation and management software and documentation.
