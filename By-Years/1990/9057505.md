With a Presidential Young Investigator award from the National Science
Foundation, Dr. Mayfair Yang of the University of California-Santa Barbara, will
continue her studies of informal exchanges in mainland Chinese society. Through
her analysis of gift exchange and the exchange of favors, she is revealing the
actual workings of Chinese society, as distinct from the normative rules
published and supported by the state bureaucracy. Dr. Yang will conduct
ethnographic research in a small town in China and conduct participant
observation on the variety of non- state organizations, both economic and non-
economic, spawned by the economic reforms of the 1980's. She will analyze their
organization, leadership structure, membership and activities, relation with the
state, and the role of women. This research is important because these informal
exchanges are the "grease" that allows the sticky bureaucratic machinery of
communist societies to function in the actual world, as distinct from the paper
world of state planners. In-depth ethnographic studies such as Dr. Yang's will
help us understand the actual way such societies function, and so will help us
deal successfully with them.
