Regions of the United States have been shown to have their own distinct language
dialects. However, recent research in the region around the Great Lakes has
shown movement away from a regionally specific accent, with new linguistic norms
emerging. In linguistics, the processes through which regionalized sound changes
alter course requires an understanding of historical changes in places where
such changes occur, as well as an examination of individual speakers’ awareness,
evaluations, and ideologies about the features undergoing change. This study
engages in a detailed analysis of how sociohistorical processes, relating to
migration histories and current and past racial dynamics, affect the spread of
language change in Chicago, a major urban center in this region. In addition to
advancing the understanding of language, culture, and history in this important
region of the U.S. and advancing theories regarding language change, this
project provides opportunities to train underrepresented students in conducting
scientific research and produces a publicly-available database of oral histories
highlighting important community issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators
will collect ethnographic interviews from lifelong community members in three
neighborhoods of Chicago, perform acoustic analyses of the data, and
experimentally assess social evaluations of specific place-linked linguistic
features through a series of perception experiments. These data and analyses
will provide insight into the current status of sound change reversals in
Chicago and, more generally, how and why sound changes propagate across and
within communities. The outcomes of this work speak directly to current debates
about the nature of sound change and the current and future trajectory of
American English. The project’s creation of a Chicago speech corpus, accessible
to other scholars for broader analyses, will also lead to long term advances in
sociolinguistic research in the U.S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
