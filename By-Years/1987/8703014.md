Dr. Freed plans to continue and expand a program of research involving studies
of dynamical molecular processes of spin probes and free radicals in fluids, on
surfaces, and related systems. A variety of experimental ESR relaxation
techniques are to be employed, and the necessary theoretical frameworks for
understanding these experiemnts are also to be developed and extended. Specific
projects include the following: (1) the further application of new field-swept
two-dimensional electron-spin-echo techniques in the study of molecular
dynamics; (2) the further development of new Fourier Transform techniques for
two-dimensional-ESR studies; (3) studies of rotational molecular dynamics in
normal and viscous liquids by ESR; (4) studies of molecular dynamics on
surfaces; (5) the application of high-field far-infrared ESR techniques in the
study of molecular dynamics. The close coupling between theory and experiment
represents an important characteristic of Dr. Freed's research. The development
of new techniques is expected to open new areas of investigation in his field.
His investigations will lead to more understanding of the physics of liquids and
of molecular motions on surfaces.
