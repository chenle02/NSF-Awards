This project involves synthesis of new AB and ABA block copolymers to be used in
physicochemical and mechanical studies on solution and gels of these copolymers.
The block copolymers typically will have large differences in cohesive energy
density of the constituent blocks. Typical examples are block copolymers of
polystyrene (PS), polybutadiene (PBD), polyisopurene (PI) or
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), in combination with polyethylene oxide (PEO) or
polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). For each combination of blocks, the AB, ABA and
BAB block copolymers will be prepared by sequential anionic copolymerization of
two types of monomers followed by coupling for the case of the triblock
copolymers. Alternative methods involving bifunctional initiators will also be
used. For several of these block copolymers will be characterized by proton and
carbon 13 NMR, size exclusion chromatography, and/or light-scattering osmometry,
viscometry and differential scanning calorimetry. This project is being funded
simultaneously with a project at Cornell where a group directed by Professor
Claude Cohen will collaborate with this group at the University of Southern
California (USC) . USC will synthesize new AB and ABA block copolymer performed
at Cornell. The overall goal of the two joint projects is to identify block
copolymers and processing conditions with the potential for a new generation of
high performance membranes for chemical processing, Biotechnology, Biomedical
Cornell involves the study of the physical properties of new diblock and
triblock copolymers in dilute and semi-dilute solutions and their casting as
membranes.
