Fifteen Macintosh Quadra workstations and one Dec file server will provide, in a
newly constructed mathematics and computer center, a laboratory/classroom for
integrating computing and Mathematica into the calculus curriculum. The Calculus
Laboratory will allow each section of calculus to use an extensive amount of
laboratory material that has been developed recently at Carleton and elsewhere.
The goal of this project is to engage all calculus students in hands-on,
investigative, and experiential learning; to enhance a concepts-oriented
approach to calculus; and to provide the students with a powerful symbolic,
graphical, and numerical tool for understanding and applying calculus.
