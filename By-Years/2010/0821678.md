The Petascale Active Data Store (PADS) will be a petabyte (1015-byte)-scale
online storage server capable of sustained multi-gigabyte/s I/O performance,
tightly integrated with a 9 teraflop/s computing resource and multi-gigabit/s
local and wide area networks. Its hardware and associated software will enable
the reliable storage of, access to, and analysis of massive datasets by both
local users and the national scientific community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PADS
design results from a study of the storage and analysis requirements of
participating groups in astrophysics and astronomy, computer science, economics,
evolutionary and organismal biology, geosciences, high-energy physics,
linguistics, materials science, neuroscience, psychology, and sociology. For
these groups, PADS represents a significant opportunity to look at their data in
new ways, enabling new scientific insights. The infrastructure also will
encourage new collaborations across disciplines. PADS is also a vehicle for
computer science research into active data store systems, and will provide rich
data on which to investigate new techniques. Results will be made available as
open source software.&lt;br/&gt;
