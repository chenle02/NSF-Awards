EAR-0219293&lt;br/&gt;Sean M. Buckley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Satellite
radar interferometry (InSAR) provides earth-surface deformation measurements at
finer resolution and greater spatial coverage than any other traditional
geodetic technique and has quickly developed into a critical tool for
measurement of deformation associated with natural and anthropogenic hazards.
The routine production of InSAR measurements is a consequence of the general
availability of InSAR processing software with each package producing the same
general final product - the differential interferogram. Although recent InSAR
research has considered the ensemble use of tens of interferograms to reveal
complex and subtle surface deformation, a post-processing software package is
not readily available to the InSAR geoscience community. This project involves
the research and development of an InSAR post-processing software toolkit
employing three general strategies missing from current InSAR software:
mosaicking of multiple satellite tracks for complete surface displacement
measurement, interferogram stacking for noise reduction, and InSAR time-series
analysis for measurement of continuous, non-uniform deformation. The software is
modular, coded in C and Fortran, called from a series of Unix-based shell
scripts and developed generally independent of the InSAR software used to
generate the differential interferograms. Where processor-specific information
is required, the software is integrated with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
ROI_PAC software package. Distribution of the post-processing toolkit is through
