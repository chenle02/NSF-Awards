Computational geometry is an important area of computer science, with
applications in graphics, 3D modeling, robotics and topology. Geometry Week
organizes the flagship conference for computational geometry with several
workshops, most notably the Young Researchers' Forum, where PhD students and
Postdoctoral researchers can present their work. The project expects to support
the equivalent of 10 full support participants and 5 half support participants.
The proposal also aims to increase the representation of under-represented
groups at the meeting.

The travel support provided in this project will help bring young researchers in
the field of computational geometry together and create synergies and idea
exchanges to solve problems and open up new areas for study. Past versions of
this effort have been productive in generating several high-impact research
papers in addition to encouraging and mentoring young researchers.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
