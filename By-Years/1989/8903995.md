Experimental studies will be done to determine Fe-Mg fractionation between
garnet and orthopyroxene at selected pressure and temperature conditions. The
results will tightly constrain (a) the determination of temperatures of
formation of rocks containing these minerals (b) the determination of depth of
formation, and c) their thermodynamic data.
