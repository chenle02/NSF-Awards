Molecular surfaces are paramount to the stability and solubility of
macromolecules, such as proteins, DNAs and RNAs, because their features
determine how other molecules interact with them to produce the desired
function. Important applications of molecular surfaces include protein folding,
protein-protein interfaces, protein-membrane interaction, DNA binding and
bending, macromolecular docking, enzyme catalysis, solvation energy and
molecular dynamics. Despite extensive effort in the past three decades, the
generation and analysis of molecular surfaces remain a bottleneck in the
structure prediction of biomolecules. To overcome this difficulty, investigators
introduce a partial differential equation (PDE) based approach of molecular
surface modeling. A set of curvature-controlled PDEs is designed for molecular
surface generation. Two new concepts, molecular multiresolution surfaces and
minimal molecular surfaces, which naturally arise in the proposed PDE modeling,
are introduced to the field of molecular biology. The proposed molecular
multiresolution surfaces provide a unified description of the van der Waals
surface, solvent accessible surface, and solvent excluded surface. The proposed
minimal molecular surface is also consistent with surface free energy
minimization. Numerical techniques, including PDE solution algorithms and
isosurface extraction schemes will be investigated. Numerical tests will be
carried out to validate the proposed ideas.

This project will lead to reliable methods in the structure prediction of
biomolecules. Structural information is particularly important for rational drug
design efforts specifically targeting proteins and/or membranes. It can be
expected that the availability of more protein/membrane structures will lead to
accelerated drug development efforts. The mathematical analysis proposed in this
project will also impact image processing, pattern recognition, and computer
vision. The results of the proposed project can be used for detailed control of
PDE surfaces according to industrial and scientific needs and objectives. In
particular, nonlinear diffusivities in the proposed equations can be used to
control the shape of a PDE surface locally according to its curvature. The
proposed research has a strong educational component. The project will support
the training of a Ph.D. student researcher in mathematical biology. PDE-based
molecular surface modeling is a suitable topic for graduate theses and
undergraduate projects. Project results will be incorporated in graduate courses
in biological modeling and simulation.
