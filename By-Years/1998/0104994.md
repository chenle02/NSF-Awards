Soil aggregates, groups of soil particles bound together into a larger
structural unit, may be important regulators of carbon and nitrogen cycling in
soil. Aggregates physically protect organic matter from microbial oxidation and
provide microsite habitats that may favor greenhouse gas production. Aggregate
structure is typically lost following soil disturbances such as tillage, and the
recovery of aggregate structure could help mitigate environmental problems
related to carbon and nitrogen cycling. Accelerated carbon and nitrogen
transformations in disturbed ecosystems contribute to a number of environmental
problems, including greenhouse gas accumulation, groundwater contamination, and
soil erosion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will examine soil aggregation
and its effects on carbon and nitrogen cycling in ten ecosystems on the same
soil series along a disturbance gradient. The systems range from intensively
managed, row crop agriculture to late successional forests. The research will
test hypotheses about the recovery and breakdown of aggregates on soil carbon
storage, trace gas fluxes, and microbial population structure.&lt;br/&gt;
