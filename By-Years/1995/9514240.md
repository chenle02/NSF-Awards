This is a group proposal for continued support of research in general relativity
and especially its interface with quantum physics. The program has several goals
which will be pursued by the PIs in various collaborations. First, they hope to
determine conclusively if quantum general relativity can exist as a
mathematically consistent theory non-perturbatively. Second, they wish to
introduce a number of new approximation methods to: i) gain physical insights
into the nature of quantum geometry that is to replace the continuum and explore
the effects that this replacement would have on quantum field theory; ii) study
the coupling of matter fields to gravity; iii) investigate whether the
requirements that the theory has a good ultra-violet behavior and a good semi-
classical limit have unanticipated consequences; and, iv) explore certain
aspects of the relation between string theory and quantum gravity. This program
will explore the most important open problems in theoretical physics, and is
likely to produce important insights and progress.
