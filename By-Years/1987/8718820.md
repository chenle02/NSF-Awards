This project deals with the processing of high transition- temperature
superconducting materials via the glass ceramic approach. The essential features
of this study will be to dissolve the 1-2-3 composition oxide in a suitable
glass composition, to form the samples in desired physical shapes and forms from
the glass, to nucleate the superconducting oxide from the glass, and to remove
the glassy matrix by chemical means.
