This Research award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
program supports fundamental studies by Professor David McMillin at Purdue
University on the development of new reporter probes that contain a transition
metal ion and emit light after electronic excitation. The investigations involve
different metal ions, including copper, ruthenium, and platinum, each of which
is incorporated into a specifically designed coordination sphere. The focus is
mainly on systems that offer open coordination sites where interactions occur in
the excited state and provide coupling to the local environment. The systematic
approach provides for the development of new, sterically accommodating systems
with programmable binding properties. From the educational perspective, the
Chemistry Department at Purdue University and the McMillin group have a strong
track record of training students from underrepresented groups. In terms of
chemistry, the new luminophores that result are applicable to many areas
including supramolecular chemistry, molecular sensing, and molecular devices
that utilize solar energy.
