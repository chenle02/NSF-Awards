Peter Anderson Subject: Re: IBN-9723438 ABSTRACT Voltage gated calcium channels
are a family of proteins that are essential for many cell functions, including
excitation, contraction, secretion, enzyme activity and gene regulation. They
exist in living cells as multisubunit complexes, usually consisting of an alpha1
subunit and associated beta, gamma and alpha2/delta subunits. The pore forming
alpha1 subunits, which are primarily responsible for many of the physiological
and pharmacological properties of the channels, can be divided on their basis of
their structure, into 6 separate classes. A full length calcium channel cDNA was
recently cloned from the jellyfish Cyanea capillata, by our lab. The deduced
amino acid sequence of this protein suggests that it is a member of the L-type
family of calcium channels, and this is supported by much of its physiology and
pharmacology. However, there are some significant deviations from the overall
properties of calcium channels, in particular the ionic selectivity of the
channel and its sensitivity to dihydropyridines, a class of calcium channel
blockers that are diagnostics of L-type calcium channels. The aim of the
proposed work is to complete the characterization of the jellyfish calcium
channel with a view to using the physiological and pharmacological abnormalities
of this channel as a means of identifying the structural correlates of L-type
channel function.
