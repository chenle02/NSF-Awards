This grant will provide partial support to defray the expenses associated with
the organization, documentation, publicity and conduct of the Symposium on
Advances and Trends in Computational Structural and Fluid Dynamics to be held at
the Sheraton National Hotel, Washington, D.C., October 17-19, 1988. The
objective of this symposium will be to facilitate the interchange of latest
research results and other information between researchers and engineers on
recent activities and developments in computational structural and fluid
dynamics with emphasis on innovative computational techniques as well as
interaction problems and techniques applicable to both areas. Papers accepted
for presentation at the conference will be included in a hardbound volume of
proceedings to be published before the meeting.
