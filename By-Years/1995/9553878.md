9553878 Anderson This 3-year project will develop and pilot test a middle-school
(6- 9) curriculum called GLACIER. It uses on-going research in the Antarctica to
deliver science content in the areas of geologic principles, glacial geology,
geomorphology, geography, meteorology, oceanography and environmental science.
Also included is the requisite mathematics and hands-on explorations. The
curriculum envisions students, assigned to the role of scientist, connecting to
on-line data bases and with Antarctic researchers to conduct their
investigations. GLACIER integrates with, and replaces portions of, the
traditional middle-school sciences curriculum. A comprehensive instructors'
guide, videointroduction, student portfolio and World Wide Web environment will
be produced.
