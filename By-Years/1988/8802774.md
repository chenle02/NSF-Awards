This research program is developing new approaches to the description and
solution of problems in few-body collisions which involve multiparticle
channels. The research includes a study of the properties of the multichannel
equations, incorporation of exchange symmetries and particle spins, and the
inclusion of the Coulomb interaction. The mathematical methods and numerical
approximations represent forefront contributions to collision theory which are
expected to be applicable to nuclear, atomic, and molecular physics in a variety
of contexts.
