Transport theory denotes the formulation and analysis of mathematical models of
the motion of particles at the microscopic level; the applications of these
models range from particle movement in the stellar atmosphere, gas dynamics, and
fusion reactors. Recently, these methods have been extended to vehicular traffic
flow, information transfer, and medical diagnostics. Travel support will be
provided to permit physicists, mathematicians, and engineers from the U.S. to
participate in the NinthInternational Conference on Transport Theory, to be held
in Italy in June 1985. The conference will encourage the exchange of information
across disciplinary and geographical boundaries. The Conference proceedings will
be published as a special issue of the journal, 'Transport Theory and
Statistical Physics.' Thus, transport theory is of both scientific and practical
importance to the U.S. The participation of U.S. scientists and engineers in
this conference is necessary to assure the success of the conference and to keep
U.S. researchers abreast of developments in foreign research centers in this
field.
