Dr. Nemiroff is awarded funds to support the CONCAM project at Michigan
Technological University. CONtinuous CAMeras (CONCAMs) are fisheye night sky web
cameras that provide astronomers at major national and international observing
sites with real-time images from which cloud cover, skyglow, and air
transparency can be immediately recovered. Within the past two years, a global
network of CONCAMs has begun to operate. The PI and his students will use the
funds to write the software that will make CONCAM images available in real-time,
and to design a pipeline that will eventually convert CONCAM images into real-
time data products such as continuously updated all-sky maps of skyglow and
transparency. These products will constitute a real service for observers and
robotic telescopes needing to make observing decisions in real time. Software
will also be designed for an automated bright transient search, potentially
leading to significant discoveries from the CONCAM data itself.
