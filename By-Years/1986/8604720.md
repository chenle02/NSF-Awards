Exploratory research on active structures will be initiated. An active structure
is defined to be one consisting of two types of load-resisting members: the
static or passive members and dynamic or active members. Their integration
produces a structure which is adaptive to changing environmental loads and
changing usages. The importance of undertaking this research rests on the belief
that active structures represent truly optimal structures. Furthermore, they
have the best potential of meeting increasingly stringent safety and performance
requirements. The research planned for the first year will be devoted to
establishing a foundation for structural optimization involving active member
characteristics and time-varying configuration. It is envisioned that active
structures will be fundamentally different from traditional structures in all
aspects: geometry, topology, and material utilization.
