The planned Workshop WOFE-09 is a sequel to WOFE-97 held January 1997 in Puerto
de La Cruz, Tenerife, Spain, WOFE-99 held May 31 - June 4 in Villard de Lans,
France, WOFE-2002 in St. Croix, Virgin Islands, and WOFE-04 held on December
18-22 in Aruba, and WOFE-07 held in Cozumel, Mexico

The objective of the workshop is to bring together leading scientists and
engineers who are at the frontiers of electronic device and circuit research and
development. Ultra low power digital electronics, microwave power circuits, and
optoelectronics have become the foundation of today's electronics technology.
Yet, they emerged from traditionally separated fields and are still largely
pursued by specialists trained in different areas.

The intellectual merit of the proposed workshop will be in facilitating of ideas
and information in cutting edge technologies at frontiers of research and in
reviewing the most recent and exciting breakthroughs in the nanoelectronics and
microelectronics fields, the underlying physical mechanisms that link recent and
expected advancements, and in exchanging views on future trends and directions,
the market pulls and the necessary policy and infrastructure changes.

The broader impacts will be in publishing Proceedings that will included best
paper presented at the WOFE-09, peer-reviewed and edited with a detailed
editorial Introduction and in promoting involving graduate students and younger
scientists. In the past, some of the previous WOFE Proceedings were listed as
Best Sellers by Word Scientific, Inc.
