This proposal requests funds to support the 32nd Annual Regional Developmental
Biology Conference to be held at the University of Virginia on April 26-29. Five
session topics, which concern important issues in modern developmental biology
have been selected; they include molecular, cellular, and tissue development in
both animals and plants. There will be two sessions on each topic, one in which
20 minute talks will be presented by junior faculty and one in which 10 minute
talks will be presented by 5-6 postdoctoral and graduate students. In addition
to the platform sessions, there will be poster sessions for both faculty and
students. Three nationally recognized speakers will each give one hour keynote
seminars. %%% In the past advanced graduate student sand postdoctoral fellows
have found this meeting to be a particularly valuable opportunity to present
their work in and informal atmosphere and to meet their peers and the faculty
from nearby institutions.
