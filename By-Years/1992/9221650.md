The Department of Chemistry at Columbia University is requesting funds for the
upgrade of their departmental computing facilities. The present departmental
machines are a Convex C210 and a Vax Cluster, both of which are now hopelessly
outdated with regard to computational power. The system proposed here will
increase CPU capabilities by more than an order of magnitude, thus facilitating
both theoretical and experimental research in computational chemistry. The
proposal is based on a workstation farm in operation at the Thomas J. Watson
Research Laboratories of IBM that has provided a stable computing environment
for the past 1.5 years. The most important feature of a farm is that it can
simultaneously satisfy departmental computing needs, serve as a development
environment for new theoretical codes and algorithms, provide state of the art
graphics and visualization facilities and support research in state of the art
applications of parallel processing for the entire department. Work which will
be supported with this new computing facility includes: 1) Molecular dynamics
and Monte Carlo algorithms for quantum and classical systems; 2) New algorithms
for quantum chemistry, quantum dynamics and molecular spectroscopy; 3) High
performance parallel free energy perturbation and conformational searching; 4)
Ultrafast molecular mechanics. %%% A workstation farm of fast, modern computer
workstations is a new way to satisfy the computing needs of chemistry
departments. Such a "computer farm" also serves as a development environment for
new theoretical codes and algorithms, provides state-of-the-art graphics and
visualization facilities and supports research in state-of-the-art applications
of parallel processing.
