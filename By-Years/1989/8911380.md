A better understanding of the control of feeding and drinking is of both
theoretical and practical importance. Disorders of ingestion such as obesity and
bulimia are major public-health problems. On the theoretical side, ingestive
behavior is a model case of motivated action. If we understood it, we would
better understand the more general problem: What is the brain doing as it
organizes, expresses, and terminates motivated behavior? The conventional view
has been that a bout of feeding ends when certain internal "satiety signals"
reach sufficient strength. Dr. Mook's research has shown that this view is
oversimplified, if not simply wrong. He finds the following: (1) An animal can
be satiated for one food and hungry for another at the same time. (2) Oral
stimuli (such as taste) determine which internal signals the animal will heed
and which it will ignore. (3) Conversely, internal signals act by modifying,
selectively, the way in which the animal responds to a given set of oral
stimuli. In short, "satiety" is not a fixed internal state or signal. The eating
of a meal is controlled by oral and internal factors in interaction with each
other (and with the animal's learning history, which provides yet a third term
in the interaction). In an animal model, the rat, Dr. Mook has developed
techniques (a) for permitting feeding to occur with no internal consequences
("sham feeding") and (b) for combining sham feeding with manipulation of the
animal's internal state prior to or during a meal that it eats voluntarily.
Using these techniques, he will manipulate oral signals, internal signals, and
learning history independently, and thus attempt to specify how oral, internal,
and experiential factors interact in controlling the eating of a meal. The
results will lay the groundwork for investigating how the interaction is
mediated by the brain.
