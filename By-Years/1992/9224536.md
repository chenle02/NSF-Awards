Professor Michael Klein is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research in the application of
computer simulations of classical and quantum phenomena in condensed molecular
systems. Constant pressure molecular dynamics will be used to characterize
disordered phases, and to study phase transitions in molecular systems including
fullerenes and sulfate crystals. Path-integral Monte Carlo will be used to
characterize and study quantum phenomena in solids, fluids and clusters, and
quantum simulations using the Car-Parnello approach will be used to probe the
electronic states of metal ammonia solutions as they pass through the metal-
insulator transition region. %%% Computer simulation of molecular systems is
providing many rich insights into chemical behavior at the molecular level. As
the computer algorithms and force field models continue to improve, it becomes
possible to study larger systems, and to gain useful insights regarding more and
more physical and chemical properties. Using a combination of simulation
techniques including molecular dynamics, quantum Monte Carlo, and Car-Paranello
theory, Klein is able to perform computer simulations on systems consisting of
large numbers of molecules such as crystalline substances, and metal ammonia
solutions. He is able to study a number of important chemical and physical
properties of interest in the design of new materials.
