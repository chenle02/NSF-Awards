SES-1155221&lt;br/&gt;Steven Brint&lt;br/&gt;University of California,
Riverside&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;U.S. Higher Education during
the Great Recession&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores how U.S. four-
year colleges and universities have adapted since 2007, the start of a period of
exceptional economic challenges. Specifically, the project collects and analyzes
institutional data on how institutions have responded to declines in educational
spending , complemented by survey data with presidents and provosts. The project
also serves a data infrastructure purposes, adding 42 for-profit organizations
to two pre-existing databases, reflecting the growing share of higher education
enrollments in the for-profit sector. Previous work by the project team led to
the construction of two databases that are widely used by higher education
researchers: the Institutional Data Archive on American Higher Education (IDA)
and the College Catalog Study (CCS) database. In the process, the project will
examine various organizational changes experienced by this sample of
institutions: changes in hierarchies and decision-making structures, curricular
and programmatic changes, as well as the priorities and outlooks of the
institutional leadership. A central hypothesis is that by academic year 2010-11,
interdisciplinary programs were growing most rapidly at financially struggling
institutions, as these institutions attempted to consolidate low-enrollment
departments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Demand for higher
education will likely continue to increase in the coming years. Findings from
this project may inform how social scientists and public policy analysts view
the (un)intended long-term consequences the recent economic contraction has had
for educational institutions and the sector at large. In particular, findings
from this study may help us understand the tension between economic trends and
key national policy goals - including research productivity, access and
graduation among students from under-represented groups, and human capital
development. Moreover, the data infrastructure provided by the IDA and CCS
datasets provides wide-ranging, detailed, and well-organized resources for
scholars. The databases are also an ideal source for training graduate students
who are interested in organizational and institutional change.
