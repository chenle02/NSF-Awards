The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectrometer, a computer workstation, and accessories for use in upper division
courses. The instrument is being used in number of new investigations in the
areas of kinetics, photochemistry, and the quantitative analysis of hydrocarbon
mixtures related to gasoline and associated products. Other applications include
study of equilibrium values for H-D exchange reactions on solid catalyst
surfaces.
