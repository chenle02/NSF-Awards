To carry on effective, natural, spoken dialogue,computers will need to do more
than recognize and interpret spoken words -- they will also need to be sensitive
to the prosodic information encoded in how the words are spoken. To investigate
the hypothesis that detecting and exploiting prosodic cues can help computers
guide spoken dialogue, this case study focuses on an educational task that
combines intrinsic national importance with compelling methodological
advantages: listening to a child read aloud, and providing spoken assistance.
The research focusses on improving four aspects of dialogue -- taking turns,
handling speech repairs, preventing dialogue breakdown, and modelling the
speaker. In the reading task, these aspects include detecting a number of
pedagogically significant events, such as when readers complete a passage,
correct themselves, or encounter difficulty in identifying a word or
comprehending a passage. The goal is to use prosodic cues to help detect these
events in order to make the dialogue between student and computer more effective
in achieving its educational objectives . Expected outcomes include improvements
in the automated reading assistant, the discovery of robust prosodic phenomena,
methods for detecting them, and principles for using them to achieve graceful,
effective spoken dialogue between humans and computers.
