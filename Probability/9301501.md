Several problems in probability theory are to be studied. The first three
concern models which are closely related to statistical physics, while the last
one deals with the more traditional topic of sums of independent, identically
distributed random variables. Particular problems include finding bounds on the
radius of a stochastic growth model, investigating some properties of random
resistor networks, and studying the asymptotic shape of first and last passage
percolation. This research will investigate some probabilistic models inspired
by statistical physics. These include critical phenomena in percolation theory,
diffusion limited aggregation , and first-passage percolation. In addition, the
investigator will also look at criteria for divergence of sums of independent,
identically distributed random variables from which some large summands have
been removed.
