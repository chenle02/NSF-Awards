9360523 Shtessel Self-propagating High-Temperature Synthesis (SHS) is a novel
process for synthesizing intermetallic, micro and nano phase composites. SHS
powders can be consolidated via plasma spraying to high densities to produce
high temperature structural or wear-resistant materials. SiC reinforced MoSi2
intermetallics are of particular commercial. Brittle MoSi2 can be toughened
through incorporation of dispersed phases. Uniform, micro/nano dispersions of
SiC, other carbides, nitrides or oxides, and other intermetallic/ceramic
matrices can also be produced by SHS. There is a growing need for materials
which can extend component lifetimes and improve reliability in the increasingly
severe high temperature environments of heat engines and materials processing
(e.g. burners for glass production). this research will evaluate the synergistic
SHS production and plasma spray consolidation of SiC reinforced Mosi2 composites
to understand process-structure relationships. Processing relationships
originating from SHS and plasma spray forming will be linked through
microstructures and phase contents. Research will establish SHS processing
conditions which produce powders optimized to yield dense plasma spray deposits.
Evaluations will also explore the limitations of SHS on a commercial scale.
Success in the Mosi2/SiC system will be extrapolated in Phase II and Phase III
to include Si3N and TiB2 reinforcements in MoSi2 matrices. Once processes are
established, Exotherm Corporation will develop commercial partnerships to
commercialize the SHS/Plasma Forming technology. ***
