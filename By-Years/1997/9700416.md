BENSON, 97-00416 The first part of Professor Benson's project involves
developing the theory of complexity and varieties for infinitely generated
modules for finite groups, and the corresponding theory for a large class of
infinite discrete groups. With his student Gnacadja, he is studying the idea of
a phantom map between represenations, an idea borrowed from topology. The second
part of the project involves the study of group actions via the theory of
varieties for modules, and the study of homotopy decompositions of classifying
spaces. The third part involves generalizations of his work with Jon Carlson on
Poincar&amp;eacute; duality for finite groups. This theory has already been
generalized to compact Lie groups and to virtual duality groups in joint work
with John Greenlees, and they are currently working on the generalization to
p-adic analytic groups, based on the work of Lazard for the torsion free case.
The fourth part involves explicit computer calculations of projective
resolutions and group cohomology using John Cannon's MAGMA program.
Representation theory is the study of how to represent abstract groups as groups
of matrices. Cohomology studies how matrix representations glue together.
Professor Benson's research centers around the cohomology and representation
theory of finite, infinite and compact Lie groups, the algebraic topology of
classifying spaces, and invariant theory for finite groups. This subject is on
the borderline between algebra and topology, which seems to be a very fruitful
area of interaction within pure mathematics.
