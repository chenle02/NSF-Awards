Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many problems societies face are increasingly
regional to global in scope. Problems such as droughts, floods, and disease in
one part of the world can have far reaching health and economic impacts on other
regions. Understanding the relationship and linkages require an understanding of
global scale biological processes and dynamics. International networks and
"Observatories" have been emerging that could play a significant role in
providing valuable data and expertise to develop this understanding. This
workshop will bring together Observatory and Network scientists with the
overarching goal of developing a road-map to explore a network-of-networks and
observatory-of-observatories approach to answer regional to global ecological
questions. The workshop will explore: i) what are the current ecological
theories and grand challenge questions that span continents in order to provide
a broader ecological understanding and prognostic capability to inform science
and society; ii) how can Observatories/Networks be used to address among
continent (global) grand challenges, iii) what attributes can be integrated
among Observatories/Networks to foster a broader understanding; and iv) which
are the near term strategic targets that should be followed by the scientific
community. The workshop will identify related societal needs and benefits and
how these networks/observatories can contribute data, knowledge and forecasts.
The workshop will focus on ecological contribution of Observatories/Networks to
societal benefits areas including: agriculture, biodiversity, climate,
ecosystems, water, and weather.
