9512857 Collins This award supports a three-year cooperative research project
between George Collins, Colorado State University and Professor Shiro Sakai,
Tokushima University. The investigators will explore the feasibility of
fabricating light emitting diodes operating in the blue/UV spectral region using
a new material, GaPN, grown by a new technique. They propose a study of GaPN
because the suitability of AlGaN/InGaN devices for lasers is in some doubt due
to the weak bond between In and N which causes quick device degradation at
temperatures higher than 80 degrees Centigrade and at currents above 100 A/cm
squared, both of which are required for injection lasers. Tokushima University
is a world leader in GaN material growth, having already achieved over 100
micron thick high quality and well characterized GaN films on sapphire
substrates. Dr. Sakai's group will be introduced to a new materials growth
technique being pioneered at Colorado State University and as yet untried in the
III-V Nitride arena. Hence, the investigators will exchange and transfer
scientific knowledge through this international collaboration. ***
