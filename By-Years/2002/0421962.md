This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to develop a pilot-
scale Centrifugal Bioreactor (CBR) for the continuous cultivation of hybridoma
cells. &lt;br/&gt;The commercial application of this project will be in the
biopharmaceutical industry for cell culture production of therapeutic agents. It
is expected that the technology will reduce the scale and capital costs of
commercial animal cell culture equipment and improve the quality and consistency
of the secreted protein product. &lt;br/&gt;
