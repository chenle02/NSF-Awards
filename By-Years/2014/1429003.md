University of Northern Colorado (UNC) requests $139,948 over 36 months for the
acquisition of an HPC Cluster for Multidisciplinary Research and Education.
Research projects include biology, computer science, mathematics, and
atmospheric sciences. &lt;br/&gt;The proposed UNC HPC cluster is available to
all of UNC, including training courses for new users. It is expected that some
courses (specifically bioscience and computer science) will utilize the cluster.
Outreach activities include the UNC 'Frontiers of Science Institute' which is a
summer program for Colorado high school students in STEM disciplines. The PIs
plan on implementing a program with the UNC Math and Science Teachers Institute
to train K-12 teacher in advanced topics.
