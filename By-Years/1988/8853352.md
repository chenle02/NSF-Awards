The aim of this project is to introduce integrated manufacturing into the upper
level undergraduate curriculum through development of a laboratory. Generally,
the technical area deals primarily with computer usage in the integrated
manufacturing environment: computer simulation, human-computer interaction, and
knowledge- based computer-aided engineering. Suitable computer work stations are
essential. These stations must support system simulation, animated simulation,
user interface development, expert systems, CAD, and AM, all with adequate
speed, storage, and graphics. The significance of this project is twofold.
First, results of recent faculty and graduate student research will be
transferred to the undergraduate upper level thereby enhancing the curriculum.
Second, the mechanisms for this transfer will be available for study; to help
develop the pedagogical means for facilitating inter-level transfer in other
topical areas.
