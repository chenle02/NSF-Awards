This award supports organization of the 2021 Workshop on Plasma Science Facility
Networks planned to be held in November, 2021 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The
workshop will bring together representatives of the plasma science and
scientifically related communities to address the following questions:
&lt;br/&gt;(1) What is required to establish and operate a network of plasma
science user facilities? What facilities or instrumentation can be leveraged,
expanded or upgraded? &lt;br/&gt;(2) What is the estimated user base for the
proposed facilities? Will expansions or upgrades to existing facilities increase
the user base or expand to new plasma science or other sub-fields?
&lt;br/&gt;(3) What are the best practices for managing transparent and
effective operation of user facility networks for plasma science? &lt;br/&gt;(4)
How can networks broaden access to user facilities, specifically to Minority
Serving Institutions and Primarily Undergraduate Institutions?&lt;br/&gt;The
workshop participants will be identified and will begin to prepare structured
responses to the above questions well ahead of the workshop meeting dates via
virtual meetings or townhalls. The workshop presentations will be webcast with
the opportunity for online commentary and questions and answers with offsite
participants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop is being held in response to
recommendations made by the National Academies Plasma 2020 Decadal Survey and
other recent community reports which have advocated for inter-agency and inter-
program collaboration on networks of plasma science facilities in order to
leverage and maximize their scientific and programmatic impact. The goal of the
workshop is to discuss the opportunities and the challenges associated with
establishing and operating networks of plasma science user facilities across the
spectrum of plasma science sub-fields. The workshop will produce a report
addressing the above questions and will aim to publish the report or some
appropriately modified version in a scientific
journal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
