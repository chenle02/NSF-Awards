&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal number: 0106760&lt;br/&gt;PI: Stephen
Kosslyn&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Harvard University &lt;br/&gt;Title: Cognitive
Styles and Individual Differences in Imagery &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award
Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a study of cognitive styles
(such as the visualizer-verbalizer distinction) people (both students and
professionals) use in thinking through and learning science and mathematics
(specifically in the topic area of kinematics). The project has two goals: (1)
To investigate and revise the traditional verbalizer-visualizer cognitive style
dimension, including the possibility that more than these two basic styles exist
(such as object and spatial visual styles). This approach is based on findings
and methods from cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience to
conceptualize the nature of cognitive style and its neural underpinnings. (2) To
examine the instructional implications of these cognitive styles and their
relevance to educational practice. The research will proceed along three lines:
behavioral studies, classroom-based studies, and functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI). Based on evidence from this research, the investigators will
develop theoretically-based guidelines for teaching students to process
visually/spatially and materials which build on the specific strengths of each
type of thinker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
