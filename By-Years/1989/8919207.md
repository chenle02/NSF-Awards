In this project supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program, Kenneth N. Raymond of the University of California at
Berkeley will synthesize various ligands designed to specifically bind with oxo-
metal cations, and in particular, uranyl and vanadyl. This work has relevance to
the nuclear power industry, mining technology and environ- mental monitoring and
control. The strategy to be employed is based on the premise that oxo- metal
cations do not fit the "billiard ball" model for other cations, and to
effectively encapsulate the uranyl and vanadyl cations, the ligand design will
incorporate nitrogen-hydrogen groups which are constrained in position to
hydrogen bond to the oxo-group(s) of the cation(s). Characterization of the
resultant complexes will include structure determination by x-ray diffraction,
stability constant determination, electro- chemical studies in solution and
various spectroscopic analyses.
