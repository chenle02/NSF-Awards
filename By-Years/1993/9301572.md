9301572 Boyer A series of laboratory experiments will be conducted in a rotating
tank to study the interaction between tidal currents and the bathymetry in the
vicinity of continental shelf breaks. The full range of parameters influencing
the rectification of the coastal currents will be explored by changing the shelf
break geometry, the rotation rate and the amplitude and angle of the time-
dependent currents impinging on the shelf break. Both laminar and turbulent flow
regimes will be investigated. ***
