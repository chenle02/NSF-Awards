The research described in this proposal will examine the spatial and temporal
structure of ensemble encoded information within the hippocampus of the rat.
Data from these experiments will provide information essential to hypotheses
concerning the nature of associative processing within this region. To evaluate
these hypotheses, a computational model of the CA3-CA1 network will be developed
to explain observed experimental results. Modeling and data analysis work will
be done on high performance RISC workstations utilizing supercomputer resources
if necessary. Overall, this work represents an attempt to integrate systems
level neurophysiological data with predictions made by computational theories of
learning and memory through the use of computer modeling.
