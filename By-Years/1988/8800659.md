The possibilities of electronic and opto-electronic device design using the Sb-
containing alloys and heterostructures are largely unexplored. Part of the
problem arises from the fact that some of these compounds exhibit miscibility
gaps and spinodal decompositions in the phase diagrams. Molecular beam epitaxy
is generally a far- from-equilibrium growth technique and, therefore, allows the
low- temperature growth of these compounds within the miscibility gap. However,
the materials can have severe alloy clustering and we, therefore, propose to
study the growth of these alloys and heterostructures with in-situ and ex-situ
characterization techniques. In particular, we will initiate our program with
the growth of lattice-matched and strained GaSb, GaAlSb, and InAsSb, which will
be extremely critical materials for a host of electronic and optical devices.
Characterization of the layers will be done by temperature- dependent Hall,
photoluminescence, absorption DLTS and Shubnikov-de Haas measurements. These
should give a wealth of data regarding the fundamental materials
characteristics. In addition, in-situ RHEED oscillations studies will be done to
study the growth kinetics.
