Experimental studies will be conducted of photoionization, focussing on
electron correlation as reflected in the angular distribution of photoelectrons
and the alignment of the resulting ion. Measurements will be made on few
electron atoms, e.g. beryllium and magnesium. Photoelectron angular
distributions will be measured for the rare gases from neon to xenon. New
measurements will be begun at high energy to determine the influence of higher
multipoles on the angular distribution, the first such measurements using
synchrotron radiation as a source.
