9616880 Shklovskii This grant to a senior, distinguished theorist involves study
of interplay between disorder and coulomb interaction, a subject to which he has
made several seminal contributions. This grant consists of three related
projects, all involving low to moderate magnetic fields. In one, the PI proposes
to study the transport properties of a crystal of charged bubbles (clusters of
electrons) that has recently been proposed as a possible ground state of a layer
of electrons in low magnetic fields. In another project, there are plans to
study the crossover between the moderate magnetic field regime represented by
quantum Hall effect and the oscillations in resisitivity at low fields, the
Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations. Finally, there is a project to study quantum
version of the Coulomb gap, expected to be present during a metal-insulator
transition or near a transition between the two plateaus in the quantum Hall
effect regime. %%% This grant to a senior, distinguished, theoretical physicist
is to study the subtle and complex properties of a thin layer of electrons. This
PI is well known for his seminal contributions to this subject. In this grant,
the work will concentrate on the effects of impurities and interaction between
electron on electrical current in the presence of a moderate magnetic field. All
of the projects involve sophisticated state-of-the-art mathematical machinery
and includes further development of these mathematical tools.
