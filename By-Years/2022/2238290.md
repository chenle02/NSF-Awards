Hot mantle material rises up beneath Iceland from deep within Earth’s interior
forming a giant plume that pulses on timescales of millions of years. Plume
pulsing contributes to changes in the height of oceanic gateways that link
Greenland, Iceland, and Scotland. These gateways control the amount of cold,
deep water that has flowed from the Norwegian Sea to the Atlantic ocean over the
past few million years. This project will examine the history of plume activity
and ocean circulation in the North Atlantic region using data from rock cores
collected deep beneath the seabed. The outcomes of this project will have
immediate impact upon our knowledge of past ocean circulation and climate, which
is key to addressing the environmental challenges that society is confronting
today. Broader impacts include participation in workshops for local teachers,
delivery of K-12 activities, development of a first year Earth systems class,
and support for a post-doctoral scholar and graduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The flanks of Reykjanes Ridge south of Iceland
lie above one of Earth’s largest plume-ridge systems, and are covered by rapidly
accumulating contourite drift sediments that are sensitive to the oceanographic
conditions influenced by adjacent deep-water gateways. This configuration
provides an ideal natural laboratory to test hypotheses about the interactions
between mantle dynamics, paleoceanography, and climate. This project will
investigate the extent to which the Iceland mantle plume has controlled oceanic
gateways and deep-water circulation in the North Atlantic Ocean during Cenozoic
times. Samples and data collected at sites on Björn and Gardar contourite drifts
during International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 395 provide an
opportunity to significantly advance our understanding of the history of
sedimentation patterns and ocean circulation across the North Atlantic region.
Kinematic and paleobathymetric models for ocean basin evolution will be
integrated with sediment accumulation rate and current speed estimates from
recently drilled cores, as tools to decipher past ocean circulation patterns.
Considered together, the proposed models and observations will provide insights
into the coupled nature of Earth’s interior, ocean, and surface
domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
