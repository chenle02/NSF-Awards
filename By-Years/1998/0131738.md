&lt;br/&gt; This research would investigate Mexican American ethnicity in two
mid-size communities (Santa Maria, California and Garden City, Kansas). These
locations extend sociological research on ethnicity beyond the usual major
metropolitan areas. 120 interviews in the two communities will address questions
of the strength of ethnic identification and the relationships between
established residents and new immigrants. An organizational comparison of
Mexican American civil rights groups in the two communities will also help us
understand how ethnicity develops and is expressed. A principal research
question focuses on how the different patterns of immigration in the two
communities (continuous immigration in Santa Maria versus distinct phases in
Garden City) have affected ethnic identification and solidarity.&lt;br/&gt;
