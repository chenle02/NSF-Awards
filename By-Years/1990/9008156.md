One faculty member together with undergraduate students will collaborate with
others on research in elementary particle physics. Experiment E672 at Fermilab
has as its goal to test the predictions of the currently favored theory of the
strong interactions, quantum chromodynamics, by studying the reaction products
emerging from collisions between the basic constituents of matter, quarks and
gluons. In addition to particle physics, the project offers the opportunity to
establish a research program at a predominantly undergraduate institution and
enable students to gain experience in forefront research.
