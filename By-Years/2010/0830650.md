Collaborative Research:&lt;br/&gt;New Directions in Graph-Based Code
Design&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative
research focuses on the physical layer of digital communication system design ?
in particular on the analysis, design, and implementation of capacity-
approaching low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes for practical communication
environments. In the last ten years, the area of channel coding has undergone a
revolutionary change with the growing popularity of graph-based codes and
iterative decoding algorithms. These coding methods, which include both turbo
codes and LDPC codes, approach the limits of channel coding performance promised
by Shannon in his landmark 1948 paper. Currently, these codes are in the process
of replacing conventional error control techniques in numerous digital
communication and storage standards, including, among others, deep-space
communication, next-generation wireless transmission, last-mile cable
transmission, digital video broadcasting, and high-density digital magnetic
recording.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research addresses several issues related to
graph-based codes. In particular, it focuses on the analysis, design, and
implementation of LDPC convolutional codes, which have several advantages
compared to LDPC block codes, but have not received much attention from the
research community. Conventional convolutional codes, on the other hand, have
had a transformative effect in numerous practical communication environments,
and the same is likely to be true in the capacity-approaching world of LDPC
codes. The project emphasizes bridging the gap between advanced theoretical
research and realistic practical implementations. In particular, it is concerned
with adapting LDPC convolutional code designs to various industry standards that
require flexibility in both frame length and code rate and with developing VLSI
implementations of hardware decoders that can be tested under real operating
conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
