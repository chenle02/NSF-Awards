The project studies probability models for evolving combinatorial structures,
particularly partition, tree and graph-valued stochastic processes. Specific
topics to be studied include representation and characterization theorems of
combinatorial Markov processes, continuum tree and interval graph scaling
limits, consistent systems of partition, tree and graph-valued processes, and
connections to random matrices and Levy processes. The dominant theme of the
research will be the effect of probabilistic symmetries, especially
exchangeability, on the structural properties of evolving large combinatorial
objects, as these structural properties impact various practical aspects of
these processes. As a result of this project, we should gain further
understanding of models for time-varying discrete structures, especially
partitions, trees and networks. Such processes arise as natural models in
various disciplines, including genetics, physics, biology, computer science and
statistics. In particular, understanding graph-valued processes has potentially
far-reaching applications in the diverse and burgeoning field of complex
networks. Effective models for real-world networks are relevant to problems in
national security, public health, sociology, computer science and physical
sciences. Other areas in which combinatorial models can be useful include
phylogenetics, machine learning, statistics and Bayesian inference.
