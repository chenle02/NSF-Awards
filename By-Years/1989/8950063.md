Two applied mathematics workshops are being offered for college faculty. The
five-day workshops are being held in the Summer of 1989 at Salisbury State
University and are sponsored by the MD-DC-VA Section of the Mathematical
Association of America. The primary population will be members of the section
and members from contiguous states. The emerging symbiosis of mathematics and
microcomputers is being emphasized, with the goal of the workshop to provide
effective applications for the classroom. The first workshop on Chaos theory is
being given by Celso Grebogi of the University of Maryland Lab for Plasma
Physics. Chaos is a field with conceptual and technical contributions that
should be in everyone's applied math kit. It makes natural and powerful use of
computers. The second workshop on Decision Making, is being given by T. L. Saaty
of the University of Pittsburgh. His Analytic Hierarchy Process is applicable to
complex systems, especially in the behavioral and social science fields.
Moreover, an expert system is available that has been designed to implement AHP
and to run on a microcomputer. The institution is contributing additional
support for the program and the participant's institutions will also provide
support.
