This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Isotopic measurements provide natural
sciences with a quantitative tracer of chemical processes and sources.
Improvements in the precision of isotope measurements open up new avenues of
scientific inquiry and significantly enhance our understanding of natural
processes. Multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometery (MC-
ICPMS) is a relatively new technique for the measurement of isotopic
compositions at high precision and as such this instrumentation has important
implications for earth, ocean, and environmental sciences.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This National Science Foundation Major Research
Instrumentation funding will be used to purchase a state-of-the-art multi-
collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer to pursue diverse
geochemical, environmental and geochronological research at the University of
Wyoming. Housing an MC-ICPMS will lead to a substantial improvement in the
University of Wyoming?s capabilities to conduct cutting-edge research. This MC-
ICPMS will provide essential research experiences for graduate and undergraduate
students using state-of-the-art facilities, as well as serving other regional,
national and international researchers.
