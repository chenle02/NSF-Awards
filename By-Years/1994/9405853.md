9405853 Kelts This award provides partial support for the Limnological Research
Center's core laboratory facility at the University of Minnesota. The core
laboratory is a multi-user facility used by the limnological research community
in collecting and analyzing lake sediment cores from a variety of lake
environments. The award specifically will allow the LRC core laboratory to hire
a technician and to add multisensor logging and digital photography to its range
of tools offered to users. The study of lake sediment cores contributes directly
to the analysis of past climate variations, and, by making available coring
equipment, core storage, and instrumentation for core analysis, the core
laboratory of the Limnological Research Center is contributing to the U.S.
research effort in Global Change. ***
