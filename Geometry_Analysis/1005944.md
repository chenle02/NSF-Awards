This proposal aims to demonstrate that analysis of, and on, singular spaces,
can, and should, be dealt with in a consistent manner and that doing so will
lead to useful and frequently optimal results. The core geometric structure
considered here is that of a compact manifold with corners, together with the
smooth maps between such spaces, and the basic operations of compactification
and blow up. To demonstrate the utility of these ideas the Principal
Investigator proposes to study from this point of view the following four
problems: The resolution of smooth actions by compact Lie groups and the use of
such `full resolutions' in topology, index theory and analysis. The
compactification of moduli spaces of magnetic monopoles. The asymptotic behavior
of solutions to Einstein's equation. The resolution of Morse-type fibrations
with applications to adiabatic limits and the existence of Kaehler metrics.

In studying solutions of mathematical problems in the large, such as the long-
time behaviour of solutions to Einstein's equation, it is particularly useful to
`bring infinity' closer by compactifying the space. After doing so, such
`asymptotic' questions are replaced by regularity problems in a more
conventional sense. This process of compactification is dual to the operation of
resolution of singularities, by the iteratrive introduction of polar
coordinates. These two processes naturally occur together in a systematc study
of transition behaviour of analytic-geometric problems.
