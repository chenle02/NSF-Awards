A reductive p-adic group is the special collection of symmetries of an
arithmetic or geometric object. This study is expected to unravel intricate and
fundamental properties of the objects and patterns which are of interest in
arithmetic and geometry through the study of these symmetries. One way to
understand a group of symmetries is through a representation of its elements as
matrices. Representation theory does this in a systematic way. Ultimately the
goal is to we are able to construct and classify all representations of the
reductive p-adic groups, and from this settle important questions about the
underlying geometric object. This is important because so many interesting
arithmetic and geometric objects have interesting symmetries that form a
reductive p-adic group.

This research comes under the umbrella of harmonic analysis on topological
groups. Group theory and harmonic analysis are a part of the fundamental
underpinnings of certain applications of mathematics to technology in such
fields as error correcting codes for efficient and reliable communication and
computer imaging, eg. medical imaging, geological imaging or planetary imaging.
