The record of trace elements that is preserved in high latitude ice masses, such
as the Greenland ice sheet, potentially contains significant information
concerning regional and global scale atmospheric and paleoatmospheric
geochemistry, such as the timing and magnitude of volcanic eruptions,
anthropogenic emissions, and climatic change. A crucial link in this record is
that between atmospheric composition and snow chemistry. This project will
conduct studies of wet depositional processes active in the high arctic by
measuring concurrent aerosol and snow elemental composition, and combined with
meteorological air trajectory analyses to help identify the types, locations,
and transport pathways of contaminants in the ice sheet. Trace metal data from
summer snow samples, compared to the annual accumulation data, will allow some
conclusion on the seasonal timing of net deposition events. This information
will be of significant help in interpreting the trace metal record contained in
the Greenland Ice Sheet Project (GISP-II) deep ice core.
