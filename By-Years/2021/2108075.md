This project supports efforts to design experiments for the new National Science
Foundation-funded high intensity Zettawatt-Equivalent Ultrashort pulse laser
System (ZEUS) facility. High peak-power lasers, such as the ZEUS multi-Petawatt
laser can generate extreme electromagnetic fields through focusing the power
down to a tiny spot. These fields are capable of accelerating charged particles
to near the speed of light in a fraction of a million billionth of a second,
producing bright, point-like sources of radiation. In such strong fields, high-
energy gamma-rays can spontaneously decay into pairs of matter-antimatter
particles, leading to matter creation from light. This project will design
experiments for the ZEUS facility to measure matter creation and amplification
of the process through a chain reaction. The project will support graduate
students and should enable a study of dense and ultrashort duration beams of
antimatter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ZEUS laser facility will generate few-
gigaelectronvolt electron beams through laser wakefield acceleration, which is a
method for generating beams of electrons using the accelerating field structure
produced in a plasma in the wake of a high-power, ultrashort pulsed laser. By
colliding the electron beam with a second, tightly focused, high-power laser
pulse, the field strength is expected to greatly exceed the critical field of
quantum electrodynamics in the electron rest frame, leading to electron-positron
pair production. Graduate students will participate in designing and building
particle detectors for ZEUS experiments, the plasma target for controlled
injection of stable monoenergetic beams and guiding of the laser to achieve
multi-GeV energies, and modelling the laser-electron collision physics using
advanced quantum kinetic codes. Understanding the laser interaction physics is
crucial for the frontier ZEUS experiments to be successful. In the final year of
the project, laser time with ZEUS is anticipated to be available for the first
runs for this frontier experiment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
