The problem of science illiteracy is a national problem. Although university
undergraduate programs have done an admirable job at educating SME&amp;T majors,
they have not provided majors outside of these fields with an adequate technical
background. One of the reasons for this failure is that students are not
transferring the skills taught in preparatory classes to their science classes.
In order to reach the student body, either a multitude of science classes must
be targeted, or, alternatively, a class that essentially enrolls all students.
Two classes that meet this requirement are beginning Math and English. A large
number of NSF projects have already targeted math classes. This project instead
is working to revise the beginning English class to incorporate materials that
will prepare students to understand the concepts and methods taught in science
classes. This is a novel approach, that to our knowledge, has not yet been
attempted on the scale that we propose. This untried approach may prove quite
effective and the materials we are constructing can be incorporated into
introductory English classes in both two- and four-year institutions with
minimal disruption. The pedagogical method presented in this proposal can be
easily incorporated in current English classes and offers a vehicle to teach
science reasoning skills in a less threatening environment than the Math or
science class. This approach should be particulary effective with minorities and
women whose math and science anxiety levels are high.
