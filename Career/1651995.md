Technological advances and the information era allow the collection of massive
amounts of data at unprecedented resolution. Making use of this data to gain
insight into complex phenomena requires characterizing the relationships among a
large number of variables. Graphical models explicitly capture the statistical
relationships between the variables of interest in the form of a network. Such a
representation, in addition to enhancing interpretability of the model, enables
computationally efficient inference. The investigator develops methodology to
infer undirected and directed networks between a large number of variables from
observational data. This research has broad societal impact, as it affects
application domains from weather forecasting to phylogenetics and to
personalized medicine. In addition, the PI is one of the initial faculty hires
in a new MIT-wide effort in statistics. As such, the PI has major impact on
creating new undergraduate and PhD programs in statistics to train the next
generation in big data analytics, crucial for taking on challenging roles in
this data-rich world.

The goal of this project is to study probabilistic graphical models using an
integrated approach that combines ideas from applied algebraic geometry, convex
optimization, mathematical statistics, and machine learning, and to apply these
models to scientifically important novel problems. The research agenda is
structured into three projects. In the first project, the investigator develops
methods to infer causal relationships between variables from observational data
using the framework of directed Gaussian graphical models combined with tools
from optimization and algebraic geometry. The end goal is to apply this new
methodology to learn tissue- and person-specific gene regulatory networks from
gene expression data such as the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. In
the second project, the investigator develops scalable methods for maximum
likelihood estimation in Gaussian models with linear constraints on the
covariance matrix or its inverse. Such models are important for inference of
phylogenetic trees or cellular differentiation trees. The third project is an
application of graphical models to weather forecasting; the investigator
develops new parametric methods based on Gaussian copulas and also non-
parametric methods for the post-processing of numerical weather prediction
models that take into account the complicated dependence structure of weather
variables in space and time.
