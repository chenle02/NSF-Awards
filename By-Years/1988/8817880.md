Algal consuming crustaceans living in freshwater lakes and ponds have a variety
of adaptations to avoid being consumed by fish and other predators. One of these
adaptations is to be active during Winter when fish feed very little, and to
produce dormant stages in Spring and Summer when fish feeding activity is high.
Dormant eggs of the copepod, Diaptomus sanguineus, are deposited on lake
sediments where plankton-feeding fish cannot find them. The eggs hatch in Autumn
after fish have again become quiescent. A recent study showed that after fish
were removed from a small lake, the timing of the production of dormant eggs
shifted to later in the spring than had been the case when fish were present. To
test if this shift represents a genetic response to fish removal, the small lake
was divided into quarters with a solid vinyl barrier. Fish were introduced to 2
of the quarters and were excluded from the other 2. This research will continue
the necessary monitoring of the timing of production of dormant eggs in all
quarters to see if it differs in the presence and absence of fish. Laboratory
experiments will be carried out to test if any differences observed are
genetically based.
