This award provides one-half of the funds necessary to acquire a laser
microsource for the Fourier Transform Mass Spectrometer (FTMS) system being
developed for geological applications in the Department of Geological Sciences
at the State University of New York (SUNY)in Albany. SUNY is committed to
providing the remaining half of the necessary funds for the acquisition. The
laser microsource will permit a spatial resolution of ten micrometers or better
on geological samples being analyzed for isotopic ratios. This instrument design
project is intended to develop the FTMS technique so that it is capable of
measuring isotope ratios accurately for the dating of mineral- and rock- forming
events in the geological evolution of the Earth.
