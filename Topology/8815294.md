Douglas C. Ravenel has been working and will continue to work on algebraic
techniques used in topology. In collaboration with various others across the
U.S., he has shed light on the Morava K-theory of the classifying space of a
finite group, on the homotopy type of MO(8) at the prime 3, and on a new
elliptic cohomology theory of apparent interest to physicists (through string
theory) and to number theorists. The continuation of this research will also
include some machine computation of homotopy groups of spheres.
