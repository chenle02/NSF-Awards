9400666 This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of
Professors Schuster, Wilson, and Courtney at New York University to study the
scope and mechanism of photocycloadditions of fullerenes by enones. The studies
focus on an analysis for steric and electronic influences of the fullerene
functionalizations, sensitizing and quenching experiments to address the
reaction mechanism, and analysis of the interaction between the reactants by
photophysical probes. Characterization of fullerene excited states and triplet
1,4-biradicals is sought by photosensitized electron transfer reactions and
time-resolved photoacoustic calorimetry. In this project Drs. Schuster, Wilson,
and Courtney will conduct photocycloadditions of fullerenes by a variety of
enones. Their research provides a novel route to functionalize fullerenes and
addresses in detail all parameters that influence the photochemical reaction
pathway. The significance of their studies on fullerenes is a profound expansion
of the important photocycloadditions of olefins. This research will also provide
much valued information on the photochemical and photophysical properties of
fullerenes.
