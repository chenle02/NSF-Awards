9309430 Sheng This research is for the development of a laser based machine tool
for the finishing of axisymmetric and prismatic parts, especially parts made
from high strength metal alloys, ceramics, and composites. Specific techniques
such as tangential laser beam impingement, raster scanning of the laser beam,
use of high wavelength radiation, use of off axis water jet, workpiece
preheating, and control of laser beam temporal and spatial modes are researched
to improve surface finish and reduce surface thermal damage. A prototype machine
tool will be constructed, several classes of engineering materials evaluated for
their machinability, and theoretical analysis of beam/material interaction
performed. The resulting machine tool is expected to be flexible in terms of the
workpiece geometries that could be finished, and would combine material removal
and heat treatment. The applications would be especially well suited to some new
lasers emerging commercially, such as excimer, high radiance tunable dye, and
copper vapor lasers. ***
