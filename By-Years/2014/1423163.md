Autonomous systems (AS) are key building blocks of the Internet's routing
infrastructure. Surveillance of AS may allow large-scale monitoring of Internet
users. Those who aim to protect the privacy of their online communications may
turn to anonymity systems like Tor, but Tor is not designed to protect against
such AS-level adversaries. AS-level adversaries present unique challenges for
the design of robust anonymity systems and present a very different threat model
from the ones used to design and study systems like Tor. Thus, new research is
needed to understand this threat and to defend against it.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is investigating the design of anonymity
systems that are resilient against AS-level adversaries. First, the project aims
to quantify the capabilities of AS-level adversaries, who are powerful
eavesdroppers and also capable of active attacks, but also have some limitations
in practice. Second, the project is designing new route-selection strategies for
anonymity systems that can limit how much of the anonymized traffic the AS-level
adversary can observe and attack. Finally, the project is investigating how
anonymity systems can hinder an AS-level adversaries' ability to analyze
encrypted traffic by injecting spurious cover traffic and timing delays. The
findings and new anonymity system designs from this research will impact the
privacy of a broad class of users in the context of forms of large-scale
monitoring of online communications.
