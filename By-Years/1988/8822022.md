The effects of the sediment and meltwater fluxes from the Laurentide Ice Sheet
on the North Atlantic are greatest where these are concentrated for reasons of
ice sheet dynamics and/or topography. Detailed isotope stratigraphy, combined
with AMS 14C dating, shows that the transition from glacial to interglacial
conditions contains significant irregularities, e.g.the Younger Dryas stadial
event. This award will continue amulti-parameter investigation of
cryosphere/ocean interactions at the margin of the Hudson Strait ice stream. The
study focuses on a suite of cores from 1000 to 2000 meters in the northwestern
Labrador Basin. Methods include: detailed AMS dating, stable isotopic and
sedimentological analyses, with the aim of documenting meltwater and sediment
fluxes from the ice sheet, and into the North Atlantic Ocean. The cores can be
placed in a firm stratigraphic context because of the availability of high-
resolution Huntec acoustic records.
