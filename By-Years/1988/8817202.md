This award provides partial (60%) funding to purchase a computer system for use
by researchers in the School of Oceanography and the Geophysics Program at the
University of Washington. The University of Washington is committed to providing
40% of the acquisition cost for this equipment. The equipment will serve to
upgrade a distributed network of Sun workstations and peripherals for research
in the electrical conductivity of the mantle, long-period magnetotelluric
observations, side-scan acoustic seafloor imaging, and the dynamics of mid-ocean
ridge hydrothermal activity.
