Fundamental problems in network design have served as benchmarks for the
development of new techniques and evaluating their effectiveness in
combinatorial optimization. This proposal will investigate a class of
connectivity problems including the traveling salesperson problem and its
closely related variants such as the bridge connectivity augmentation problem,
two-edge-connected subgraph problem and vertex connectivity network design
problems, in order to design improved approximation algorithms by advancing
current techniques and developing new methods. The proposal also develops new
theoretical models for network design problems from practice that incorporate
sub-additive demands in information aggregation, and that integrate inventory
storage and vehicle routing costs in logistics planning.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the ubiquity of their applications, and the
fundamental nature of their theory, network design problems are important both
in practice and theory. New methods developed can be incorporated into practical
heuristic approaches for solving prototypically hard optimization problems of
real-life scale that arise in a host of applications from communications to
logistics networks. The theoretical analysis developed will improve the
mathematically provable quality of fast heuristic solutions for this important
class of computational optimization problems.
