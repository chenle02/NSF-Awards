This research considers the problem of determining parametric bounds for the
performance criterion of perturbed nonlinear programming problems. Initially
special problem structure, such as separability will be exploited, the aim
however is to apply the results to so-called "factorable functions" which occur
in a wide variety of problems. Thus the eventual outcome of the research could
have wide applicability. The central idea is to use branch-and-bound techniques
to generate regions in which sequences of approximating convex programming
problems can be used to get bounds, then piece together the information from
different regions to create global bounds. The goal of the research is to
produce an algorithm for general nonconvex parametric problems. The methods will
be implemented on practical applications and user friendly code will be
produced. This research considers the problems of producing parametric bounds
for the performance criterion of perturbed nonlinear programming problem. It is
expected that the research will lead to techniques and computer implementations
of direct use in computing the solution to difficult nonlinear optimization
problems.
