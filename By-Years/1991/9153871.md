The techniques of mathematical modeling and simulation are changing the nature
of both social decision making and scientific inquiry. An essential feature of
this change involves viewing complex, interconnected problems from a dynamic
feedback systems perspective. Today's students need a working knowledge of
modeling, simulation, and system dynamics so that they are adequately prepared
to become the scientists, engineers, and policy makers involved directly with
problem solving. We propose to study how students think about models and
simulations with the aid of The Explorer, an interactive computer learning
environment, and to see if the addition of system dynamics will work effectively
as a scaffolding for the transfer of skills and understandings from one complex
problem to another in a different knowledge domain. We believe that integrating
tools that aid in understanding complexity into science courses will provide the
basis for a radically different approach to learning. In this proposal we
explore alternative ways of working with simulations and system dynamics. This
research has three components: o Identifying and assessing the development of
modeling-specific cognitive skills, and the student's understanding of the
nature and function of a model. o Identifying and assessing the development of
higher order analytical cognitive skills, and the student's ability to transfer
these skills through different subject domains. o Augmenting an existing model-
based curriculum to facilitate implementation of the previous two components.//
