9630517 Vivian The Arizona State Museum (ASM) will use this planning grant to
further their planning for the educational content of their new prehistoric
gallery. This project is titled "Prehistoric Gallery: Planning for Science
Education Components". The subject of the planning activity is part of their
master plan for facility renovation and interpretation. Two approx. 10,000
square foot exhibit halls are being developed; the first is the recently opened
Paths of Life: American Indians of the Southwest. The second, and the subject of
this planning project, is Journeys of the Ancestors: Ancient Peoples of the
Southwest. The planning activities will consist of 1) travel by the ASM planning
committee to seven museums to discuss exhibit philosophy, interpretive
strategies, and exhibit techniques; 2) an interpretive design seminar that will
bring together a multidisciplinary team of scientists, science educators,
exhibit designers, and others to share ideas on the design, content, and
educational activities for this new hall; 3) additional a front-end evaluation
to test effectiveness of the themes, strategies, and learning activities with
different segments of their potential audience; 4) a planning session with area
teachers to examine the relationship between the exhibit and the curricular
needs.
