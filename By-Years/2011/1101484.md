The main thrust of the research project is the continuation of the joint work of
the PI with T. Hausel and E. Letellier on the geometry of certain character
varieties, the moduli space of representations of the fundamental group of a
Riemann surface to a reductive algebraic group. These spaces have a rich
geometry. In other incarnations they parametrize certain Higgs bundles on the
surface, a space which arose in connection to theories in Physics. The main
conjecture of the PI and his collaborators describes the mixed Hodge structure
of the character varieties and involves the Macdonald polynomials of
combinatorics. In a separate project the PI will continue to investigate the
theoretical and computational aspects of the L-functions attached to
hypergeometric motives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is hard to predict
how current pure Mathematics will impact life outside its discipline. But
overall, it largely does sooner or later. Arithmetic geometry in particular, has
become crucial in a world of ever increasing digital communication and data
manipulation. Geometry over finite fields, for example, once a subject of
specialists, is now needed for many widely used algorithms for encryption and
electronic transmission of information. In this project the PI uses finite
fields in the other direction: as a probe to study the geometry of some spaces
of relevance in Mathematics and Physics.
