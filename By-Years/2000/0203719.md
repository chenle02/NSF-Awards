This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
Informatics for FY2002. The fellowship supports research and training at the
postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
these fellowships will play important roles in training the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Modeling the
influence of climate change on fire regimes and successional patterns in
topographically diverse landscapes in the Rocky Mountains." Understanding the
response of fire regimes to variation in regional climate and local topography
is critical to predicting potential effects of global warming in forested
ecosystems. This research combines dendrochronology and GIS techniques to model
potential responses of fire regimes and successional patterns to plausible
climate change scenarios within two national parks in the Rocky Mountains.
