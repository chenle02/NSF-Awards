9322488 Horanyi The fragments of the recently discovered Comet Shoemaker-Levy
are expected to return to Jupiter on July 25, 1994. During the approximately 1
week long trip, as Comet Shoemaker-Levy crosses Jupiter's magnetosphere, it will
produce more dust in situ than the total mass of the main jovian ring ( 5 x 1010
g). Dust grains, once exposed to the plasma environment, will collect
electrostatic charges and interact with the magnetic and electric fields of the
magnetosphere. These grains will be dispersed or focused depending on their size
and location in the plasma environment. Research on this award will allow
extended computer simulations of the trajectories of a large number of test
particles accounting for all the relevant interactions. This test particle code
has been developed by the PI and has been successfully applied to charged dust
dynamics around other planets, and also in the Earth's magnetosphere. These same
routines will be used for the case of Comet Shoemaker-Levy entering Jupiter's
magnetosphere. It is quite possible that new dust rings may be formed around
Jupiter as a result of this comet impact.
