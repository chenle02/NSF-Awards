This project will measure vertical neutral atmospheric motions in the F-region
using existing Fabry-Perot interferometers, by observing the atomic oxygen red
line emissions from the ionosphere. To calibrate the FPI for velocity, the PIs
will produce and evaluate a zero velocity reference standard for use with Fabry-
Perot interferometers. First, the PI will build a new laboratory 630 nm lamp at
the University of Pittsburgh, and compare it with various secondary reference
sources at Millstone Hill. The comparison between the oxygen lamp and the
secondary sources will determine the effective velocity difference between the
lamp and the ionospheric red line. Once secondary standards have been
calibrated, the PI will acquire and analyze data using existing FPIs along with
these standards, measuring vertical motions by a long series of observations.
