The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) project is a handheld smartphone-enabled hardware platform for
the rapid detection of COVID-19 in nasal swab samples. The proposed project will
translate a portable smartphone enabled platform to detect COVID-19 in patient
samples in 30-90 minutes in a standard clinical setting or in an even lower-
resource facility. After diagnosis, data are immediately recorded and encrypted
with geo-mapped and time-stamped for public health use. This novel and proactive
approach for detection can enable communities to rapidly detect COVID-19 and
monitor outbreak data to suppress disease spread. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the need to
develop a rapid and portable COVID-19 point-of-care diagnostic. The scope of the
Phase I project is to develop a robust nucleic acid assay to specifically and
sensitively detect for COVID-19 in a handheld smartphone-enabled device. This
project proposes an optimized nucleic acid amplification assay that is highly
selective and rapid, while maintaining sensitivity, specificity, and a low false
positive rate. Additionally, the project will test the optimized assay in the
presence of nasopharyngeal (nasal) swabs and viral transport media, preparing a
robust platform for clinical analysis of both fresh and stored samples. The
project will integrate the assay into a sample-to-answer device for fast
COVID-19 nucleic acid diagnosis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
