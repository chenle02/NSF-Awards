9709486 Chau The aim of this project is to develop advanced techniques in the
study of cell cycle kinetics. This involves: (1) the development of fluorescent
in situ hybridization flow cytometry (FISH-FC) using oligonuleotide probes such
that one can measure specific messenger RNA of the light of heavy chains of
immunoglobulin (2) the measurement of cell cycle kinetic parameters from
asynchronous serum-free or protein- free cultures using FISH-FC (DNA and
intracellulr immunoglobulin distributions are also to be measured simultaneously
with multi-straining); ad (3) the development of a population cell cycle age
model which can describe protein production and simulate flow cytometry
bivariate distributions. Results of this project should lead to a better
understanding of the appropriate cell biology and kinetic phenomena of
monoclonal antibody production, especially under serum-free and protein-free
conditions. ***
