The female gametophyte is an absolutely essential structure that is involved in
several reproductive functions such as seed development, pollen tube guidance,
fertilization, and the induction of seed development. Despite its importance,
very little is known about the molecular processes controlling female
gametophyte development and function. The long-term goal of the experiments in
this proposal is to understand these processes. We will take a genetic approach
to this problem. This proposal has four specific goals: (1) identify mutants
with defects in female gametophyte development, (2) characterize the female
gametophyte mutants genetically, (3) determine the developmental steps affected
in the FG mutants, and (4) isolate one female gametophyte gene. These studies
will lead to the isolation of key genes mediating female gametophyte development
and function and should provide new insight into how these processes are
regulated. Because of the reproductive processes the female gametophyte
mediates, this basic knowledge can feasibly have applications to the control of
seed visability and vigor.
