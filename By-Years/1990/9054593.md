The Eagle-UnionCommunity School Corporation proposal seeks support to build
upon and extend the work initiated with NSF support ( working partnership of
many parts which is focusing on the use of modern technology for teaching
science and mathematics. There are two major objectives of the project. E
Objective I: Teachers in grades four through ten will integrate essential
problem solving, critical thinking, and communications skills into the science
curriculum using information technologies (electronic mail, online database
searching, and CD-ROM). E Objective II: Each of the teachers will develop and
implement at least one comprehensive student-based project. The projects will
promote problem solving, critical thinking, and communication skills, and
integrate the use of the information technologies. Over the three years of
project support 120 teachers, 30 student teachers, and 5,600 students at in
grades 4 - 10 will become involved in the program. The project leadership
anticipates the involvement of an additional 5,000 students in each of the three
years following completion of the NSF project.
