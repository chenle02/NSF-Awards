Recent research demonstrates that biparental inheritance of plastids (BIP) may
be more common in the plant kingdom than previously thought. Plastids are
inherited biparentally in approximately 20% of angiosperm taxa studied. Various
hypotheses have been presented to explain the basis for patterns of plastid
inheritance in plants, however, very little is understood regarding the
evolutionary significance of these inheritance patterns. Our research with
alfalfa (Medicago sativa), which exhibits regular BIP, suggests that there may
be fitness effects associated with sporophyte plastid composition (maternal,
paternal, or biparental) in this species. Plastids may also provide an energy
source for the developing microgametophyte, sperm or the fertilized egg in
species with BIP. The research described here would consider these two possible
explanations for the existence of the BIP. Using sets of full-sib families with
defined constitutions, we propose to measure the effects of 1) plastid
composition in sporophytes on basic physiological processes and components of
fitness in alfalfa. Measurement would concentrate on physiological traits
influenced by plastid-nucleus interaction and whole-plant characteristics that
may reflect differences in primary metabolism.
