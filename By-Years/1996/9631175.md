9631175 HEBERT This project will examine turbulent mixing on Georges Bank as
part of the U.S. GLOBEC Northwest Atlantic Field Studies, Phase 2 program.
Research will be conducted to determine if there are relationships between
turbulence and predator/prey distributions in the context that turbulence levels
affect the patchiness of prey and predators. Three different objectives will be
pursued: 1) to investigate the processes and dynamics responsible for the
vertical structure of mixing rates; 2) to determine bottom stress at each
location and formulate a parameterization to explain the variability of the
stress; and 3) to define the relationships between biological patchiness and
turbulent mixing rates. ***
