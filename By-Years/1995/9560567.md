*** 9560567 Hansen This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project investigates the Operator Training Simulator (OTS) of the Electric Power
Research Institute (EPRI) to be applied to electric power distribution systems.
System automation in electric power systems is moving rapidly beyond
transmission systems. Control in the distribution area raises a new need to
train distribution control center operators in complex situations. Phase I will
incorporate three-phase models and a three-phase load flow into the EPRI-OTS
package, modify a graphical user interface so that three-phase results can be
visualized by the operator, and find testing locations for later SBIR Phase II
research. Phase I is expected to produce innovative, new OTS software for
distribution management systems (DMS). Electric power utilities need training
for their DMS operators. Softwares products will be aimed at meeting this need
and to assist software developers in new tools for electric power distribution
systems. ***
