Professors De Lucia and Herbst are supported by a grant from the Experimental
Physical Chemistry Program to continue their studies of radiative and
collisional preperties involving small fundamental molecular species. Using the
tools of millimeter and submillimeter spectroscopy, De Lucia and Herbst are
studying the collisions of gas phase species at very low temperatures (below 5
K), the mechanisms and the modeling of intermolecular rotational energy
transfer, and the spectroscopy of internal rotor states in various simple
molecules. %%% This collaborative experimental and theoretical program provides
important basic scientific information of potential use in various diverse
fields, including molecular astrophysics, quantum electronics, and atmospheric
science.
