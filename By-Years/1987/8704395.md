Ultraviolet/Visible (UV/VIS) spectroscopy is a technique that uses absorption of
ultraviolet light to probe molecular structure. The acquisition of an UV/VIS
spectrophotometer is crucial for enhancing the research and teaching environment
of the modern chemistry department. The Department of Chemistry of Florida
International University will use the instrumentation, purchased with the help
of an award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program, to enhance
research in the following areas of chemistry: 1) Temperature dependence of
UV/Visible spectra of molecules in the gas and condensed phase 2) Separation and
identification of carotenoids in human macular pigment 3) Thermochemistry of
coordination compounds 4) Competitive chelation of porphyrins; implications for
geoporphyrin chemistry 5) Kinetics of monochloramine oxidation of Syringaldozine
The UV/VIS spectrophotometer will represent a significant addition to the
research and teaching instrumentation available to this RUI institution that has
set the increased participation of talented black and hispanic students as one
of its primary goals.
