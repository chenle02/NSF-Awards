The focus of this research involves the development of new chiral methods for
epoxide production. Oxodipoxomolybdenum trialkyl\(aryl)\phosphine oxide
complexes will be used to oxidize alkene and indole substrates. Both biphasic
and homogeneous solvent systems will be employed and a number of chiral
phosphine oxide ligands will be synthesized and tested for the ability to
promote catalytic, chiral oxidation when used in concert with oxidizing agents
such as hydrogen peroxide, t-butyl hydroperoxide and bis(trimethylsilyl)
peroxide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this Minority Career Advancement Award, the
Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr.
Leslie S. Jimenez in the Department of Chemistry at Rutgers University, New
Brunswick. Professor Jimenez will focus her work on developing methodology for
the preparation of epoxides, three-member rings containing two carbons and one
oxygen. The project provides an excellent venue for the training of both
undergraduates and graduate students and the results of the research could have
impact in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries. &lt;br/&gt;
