0236527/ 0236654 Richardson/Wooding&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project consists
of an analysis of the trajectories of RAFOS floats, deployed as part of the
KAPEX experiment around the southern tip of Africa, in combination with
ancillary data from surface drifters and satellite-borne altimeters. Preliminary
analysis of these trajectories show that many of them were trapped in Agulhas
eddies. A motivation for this work is the belief that Agulhas eddies both
provide a significant conduit for flow from the Indian Ocean into the Atlantic
and stir the ocean in the south-eastern Atlantic. The proposed analysis seeks to
summarize the life history and statistics (including: number, size, swirl
velocity, translational velocity, and the interactions of eddies with each other
and with bathymetry). The investigator will compare the details of the
trajectories with output from various numerical models of the region and
collaborate with a German investigator in mapping the intermediate-depth
velocity field in the S. Atlantic.&lt;br/&gt;
