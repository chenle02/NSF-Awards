This is a program to support for the American Meteorological Society Summer
Policy Colloquium. The goal of this program is to build knowledge, experience
and leadership capacity in the intersection of science and policy for individual
scientists and for the geosciences as a whole. The workshop participants
generally consist of 30 early to mid-career researchers and graduate students.
The program exposes the participants to variety of issues related to science and
science policy, including: 1) reconciling scientific opportunities and national
needs in developing research programs; 2) allocating and managing resources for
science; 3) incorporating science and knowledge into policy formulation and the
national agenda; 4) strengthening their ability to listen to and understand, as
well as educate and inspire other scientists, policymakers, users of science and
science-based services, and the general public; 5) understanding the special
ethical dimensions and demands of scientific research and scientific leadership;
and 6) building understanding of the implications of their science for national
security. Course instructors are scientists and others with significant policy
experience, which is shared with the workshop participants during a 10-day
colloquium in Washington, DC.

Facilitating the interaction among researchers and policy analysts and
practitioners is a significant benefit to both groups. The focus on early career
individuals, especially the graduate students, is also a strength of the
project, providing these individuals with the tools they will need to work
together to address important societal problems in which scientific research
plays a role. The impacts of the AMS Policy Colloquium, which has been serving
the research and science policy communities for more than ten years, can be
observed in the influential positions that its alumni (now totaling more than
400 individuals) now hold.
