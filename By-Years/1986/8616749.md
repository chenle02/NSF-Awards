The mass transport velocity inside the double boundary layer under three
dimensional short-crested waves will be theoretically investigated. Velocity
over a flat permeable bed will also be examined. Preliminary experimental
studies of mass transport velocity will also be conducted to study the mass
transport velocity in the boundary layer over a flat permeable bed.
