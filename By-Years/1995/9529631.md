9529631 Sarid This proposal describe a research plan to upgrade the capability
of an existing UHV-STM systems to study the time-dependent response of the local
density of states (LDOS) for a variety of species adsorbed on metal and
semiconductor nanostructures. The PI proposes to use fast lasers for the
photoexcitation of electron-hole pairs in the semiconductor nanostructures. The
photoexcited carriers will modify the LDOS of the semiconductor and the carrier
decay will be measured via the surface photovoltage generated. In particular,
the temporal response of the LDOS on an around atoms and molecular adsorbed on
metal and semiconductor surfaces will be examined with sub-nanometer and sub-
nanosecond resolution. The modification of UHV-STM equipment will permit the
study of the LDOS in the vicinity of the adsorbed molecules and determine the
nature of their bonding. The research will shed light on the intricate bonding
of molecules to surfaces from both the spatial and temporal points of view. ***
