The Analog Circuits Laboratory Project aims at major curricular revisions in the
Electronic Engineering Technology program. Specifically, the analog circuits
sequence is changed from an emphasis on circuits as closed systems to signal
processing building blocks used to implement larger systems. This change results
in an increase in systems-level and frequency-domain analyses. Computer-based
tools and circuit simulation techniques are integrated into existing courses.
The Tektronix 2630 Personal Fourier Analyzer and system controller are the major
instruments purchased and are accompanied by Microsim PSPICE Circuit Simulation
software. The students maximize their performance through computer-based
analysis and simulation tools. Following the design, the circuits and subsystems
are built and tested for verification of performance in both the time and
frequency domains. The project responds to the shift in engineering practices in
industry and targets curricular revisions which parallel the changes in the work
place. The award is being matched with a greater amount, 104%, by the principal
investigator's institution.
