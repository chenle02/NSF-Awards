This proposal is to provide partial funding for the 1987 biannual International
Bacteriophage T4 meeting at Evergreen State College. This meeting provides a
much needed forum for discussion of the results of basic research dealing with
the replication, regulation of gene expression, and morphogenesis of bacterial
viruses. Previous meetings have generated a valuable book (The Bacteriophage
T-4) and a T4 community newsletter. The meeting have been well attened bya
mixture of graudate students, postdoctoral fellows, and established scientists.
The 1987 meeting promises to be equally successful.
