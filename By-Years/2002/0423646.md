This research studies organizations' exploitation of existing knowledge to
promote innovation, with a long-term research goal to understand how existing
knowledge can improve the survival and success of firms and industries. Theories
on organizational evolution are used as a basis for the study. Three sequential
methods-case study, longitudinal archival study and a multi-industry survey-will
be used to examine the research questions. The organizational partners are firms
in the robotics and computer hardware industries. The partners have provided
access to information and people involved in both successful and unsuccessful
R&amp;D projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is novel in several
ways. First, the study is unique theoretically, because it brings together
previously disjoint literatures of product development and organizational
evolution. The second distinctive contribution of this project is that it
provides evidence for the value of exploiting existing knowledge. Much
innovation research underestimates or neglects the potential of such knowledge,
yet its impact on product innovation can be significant. Third, the project is
important nationally. It promotes a better understanding of innovation and
technological change, two main forces driving national growth and
competitiveness.
