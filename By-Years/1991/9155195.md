This project, sponsored by the Center for Science, Mathematics and Technology
Education at Colorado State University, will offer a three year
interdisciplinary science program to 40 middle school and junior high school
teachers from representative districts in the state of Colorado. Each summer
these teachers will be taught the fundamental concepts of biology, chemistry,
geology, mathematics and physics appropriate to the grade level using a content
intensive thematic approach. In the academic year following the summer program
the participants, with the help of project staff, will work toward implementing
the new curriculum in their schools. They will do this by incorporating the new
modules into the everyday curriculum, by conducting whole school projects and by
offering teacher-to-teacher workshops. When the project is completed there will
remain a cadre of teacher leaders who will be able to disseminate innovative
instructional models for middle school interdisciplinary science. The NSF award
is being matched with funds from the school districts and the university by an
amount equivalent to 52% of the NSF grant.
