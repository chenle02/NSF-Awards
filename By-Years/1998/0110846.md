This research project is being carried out by Professor Jillian Buriak and her
group in the Department of Chemistry at Purdue University. With the support of
the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Buriak is exploring a
novel method for synthesizing spatially defined functionalized silicon surfaces.
Using a scanning probe mediated electrochemical reaction, alkyne molecular
species are grafted to silicon and germanium surfaces. This localized
functionalization of the surface allows direct electronic communication between
the semiconductor substrate and attached molecular electronic devices.

Using a novel electrografting method, Professor Buriak and her colleagues at
Purdue University are developing synthetic approaches for locally modifying the
electronic properties of silicon and germanium semiconductor surfaces. This
research is likely to lead to new methods for building molecular electronic
devices.
