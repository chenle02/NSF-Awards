ABSTRACT CTS-9985929 A. Gast/Stanford University

The important interfacial properties of suspensions of colloidal crystals and
liquids will be investigated. The interfacial behavior of suspensions is of
central importance in many systems such as inks, paints and ceramics where the
final product depends on wetting or interaction with a substrate. The primary
goal is to understand how the phase behavior of a suspension influences its
wetting and surface tension properties. These interfacial properties will be
manipulated via an electric field to produce unique and controllable contact
angles and wetting processes. This is a program that combines colloid and
surface science, statistical mechanics, electrodynamics and microfluidics. The
study focuses on understanding the interplay between colloidal interactions,
structure, and suspension interfacial phenomena. The work will be extended to
use patterned electrodes to spatially modulate colloidal wetting processes. The
spatially modulated electrocapillary behavior of colloidal suspensions will be
exploited for interesting and novel microfluidic applications.
