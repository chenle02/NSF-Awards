Funding from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will enable Mount
Saint Mary's College, an institution primarily for women, located in the
Southern California area, to renovate key areas of the science building
dedicated to research and research training activities. The renovation plan
targets specific areas in Biology and the Physical Sciences where investigations
in microbiology, cell biology, immunology and neuroscience occur. Funds will be
used to update electrical and plumbing systems, increasing the safety and
accommodation of increased equipment utilization. Selected laboratories will be
reconfigured to provide more efficient space for faculty and students as they
conduct various experiments. Fixed equipment consisting of fume hoods, casework,
benches and storage cabinets will be installed in the renovated spaces. The
project will improve the quality of the research space as well as the total
educational and research experience. It is anticipated that because the
institution has the highest percentage of minority students among the
independent colleges in California, more minority women will matriculate in the
sciences, having the opportunity to contribute to the scientific enterprise of
the nation.
