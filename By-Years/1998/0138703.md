0138703 Willis This award to Oregon State University provides instrumentation to
significantly improve the oceanographic research capabilities of the institution
and the research vessel Wecoma, an NSF-owned ship operated by OSU as part of the
University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. The award
supports acquisition of a phased array 75 kHz acoustic current profiler that is
expected to significantly improve the R/V Wecoma's capabilities for measuring
currents. It also provides upgrades to the piston corers of the NORCOR facility
and improvements to the shipboard computer network on R/V Wecoma. All of these
are shared-use capabilities that are available to all funded users of the R/V
Wecoma, or in the case of the coring systems, users of any UNOLS vessel. These
improvements will be of substantial advantage to marine scientists during 2002
and future years. ***
