Stephen L. Bloom&lt;br/&gt;"Axiomatizing Fixed Points&lt;br/&gt;Stevens Inst. of
Technology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the proposed work is to obtain
complete, but simple, descriptions of the properties of the "fixed point" or
"iteration" operation in computation. Simpler axioms may lead to concrete
discreptions of free structures and we intend to use the axioms and/or these
concrete descriptions to find and improve decision algorithms. Previous work by
Bloom, Esik and others has resulted in a complete description of the equational
laws satisfied by the iteration operation. This description takes the form of
the axioms for Iteration Theories, which capture important features of many
classes of structures of interest in the theory of computation. The original
axiomatization of iteration theories contained a complicated equational scheme.
Recently, this scheme has been replaced by the "group identities". Nevertheless,
further simplifications seem to be possible. Another goal is to find relative
finite axiomatizations of iteration theories enriched by additional operations
and/or relations. If successful, there are major beneficial corollaries. For
example, a relatively simple set of axioms for the concurrent behavior of finite
state processes (both for bisimilarity equivalence and for trace equivalence),
for Kleene relation algebras with and without conversion, for the behavioral
equivalence of recursive program schemes or recursive data type definitions and
others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lastly, some previous work of the investigators and
others has indicated that the laws of iteration theories hold in the extremely
general setting of 2-categories, and we intend to investigate this phenomenon in
detail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
