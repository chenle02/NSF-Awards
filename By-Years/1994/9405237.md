ABSTRACT -- CTS-9405237 Howell The proposed research requests funds to
investigate the heat transfer characteristics of fluids at or near the critical
point. Four tasks have been proposed: first to gather available data on heat
transfer to supercritical water and other fluids and evaluate these data;
second, to investigate predictive techniques for heat exchange at supercritical
conditions; third, to apply a newly developed technique to one fluid other than
supercritical water; and fourth, to report the results and analyze the
applicability of the results for application to other fluids. The proposal was
submitted as a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) as a result of
conversations between the PI and the Thermal Transport and Thermal Processing
Program Director. The qualifications of the PI and his ability to perform
fundamental work in this area are excellent. The relevance of the proposal, the
fact that the subject area is one of increasing importance, and the uncertainty
of the outcome make this particular proposal an excellent candidate for the SGER
program.
