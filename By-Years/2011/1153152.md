This award will provide support for attendees and invited speakers for the tenth
annual symposium of the NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship
(AAPF) program, to be held in Austin, TX on January 7-8, 2012. The purpose of
the AAPF program is to integrate research and educational activities at the
postdoctoral level, to better prepare the fellows for a scientific career. The
Annual Symposium provides a venue for fellows to discuss their research and
teaching or outreach projects while increasing their exposure within the
astronomy and astrophysics community. The symposium represents a key component
of the AAPF program, acting as a mechanism to facilitate knowledge transfer from
experiences the fellows have obtained in the course of their activities to a
broad audience.

As with the previous symposia in this series, the AAPF symposium for 2012 will
promote interactions among astronomers with very different interests and
backgrounds. By creating a forum in which discussions can occur across the
standard boundaries defined by sub-discipline, there is great opportunity for
new insights and the ability to develop new interdisciplinary collaborations.
The symposium will also provide a venue for discussing other issues that are
important to early career astronomers. In addition, the symposium will (1)
provide a forum for discussing the combination of research and teaching, (2)
facilitate collaborations between AAPF fellows on both research and education,
and (3) provide exposure for the fellows and the fellowship program within the
astronomical community.
