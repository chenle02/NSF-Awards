This award supports a two-year collaborative research project between Professor
Mark S. Gordon of Iowa State University and Professor Kazuo Takatsuka of Nagoya
University. Also involved on the U.S. side are Professor George Schatz of
Northwestern University and Professor Vincent McKoy of the California Institute
of Technology. In Japan Satoshi Yabushita of Hiroshima University and Kimihiko
Hirao of Nagoya University are also involved. This project will address one of
the most important new developments in chemistry during the past five years --
the experimental ability developed by Neumark and others to directly study
reaction transition states by performing photodetachment of an electron from
related anions and then studying the subsequent photodetachment spectroscopy and
dynamics. The investigators, all theoretical chemists, will attack this problem
from several complementary perspectives, including electronic structure theory,
dynamics based on both time-dependent and time-independent formalisms, and
photoionization spectroscopy and dynamics. By combining complementary expertise,
the U.S. and Japanese groups will be able to develop insights that build on
current collaborations.
