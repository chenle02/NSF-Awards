0218736&lt;br/&gt;He&lt;br/&gt;The past decade, dubbed the "Decade of the
Brain", has witnessed explosive growth in the ability to observe and measure
brain activity in human subjects. The technique of functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) has enabled precise anatomical localization of brain structures
that are activated during certain psychological processes. Though fMRI has high
spatial resolution, temporal resolution is on the order of a second. In
contrast, electrophysiological (EEG type) recordings, which can be obtained from
the scalp and measure the electrical activity of ensembles of neurons activated
synchronously (event-related potentials (ERP) provide millisecond level temporal
resolution but limited spatial resolution. Tremendous efforts have been made to
localize electrical source generators within the brain that underlie ERP
components evoked by specific sensory, motor, or cognitive events. The approach,
called electrophysiological neuroimaing, attempts to image the neural source
distribution within the brain from electophysiological recordings obtained over
the scalp by deconvolving the volume conduction process.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this proposal is to achieve high spatial and
temporal resolution in brain imaging by mathematically combining MRI and EEG
data. The method involves placing constraints derived from one imaging modality
on possible inverse solutions of the other modality. Once the algorithms are
developed, the method will be applied to obtaining finer localization of brain
structures involved in detecting and responding to an error in a cognitive task.
The multimodal brain imaging technique will be assessed for applicability and
performance in studying executive control systems in healthy subjects and
disturbance of executive functions in selected groups of patients with
schizophrenia.&lt;br/&gt;
