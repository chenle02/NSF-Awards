This Research Training Group (RTG) will focus on training a new generation of
scientists in (i) the development of analytical and computational algorithms for
solving complex spatio-temporal problems that arise in biology and (ii)
applications of these and other methods to problems arising in neuroscience and
inflammation. In particular, on the computational side, this project will
develop effective discretizations of coupled biological processes, iterative
solvers and coupling/decoupling strategies. Within the neuroscience application,
the investigators will derive new results on propagating waves and sustained
activity patterns, synchrony and rhythmicity, noise and synaptic plasticity.
Within the inflammation application, the research projects deal with the immune
response to influenza infection, inflammation and sepsis, and models of
necrotizing enterocolitis and wound healing.

This project builds on the research and training experience of the principal
investigators who have ongoing successful collaborations with the departments of
Neuroscience and of Computational Biology, the Center for Inflammation and
Regeneration Modeling and the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition. The
trainees are postdoctoral fellows and graduate and undergraduate students. They
will participate in a variety of integrated research and training activities,
including regular trainee presentations, journal clubs, working groups and
research seminars, semiannual RTG Theme Days, an annual retreat, and an online
forum. The biomedical applications targeted in this project are of enormous
importance to society, as symbolized by the inclusion of inflammation as an NIH
roadmap emphasis area for 2008 and the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research.
