This experimental and analytical investigation considers the potential heat
transfer enhancement from resonant excitation of the shear-layer instability in
a ribbed duct flow. The specific interest is in the degree of excitation-induced
enhancement for various flow and geometrical conditions resulting from external
acoustic source excitation. The timewise evolution of the local wall heat
transfer will be measured and linked to the instantaneous flow behavior. The
complementary numerical study will assess the modeling capabilities and extend
the experimental parameter range. The enhancement of heat transfer is important
in many applications including electronics cooling and heat exchanger design.
This research addresses heat transfer augmentation through the coupling of an
external excitation and flow instability. The enhancement by flow instability
has been documented so that the new part of this research is the use of external
excitation. There is a potential for significant enhancement by this technique.
