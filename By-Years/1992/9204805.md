Professor Chai on several problems in arithmetic geometry. These include
canonical integral models of Shimura varieties and the theory of p-adic
symmetric spaces with a view to an analogue of Schmidt's theorem on
degenerations of Hodge structures. This project falls into the general area of
arithmetic geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of
mathematics: number theory and geometry. This combination has proved
extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that withstood
generations. Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes. Such
codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
