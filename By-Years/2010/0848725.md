This Research award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
program supports work by Professor Achim at Carnegie Mellon University to
synthesize hybrid inorganic-peptide nucleic acid (PNA) structures. PNA is a
synthetic analogue of DNA that has a pseudo-peptide backbone to which
nucleobases are attached. The comparative study of the structure and
thermodynamics of formation of non-modified and ligand-modified PNA duplexes, in
the absence and presence of metal ions is used to create metal-containing PNAs
capable of undergoing structural changes in response to external stimuli. This
research developed at the interface between bio-organic and -inorganic chemistry
offers to undergraduate and graduate students a unique opportunity to learn
about both research fields. The students in the Achim group interact with
research groups in the Center for Nucleic Acids Science and Technology at
Carnegie Mellon, which exposes them to a broad range of tools for the synthesis
and characterization of nucleic acids and gives them a wide perspective of
chemistry. The hybrid inorganic-PNA structures synthesized have relevance and
potential applications in nanotechnology and molecular electronics.
