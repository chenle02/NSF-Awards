ABSTRACT

This project involves inverse spectral and scattering theory in three areas of
mathematical investigation: (1) the spectral theory of two-step nilpotent groups
and compact nilmanifolds, (2) the inverse resonance problem for exterior domains
and scattering manifolds, and (3) inverse scattering for singular potentials
with applications to nonlinear dispersive equations. Two-step nilpotent lie
groups play an important role in pure mathematics as models of sub-Riemannian
geometry and as a rich source of examples of manifolds with identical Laplace
spectra but distinct geometries; a detailed investigation of the trace formula
for these manifolds will be carried out using analysis on nilpotent Lie groups.
Resonances are discrete scattering data for non-compact manifolds analogous to
the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on a compact manifold; the inverse resonance
problem will be investigated in the contexts of conformal and asymptotically
flat geometries, and invariants such as the determinant will be studied.
Nonlinear dispersive equations with singular initial data may be viewed, via the
inverse scattering method, as linearized flows for the scattering data of a very
singular potential. We hope to extend the inverse scattering picture for the KdV
and mKdV equations to such singular data and obtain greater insight into these
dynamical systems--by constructing the flow on Hilbert spaces of initial data
which are singular but very natural from a dynamical point of view.

Inverse spectral theory is the mathematical discipline that underlies important
applications of mathematics to medical imaging, geophysical prospection, non-
destructive testing, and many other areas. In these applications, properties of
a physical system (a human body, the earth, or an industrial material) are
deduced from its response to externally imposed stimuli (electromagnetic
radiation, seismic waves, or ultrasound). The properties deduced may loosely be
described as the "geometry" of the system and its response to external stimuli
the "spectral data" (or "normal modes"). A deep result of the study of
completely integrable systems is that certain physical phenomena, such as the
propagation of waves in shallow water, can be solved using an associated inverse
spectral problem. Thus advances in inverse spectral theory lead to a better
understanding of how such nonlinear waves propagate. The impact of this project
will be twofold: first, it will elucidate, by studying carefully chosen
geometric contexts, the relation between speectrum and geometry. Secondly, it
will deepen our understanding of nonlinear dispersive waves by extending tools
of inverse scattering theory to study nonlinear wave propagation with very
singular waves.
