Abstract for proposal 0949561:&lt;br/&gt;Statistical Inference under Isolation-
with-Migration Models &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will develop new
methods to understand how new species arise. As related populations diverge from
each other, on the way to becoming separate species, evolutionary forces leave
an imprint on the patterns of genetic variation within those populations. To
reconstruct the history of the divergence process, genetic data are collected
from natural population and then subject to statistical analyses that
incorporate population genetic theory. The accuracy of these inferences depends
critically on the computer programs that are used in the data analyses. The goal
of this research is to improve existing analytical programs by developing
methods to determine whether the best conclusions that these methods provide
actually are a good fit to the data. Also existing methods will be extended to
better address questions about natural selection, and to include genes that have
experienced a history of recombination. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will
greatly improve scientists? ability to understand how separate species have come
into being. The project will directly support a postdoctoral scientist and a
graduate student. In addition several undergraduate students will be involved in
the project each semester. The results of the research will include improved
methods and tools (i.e. computer programs) and these programs will be freely
available on the internet for other scientists to download and to use.
