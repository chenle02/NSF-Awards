The objectives of this project are to develop realistic, partially synchronous
models of distributed systems and to determine the relationships between them. A
variety of partially synchronous models will be collected by studying real
distributed protocols and formulating their timing requirements as abstractly as
possible. Application areas include distributed file systems and communication
networks. Relationships between the models will be determined by defining
simulations between models and looking for problems that differentiate them.
Timing constraints will be added to distributed problems (previously studied
without them) and the resulting upper and lower bounds on time complexity will
be analyzed. The first problem to be so analyzed is that of implementing atomic
registers. The significance of identifying partially synchronous models is that
they are more realistic than the two extreme timing models (synchronous and
asynchronous) often used. Understanding the relationships between models is
important because they indicate precisely what time behavior is necessary and
sufficient for particular properties to hold. Systems builders can then
concentrate on providing the appropriate time behavior. Model simulations can
save work and unify results when results carry over from one model to another.
Studying real protocols and specific problems can lead to results that are
useful in the specific problem domains.
