Travel support is requested for about twenty U.S. participants (recent Ph.D.s,
women, and members of underrepresented minority groups) to attend the 35th
Conference on Stochastic Processes and Their Applications, to be held in Oaxaca,
Mexico from 19th to 24th of June, 2011.

The annual ``Stochastic Processes and Their Applications'' meeting is one of the
main international forum for researchers studying applied and theoretical
problems in the field of stochastic processes.

An important part of the intellectual development of researchers at the
beginning of their career is to attend international conferences where they have
an opportunity to interacts with people working in a wide range of topics. The
35th Conference on Stochastic Processes and Their Applications will feature
twenty Plenary Lectures, sixteen Invited Sessions as well as numerous

theoretical probability.
