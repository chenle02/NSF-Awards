Charge coupled devices (CCDs) with high sensitivity in the blue and ultraviolet
regions of the electromagnetic spectrum are required for many investigations in
astronomy. Devices produced with blue sensitivity in the past have exhibited
problems such as low quantum efficiency, sensitivity variations, optical
distortion and severe interference fringes. The research undertaken with this
SBIR Phase I award will use a novel CCD designed to have optimum performance
when treated to obtain high blue sensitivity. Two different approaches will be
tried to reduce the thickness of the CCD, thereby increasing the blue response.
Methods of stabilizing the sensitivity of the CCD will also be investigated. The
goal of this work is to produce a technology which can be applied to CCDs
resulting in high, stable sensitivity across a wide spectral range from near
infrared to soft x-rays. Such devices would be of use to astronomy, medical and
biological imaging, and chemical analysis.
