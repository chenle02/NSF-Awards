This project, entitled U.S. Army Obscurants: the Next Generation Systems is a
supplement to the Engineering Research Center (ERC) for Particle Science and
Technology at the University of Florida. The specific objective is to optimize
the efficacy of the defensive smokes used by the U.S. Army, particularly in the
infrared region. Sub-micron and nano-sized metallic flakes and coated flakes as
well as conductive and dielectric fibers will be prepared and their ability of
maximize the attenuation of the radiation with minimum mass or minimum volume of
material will be investigated. The fundamental research issues to be addressed
in this project are within the context of important national defense need and
applicable to other critical areas such as chemical, and biological defense.
