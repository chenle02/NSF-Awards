Grasslands and converted grasslands (i.e. agricultural land) cover extensive
areas in semi-arid regions of the world. Lakes situated in grasslands are
usually saline and have high concentrations of dissolved organic matter (DOM).
We hypothesize that DOM plays a critical role in regulating algal production in
prairie saline lakes by binding nutrients and making them less available to
algae. To explore this hypothesis, we will survey a suite of chemical and
biological parameters in lakes from three areas in the central and northern
Great Plains (ND, SD, NE). A series of experiments will be conducted in Years 2
and 3 to further explore patterns observed in the field surveys. This research
will provide training for one graduate and six undergraduate students. A greater
understanding of the controls on algal production may improve management
practices in prairie saline lakes and ensure the quality of these habitats for
migrating waterfowl.
