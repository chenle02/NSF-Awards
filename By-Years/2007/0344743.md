Leaves function in photosynthetic light capture and are critical both to
individual plant survival and to energy exchanges on a global scale. Based on
their morphology leaves can be broadly grouped into two categories, simple and
compound. Each of these leaves may have advantages over the other depending on
the environment in which they evolved. However, the developmental basis for the
various leaf forms seen in nature is largely unexplored. Dr. Sinha has
undertaken a systematic dissection of compound leaf shape in the model organism
tomato using genetic, molecular and developmental tools. When compared to
results from simple leafed model species, these results suggest to us the
commonalities and divergences between the compound and simple modes of leaf
development. Her previous results suggested that the Class 1 KNOTTED-like
HOMEOBOX (KNOX1) genes function differently in tomato (with compound leaves) and
Arabidopsis (with simple leaves) and subsequent data showed that KNOX1 genes are
utilized in the developmental cascade leading to compound leaves in most
flowering plants. Dr. Sinha has extended this study to analyze the role of
PHANTASTICA, a MYB domain protein that regulates KNOX1 genes. In tomato leaf
development PHAN and KNOX1 share a dosage sensitive regulatory relationship and
PHAN regulates leaflet placement in numerous compound leaves. While these known
genes are important determinants for leaf complexity, this work will also
identify roles that other heretofore unexplored genes play in compound leaf
development. This research involves analysis of leaf development in the tomato
and bean families, and in related species in the same genus (e.g. the genus
Lepidium) or within the same species (e.g. the heteroblastic species Neobeckia
aquatica) in the mustard family. This research encompasses the areas of
developmental biology, molecular biology, plant physiology, genetics, and
evolutionary biology and the long-term goals are to thoroughly dissect compound
leaf development in an evolutionary context.
