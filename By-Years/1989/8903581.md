+he Synthetic Organic Chemistry Program is supporting the work of Dr. William H.
Okamura of the Department of Chemistry at the University of California at
Riverside. Dr. Okamura is developing thermal reactions that can be carried out
at relatively low temperatures that result in the rapid and efficient formation
of complex ring systems. These will provide new routes to the complex materials
needed in modern agriculture and industry. The purpose of the research is to
carry out exploratory mechanistic and synthetic investigations on the manner in
which chiral conjugated allenes and other polyenes participate in carbon-carbon
and carbon-hetero atom bond forming pericyclization reactions. The significance
of this study is that by systematically evaluating pericyclic and other
reactions of polyenes that lead to new bond formation, both mechanistic and
theoretical insight into these processes should obtain. Moreover, a detailed
understanding of how substituents and substitution patterns affect the
stereomechanistic course of pericyclizations should lend information to the
synthetic chemist as to how to better develop and design synthetic methods. The
synthetic impact of the current proposal is that methodology pertinent to the
synthesis of chiral polycyclic building blocks should emerge. The topics include
the development of an understanding of pi-facial stereoselectivity effects by
substituents on electrocyclic processes and exploration of the scope and
limitations of the allene variant of electrocyclizations, Ä±3,3!-sigmatropic
shifts and cycloaddition processes.
