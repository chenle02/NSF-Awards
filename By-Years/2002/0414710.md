Many digitally-mediated activities present participants with complex strategic
decisions. Strategic interaction in electronic commerce arises, for instance, in
negotiation, trading, resource finding, matchmaking, advertising,
recommendation, contracting, and executing. Scenarios in these applications are
properly modeled as games, however, direct application of game theory quickly
becomes infeasible as problem complexity grows. Despite enormous advances in
game theory and mechanism design, an ever-growing number of applications are
intractable using standard methods. Thus, designers must resort to highly
stylized models, or non-strategic analysis using simulation or experimentation
methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project bridges the gap between simulation
and game-theoretic analysis by developing computational tools for empirical
game-theoretic analysis. The new techniques combine gaming, high-fidelity
simulation, &lt;br/&gt;experimental manipulation, statistical analysis, search,
and game-theoretic reasoning in a principled way, to reveal the shape of complex
strategic environments. The results of the project will have immediate practical
application to strategic reasoning in many domains, including government
auctions for spectrum, oil and gas, etc.; complex matching programs (e.g.,
medical residency); deregulated energy market operation; and business-to-
business electronic commerce. By extending the scope of problems amenable to
strategic analysis, this research will inform the design of more efficient
resource allocation mechanisms for public as &lt;br/&gt;well as private-sector
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
