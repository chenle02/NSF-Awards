Funds are requested for the purchase of a Model TLX-120 Table-Top
Ultracentrifuge and Rotors from Beckman Instruments Inc. This instrument will
provide new investigative capacity in the Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology
and will be an important educational resource in the training of future
independent investigators in contemporary molecular, cell and developmental
biology. Specifically, it will make possible a variety of studies that must be
conducted on very small amounts of biological materials (cells, constituent
macromolecules and macromolecular assemblies) under conditions that minimize
preparation time and maintain temperatures well below the ambient. Example
applications by the major users include analyses of: a) protein phosphorylation
as an intracellular signal in flagellar motility: b) secretion granule function
in cell-free assays; c) interaction of extracellular matrix components with
purified and reconstituted integrins; d) kinesin/dynein interactions with
microtubules and membrane- bounded organelles; and e) stage-specific RNAs
isolated from embryonic tissues. Comparable instrumentation is not available for
routine use by the identified major an minor users.
