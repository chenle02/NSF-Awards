The research is intended to continue previous studies of the effects of AC and
DC electric fields on surface related processes in ionic solids. The objective
is to understand the effects of external electric fields on evaporation, via
modification of the gaseous species near the surface, the effects of electric
fields on impurity segregation on the surface and surface diffusion of various
species, the interaction of electric fields with impurities, and finally the
effects of electric fields on the nucleation and growth films. Field effects on
evaporation will be studied by standard electron microscopy techniques on
various alkali halide single crystals; coupled mass spectrometry will also be
used to study the nature of the evaporating species. X- ray photoelectron
spectroscopy will be used to study the role and behavior of impurities and
dopants on the surface with respect to electric field effects. Some parametric
studies will also be conducted varying the parameters of the fields e.g.,
frequency of AC fields. This research is relevant to a variety of processes with
technological import. In particular, the eventual application of the scientific
understanding derived in this study to the growth of thin films has a variety of
important potential applications, in the areas of electronics and optics.
