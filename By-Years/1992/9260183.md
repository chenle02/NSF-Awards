Recent experiments in Great Britain and Japan demonstrated s hundred-fold
enhancement of convective and boiling heat transfer by the application of DC or
low frequency electrical fields. Also, in the case of boiling heat transfer, the
mean bubble detachment time was reduced and boiling hysteresis eliminated.
However, the technique, as it had been developed, is applicable only to
insulating fluids and cannot work for water, due to heating associated with the
current. The proposed method attempts to overcome this difficulty by applying
high field gradients in the form of narrow pulses. Electric heating would be
reduced by using low duty cycles. The proposed research will study the pulsed
concept and its effect on convective and boiling heat transfer in liquids.
