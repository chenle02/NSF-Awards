Funds are provided to allow the PI to continue working on the vertical
incidence and wide angle seismic and geothermal data collected over a known gas
hydrate field on the Blake Ridge and Corlina Rise during two cruises in 1992.
The work will enable, among other, the determination of pressure-temperature
conditions over the bottom simulating reflector marking the base of the gas
hydrate and constraints on vertical and lateral distribution of the hydrate,
which are crucial to the understanding of gas hydrate occurrence in convergent
and passive margins, allowing tests of an in situ and fluid flow model of
hydrate formation.
