9727759 Brahamsha Certain marine unicellular cyanobacteria of the genus
Synechococcus exhibit a mysterious type of swimming motility characterized by
the absence of flagella and of any obvious organelle of motility. In previous
work, Dr. Brahamsha has obtained mutants impaired in swimming motility and has
identified an abundant cell-surface polypeptide, SwmA, that is required for
swimming. The objectives of this project are two-fold: 1) to characterize
existing motility mutants and isolate new ones and 2) to begin studies of SwmA's
function. This will be accomplished by combining genetic and biochemical
approaches. Studies of SwmA function will include cross-linking studies to
determine the polypeptides it interacts with. Characterization of the mutants
will include isolating the genes responsible, determining their nucleotide
sequences, and localizing their products in Synechococcus cells. These studies
should provide insights not only into the mechanism of this unique type of
prokaryotic motility but also into the fundamental question of how organisms
convert chemical energy into motion.
