Abstract

This project deals with a number of problems concerning Banach space theory and
applications to other areas of mathematics. Part of the project deals with the
theory of extensions of Banach spaces and related problems about the existence
of extensions of linear operators between Banach spaces. For example, one
central problem concerns identifying those subspaces of the classical Lebesgue
space of integrable functions that have the property that every operator into a
Hilbert space can be extended to the whole space. This amounts to finding
subspaces that verify Grothendieck's theorem and is equivalent to the problem of
finding spaces with the property that every extension by a Hilbert space is
trivial. Similar problems for spaces of continuous functions in place of Hilbert
space are also of interest. A second part of the project deals with the
nonlinear theory of Banach spaces; a typical open problem here is whether two
Lipschitz isomorphic separable Banach spaces are always linearly isomorphic. A
third part deals with the study of sectorial operators and possible applications
of that study to partial differential equations.

Extensions of Banach spaces have a geometrical interpretation in finite
dimensions. If, given a centrally symmetric convex set, one only has information
about a slice in some directions and the shadow cast in the perpendicular
directions, one cannot reconstruct the origin set. However, the hope is to
reconstruct the body as accurately as possible, even though this information is
incomplete. This is a concrete way of looking at many questions in analysis that
arise in quite different forms. The nonlinear theory of Banach spaces and the
related Lipschitz structure of metric spaces has potential applications in
theoretical computer science in the handling of large data sets. Sectorial
operators and semigroups are a basic tool in the study of partial differential
equations of evolution type.
