9215331 Childers This is the second year of a three year continuing award to
investigate three major topics in the area of speech synthesis. The first deals
with improving the resolution of existing models of several voice types such as
modal register, vocal fry, falsetto, and breathy, and extending them to
additional types such as hoarse and harsh. These models will be used to
investigate the relation between voice production features and aspects of the
acoustic signal through the use of interactive, high quality, formant speech
synthesis. The second aspect of the research deals with refining the
articulatory speech synthesizer to allow the models of voice types to be related
to speech production physiology, e.g., articulator position and movement, and
vocal fold vibration motion. The third aspect is to develop quantitative
measures of speech quality and vocal function. Anticipated areas of exploration
include the quantification of glottal flow waveform and its spectral
characteristics corresponding to variations in vocal quality. Additionally, the
vocal fold mass and length, the aperiodicity of the vocal fold motion, and the
glottal area will be related to aspects of vocal quality. A unique
characteristic of the models developed is their interactivity, that allows the
user to adjust features of the models related to physiological characteristics
of the speech production process. This allows the user of the model to test new
hypotheses related to voice production by adjusting parameters in the model. Two
possible areas of application are the development to training aids for the
hearing impaired and the design of speech codes based on articulatory movements.
