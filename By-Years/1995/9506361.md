This proposal calls for continuation of recent advances in atomic experiments
designed to find and measure violations of parity and time-reversal symmetries.
The researchers plan to increase the accuracy of the parity violating
measurements in thallium vapor from 1% to 0.3%. They plan to use a new atomic
beam method to compare several barium isotopes as a test of the standard theory
of electroweak unification. Finally, they propose a search for a permanent
atomic electric dipole moment (EDM).
