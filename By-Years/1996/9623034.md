Abstract IBN 96-23034 Markow and Bertram Role of Selection in Maintaining
Variation in Mate Communication Mate communication signals should exhibit
minimal variation because they function in species recognition. However, intra-
specific variation in mating signals is common. This variation is proposed to
result from opposing sexual and natural selection, but few systems are amenable
to direct tests of this hypothesis. The specific aim of the proposed research is
to determine if selective forces shape observed signal variation in a field
cricket. Calling behavior in Gryllus integer is sexually selected, but appears
to be subject to natural selection by acoustically orienting parasitoids. To
accomplish the specific goal, research will first determine the extent of
within-male variation in calling behavior, and whether males facultatively
adjust their calling behavior when exposed to parisitoids. Selection experiments
will then determine how natural and sexual selection influence inter-male
variation in calling behavior over several generations. The proposed research
will be the first experimental test of the hypothesis that conflicting selection
forces shape mating signals within a population.
