9307621 Denell Abstract The powerful methodological approaches possible with
Drosophila have shown that two clusters of homeotic genes (the ANT- C and the
BX-C) function to establish developmental fate. Comparative studies indicate
that the ANT-C and BX-C are derived from a single ancestral cluster which arose
very early in animal evolution; descendants of this ancestral cluster can be
recognized in all higher animals which have been examined including mammals,
where the included genes also play roles of great developmental significance.
The focus of this project is a study of the evolution of the regulative
functions of these homeotic genes by comparing Drosophila to Tribolium
castaneum, the red flour beetle. Beetles and flies diverged about 300 million
years ago and in many morphological and developmental aspects beetles are
relatively more primitive. Most important is the fact that Tribolium can be used
for genetic analysis with resolution approaching that possible with Drosophila.
This project is directed toward that portion of the Beetle ancestral cluster
which resembles the ANT-C of Drosophila. We will 1) define all necessary genetic
functions in the ANT-C-like region by saturation mutagenesis and describe the
resulting phenotypes 2) molecularly clone this region 3) determine the temporal
and spatial pattern of expression of these genes and 4) elucidate the nature of
the interactions of these genes with one another and with upstream and
downstream genes. %%% Studies of the genetic mechanisms controlling
developmental commitments during embryogenesis are among the most active and
significant in biological research. These studies should contribute to insight
into that process as well as to a better understanding of the evolution of
mechanisms controlling such regulatory networks. ***
