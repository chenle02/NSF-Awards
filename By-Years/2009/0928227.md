This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanoimprinting promises low cost
fabrication of micro- and nano-devices in various fields of application
including data processing and storage, photonics, and biomedicine. The success
and proliferation of nanoimprinting critically rely on the manufacturing of
robust and durable templates. Previous research has been focused on the use of
Silicon templates. Due to their brittle nature and limited longevity, this
research focuses on amorphous metals with superior mechanical properties over
currently used materials in nanoimprinting and the absence of an intrinsic size
limitation. Within this proposal the smallest features that can be imprinted
into amorphous metals will be evaluated by utilizing the thermoplastic
formability of some amorphous metals. Furthermore the unique softening behaviour
of amorphous metals, which is utilized for thermoplastic processing will be
exploited to develop a versatile toolbox for nanoimprinting. This includes the
use of amorphous metals as a mold material and as an imprint material. In
addition, the replication of a master mold into amorphous metal daughter and
granddaughter molds through thermoplastic forming will be evaluated.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will develop an enabling and fundamental
nanomanufacturing process for a wide range of applications including data
storage, biotechnology, semiconductor ICs, solar cells, and catalysts.
Furthermore, characterizing of the fundamental deformation behavior of metallic
glasses will generate new cutting-edge knowledge in nanopatterning. Thus, the
success of the proposed research will aid U.S.'s competitiveness in
nanotechnology, benefit U.S industry, and will potentially have significant
economic impact. The research will expose and train graduate and undergraduate
students to amorphous metals and their usage in the new technology area of
nanomanufacturing. &lt;br/&gt;
