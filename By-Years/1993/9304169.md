This conference, "Materials by Design", is to be held in Plymouth, New
Hampshire, 2-6 August 1993. It is a forum for interaction of the leading
developers of computational models with the emerging group of design scientists
applying these models in first attempts at comprehensive design of new
materials. Subject areas to be covered include materials design, multifunctional
materials, thermodynamics and associated data bases, phase stability, electron
theory related to alloy design, modeling tools, computational methods, and
interface design. The emphasis is on materials theory, but includes other
subjects such as processing of cast intermetallics and weldability. There is an
effort to attract young investigators, as well as an international group of
scientists to the conference. %%% The conference subject is aimed at bringing
efficiency to material design by incorporating new theoretical approaches into
the design process.
