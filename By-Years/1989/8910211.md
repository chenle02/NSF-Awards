This proposal develops an empirically-based approach to understanding
differences between risk perceptions and risk attitudes. The distinction is
important to understanding decision making because little is known about the
measures used by individuals to assess the riskiness of options and the criteria
used to select between objective measures (e.g., the variance of the
alternatives) and subjective measures that may be more relevant for personal
decision making. The proposed study will employ a series of experiments to first
refine a general model of risk attitudes and then to test this model on two
real-world situations, financial markets and medical diagnoses. Pilot data,
discussed in the proposal, suggest that knowing more about individuals' risk
perceptions may provide substantial support for understanding their general risk
attitudes. The proposed studies extend earlier work of the investigator and
should provide important insights for a large body of work that focuses on the
effect of perceptions of riskiness on both decision processes (e.g., information
search and acquisition) and behavior (e.g., individual choice).
