As functional MRI provides a new way to study human brain functions, it becomes
increasingly important to improve the temporal resolution of the experiments so
that rapid transient neuronal events can be captured. In conventional Fourier
transform-based imaging methods, each of the dynamic images is acquired
independently so that the temporal resolution possible is limited by the number
of data points collected in Fourier space to achieve a certain level of spatial
resolution. This research seeks to overcome this problem by incorporating a
priori information into the imaging process. Specifically, new optimal methods
for data acquisition and image reconstruction are being developed that exploit
both the underlying model for the signal as well as the available a priori
information about both the object being imaged and the dynamic changes. These
methods promise to give more that an order of magnitude of improvement in
imaging efficiency over the traditional Fourier imaging methods, and should find
application in a variety of dynamic imaging problems, particularly in real-time
imaging of functional brain activities.
