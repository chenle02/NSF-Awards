The Committee on New Researchers of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics
will hold its 2019 conference at Colorado State University, July 24-27, 2019.
Each participant will give a brief introduction to his/her research, as well as
a poster presentation. Plenary talks will be given by established researchers.
There will be panel discussions on teaching and mentoring, publishing, funding,
and finding collaborators. The other workshops supported by this grant will
include oral and poster presentations by new researchers, plenary talks by
established researchers, and open discussions of future directions for
statistics, probability, and data science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colorado State
University will host a conference for new researchers in statistics and
probability from July 24-27, 2019. The meeting is organized by the IMS Committee
on New Researchers and held for junior researchers working in different areas of
Statistics and Probability. The primary objective of the conference is to
provide a platform for interaction among new researchers, as well as
opportunities to seek mentorship from leading researchers in the field. This
conference series is explicitly aimed at training the future leaders and
researchers in probability and statistics. This funding will further support new
researcher participation at subject-specific workshops and conferences
throughout the year, including the Atlantic Causal Inference Conference (an
annual meeting of causal inference researchers held in Montreal in May 2019) and
the Preparing for Careers in Teaching Statistics and Data Science Workshop (an
annual workshop for early career educators in statistics and probability to be
held in Colorado in July 2019).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Details can be found at htt
