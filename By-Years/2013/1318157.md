This grant provides funding for the study of multichannel supply chain
management with opaque service enterprises. The study will provide insights into
how consumers react to the opaque service enterprises by analyzing the consumer
behavior in a multichannel environment with uncertain demand. At the retailing
level, competition among opaque and non-opaque retailers will be scrutinized by
unitizing dynamic pricing, ordering, and revenue management techniques. The
interaction among retailers and suppliers will be modeled while taking capacity
allocation, wholesale price contract, and other dimensions into consideration. A
menu of multiple transparency levels will be designed to optimally exploit the
market. The entire supply chain efficiency and social welfare optimization will
be factored into the managerial insights. Supply chain coordination mechanisms
will be discussed in a variety of circumstances including the coexistence of
opaque and non-opaque distribution channels under
competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research
will lead to the development of a framework in dynamically determining the
optimal ordering and pricing in multichannel opaque market when there are
stochastic demand and supply; the evaluation of optimal bidding strategy for
heterogeneous customers; the design of new business models using different
transparency and opaque levels to serve the various consumer segments; and the
development of new techniques for analyzing the dynamic interaction between the
opaque retailers and suppliers. These research activities together will offer a
deeper understanding of the operational structure and the mechanism of opaque
internet market which is becoming part of our daily life. The proposed
approaches will also be useful for analyzing other multichannel systems, such as
an auction channel model, and the revenue management problems for a supply
network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
