A phosphorimager system will be purchased for the Department of Biology at Texas
A&amp;M University that will allow detection and quantitation of alpha-, beta-,
gamma- and x-rays. Research programs directly benefitting from acquisition of
the phosphorimaging system include studies of photosynthesis, recombination,
replication, circadian rhythms, protein transport, growth and differentiation,
development, proteinases, immunology, signal transduction and gene expression.
The instrument will be located in the Advanced DNA Technologies Laboratory,
which will be responsible for training, technical support, maximization of use,
and maintenance of the phosphorimaging system.
