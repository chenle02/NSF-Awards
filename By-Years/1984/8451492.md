The overall objective of this research is to study the problem of how to design
control systems for motion control which are equipped with capabilities of
motion planning, regulation, and learning. The first phase of the work will
explore fundamentally new approaches to analysis, design, and implementation of
automatic control systems, which are made uniquely possible by modern digital
systems. Special emphasis will be placed on hierarchical designs which clearly
separate the function of task planning from that of performance regulation in a
control system. Specific ideas to be studied include: real-time, model-based,
trial-and-error method for planning; deliberate nonlinear algorithms for high
performances; different world models and representations of sensing data for
controllers at different hierarchical levels; and hierarchical algorithms for
task planning. These ideas will be analyzed theoretically and tested numerically
with the simplified problems. An overall design for robotic arm control based on
these ideas will be produced and tested on a specific arm model.
