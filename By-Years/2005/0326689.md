ABSTRACT

OCE-0326689

A scientist from Massachusetts Institute of Technology will continue the effort
of understanding the dispersal of anthropogenic Pb in the marine environment and
advance our knowledge of oceanic Fe. To pursue the effort of understanding the
dispersal of anthropogenic Pb, the following studies will be carried out: (1)
continue the automated moored time series near Bermuda and Hawaii and analyze
samples from the deep South Atlantic for Pb isotopic ratios; (2) participate in
a cruise to the North Western Tropical Atlantic to determine how the Upper North
Atlantic Deep Water maximum is developed; (3) analyze surface water samples from
the North Atlantic collected between 1998-2003 and samples collected during the
CLIVAR section south of Iceland to establish how the surface distribution of Pb
has changed relative to 1981-1984 and 1985-1989; and (4) analyze a Bermuda coral
for Pb back to 1880 to assess whether high 206/207 and 208/207 Pb isotopes are a
peak or are stable. In addition, to further our knowledge on oceanic Fe, the PI
plans to continue the high-resolution time-series of surface total Fe values at
Bermuda and Hawaii and analyze vertical profile for Fe from the major western
North Atlantic basins for <0.4 um and <0.2 um Fe, as well as complete an iron
stable isotope reconnaissance for Fe in marine samples.
