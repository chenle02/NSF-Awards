This award will support collaborative research between Prof. Clifford Truesdell
of The Johns Hopkins University and Prof. Gianfranco Capriz of the University of
Pisa, Italy. The researchers propose to use techniques and methods of continuum
thermodynamics to understand and develop theories of phenomena occurring in
complex systems such as liquid crystals and mixtures. The placements of such a
medium are determined by not only the displacement and the temperature, but also
local parameters. These may be geometrical or kinematical; for example, void
fractions in porous media, the optical axis of a liquid crystal, the superfluid
velocity in liquid helium. The investigators also intend to look at the
foundations of such theories. The researchers have had a long history of
productive and deep collaboration in rational mechanics, the U.S. PI being one
of the founders of the U.S. school of continuum mechanics. His contributions
have had a significant impact in the development of mathematical models of
physical phenomena. Both investigators have been unusually successful in
attracting young workers to significant problems and promoting better contacts
between researchers in the U.S. and Italy. This award will help to continue
these activities and thus furthers the objectives of the U.S.-Italy Program.
