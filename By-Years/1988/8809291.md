The objectives of this project are to develop new algorithms for regularized
space-variant deconvolution based on adaptive Kalman or ARMA (autoregressive
moving average) filtering with applications in image restoration; to restore
blurred images to extract information that would otherwise be unreadable; to
identify blur transfer function from the degraded image itself and develop
theoretical measures for blur identifiability; to suppress ringing artifacts
that are due to space-invariant deconvolution. Image restoration is an ill-posed
problem. Small perturbations of the observed image due to noise may yield large
variations in the solution. Regularization of ill-posed problems can be achieved
by incorporating statistical or deterministic a priori information into the
solution. Shift-invariant regularization causes ringing artifacts; however,
adaptive deconvolution suppresses ringing artifacts. Adaptive deconvolution is
also able to restore spatially variant degradations. Image degradations usually
vary by spatial coordinates and the source of these degradations is generally
unknown. Hence, it is of interest to develop adaptive restoration techniques
that can identify the signal and degradation model parameters on-line based on a
local observation window. ARMA filtering, adaptive Kalman filtering with on-line
parameter identification for regularized restoration of space-variant blurs, and
adaptive regularization in a deterministic framework using the theory of convex
projections (POCUS) are being investigated. The blur identification problem is
one of identifying a symmetric, noncausal, nonminimum-phase, finite- extent
impulse response for a linear system. Practical statistical methods to solve the
blur identification problem based on spatial-domain ARMA model identification
are being explored.
