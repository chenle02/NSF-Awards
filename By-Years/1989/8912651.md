The Antarctic Peninsula supports the most abundant and diverse populations of
plants and animals on the continent. The grounding of the supply ship Bahia
Paraiso and subsequent oil spill near the U.S. Palmer Station significantly
impacted the area. Initial observations have revealed that the oil has coated
macroalgae and invertebrates living on the hard substrata along intertidal
cobble beaches and in tidal pools. Many of the invertebrates, which form the
base of the Antarctica food web, have been killed. The oil has also affected
seals and birds. Some of the oiled birds have died and others have shown
symptoms of starvation, adverse behavior and loss of insulation. This research
project is part of an integrated, time-series survey of the marine environment
in the vicinity of the oil spill. The research groups will examine the spatial
and temporal extent of the oil contamination and the associated effects on
marine flora and fauna. This project will focus on the fish community, with an
examination of the reproductive physiology and feeding ecology of fish in
control and affected areas.
