The notion of preference occurs naturally in every context where one talks about
human decision or choice. This project studies preferences in the context of
database queries. Faced with information overload, database users seek ways to
obtain not necessarily all answers to queries but rather the best, most
preferred answers.

In the framework of this project, user preferences are captured as preference
formulas. Preference queries involve the use of a number of algebraic preference
operators that have simple formal semantics. The most basic of those is winnow
which, when applied to a relation, returns the set of the most preferred tuples
-- those which are not dominated by any other tuples in the relation. The winnow
operator is parameterized by a preference formula. For example, given a suitable
formula and a database of books for sale winnow will return all the cheapest
ways to purchase every book. Other preference operators include ranking
(unbounded iteration of winnow) and preference range selection.

In the course of the project algorithms for evaluating preference operators are
developed and studied. Algebraic properties of those operators are identified,
in order to lay the foundation for the optimization of preference queries. Query
optimization techniques for such queries are also developed and integrated with
an existing query optimizer. The research addresses all the steps necessary to
make preference queries a practical concept in the area of database management.

courses for students, new applications to make databases better, and foundation
and directions for new research.
