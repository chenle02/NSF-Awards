The transport, trapping and recombination of molecular energy and charges is
relevant to radiation detectors, photoconductors, photovoltaics, optical
memories, molecular electronics, heterogenous catalysis, photosynthesis and
neural transmission. They will focus on novel reaction kinetics of elementary
excitations in low-dimensional media and in materials with structural and
energetic disorder. The emergence of non- equilibrium ordered dynamical patterns
of excitons, electrons and holes, in disordered molecular media leads to new
rate laws for transport and reaction and new tools for the structural
characterization of disordered and non-crystalline materials and surfaces.
