This EArly Grant for Exploratory Research investigates the hypothesis that
speech evolved to exploit human hearing and, therefore, properties of human
hearing are imprinted on speech. A support for this hypothesis is sought by
optimizing the speech processing on large amounts of speech data for
discrimination among speech sounds. The project intends to show that relevant
hearing properties, which are consistent with the hypothesis, will emerge in
optimized engineering modules. The focus is on modeling higher(cortical) levels
of auditory processing, not usually studied in engineering programs. The new
created knowledge should be applicable in machine recognition of noisy speech.

Linguistic messages carried in speech are coded redundantly in time and in
frequency. Redundancies, which are introduced in frequency by synchronous tract
movements and in time by the tract inertia, are exploited by human cognition in
extracting reliable information-carrying elements from noisy speech. In
particular, two particular properties of human hearing are employed: 1) the
ability to separate elements of speech signal into different frequency channels,
and 2) the ability to extract information about temporal dynamics of signals in
these channels. In particular, a deep neural net would take an output of
auditory-like spectral analysis and would be trained on the data to process this
auditory-like spectrum through a bank of learnable two-dimensional cortical-like
spectro-temporal filters. Existence of such architecture is supported by current
literature on mammalian auditory cortex. Therefore, the progress would be gauged
by evaluating similarity of the derived 2-D filters with known properties of
mammalian auditory cortical receptive fields and by their effectiveness in
extracting information about underlying speech sounds that constitute speech
messages.
