The award from the Chemistry Division supports an Undergraduate Research Centers
(URC) planning grant. The PI is Isai T. Urasa. The planning proposal will
establish a regional center of four Historically Black Colleges and Universities
(HBCUs) that will partner with Ph.D granting institutions and national research
facilities. The focus will be on first- and second-year college students, so the
center will reach out to two-year colleges and pre-college institutions in the
vicinity of the consortium. During the planning process, the following will be
undertaken: establish a consortium of four HBCUs; identify Ph.D granting
institutions and national research facilities that will work in partnership with
the consortium; design research training activities; develop a management
structure for the center; develop research training pedagogy; develop
promotional, recruitment, and participant selection materials and procedures;
develop a performance monitoring plan; develop an evaluation plan; prepare a
full proposal for a center. This award is co-funded by HRD/HBCU-UG.
