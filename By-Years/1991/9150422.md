The project is developing afreshman honors course in combinatorics. This
coursestresses experimentation and discovery as methodsfor learning. The course
is centered around a long list of combinatorial problems that the students are
challenged to solve. The problems are understandable with little or no technical
background; nontrivial--leading to important mathematical ideas; and can be
explored through experimentation.
