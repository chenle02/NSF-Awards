The College of the Holy Cross is being supported to establish a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) SITE. The purpose of this SITE is to
provide meaningful hands-on research opportunities in contemporary chemistry for
outstanding undergraduate students under the supervision of experienced research
chemists. The program will support at least 10 students for the summer of 1987,
of which almost half will be recruited from other institutions. Research
activities will include the following: o Research with Immobilized Ligands o
Fast kinetic Reactions of Electron Deficient Organometallic Systems o A Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance Investigation of Structure and Motion in Solid Polymers o
Physical Studies of Metalloproteins
