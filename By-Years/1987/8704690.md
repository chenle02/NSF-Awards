This project continues a line of research in the area of general equilibrium
macroeconomics. The investigator has already offered a number of interesting
solutions to various puzzles in the macroeconomics-labor area, and has developed
techniques that greatly enhance the usefulness of representative agent models.
This continued research has two main goals. The first is to extend the analysis
of the labor market models with nonconvexities, and the second is to study
models of the labor market which explicitly allow for heterogeneity . With
regard to the first goal, the extensions include a comparison of different types
of nonconvexities, decentralization of optimal resource allocations with
particular attention paid to involuntary unemployment, incorporation of labor
market flows, and a careful analysis of the dynamics relationships implied by
nonconvexities. With respect to the second goal, the emphasis will be on
introducing heterogeneity into aggregate models of the labor market. The forms
of heterogeneity considered are skilled and unskilled labor, married males and
married females, and adults and youths. The aim is to study models which will
account for the large differences in cyclical employment fluctuations
experienced by these groups. The analysis will focus on to what extent different
specifications of technology and preferences can produce the observed phenomena.
