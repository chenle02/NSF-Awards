In this project, supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry
program, provides research funds to Professor Bililign at North Carolina A&amp;T
University, one of the HBCU colleges. Professor Bililign will use ab initio
calculations to obtain properties of electronically excited states of free metal
atoms. These calculations will also yield potential energy curves of some
valence and Rydberg states of excited metal atoms interacting with rare gas
atoms and hydrogen. The purpose of these calculations is threefold. The first is
to develop simple analytical model potential functions to describe the metal-
rare gas van der Waals bonding in different electronic states and to test the
model suggested for the bonding. The second is to understand dynamical pre-
dissociation processes which occur in some of these systems. The third aspect of
this work aims to understand the reaction dynamics in laser induced chemical
reactions of alkali metal-hydrogen systems. The metal atoms involved are Mg, Cd,
Zn, Al, Si, Na and Li. In this research program first principles theoretical
calculations will be performed to understand the mechanism by which
electronically excited metal atoms interact with closed shell rare gas atoms and
hydrogen to form weakly bound complexes. The end result is to use the results of
these calculations to obtain analytical model potential functions which describe
these interactions. The results of these calculations help provide an
interpretation and understanding of some experiments in laser spectroscopy, as
well as the non-equilibrium conditions that occur in electrical discharge laser
systems and astrophysical phenomena.
