0349441&lt;br/&gt;Mecham&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation
Research Phase II project will develop and commercialize optical fiber sensors
for the quantitative measurement of humidity and air flow for breathing
diagnostics. Prior Phase I work has demonstrated that these physically small and
mechanically robust sensors respond over a wide range of relative humidities
with a response time of microseconds, and are orders of magnitude faster than
commercially available devices. The Phase II project will develop sensor thin
film chemistries with improved response time, design and fabricate an optical
fiber sensor optoelectronic support instrumentation system, and beta-test the
sensors and systems with clinicians and physicians. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
primary commercial impact of this project will be on home health care and
clinical research. Additional applications will be in the industrial gas flow,
automotive and transportation areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
