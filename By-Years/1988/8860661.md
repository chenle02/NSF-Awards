The feasibility of using a conical shock wave technique, which is potentially a
safer, faster and simpler method for extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, will
be studied. An experimental program, which is an extension of the recently
completed proof-of-principle test, followed by the development of a hydrodynamic
model of shock wave target interaction are proposed. If successful, the sector
shock tube system could replace the elliptical focussing system which on
occasion results in erratic peak shock wave target pressure during the course of
treatment.
