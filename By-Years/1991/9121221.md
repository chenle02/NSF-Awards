Dr. Drew will begin studying the basic neurochemistry of the brains of
teleosts. She will be exploring the regional distribution of the
neurotransmitters dopamine and gammaminobutyric acid (GABA). Dopamine and GABA
play an important role in motivation and motor function in mammals. Release of
dopamine in mammalian forebrain is thought to mediate the reinforcing properties
of drug abuse. GABA is thought to relay and modulate dopaminergic messages. She
will also be investigating what mechanisms regulate the release of these
chemical messengers. Dr. Drew will be utilizing a newly developed, state of the
art technique called in vivo microdialysis to measure neurotransmitter release
in awake freely moving teleost. In vivo microdialysis has been used successfully
in warm blooded vertebrates to address previously unanswered questions regarding
neurotransmitter release. Dr. Drew's experiments are the first to employ the
technique in the study of neurotransmitter release in cold blooded vertebrates.
Although Dr. Drew's current research is aimed primarily at establishing the
feasibility of the technique, it is envisioned that in the future in vivo
microdialysis will be used to study neurotransmitter release during migration
and rapid deterioration of teleosts as they journey upstream to spawn. Such
studies would also contribute significantly to the understanding of the role
that dopamine and GABA play in the initiation and maintenance of compulsive
behavior exhibited in some humans.//
