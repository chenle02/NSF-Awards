This research uses photonuclear reactions to investigate the properties of the
nucleon through the production of mesons and nucleon resonances using polarized
photon beams and polarized targets. The Laser Electron Gamma Source (LEGS)
provides a polarized beam with photons having&lt;br/&gt;energies up to 470 MeV
obtained by the backscattering of polarized laser light from 2.8 GeV electrons
stored in the National Synchrotron Light Source. With the successful development
of the frozen, polarized HD target SPHICE which allows independent polarization
of the proton and the deuteron and with the successful operation of the SASY
(Spin ASYmmetry) detector, this research will perform detailed double
polarization measurements on both the proton and the
neutron.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combining SPHICE and SASY with the high quality
polarized photon beam at LEGS, the experimental program will measure the
differential cross sections for both neutral and charged pion production. The
photon, being the quantum of the electromagnetic field, can interact with both
the&lt;br/&gt;distribution of electric charges in the nucleon as well as the
magnetic-field-producing charged quark currents within the nucleon. Because the
polarization of the photon is determined by the polarization of the laser beam,
linear and circular polarizations can be used. Since the nucleon has a magnetic
moment that can be oriented by manipulating the spin of the nucleon, spin-
dependent photoproduction quantities can determined to accuracies never before
possible.
