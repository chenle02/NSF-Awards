9712929 Parrish, Allen Cordes, David University of Alabama CISE Educational
Innovation: Integrating Software Architecture into an Interdisciplinary Software
Engineering Curriculum This CISE Educational Innovation award supports the
development of a new software engineering concentration involving students from
the Departments of Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Management
Information Systems. The concentration involves two major parts: a sequence of
fundamentals courses, and a year-long capstone project course sequence. The
fundamentals courses will present concepts from the research areas of software
component engineering and software architecture, while the project course
sequence will involve interdisciplinary teams of students developing a realistic
industrial product while applying the novel concepts learned within the
fundamentals courses. The project also involves assessment and dissemination of
the resulting curriculum.
