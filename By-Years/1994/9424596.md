9424596 Duenyas The objective of this research is the development of analytical
models that will assist the marketing and manufacturing departments of a
manufacturing organization in the way new customer orders are accepted and how
the due dates of the new orders can be set by marketing such that the
manufacturing department can deliver the orders on the promised due date and
conditions. Furthermore, the research is also aimed at developing order release
and job sequencing methodologies that would help manufacturing realize the
promised order due dates. Due date setting will take into account the workload
level in the shop. This research addresses a very critical problem and one that
has been the source of many conflicts between the marketing and the
manufacturing departments of many manufacturing companies. To ensure sales,
marketing may accept and promise order delivery dates that manufacturing finds
difficult to realize. The output of this research will assist in alleviating the
conflict. Furthermore, the problem addressed is real and one that does not have
a systematic procedure for resolution. If successful, the outcome of this
research will pave the way to a more amicable relationship between marketing and
manufacturing.
