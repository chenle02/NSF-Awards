This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2002. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Role of histone deacetylases in the
virulence of a plant pathogenic fungus." Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are
important regulators of many cellular processes. Four HDAC genes have been
identified in the maize pathogen, Cochliobolus carbonum, and one of them has
been shown to be important for virulence. Biochemical, immunological, and
genetic techniques are being used to study the role of these HDACs in
development and pathogenicity.
