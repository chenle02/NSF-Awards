This award will support accurate measures of stellar polarization. Circular
polarization is indicative of stellar magnetic fields such as those on
starspots. Linear polarization is due to stellar non-radial oscillations,
starspots, or reflected light from dark orbiting bodies. Magnetic fields exist
on many stars but are best observed on the Sun, especially near sunspots where
they drive solar flares and other activity. Until now, the detection of normal
stellar magnetic fields required spectra taken with large telescopes. Instead,
Kemp will detect such magnetic fields and especially star spots by the
consequent polarization of starlight. Kemp is considered an expert on the
detection of faint stellar polarization and will be able to use telescopes of
modest size at the University of Oregon and in France. Kemp's polarization data
can also reveal when stars are not spherical or have otherwise unseen companion
stars.
