ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;In the semiconductor industry, manufacturing yield, measured
as the percentage of salable products produced, is a key metric that determines
the financial success of a product line. Low yield translates into increased
design cost, delayed time-to-market, and reduced productivity. When low yield
occurs, tremendous engineering resources are spent to diagnose and resolve the
problems. &lt;br/&gt;This project proposes to develop a novel data learning
framework that greatly improves the efficiency and effectiveness of the
diagnosis and resolution process. The framework consists of a newly developed
software infrastructure that interfaces with the existing Electronic Design
Automation (EDA) and silicon test software infrastructures, through the design
and silicon test data they produce. A collection of data learning software tools
and methodologies that analyze said data are utilized to automatically extract
knowledge for yield improvement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is
integrated with educational activities to develop course and tutorial materials
released to the industry for broad impact, a state-of-the-art laboratory for
education, and a research program to attract undergraduate and underrepresented
students. The research strives to achieve a comprehensive understanding of
state-of-the-art design and manufacturing practices including anticipated issues
in the future, and to accomplish multidisciplinary studies merging knowledge
from EDA, silicon test, data mining, and machine learning. Knowledge discovered
through this research will provide the industry with a clear direction on where
to invest resources to better cope with yield related issues in future ultra
nanometer manufacturing technologies. The framework is designed to efficiently
improve yield, which helps improve productivity in the semiconductor design
industry.
