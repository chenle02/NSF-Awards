This travel grant supports USA participants to the workshop on "Modeling,
Simulation, and Visual Analysis of Large Crowds" in November 2011 at 13th
International Conference on Computer Vision. This is a multi-disciplinary
workshop that addresses challenges related to visual analysis and simulation of
large crowds. The workshop engages complimentary viewpoints from different areas
including computer vision, computer graphics, physics-based simulation, and
evacuation dynamics to develop additional insight into crowd analysis, modeling
and simulation problem. This grant partially supports the travel of invited
speakers and participants, especially from computer graphics, simulation, and
pedestrian dynamics. The final proceedings of the workshop along with speaker
slides would be made available via WWW.
