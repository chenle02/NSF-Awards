Dr. Farrar has been successful in isolating, purifying, and sequencing the
insulin from the pancreas of the bullfrog. Now she wants to characterize it
biochemically. Then using a hepatocyte culture system developed from the
bullfrog, an attempt will be made to develop a bioassay for amphibian insulin.
Once this has been done, then studies to examine whether or not the insulin will
affect glycogen synthesis will follow. The results will be compared with those
from other vertebrates. The significance of this work is three-fold. It will
contribute to our understanding of the relationship between structure and
function. It will clarify the role of insulin om larval development and
metamorphosis will also be examined.
