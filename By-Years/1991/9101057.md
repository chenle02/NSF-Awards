This award from the U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science Program will support
collaborative research in Physics to be carried out by Dr. Walter E. Meyerhof of
Stanford University and Dr. Eduardo C. Montenegro of Pontifical Catholic
University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The project focuses on the study of charge
changing processes (electron capture and loss) by ionic projectiles impinging on
gaseous targets. This continuing and successful collaboration will be carried
out at the Stanford University FN Tandem accelerator and at the Van de Graaff
accelerator at the Pontifical Catholic University. The study will focus on the
electron-electron interaction in the electron loss by various light projectiles
passing through hydrogen and helium gas targets. Both total and differential
loss cross sections will be measured. An atomic hydrogen target will be
constructed in the Brazilian site that will enable investigation into the
differences between molecular and atomic hydrogen interacting with light
projectiles.
