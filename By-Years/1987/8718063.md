Aging is among the most profound of biological phenomena. It potentially
influences the biology of animals at all levels; and the deleterious aspects of
aging raise intriguing theoretical, empirical, medical, and social problems. Not
surprisingly, aging has become a major focus of research. However, most studies
have focused on aging in laboratory stocks of inbred animals, and very few
studies have attempted to determine whether the resulting findings apply to
animals in natural populations. This proposal investigates aging in natural
populations of lizards. Huey and Dunham will gather information on how the
physiology and behavior of these lizards change as they grow old. Then they will
determine whether declining performance of old lizards leads to increased risk
of death. By comparing patterns of aging in two populations, they will also test
an evolutionary hypothesis on the timing of aging. This will be the first
comprehensive study of aging in any natural population. This multidisciplinary
approach will be a useful advance and further a general understanding of the
biology of aging.
