Gaining an understanding of the evolutionary history among a group of species
is a fundamental problem in biology. The ease with which biologists obtain and
disseminate genetic information and the resultant desire to analyze this data
necessitates a valid statistical methodology which is computationally feasible
for reconstructing large evolutionary trees and assessing the associated
uncertainty. Other existing methods for reconstructing trees with may leaves
depend on the computationally-intensive bootstrap method of resampling, whose
validity in this context has been criticized by several authors. The
investigators are developing Bayesian methodology and software implementing a
novel Markov chain Monte Carlo alorithm for searching a tree- indexed parametric
space, providing evolutionary biologists with a computationally feasible and
statistically valid method of assessing uncertainty in reconstructed trees. This
methodology is substantially superior on computational and theoretical bases to
existing bootstrap methods. This project provides a new sophisticated
computational tool for understanding evolutionary relationships of species on
the basis of genetic information via a collaboration of the fields of
statistics, computer science, and biology. The methodology the investigators are
developing uses high performance computing in a novel manner to greatly improve
the analysis of genetic data to elucidate evolutionary relationships. The
methodology is general and may prove to be useful in wide-spread applications
quite unrelated to evolutionary biology. This work is funded by Computational
Biology Activities.
