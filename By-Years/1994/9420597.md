9420597 Pfeffer ABSTRACT A concentration of courses in Particulate Technology is
proposed. It will consist of three courses: {SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 13 \h}
Introduction of Particle Technology: Fundamentals and Applications {SYMBOL 183
\f "Symbol" \s 13 \h} Current Research in Particle Technology {SYMBOL 183 \f
"Symbol" \s 13 \h} Experiments and Simulations in Particulate Flows. The courses
will be based on the recent research of the PIs and their colleagues in the
particle technology research community. The collective work of the PIs come from
a wide range of areas such as discrete element modeling, experimental studies of
dry bulk solids, N-body hydrodynamics and sedimentation, dust filtration,
theoretical studies in solid-liquid flows, agglomeration and granulation in
fluidized beds, pattern recognition and cluster analysis, image analysis, and
design of mechanical experiments. Most of the research results are relatively
recent and cannot be found in text-books. The objective of this proposal is to
incorporate these results into the engineering curriculum. ***
