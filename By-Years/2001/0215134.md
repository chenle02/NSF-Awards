This award supports a collaborative research project between Professor Ellen
Wohl of Colorado State University and Professor Timothy Davies of Lincoln
University in Canterbury, New Zealand. While mountainous regions provide the
major water source for many regions and produce a disproportionately large
amount of the global sediment budget, we know relatively little about the basic
processes operating along mountain river channels. This project will investigate
mountain rivers to understand relationships between potential control variables
(valley gradient, discharge, bedrock substrate resistance, and local sediment
supply) and response variables (channel geometry and flow hydraulics). The study
will be conducted on the northwest side of the South Island of New Zealand where
mountainous catchments remain largely unimpacted by human activities. Knowledge
gained should help in developing effective management schemes for mountain
drainage basins. This project will benefit from the expertise and facilities of
both the U.S. and Australian institutions, and will include the active
participation of American students in the international collaboration.
