This action funds Emanuel G. Indrei of The University of Texas at Austin to
conduct a research project in mathematics, entitled "Investigating strategies
that optimize the partial allocation of resources" during the summer of 2012 at
Australian National University in Canberra ACT, Australia. The host scientist is
Prof. Neil Trudinger.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is the investigation of free
boundary regularity for the partial optimal transport problem. This problem is a
generalization of the classical Monge-Kantorovich problem in which one tries to
find a strategy of allocating a given number of resources as cheaply as
possible. The research seeks an understanding of the regularity of this optimal
strategy. The natural setting for this work is the field of partial differential
equations and convex geometry, more specifically, the study of a double obstacle
problem for the Monge-Amp√®re equation.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
