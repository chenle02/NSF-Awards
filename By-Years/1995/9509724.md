Rodier In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global Learning and
Observations to Benefit the Environment Program (GLOBE) this project is designed
to meet the GLOBE goals and objectives of linking scientists and schoolchildren
in a global information network with the ultimate goal of better understanding
the Earth's environment and changes that take place within it. This proposal to
GLOBE PHASE II is concerned with measurements of Ultra Violet (UV) radiation
using a photochemical dosimeter. The UV data collected by students in individual
schools will be shared with other schools through a network called "ULTRA-NET",
interpreted by high school students and the Principal Investigator and made
available to all students on the Internet. UV radiation has important biological
effects and an increase in UV radiation at the surface of the Antarctic
continent for example has been tied to the diminution of the earth's protective
ozone layer by man-made chemical compounds.
