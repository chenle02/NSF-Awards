Modern solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy offers the
chemist one of the most powerful tools available for the study of the physical
and chemical properties of materials. Fundamental knowledge of structure and
dynamics of materials as diverse as biopolymers, resins, coals, and liquid
crystals is accessible by solid-state NMR techniques. Solid-state NMR studies
often complement those carried out using solution NMR and X-ray analysis. Access
to solid-state NMR is rapidly becoming essential to chemists carrying out
frontier research. This award from the Chemistry and Material Research Shared
Instrumentation Programs will help the Department of Chemistry at the University
of California at Irvine, purchase a wide bore 300 MHz NMR spectrometer for
solid-state NMR studies. The areas of chemical reserach that will be enhanced by
the acquisition include the following: 1. Studies of solid yttrium and
lanthanide metal alkoxide complexes 2. Characterization of modified silica
surfaces and novel and high modulus elastomers 3. The molecular details of small
molecule binding to polymer surfaces 4. An analysis of the morphology of hybrid
organo-silicates. 5. New techniques for acquiring NMR data for purposes of en-
hancing signal intensity, spectral and spatial resolution of nuclei in solids.
