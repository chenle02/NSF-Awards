Small quantities of the volatile molecules H2O and CO2 are found magmas and
rocks from the Earth's upper mantle. These volatiles can have important effects
on such problems as the origin of magmas, the melting temperature of the mantle
as a function of depth, the existence of melts along geotherms in the primitive
mantle, and the chemical differentiation of the mantle. Experimental research
completed in the past 30 years has focused on answering these questions at
pressures up to 35 kbar, reaching only into the uppermost mantle. The upper
pressure was largely determined by apparatus limitations. In the last three
years, a burst of activity focusing on the 70-250 kbar pressure range has
occurred due to the advent of the multiple anvil high pressure device. Fragments
of upper mantle rocks found in kimberlite breccias record fossil geotherms
(temperature profiles) with an inflection (change) in their pressure-temperature
trajectories at pressure of about 50 kbar. The deepest samples record pressures
of 60 kbar. Diamonds found in these garnet peridotite fragments and in the
kimberlites suggest somewhat higher pressures. The inflection in the geotherm
suggests that major processes occur in this pressure range. The proposed
problems that will investigate the interaction of volatiles with minerals and
magmas at a 50-70 kbar pressure range are: *Which H2O reservoir minerals are
stable, and do they have a required constituent such as potassium? *What is the
effect of CO2 on magma compositions? *What is the effect of pressure on the
ferric/ferrous iron ratio in magmas? *What is the relationship between
H2O-CO2-oxygen and primary magma composition? A newly developed apparatus, an
active girdle piston-cylinder with a routine operating range to 70 kbar, will be
used to explore these questions.
