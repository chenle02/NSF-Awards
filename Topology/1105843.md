The project addresses relations between geometry, topology and combinatorial
invariants of 3-manifolds. The PI will establish concrete connections between
geometry and topological descriptions, properties, and quantum invariants of
links and 3-manifolds. One part of the project will combine several techniques,
developed both by the PI and her collaborators and by others, to derive
estimates of hyperbolic volumes and other geometric invariants of 3-manifolds
from topological data such as Dehn surgery presentations, link diagrams and
group actions. A second part will establish relations between the Jones knot
polynomials (and the Khovanov homology), essential surfaces, and geometric
structures of knot complements. A third part will study skein link theory in
3-manifolds, its invariants, and investigate its interaction with the detailed
structures coming from the geometrization picture. The research also involves
graduate students currently working with PI.

The research of the project lies in the area of 3-dimensional topology. The
central objects of this study are spaces called 3-manifolds. A 3-manifold is an
object that locally looks like the ordinary 3- dimensional space but whose
global structure can be complicated. An important part of 3-dimensional topology
is also the study of knots (loops embedded in some tangled way in 3-manifolds)
and their classification. The solution of Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture
has established that 3-manifolds (and complements of knots in them) decompose
into pieces that admit explicit geometries and that hyperbolic geometry is the
one that appears more often. In practice, however, 3-manifolds are often given
in terms of combinatorial topological descriptions and it is both natural and
important to seek for ways to deduce geometric information from these
descriptions. One of the ways that topologists have been approaching the study
of 3- manifolds is through the use of invariants. In the last few decades ideas
originated in physics led mathematicians to the discovery of a variety of
invariants of knots and 3-manifolds. Understanding the connections of
topological and combinatorial quantities and invariants to geometry is a central
and important goal of 3-dimensional topology. The main theme of this project is
to establish concrete such connections and explore their ramifications and
applications to other areas of mathematics.
