The objective of this project is to study the biodegradation of xenobiotic
organic compounds in a process that could be used to reduce the concentration of
these compounds in industrial and agricultural wastewaters. Contamination of
water by zenobiotic and toxic organic compounds occurs when industrial or
agricultural wastes have been disposed of in leaking landfills or inadvertently
discharged into the environment. Biodegradation of these organic compounds in
engineered treatment systems is one important method of cleaning up water which
has been polluted with toxic organic compounds. In this research project, the
investigators plan to work on biodegradation of two types of xenobiotic organic
chemicals in Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) systems and in flask microbiological
experiments, examining the effect of cell recycle and a supplemental carbon
source on the rate of degradation. Results of this work are likely to be
utilized in the engineering design of biological reactor processes and their
incorporation in systems to reduce the pollutional effect of wastewaters from
industrial processes on surface and groundwater.
