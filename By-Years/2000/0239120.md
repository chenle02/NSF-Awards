In this CAREER project funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of
the Chemistry Division, Kleiman will study poly-conjugated molecules and their
photo-physical properties using both ultrafast experiments and quantum chemical
calculations in order to understand novel properties that arise from the
macromolecule as a whole. This program involves collaborative work aimed at the
synthesis of hyper-branched polymers, dendritic macromolecules and charged
oligomers. Ultrafast spectroscopy is used to examine energy transport in
conjugated polymers whose electronic and optical properties can be chemically
controlled at the molecular level. Theoretical calculations will provide an
understanding of the experimental data and allow the prediction of measurable
properties and delineation of a fundamental model of energy-transport. The PI
will make an intensive effort to involve young women in an area of chemistry
where they are vastly underrepresented. This will be accomplished via
conscientious recruiting, mentoring and encouragement of both undergraduate and
graduate students. Promotion and expansion of an exchange program with
undergraduate students from Latin-American countries will also be pursued.
Community outreach activities in grades K-12 will showcase the essential role of
female scientists in today's life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New materials with novel
photophysical properties are crucial for developing revolutionary molecular-
photonic and optoelectronic components. Conjugated polymers have emerged as
materials exhibiting valuable properties in optical sensing, energy transport,
and light harvesting. This research program is highly interdisciplinary, dealing
with synthetic organic, polymer, material-science, theoretical, and nonlinear-
optical research. The results of these investigations will provide an
understanding of the electronic and photo-physical characteristics that lead to
unique optical properties useful for optoelectronics, sensing and energy
harvesting.&lt;br/&gt;
