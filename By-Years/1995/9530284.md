9530284 Shervais This award provides funds for in partial support of the costs
of upgrading an aging (circa 1986), first generation CAMECA SX-50 electron
microprobe in use at the University of South Carolina's Department of Geological
Sciences for geochemical analyses in petrologic studies of continental, oceanic
and lunar samples. The upgrade will replace outdated and no longer supported
computer hardware and software used for controlling the instrument and for
subsequent data analysis. These improvements will allow more rapid and improved
X-ray image acquisition, thin film analyses and energy dispersive spectrum
analyses. ***
