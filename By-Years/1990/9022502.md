A general purpose, numerical simulation and modeling software package program
for the analysis of dynamics systems by biologists and biomedical scientists,
will be developed. The software program will be applied to new areas of
biological research and serve to train experimental scientists in the use of
mathematical hypotheses and simulations. Commercial GUIs (graphical-user-
interface), including MS-DOS Window will be used and the kernel of the program
will be established separately so it can run on a UNIX machine. The GUI for a
UNIX RISC-type workstation will also be established. Smalltalk/V will be used
for prototyping, using C++ concurrently under MS-DOS and UNIX Windows.
