9601587 Bacon The PIS request funding to acquire an Inductively Coupled Plasma-
Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) and an isotope ratio monitoring-Gas
Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer (irm- GC/MS). They propose to operate both
instruments as institution facilities (`cost centers') with dedicated managers
for daily operations, maintenance and training of new users. The facilities will
be under the supervision of a scientific management committee consisting of
representatives from marine chemistry, paleoceanography, and petrology. Specific
applications for the ICP-MS include analysis of long-lived radionuclides, rare
earths, platinum group elements and other trace elements in water, sediment,
rocks and marine microfossils. The irm-GC/MS will fulfill two general needs -
compound specific isotopic measurements of 13C and 15 N and microscale
measurements of 13 C and 15 N and 34 S in bulk samples. These measurements will
be applied to studies of the contemporary and paleo oceans. WHOI will cost share
$290,000, which represents 47% of the total funding for this project. ***
