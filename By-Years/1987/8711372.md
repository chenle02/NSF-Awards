The PI proposes to determine the oxygen isotopic composition of seawater during
the last ice age by directly measuring the isotopic composition of seawater
trapped in the skeleton of corals which grew during the ice age. The oxygen
isotopic composition of the ice-age ocean is important to know because it is a
function of the ice volume of the continental glaciers. That ice volume can only
be estimated now because the only way to determine the ice-age isotopic value is
to measure the value in the carbonate from fossil foraminifera; the measured
value, however, will be affected by both ice volume and the temperature of the
ocean in the place where the foraminifera lived. The PI proposes to measure the
isotopic value of seawater extracted from ice-age coral so that it will not be
necessary to estimate the value based on some assumptions which may not be
accurate. The results would be important for determining the temperature of the
ice-age ocean from foraminiferal carbonate after the ice volume effect is
determined and removed.
