Project models and analyzes teleseismic data from regions of strong lateral
velocity variation. Project extends previous efforts, and will examine in detail
diffraction arrivals from refraction arrivals. Exmphasis will be on the
discrimination of the diffracted signals. Application of techniques on digital
teleseismic data from sites on the Rio Grande rift, and the Kenya Rift.
