This project provides for institutional development in the area of secure and
trustworthy computer systems. It expands laboratory facilities to include a
computer network laboratory for information assurance classes. Course materials
in computer security and trustworthy computer networks are developed and tested
for eventual publication and wider dissemination. A distinguished speaker series
brings in national and international experts to the campus. Faculty development
is provided through a variety of methods. The area of reliable and trustworthy
systems is one of emerging national need. Many of these systems contain embedded
computers with software and hardware providing functionality and controlling
operations of the system. This can range from use in household appliances to
aircraft or medical systems. This program provides expertise and capacity that
is in our national interest and adds critical core curricular components to the
information assurance field.&lt;br/&gt;
