This Symposium on Industrial Ecology for Young Professionals (SIEYP VIII),
organized by the International Society for Industrial Ecology Student Chapter
Board (ISIE‐SCB), focuses on translating industrial ecology (IE) research into
tangible outcomes through policy development or implementation. The main goal of
this symposium is to provide an opportunity for young professionals who perform
research in IE to enhance their skills to identify and develop ways to translate
environmental engineering and sustainability research concepts into actionable
items, visit industrial areas proximate to the conference location in Leiden,
the Netherlands that have implemented innovative IE concepts, discuss their
novel research ideas and experiences, and receive constructive feedback. The
Symposium will be held during early July 2023.

The symposium will build participants' fundamental skills that will assist in
research and grant writing, oral presentation, developing effective research
products, and increasing the impact of their research. The symposium will also
provide students and young researchers with the skills to connect their research
interests to policy relevant questions. Moreover, it is expected that this
symposium will facilitate initiation of long‐lasting international relationships
and collaboration among young professionals. These interactions provide
opportunity for joint projects that may result in benefits to USA science and
society at large. The symposium will have immediate benefits for participating
U.S. researchers, and compounding benefits for domestic and international
environmental sustainability efforts that stem from idea sharing and joint
projects over time.
