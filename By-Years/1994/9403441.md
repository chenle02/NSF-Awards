9403441 Zhu It is proposed to perform an in-depth mechanistic study of the
quantum tunneling diffusion of hydrogen on metals. The experimental technique
used is the method of linear optical diffraction to monitor the decay of
hydrogen on nickel and copper. It is proposed to (1) establish tunneling
diffusion rates in the thermodynamic zero coverage limit over a wide temperature
range; (2) explore the effect of immobile surface disorders on the tunneling
process; and (3) determine the effect of different quantum statistics for
hydrogen and deuterium. % % % % The method of laser-induced desorption is used
to create density gratings of hydrogen on metals and use an optical diffraction
technique to probe the time evolution of these gratings. The method will allow a
study of the transport of hydrogen along metal surfaces over wide ranges of
temperature, hydrogen coverage and surface conditions. It is planned to
determine the mechanisms which control the diffusion of hydrogen on metal
surfaces. The results may shed light on the transport of hydrogen atoms along
grain boundaries in polycrystalline metals and alloys frequently used in
hydrogen purification and hydrogen battery technology and in hydrogen
embrittlement research. ***
