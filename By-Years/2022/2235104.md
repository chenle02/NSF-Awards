This project aims to serve the national interest by developing resources for
instructors and students to gain experience in both the technical and design
aspects of developing accessible software. The World Health Organization
estimates that 15% of the worldâ€™s population has some form of disability. While
computing technologies such as computers, mobile devices, and the Internet have
become essential for full participation in society, many of these technologies
are not accessible for individuals with disabilities. Computing professionals
must make design choices and take specific steps to ensure that the computing
technologies they develop are accessible to all individuals. Most computing
practitioners are not up to this task, and most faculty do not have the
expertise to teach these skills. In many computing programs, exposure to
accessibility consists of a stand-alone lecture, assignment, or project within a
single course. Rather than focus on a single course, this project intends to
evaluate the effectiveness of different approaches to teaching accessibility
throughout an entire computing program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year
project plans to investigate the degree to which different instructional
materials and activities across the undergraduate computing programs at the
University of North Texas result in both short- and long-term skill and attitude
shifts for students. Examples of the approaches to be integrated into the
required, undergraduate courses include lecture material, related assignments,
and projects that bring together relevant technical content and their relation
to the needs of persons with disabilities. The result will be a greater number
of graduates who are better trained in accessible software design. Interaction
with persons with disabilities, which is a component of one of these
interventions, will provide students with the opportunity to develop skills that
promote inclusion during hands-on project activities. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program
supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM
education for all students. Through its Engaged Student Learning track, the
program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising
practices and tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
