The request for travel support of 13 U.S. researchers is to participate at the
International Conference (of the International Association) for Computer Methods
and Advances in Geomechanics which will be held May 6-10, 1991 in Cairns,
Queensland and Australia. The emphasis of the conference will be the interaction
of computer modelling and field measurement. This will include advances in
computer hardware and software and the formulation of constitutive laws for
geomaterials using laboratory experiments. In addition the verification by field
measurements will be an important topic of the conference.
