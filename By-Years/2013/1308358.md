The objective of this program is to design and build a novel nonvolatile
transpinor device using a diluted magnetic germanium nanowire with an electric
field-controlled paramagnetism-to-ferromagnetism phase transition. Compared with
conventional silicon complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor devices and other
previously proposed spin field-effect transistors, the proposed transpinor
device provides many unique advantages, including unique nonvolatility, added
functionalities, lower power dissipation and faster switching for information
processing. The intellectual merit is that the proposed transpinor device
invokes new quantum physics to enable the control of the ferromagnetic phase
change (collective spins) in diluted magnetic semiconductor at room temperature.
Additionally, the use of electic field to achieve the control of phase
transition will enable the reduction of power dissipation. The broader impacts
are to create new knowledge and to provide an in-depth understanding of the
carrier-mediated ferromagnetism and spin transport in nanostructures, therefore
establishing a new platform for room-temperature spintronic devices. The impact
will be transformative because it involves the discovery of novel functional
magnetic nanomaterials and physics, which may tranform semiconductor technology
with the integration of spintronics to form nonvolatile systems by introducing
new kinds of high-performance room-temperature spin-based electronic devices
beyond the traditional scaled complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor devices.
It will establish new low-energy electronics technology, and new market and
economy. The program also offers a unique multi-disciplinary research and
educational opportunity to incorporate spintronics into curriculum
