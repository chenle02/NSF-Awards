This is a tie project between the Industry/University Cooperative Research
Center for Biocatalysis and Bioprocessing of Macromolecules at the Polytechnic
University of New York, and the I/UCRC for Advanced Studies on Novel Surfactants
at Columbia University, New York. The research program includes (1) synthesis of
new functional polymers from renewable resources by selective biocatalytic
transformations, and (2) investigation of fundamental relationships between the
polymer structures, adsorption and conformational characteristics at surfaces
and interfaces. Surface and interfacial properties of the polymers and
copolymers synthesized at the Polytechnic University will be studied at the
I/UCRC at Columbia University. A companion award (EEC-0124037) will support the
research at the Columbia University.
