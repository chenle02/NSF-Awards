Ives, Milewski&lt;br/&gt; The two investigators train a long-term
(2-year)&lt;br/&gt;collaborative group of 4 undergraduates working on a suite
of&lt;br/&gt;problems in mathematical biology. One of the investigators is
a&lt;br/&gt;biologist, and the other is an applied mathematician, yet
both&lt;br/&gt;have collaborated with researchers from the other
discipline.&lt;br/&gt;The investigators work collaboratively with 4
undergraduates and&lt;br/&gt;address aspects of at least three problems at the
interface of&lt;br/&gt;biology and mathematics: (1) Why do periodical cicadas
have long,&lt;br/&gt;prime-numbered periods? (2) Why do pineapples, pinecones
(and&lt;br/&gt;many other plants) display patterns with Fibonnaci
sequences?&lt;br/&gt;and (3) How does the functioning of ecosystems change as
they&lt;br/&gt;collapse via species extinctions? These three questions are
an&lt;br/&gt;exciting starting point for the collaborative group, and they
are&lt;br/&gt;selected to both keep the interest of the students and take
life&lt;br/&gt;through the collaborative process.&lt;br/&gt; Although some areas
of biology (ecology in particular) have&lt;br/&gt;luminous histories of
partnership with mathematics, the current&lt;br/&gt;explosion of theoretical and
technological advances in both&lt;br/&gt;fields has upped the ante for
interdisciplinary work. To work at&lt;br/&gt;the interface between biology and
mathematics, more scientists&lt;br/&gt;need to be trained in both fields, and
trained in how to connect&lt;br/&gt;the fields. Recognizing that a single person
cannot span the gap&lt;br/&gt;between fields effectively, future scientists must
also be&lt;br/&gt;trained to work collaboratively. Using collaborative
learning&lt;br/&gt;groups for undergraduates fosters interdisciplinary thinking
for&lt;br/&gt;the participating undergraduates and the investigators. It
also&lt;br/&gt;serves as a model for training undergraduates to do research
at&lt;br/&gt;the interface between disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
