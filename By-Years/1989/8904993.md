This proposal is to investigate the proposition that most of the major
transcurrent structures in Southern California are detached at fairly shallow
depths. The research will utilize an extensive set of existing seismic
reflection data from Southern California for information bearing on the
question. Novel imaging methods to extract reflections from steeply dipping
fault surfaces will be applied to evaluate the earthquake potential of
previously unknown active faults. This research deals with the earthquake
potential of Southern California and thus is directly applicable to the National
Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
