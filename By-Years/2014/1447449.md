Human experts are crucial to data analysis. Their roles include sifting through
large datasets to facilitate search, retrieval, and machine learning. Humans
often perform much better than machines at such tasks, but the speed and
capacity of human experts is a limiting factor in the human-machine co-
processing. This project is addressing two aspects of human-machine co-
processing: winnowing Big Data to produce manageable subsets for human expert
analysis, and machine learning algorithms that learn efficiently from human
experts with a minimal amount of human interaction. This has a wide range of
applications; to ensure broad applicability of the results the project is
evaluating the techniques in multiple domains: cognitive science, large-scale
astronomical data analysis, and experimental design in materials
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach used for data winnowing is based on
developing predictive models and identifying data that does not fit the models.
A key research challenge is non-stationary environments: the underlying model
changes over time. Preliminary work shows promise on selection from a finite set
of models, and new work investigates more flexible parametric models. The active
learning task uses the multi-armed bandit problem to model identify which
features have the greatest impact on human decisions. This task also
investigates learning from comparisons/rankings rather than predictions;
conjecturing that there may exist low-dimensional structure governing human
reasoning and decision-making that enables learning with significantly fewer
comparisons than might otherwise be required. A common theme in both tasks is
ensuring computational complexity is low enough to facilitate real-time
interactions with human experts in spite of the volume of data. This is achieved
using bounded approximations and convex relaxations of the optimization programs
used to guide the interaction.
