This project is concerned with the study of algebra structures on free
resolutions of cyclic modules. The principal investigator will study the
existence of an algebra structure on the minimal resolution of a cyclic module.
She will also determine if the minimal resolution of the algebras defined by
ideals in the linkage class of a complete intersection admit a multiplication
leading to an algebra structure. This work is concerned with mathematics on the
interface of commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. The particular problems
to be investigated are central to this very active area of mathematics.
