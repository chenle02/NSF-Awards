The Chemistry Department is implementing an extensively revised sequence of
introductory courses at the freshman level, along with major revisions in its
laboratory experiments throughout the four year curriculum. Modern instrumental
techniques are being discussed in freshman classes and introduced into the
laboratory at appropriate times. In order for magnetic resonance techniques to
become an integral part of this sequence of laboratory experiments, a 300 MHz
broadband FT NMR spectrometer is being added to the available equipment.
Background for NMR is being introduced at the freshman level by focusing on the
concept of equivalent nuclei during the discussion of bonding in organic
compounds, and the NMR itself is being used by all organic chemistry students. A
series of coordinated experiments are being used as stepping stones in the
development of NMR in the lab curriculum, beginning with the traditional
structural identifications in the 2nd year, progressing through more
sophisticated multi--pulse and 2-D experiments, including a molecular dynamics
study and multi-- nuclear use, and culminating for many students in the
utilization of the NMR in their senior research projects.
