Hans Andersen is funded by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to continue his studies of the dynamics and equilibrium of
liquids, supercooled liquids and glasses. Andersen will develop and use three
types of statistical mechanical methods for the study of the kinetic theory of
dense supercooled fluids: 1) a formulation of the Martin, Siggia, Rose (MSR)
approach applied to the classical dynamics of particle and spin systems; 2)
molecular dynamics simulation studies of dense, low temperature and slightly
supercooled atomic liquids; and 3) simulation of the time dependence of kinetic
spin models designed to elucidate mechanisms for relaxation and structural
change in highly supercooled liquids and glasses. The major objectives of the
research are: 1) to provide critical tests of the derivation and accuracy of the
extended mode coupling theory and a greater understanding of the physical
content of the theory; 2) to develop a basis for kinetic theory that is an
alternative to the use of projection operators or the four-point function of
Mazenko; and 3) to understand how to incorporate such phenomena as formation of
frustration-limited domains, secondary relaxation, and inhomogeneous relaxation
into kinetic theory. Molecular dynamics simulations will be used to study
liquids and slightly supercooled regimes, and more schematic spin models will be
used at lower temperatures where the relevant time scales are longer. Glasses
are technologically important materials made from a variety of components, both
organic and inorganic, both small molecular weight substances and polymers.
Examples include ordinary materials such as window glass and food containers, as
well as high-tech materials for telecommunications, optoelectronics, and solid
electrolytes. As nonequilibrium materials, their properties depend on how they
are made, which usually involves preparation of a high temperature liquid
followed by various cooling and processing steps. The preparation of such
materials to achieve optimal performance is guided largely by empirical
observations, but Andersen's research seeks an understanding of the dynamics of
these materials and their corresponding liquids on a molecular level which can
be useful in the design of rational processing procedures.
