This research project is motivated by a growing gap between trends in processor
development and needs of modern data-intensive dynamic applications ranging from
differential equation solvers to data mining tools to particle dynamics
simulations, playing an essential role in science and humanity. These
applications feature tremendous amounts of data accesses as well as complex
patterns in data accesses or control flows. The properties make them a great
challenge for modern processors which are evolving exactly opposite to these
applications' needs: A chip's aggregate computing power is rapidly outgrowing
memory bandwidth; the rise of throughput-oriented manycores makes system
throughput even more sensitive to irregular computations. The new paradigm of
program optimizations, non-uniformity--centric, distinctively takes the non-
uniform inter-core relations in modern systems as the first-order constraint for
program optimizations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed framework named
PipeReg is a new way to reorganize data accesses and threads during run time to
reduce the influence of irregular computations on the throughput of massively
parallel processors. In addition, a novel kind of program transformations,
neighborhood-aware, exploiting non-uniform interactions among threads in on-chip
storage in a multi-socket multicore system. Together, the two techniques will
synergistically remove some important barriers for data-intensive dynamic
applications to tap into the full power of future computing systems. The outcome
from this research will provide essential support for enhancing the computing
efficiency of data-intensive dynamic applications in the era of heterogeneous
parallel systems. Because of the critical roles of these applications, this
research will help foster sustained advancement in science, commerce, health,
and other areas.
