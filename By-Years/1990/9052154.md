This project introduces Laser Electro-Optics/Fiber Optics and Engineering
Technology students to the properties of an Excimer Laser system. This system
(with wavelengths from 350nm to 175nm) can also be linked to a Dye Laser to
produce wavelengths below 175nm. This overall range is important because of the
current interest in applications in fusion, medicine, and thin films. Students
gain experience in determining the attenuation of ultraviolet wavelengths
through a variety of waveguides, testing different materials for absorption and
reflection properties, and the finding the effects on various animal tissue
samples and crystals. The award is being matched by an equal amount from the
principal investigator's institution.
