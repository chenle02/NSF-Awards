9712605 Dorman This ocean sciences instrumentation development project will
develop and test an acoustic seismic source which uses hydrostatic pressure
rather than explosives. The implosive device consists of a pressure case with a
hole on one end. The hole is covered with a special ceramic plate prior to
deployment. At depth, the plate is broken, causing an implosion, which in turn
produces a low-frequency acoustic signal for use in seafloor research
applications such as dealing with shallow shear velocity structures and short
refraction profiles. Work to be performed involves engineering tests and at-sea
trials to compare the acoustic signals from those from other types of sound
sources. The proposed implosive device would be safer than explosives and would
not be encumbered with regulatory restrictions.
