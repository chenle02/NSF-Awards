9354777 Alstad I am the author of an instructional software package designed to
support university courses in ecology and evolutionary biology. Development of
my present version, Populus 3.0, was funded by grants from IBM, the University
of Minnesota, and the NSF. It has proven to be an extremely successful
pedagogical tool here at Minnesota, and is currently in use at more than 350
institutions, worldwide. I request additional UCCD funding to pursue four major
objectives, including (1) improvement of the narrative text offered to explain
Populus models both on screen and in a companion book, (2) expanded coverage
with new models, (3) "porting" of the package to a new operating system, and (4)
an initiative to increase the use of Populus in small colleges. In addition to
these new efforts, I will continue to debug and maintain the program, and curate
the free distribution that will maximize its use. ***y
