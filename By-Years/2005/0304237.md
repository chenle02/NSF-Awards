Proposal Title: NER: Nanofluidics for Advanced Separation and Detection of
Biomolecules&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: CTS-0304237&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: Sang Han&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of New
Mexico&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the project is to
fabricate versatile, hybrid microfluidic systems for high throughput
bioanalysis. An experimental study of biomolecular transport in nanoscale
structures, including the effects of electrophoretic and entropic forces in
nanostructures will be performed. The envisioned analytical system consists of
nanochannels for bioseparation, peripheral microchannels for analyte delivery
and recovery, and an integrated optical detection system. The detection system
includes fluorescence spectroscopy, surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy, and
multiple internal reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. In terms
of the broader impacts, the PIs will help develop courses in optics,
spectroscopic imaging, and biosensing. Outreach to high schools and
underrepresented groups is planned. The nanomachined waveguides may provide
exceptional sensitivity to detect biomolecules for numerous biotechnology
applications. This project is co-funded by the Thermal Transport and Thermal
Processing Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
