Abstract&lt;br/&gt;VanBerkum&lt;br/&gt;0416472&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proper
functioning within the nervous system requires neurons to extend axons over long
distances to make connections with their target cells (other neurons, muscle
etc.). The extension of axons is a dynamic, motile process. Cell surface
receptor proteins detect attractive or repulsive cues that guide the axon to its
target. Receptors initiate biochemical signaling cascades inside the cell that
regulate the motile machinery - essentially actin and myosin interactions. In
this proposal, VanBerkum's goal is to identify the signaling pathways used by an
axon to regulate myosin activity downstream of both attractive and repulsive
signals used to guide an axon at the midline of the developing fruit fly embryo.
By using a combination of classic and modern molecular genetic approaches, and
assaying axon pathway formation, VanBerkum's lab will build and use several
reagents to help identify how three different signaling pathways contribute to
the regulation of myosin activity during axon pathway formation. Each of these
three signaling pathways are suspected to regulate aspects of motility, and this
work focuses on the individual and combined use of these pathways in guiding an
axons response to selected cues. Given the universality of these signaling
pathways, this work may impact our understanding of several other motile
processes during embryonic development, as well as motile processes in adults
including for example, immune cell migration toward invading organisms or
metastasis of cancer cells. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this
project includes the training of several graduate students and participation in
outreach programs targeting minority undergraduates and area high school
students. VanBerkum also directs the graduate program within his department.
