The principal investigator will consider several mathematical models of
heterogeneity in cell populations. Heterogeneity is the broad distribution and
rapid dispersion of characteristics of cells growing in populations. This is a
collaborative project between a mathematician and a biologist. The main
mathematical tools used will be the theory of branching processes for the
stochastic features and the theory of operator semigroups for the deterministic
(structural) features of the models.
