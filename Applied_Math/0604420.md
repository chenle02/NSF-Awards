The investigators collaborate in developing mathematical methods that improve
the understanding of dynamic behavior in complex nonlinear systems. The focus is
on the universal trend to self-similarity, or dynamic scaling, in a variety of
physical settings, such as clustering of colloids in physical chemistry,
selection of nonlinear waves in fluid mechanics and models of population
biology, and coarsening of nanoscale islands in materials science. The goal is
to devise a unified framework for the treatment of these problems based on
methods from dynamical systems, partial differential equations, and probability
theory. The work is driven by close analogies between the mathematical ideas of
infinite divisibilty and limit theorems for heavy-tailed distributions in
probability theory, and apparently unrelated problems of dynamic scaling and
selection in these diverse physical settings.

Progress in this program leads to deeper understanding of how order emerges
from complexity in a variety of problems of fundamental scientific interest in
the areas of aerosol physics, fluid mechanics, materials science, and physical
chemistry. The work on island coarsening promises to improve the physical
modeling of nanoscale step-terrace structures on crystalline surfaces. The work
on coagulation aims to improve our understanding of models for the formation of
clouds, smoke, dust and haze, which is of potential environmental importance. A
significant outcome is to link progress on apparently unconnected problems with
a basic mathematical framework that ties together probability and dynamical
systems theory and that broadly facilitates the transfer of insights from one
area to another.
