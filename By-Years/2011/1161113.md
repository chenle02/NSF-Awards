The Ensuring Early Mathematics Success for STEM Majors (EEMS) initiative
integrates academic support and intervention services to increase graduation
rates among 1) STEM majors who transfer from other institutions, 2) incoming
freshmen at risk of failing first-year mathematics courses, and 3) students in
the general population who underperform in first-year and subsequent mathematics
courses. In order to improve student performance and reduce the risk of course
failure, attrition, or increased time to degree the EEMS initiative includes
summer bridge programs for transferring STEM majors and entering freshman STEM
majors at risk of failing first-year mathematics courses and Peer-led Team
Learning (PLTL) for all STEM majors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The EEMS Initiative
seeks to increase persistence rates among the identified at-risk groups to match
the current first-year STEM major persistence rate (80.9%), which will produce
an increase of at least 66 STEM graduates per year. Underrepresented minority
students are overrepresented among these at risk students, suggesting the
program will have a proportionally larger impact on retention and graduation
rates for this group. In addition to traditional journal and conference venues
for dissemination, faculty from institutions in the Urban Massachusetts LSAMP
and other interested institutions are invited to observe the program and
participate in PLTL workshops.&lt;br/&gt;
