The college is a public, Hispanic-serving, two-year associate degree granting
college charged with advancing the state's economic development by educating a
skilled workforce. The vast majority of the residents in the College's service
area are of Hispanic origin, reflecting the College's 87% Hispanic student
population. Students receive an associate of applied science degree in one of
four areas: Biomedical Engineering Technology, Electro Mechanical Engineering
Technology, Electronic Engineering Technology, and Telecommunications
Technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award recipients are being selected on the
basis of a submitted application, interviews, a written statement on choosing an
engineering related field, and assessment of career goals. A campus National
Science Foundation (NSF) Scholarship Committee selects qualified students for
awards. Awarded students maintain a 3.0 GPA and if they continue in an
engineering-related field until graduation, they remain eligible for the
scholarship award.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scholarship awards are being
integrated into the overall recruitment and retention efforts of the college. As
a result of additional funding, specific initiatives for outreach and
recruitment to Hispanic families, Texas Workforce Commission, and parental
involvement centers are ready to be implemented. Intensive retention strategies
such as assessment methods using the Noel-Levitz Retention Management System,
intrusive academic advising, a structured first year student success course,
supplemental instruction, tutoring and mentoring, and the establishment of
learning assistance centers provide awarded students with a strong retention
infrastructure for student success as measured by persistence until
graduation.&lt;br/&gt;
