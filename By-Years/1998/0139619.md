The Experiences in Molecular Biology Academic Research Careers (EMBARC) Program
at UMBC offers a focused, comprehensive ten-week residential summer research
program to ten undergraduates recruited from two and four year colleges. This
program, which is supported by the National Science Foundation as one of its
Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites, offers a $3,000 student
summer stipend with paid campus housing and program activities. EMBARC Trainees
will be paired with faculty mentors to guide their individual research projects,
which will be focused on the Structure and Function of Biological Molecules.
Faculty mentors will be drawn from three departments at UMBC: Biological
Sciences, Chemistry and Biochemistry, and Chemical and Biochemical
Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EMBARC Trainees will work closely with their
faculty research mentors to ensure the quality of the student experience. In
addition to conducting individual research projects, EMBARC Trainees will
participate in an Ethics in Science Course and a GRE Preparation Course
stressing math and verbal skills. To enhance research training and promote the
pursuit of post baccalaureate education, each EMBARC Trainee will also be paired
with a graduate student peer mentor, who will be selected from underrepresented
groups in the sciences whenever possible. They will participate in field trips
and team building activities with other undergraduate researchers, mentors and
peer mentors. Program outcomes include the creation of student portfolios and
presentation of research projects at an end-of-the-summer Research Fest. Parents
and advisors/mentors from home institutions will be invited to the Research
Fest, which will showcase each student's efforts and will encourage continued
support for post program research activities and the pursuit of careers in
science. &lt;br/&gt;
