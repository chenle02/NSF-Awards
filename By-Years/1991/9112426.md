The goal of this research is to provide power supply designers with a more
realistic and practical design methodology that will enable them to meet design
specifications of the present and future applications in aerospace and
industrial concerns. The design strategy results in converters with smaller
weight and volume, reduced device stresses with the highest possible system
efficiency. These goals are achieved by solving a multiobjective optimization
formulation that provides the Pareto-optimum designs for the diverse and non-
commensurable objectives of the designer.
