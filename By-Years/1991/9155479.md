This project will enable 30 secondary teachers, 15 graduate students and 15
faculty from primarily undergraduate institutions to participate in the 27th
International Geographical Congress. The main Congress will be held in
Washington, D.C., August 9-14, 1992. Participant support will enable teachers to
attend the main Congress plus participate in scientific field seminars around
the United States immediately before or immediately after the main Congress. The
Congress will have a special session on U.S. Geographical Education. A 14-volume
set of guidebooks will be produced. These will be useful to participants in the
field seminars and as instructional materials to enhance the teaching of
geography. Following the Congress, participants will become members of an IGU
Commission, form a network to share resources and teaching ideas, lead peer
workshops and prepare a report in 1993 for submission to the USNC/IGU. The PI
for this project is Dr. Anthony de Souza. Cost sharing will exceed 20% of the
NSF award.
