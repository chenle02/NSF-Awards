The Earth Science department is developing a microcomputer-based laboratory to
augment capabilities in undergraduate remote sensing/geographic information
systems (GIS) education and research. Networking of three Map and Image
Processing Systems workstations and peripheral hardware and supporting software
will provide students with training and instruction in the acquisition,
processing, and displaying of spatial digital data. Importation of
satellite/airborne data from computer compatible tapes using an open reel tape
deck will enable greater access to information stored on 9- track tapes and will
introduce the student to a variety of data sources and formats. A digitizing
tablet will permit students to generate data bases from readily available
hardcopy sources for subsequent analysis via image processing and GIS modules. A
laser printer will provide high quality graphics output suitable for classroom
presentations and research reports. This equipment will improve the quality of
remote sensing and GIS coursework and research done by students in earth
science, earth science education, geography/cartography and geology, enhancing
their preparation for graduate work and professional employment. The university
will match the award with an equal amount of funds.
