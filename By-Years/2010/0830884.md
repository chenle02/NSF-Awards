Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides scholarships
for students seeking undergraduate degrees in Information Assurance (IA). Each
scholarship is for the last two years of a student's degree program. Students
are engaged in team-based projects -- motivated, for example, by the power grid,
avionics systems, and enterprise computing -- in which they build example
applications using the latest computer security techniques. Upon graduation,
scholarship recipients must work for a Federal government agency in an IA
position. This scholarship program is helping to address the nation's need for
qualified information technology professionals working in government agencies.
The project involves outreach to minorities and to two-year college transfer
students.&lt;br/&gt;
