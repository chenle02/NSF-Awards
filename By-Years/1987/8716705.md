The U.S.-Japan Coordinated Program from Masonry Building Research is the third
in a series of joint structural research projects done under the auspices of the
Panel on Wind and Seismic Effects on UJNR. Research in the U.S. began in the
mid-fall of 1985 and is progressing well. The Japanese research began
approximately 18 months earlier and is also in good order. Joint meetings are
held every year, alternating between countries, for the purpose of exchanging
ideas and information to the benefit of both countries. This project would
support attendance of nine U.S. researchers at the next meeting in Japan. In
addition, there will be opportunities for the U.S. delegation to witness
Japanese masonry construction, masonry unit manufacture and the set-up of the
full-scale test of a five-story masonry building.
