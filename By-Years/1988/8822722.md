This research is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of spectroscopy. This research involves an examination of
fluorescence detection of laser photofragmentation products as an analytical
measurement tool. Such an approach should be useful for molecules which are
normally not fluorescent. Specific areas of study include 1) fragmentation
fluorescence spectrometry (FFS) of volatile metal chelates, 2) pulsed supersonic
expansion for high analytical selectivity in laser photolysis-FFS (LP-FFS) via
photofragmentation, 3) evaluation of the "remote sensing" capabilities of LP-
FFS, 4) LP-FFS of relatively large nonvolatile molecules, 5) the utility of
matrix isolation for increased sensitivity in LP-FFS measurements, and 6) FFS as
a gas chromatographic detector. This research examines the utility of analytical
measurements using laser fragmentation of non-fluorescent molecules followed by
fluorescence detection of the fragments. Such an approach allows the
fluorescence detection of molecules which are normally not fluorescent.
