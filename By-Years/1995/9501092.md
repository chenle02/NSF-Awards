DMS-9501092 PI: Li Li will investigate a new approach to the problem of
exhaustion of automorphic forms based on recent work by Sarnak. This approach
does not make use of Fourier coefficients and is applicable to groups of small
rational rank, including anisotropic groups. It involves the study of matrix
coefficients, small representations of p-adic groups, and some Diophantine
problems. The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian
mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in twentieth century
mathematics. As the mathematical vehicle for exploiting the symmetries inherent
in a system, the representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact
upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number theory, and upon
theoretical physics, especially quantum mechanics and elementary particle
physics.
