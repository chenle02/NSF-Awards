In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the NSF Chemistry
Division, Professor Mark Mascal of the Department of Chemistry at the University
of California Davis is exploring fundamental aspects of molecular curvature and
electronics. This project has the potential to substantially contribute to
applied material science because of the relevance of curved aromatic surfaces in
the area of nanotechnology. The broader impacts in terms of training and
diversity lie in the program's interdisciplinary nature, encompassing organic
synthesis, noncovalent bonding, coordination chemistry, reactive intermediates,
hypervalency, aromaticity, crystallography, theoretical chemistry, and
nanotechnology. Principal educational deliverables are the incorporation of
research into undergraduate chemistry laboratory courses and the promotion of
undergraduate research, particularly involving under-represented groups, through
the involvement in dedicated, university-sponsored programs. Outreach involves
participation in the NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates program, ACS
Project SEED, the UC Davis Youth Scholars Program, and the UC COSMOS program.

The project involves synthesizing organic polycycles that enclose volumes of
space, from concave, to hemispherical, to completely closed shell bodies. The
research program revolves around the triquinane molecular framework, which
comprises three rings fused together in a rigid, puckered arrangement. Key
features of synthetic interest are the oxidation of heterotriquinanes to bowl-
shaped aromatic hemi-fullerene fragments, and the prospect of building up such
structures into spherical heterododecahedranes. The triquinane platform also
stabilizes chemical species that are normally seen only as reactive
intermediates, such as tertiary oxonium salts, oxonium ylides, and even
tetravalent oxadionium ions.
