This award supports the planning a multi-university, multi-disciplinary
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Safety, Security
and Rescue Robots (C-SSRR). C-SSRR will bring together industry, academe, and
public sector users together to provide integrative robotics and artificial
intelligence solutions for activities conducted by the police, FBI, FEMA,
firefighters, transportation safety officials, and emergency responders to mass
casualty-related activities. The need for SSRR has accelerated in the aftermath
of 9/11 and a new research community is forming, as witnessed by the first IEEE
Workshop on Safety, Security and Rescue Robotics in February
2003.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center will be built upon the knowledge and
expertise of multi-disciplinary researchers in computer science, engineering,
industrial organization, psychology, public health, and marine sciences at the
University of South Florida and the University of Minnesota. Together, the two
institutions support a research program in control of vehicles, human-robot
interaction, and sensors and sensor fusion combined with rapid prototyping
capabilities and access to users and high-fidelity testing sites throughout the
country.&lt;br/&gt;
