9312146 Xu and Haynes The proposed project is to develop a prototype bilingual
(English-Chinese) herbarium database of the plant collections at Sun Yatsen
University in China. Through cooperation between researchers at the University
of Alabama and the Sun Yatsen University in Guangzhou, China, the existing
inventory of approximately 150,000 specimens at the Sun Yatsen Herbarium will be
entered into a computer database which is accessible in both English and
Chinese. This may serve as a prototype for other bilingual herbarium databases.
This is particularly important for US researchers who currently have very
limited access to information in China's herbaria, which include collections
from not only China but also Southeast Asia, a vital area for tropical
biodiversity. The project is expected to result in a database in English
summarizing the label information of all plant collections at the Herbarium and
in software that provides an interface for Chinese and English database
management.
