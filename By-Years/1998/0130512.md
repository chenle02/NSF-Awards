This work involves the continued development and application of models for
recognition memory. The first phase included formulation of the architecture and
basic processing modules of a recognition model based on general theories of
classification and memory; the model has been formulated with special attention
to usefulness in increasing the informativeness of measures extracted from
recognition data. A major published application reported a study of how
performance on a test of recognition of an item or event depends on past
frequencies of encounters with the same or similar stimuli and on presence or
absence of positive or negative payoffs for correct responses on previous tests.
The major result reported was that performance in recognition is not simply a
matter of matching perceived with remembered stimulus patterns, but is
influenced by many of the same conditions that control goal-directed behavior.
At this juncture, a new set of benchmark experiments has been completed and is
ready for model-based analysis. Several of the experiments were addressed to the
problem of how prior familiarity with stimuli such as words or faces affects
their recognition in a new situation; others deal with ways of enhancing the
precision of measurement of the way factors such as stimulus frequency, stimulus
exposure duration, and retention interval affect performance in situations that
simulate eyewitness identification. Results from this series of experiments are
ready for model-based analyses, which will be very computationally demanding,
because all models and model versions examined will be fitted to the data of
individual subjects, typically 30 to 80 in number per experiment. In all of this
work, there will be major attention to advancing methodology for dealing with
artifacts of averaging data and to communicating theoretical results in forms
available to potential users in education, medicine, and technology.
