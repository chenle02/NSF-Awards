With this Research at Undergraduate Institutions award, the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program provides renewed support for the research of
Professor Daniel J. O'Leary, of the Department of Chemistry at Pomona College.
Professor O'Leary will carry out a number of synthetic and conformational
studies, addressing issues of hydrogen bonding and polypeptide conformation.
Isotopic perturbation techniques for hydrogen bond detection by NMR will be
applied to the analysis of arrays of hydrogen bonds involving hydroxyl groups,
and the utility of tritium NMR for detecting OH/OH hydrogen bonds will be
assayed. The possibility of using hydrogen bond-mediated scalar couplings to
assign the relative stereochemistry of acyclic 1,3-diols will be explored, and
analysis of isotopic perturbation of the rotameric distribution of methyl groups
in compounds supporting N--DH2C interactions may lead to direct NMR techniques
for the configurational assignment of chiral methyl groups (R-CHDT). Solution
conformations of conformationally constrained polypeptides and their
unconstrained analogs will be analyzed for cross-linked 3/10 helical peptides
synthesized via an olefin metathesis approach.

With the support of a Research at Undergraduate Institutions award from the
Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Daniel J. O'Leary, of
the Department of Chemistry at Pomona College, is carrying out a program of
synthesis and analytical methods to study hydrogen bonds and other novel weak
inter- and intramolecular interactions. Water is the fundamental biological
solvent, and proteins, nucleic acids, and sugars are the three fundamental
biopolymers. All three rely on hydrogen bonds and directed non-covalent
interactions to attain their optimal structures. Understanding the nature of the
interactions that control their structures is of fundamental importance, and
forms the basis of Professor O'Leary's studies, which are carried out with
undergraduate students under this Research at Undergraduate Institutions award.
