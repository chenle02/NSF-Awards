9451723 Stephenson-Hawk The comprehensive academic, research, and outreach
program in Earth System Science (ESS) is continuing to be strengthened through
the enhancement of the ESS laboratory. Earth System Science is the
interdisciplinary study of the earth, as a system, and its component parts,
which include the atmosphere, maritime regions, biological and hydraulic cycles,
and geographic features, their interaction and evolution. The overall motivation
for a program of study in Earth System Science is to expose a large segment of
the University's faculty and students to the multidisciplinary nature of the
subject while simultaneously increasing the numbers of minority students
pursuing careers in this and related areas. A laboratory that is used to
accompany a recently developed course entitled "Introduction to Earth System
Sciences" is being further developed and equipped. This course targets (1) first
and second year students that are interested in pursuing ESS careers or are
interested in learning more about the environment in which they live, (2)
elementary and secondary education majors that will eventually teach in our
nation's classrooms, and (3) students that need a laboratory science course to
fulfill their requirements for a bachelor's degree. The requested equipment,
coined, educational development workstations, allows the inclusion of
interactive, multimedia based teaching modules in our developing Earth System
Science program.
