This study is designed to test the hypothesis that the basal metabolic rate of
Mongolian pastoral nomads is accurately predicted by the equations developed by
the World Health Organization (WHO) for use throughout the world. The basal
metabolic rate is the minimum energy required to maintain life, and is a major
proportion of total human energy needs. According to the WHO, the prediction
equations are applicable regardless of the climate in which the population lives
and regardless of seasonal variation in temperature stress. However, there is
considerable evidence that the basal metabolic rate of indigenous populations
varies inversely with temperature. Mongolia provides a natural laboratory for
testing this ongoing scientific debate. This study will measure basal metabolic
rate, diet, and cold exposure in male and female Mongolian pastoral nomads 18
years of age and older who live in a cold, high latitude climate with seasonally
extreme cold stress. It will add to the knowledge of factors influencing basal
metabolic rate in human populations and to the ongoing scientific discussion as
to whether basal metabolic rate is a universal trait in humans influenced only
by age, sex, and body weight, or whether it adapts to environmental factors such
as cold stress.
