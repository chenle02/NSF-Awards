9413490 Marzke This award provides support to purchase a 300 MHZ Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectrometer, equippped with a wide- bore
superconducting magnet and configured for nuclear magnetic relaxation and
spectroscopic studies in solids and liquids. The principal mission of the
instrument is to allow powerful, modern NMR techniques to be applied to the
investigation of a new class of electrolytes recently introduced and patented by
the co-principal investigator, comprised of mixtures of lithium ion conducting
salts and polymers. These materials have shown genuine promise for use in
battery applications, but many of their properties are still not understood, and
NMR offers the best means of studying their macroscopic behavior from a
microscopic point of view. This instrument will greatly enhance this group's
ability to define the structures of, and the relative ion mobilities in, this
new class of electrolytes. ***
