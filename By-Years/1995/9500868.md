DMS-9500868 Newman The first part is focussed on first-passage percolation and
on such related topics as ground states of disordered ferromagnets and polymers
in random media. The second part involves the recently uncovered connection
between invasion percolation and dynamics in random energy landscapes. The
research in several areas is proposed where the mathematics of probability
theory overlaps with that of materials science and statistical physics. Part of
this work will be in collaboration with the students and concerns microscopic
fluctuations of growing surfaces. Part will be in collaboration with the
physicist and concerns the behavior in time of complex systems.
