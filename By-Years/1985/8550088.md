This Leadership Activities project will provide enhancement and professional
development experiences for 20 exemplary high school mathematics teachers from
the Nassau County, New York area. The overall goals of the multiyear project
involve the updating and deepening of the participants' mathematical backgrounds
and teaching methodology, the networking of the participants, the conduct of in-
service workshops by the participants in their home schools, the dissemination
of the project materials and results to nearby school systems, and the
investigation of the modelistic approach within a carefully planned
documentation, assessment and evaluation effort. The second year of the project
will involve 40 additional exemplary teachers.
