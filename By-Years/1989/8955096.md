Undergraduate education in the sciences and mathematics faces a number of
challenges. Three comments relate to this. First a climate which encourages
scholarly and creative activities related to teaching often does not exist in
major research institutions. University administrators can play a leading role
in changing that climate. Second, easing the constrictions in the pipeline at
the level of undergraduate science students is in the national interest. Third,
it is also of highest importance to create in the nonscience major an awareness
of the importance of science and technology in our individual and collective
lives. This conference explores the opportunities for curricular reform in major
research universities at the undergraduate level.
