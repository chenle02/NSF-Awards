The goal of the research is to develop a precise mathematical model (based on a
piecewise-deterministic Markov process) for the uncertainties in capacity
expansion planning and to study the construction of optimal plans with this
framework by means of stochastic control theory. To provide a concrete context
for the Phase I work, the research plan is directed toward the specific capacity
expansion plans faced by electric utilities. The investigator plans to achieve
the research goal by: (a) formulating a representative class of capacity
expansion problems using demand and completion time data from electric
utilities; (b) determining optimal controls or investment strategies for these
problems using analytic and numerical techniques; and, (c) implementing these
optimization techniques on a computer and generating a set of clear,
illustrative examples of their effectiveness. Successful completion of these
objectives will demonstrate the feasibility of extending the approach to a
prototype capacity expansion decision aid. An optimization technique for
generation expansion planning would have direct application to determining
reserve margins, adopting new technologies, selecting units sizes, and ensuring
reliability. In addition, such a technique would provide important leverage for
addressing complex capacity expansion problems in other industries.
