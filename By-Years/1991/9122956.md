The oceanographic instrumentation program supports requests to acquire
instrumentation for the collection, processing and analysis of oceanographic
data. This proposal from Texas A&amp;M University requests funding for equipment
that will be used to support NSF- funded research cruises on several of the
ships in the oceanographic fleet, particularly the MOANA WAVE, the THOMAS
WASHINGTON and the NEW HORIZON. The PI's propose to collaborate with scientists
at the University of Hawaii and Scripps Institute of Oceanography to upgrade the
digital seismic systems used at all three institutions. The upgraded systems
will consist of a SUN SPARCstation with output to either 8mm or 4mm tape. The
new systems will be significantly smaller and more portable than the current
systems, and the storage media (Exabyte or DAT tapes) will be cheaper and
significantly smaller than the currently used storage media (9-track tapes).
Three systems will be developed and made available for use by the scientific
community.
