This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Project will investigate the
feasibility of a novel modular image processing architecture. The proposed
system will be designed to be compatible with existing microprocessor
architectures to allow for commercial product development and market entry in
the near future. Additional benefits of the system over existing image
processing methods are increased processing speed, on-chip stereo and motion
correspondence computation, low power consumption, reduced size (stand-alone or
MCM packaged chips) and cost. The work involves research in analytical
foundations, as well as experimentation and simulation with a variety of
algorithms that can be implemented in hardware. This broad scope of
investigations will lead to a better understanding of the issues involved in the
actual construction of an image processor and enhance the level of success
during Phase II prototype development.
