*** 9760545 Smith This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project will
demonstrate feasibility of a new high energy x-ray target technology allowing
linear accelerator sources to operate at twice the brightness of current
sources. By incorporating an innovative approach to removing heat, the target
can handle the increased power load with no increase in the peak temperatures
which limit the target performance. The increase in brightness will increase
throughput and/or improve image resolution for computed tomography (CT) systems.
The objective for Phase I is to demonstrate, on thin targets, that the bond
between the target and the cooling substrate can withstand the repeated thermal
transients generated when the target absorbs energy from intense electron
pulses. Successful demonstration of the bond strength will lead to a Phase II
extension of this technique to the thick targets required for commercial high
energies. The enhanced performance of CT systems will accelerate the acceptance
of CT as an important component of the rapidly growing agile-manufacturing and
rapid-prototyping industries. Additional applications are anticipated in the
medical and industrial imaging industries. ***
