This project establishes a modern facility that will allow students to capture,
quantify, analyze, and present visual images obtained from a variety of sources.
The project greatly enhances the education of students by facilitating and
promoting the "hands-on" investigations critical to understanding how science is
done. Student researchers capture images of objects such as tissue sections, and
fluorescing cells, and quantify these images quickly and easily to test a wide
diversity of functional, developmental and evolutionary hypotheses. The imaging
facility includes MacIntosh Quadra computer workstations equipped with video
cameras and software for image acquisition, manipulation, and reconstruction,
and for statistical data analysis.
