This research addresses the study of an algorithm called Arithmetic Fourier
Transform (AFT) for accurate high-speed Fourier analysis and synthesis. The AFT
is based on the number theoretic method of Mobius Inversion . Its computations
proceed in parallel and except for a small number of scalings in one stage of
the computation, uses only multiplications by 0, +1 and -1. Work is being
carried out in studying the properties of this transform and quantifying the
advantages of this transform in comparison to other approaches to Fourier
analysis.
