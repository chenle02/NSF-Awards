The research will focus on the geometric and computational issues that arise in
the design and implementation of integrated, programmable (i.e., flexible) and
highly automated systems for the design, analysis, manufacturing, inspection and
assembly of discrete goods. Important capabilities not available in current
solid modelers will be developed, and novel applications of solid modeling to
design and production will be investigated. Two high-priority topics will be
addressed: (1) modeling and reasoning about geometric uncertainty, and (2)
automatic extraction of machinable features from geometric models. Additional,
lower-priority research topics are (3) constraint-based mechanical design, (4)
incorporation of Minkowski operations in solid modelers, (5) algorithms for
hardware implementation, (6) conversion of boundary representations to
constructive solid geometry, and (7) modeler support for mobile robot
navigation.
