This award is concerned with a broad range of research in gravitational physics,
including research projects in classical general relativity and quantum field
theory in curved spacetime. The main aim of this research is to obtain a deeper
understanding of the implications of Einstein's theory of general relativity for
phenomena involving black holes, as well as the nature of quantum phenomena in
strong gravitational fields. The research will involve the direct participation
of graduate students in all aspects of the research, and it will thereby
contribute to their training. The areas of research associated with this award
are of considerable interest to the public, and activities will be undertaken,
such as giving public lectures, that aid in the dissemination of scientific
knowledge to the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific research topics
proposed include: (i) an analysis of the quantum field infrared divergences
associated with the classical memory effect, specifically (a) whether suitable
"in" and "out" Hilbert spaces incorporating memory can be defined and (b) the
decoherence effects of "soft gravitons"; (ii) an analysis of whether the quantum
stress-energy tensor must always be singular on a Cauchy horizon, thereby
enforcing strong cosmic censorship; (iii) an analysis of whether local and
covariant "flow relations" can be obtained for the operator product expansion of
interacting quantum fields; (iv) an analysis of the limitations on position
measurements of a particle resulting from vacuum fluctuations of a quantum field
with which it interacts; (v) an analysis of approximate Poincare invariance in
discrete spacetime models; and (vi) an investigation of whether and how one can
make sense of mathematically ill posed equations that are intended to represent
effective field theories for alternatives to general
relativity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
