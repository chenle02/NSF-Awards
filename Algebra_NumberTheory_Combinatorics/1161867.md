To every classical algebra (associative, commutative, Lie) one can assign its
homotopy version. In a homotopy version, axioms of the original algebra hold
only up to a homotopy and the corresponding homotopy operators are considered as
a part of this algebraic structure. These homotopy operators are supposed to
satisfy their own coherence laws also up to homotopy and so on. The PI continues
his research on homotopy algebras related to Deligne's conjecture on Hochschild
complexes and various generalizations of Kontsevich's formality theorem. The PI
will continue his work on stable formality quasi-isomorphisms and their homotopy
classes. The PI will continue his joint work with D. Tamarkin and B. Tsygan on
homotopy calculus structure on Hochschild complexes and apply results to the
algebraic index theorem for formal deformations. The PI (jointly with V.
Ginzburg) is going to establish a link between homotopy calculus algebras and
homotopy BV algebras and apply the results to deformation theory of Calabi-Yau
algebras. Finally, the PI is going to investigate a higher categorical structure
on homotopy algebras.

Homotopy algebras appear in various problems of algebraic topology, algebraic
geometry, deformation theory, and mathematical physics. The PI's work on
homotopy algebras is motivated by quantization: a process of constructing
quantum versions of models of classical mechanics. The project will enhance our
understanding of fundamental principles which underpin quantum theory and their
links to other branches of mathematics. The PI works with graduate students and
postdoctoral researchers, and runs research oriented seminars. The P.I. invites
mathematicians from the US and from abroad to speak at the colloquium and at the
algebra seminar at Temple University. Talks of invitees give graduate students
an opportunity to be exposed to current problems in mathematics.
