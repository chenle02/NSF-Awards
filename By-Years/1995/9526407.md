Abstract: The proposed planning grant is designed to develop a major research
proposal to characterize three of the world's largest copper deposits, located
in central Chile. The deposits are higher grade, an order of magnitude larger,
and distinct in alteration style relative to the well- studied copper deposits
of western North America. Varied erosional levels in the three deposits provide
different and complementary information about zonation and ore deposition
processes. The planning grant will fund visits to each deposit in order to
coordinate access and logistics, examine and collect drill core, and make
preliminary assesments of the suitability of samples for chronologic and
petrologic analyses. The resulting project will involve much more comprehensive
field and laboratory studies, including petrology, geochronology, and fluid
inclusion studies, to deduce the anatomy and origin of the deposits.
