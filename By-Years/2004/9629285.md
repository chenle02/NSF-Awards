9629285 Sosinsky This is a Career Advancement Award for Women Scientists and
Engineers. The project concerns gap junctions, which are gated membrane channels
between paired cells in multicellular animals which allow for intercellular
communication and exchange of small metabolites and ions. The channels consist
of two paired hexamers of the protein, connexin, with one hemichannel
contributed from each cell of the pair. The connexins are a family of related
proteins with a common folding motif. Different connexins can be found in the
same tissue, and different connexins can be localized to the same gap junctional
plaques (patches of membrane with abundant junctions). Sometimes connexons
composed of different connexins can dock together, presumably due to
conservation of the extracellular domains of the proteins. However, not all
connexins can pair with other connexins, giving rise to selectivity between
different connexins. Gap junctions can be considered an example of a naturally
occurring two dimensional quasi-crystal. The packing and numbers of channels
that pack in gap junctions are important factors in communication between two
neighboring cells of a tissue. The overall goal of this project is to image gap
junction assemblies within whole cells. Specifically, the aim is to spatially
map the size, location and packing of gap junctions within cells. This will
involve immunocytochemical techniques, confocal microscopy and tomography, as
well as advanced image analysis of the three-dimensional reconstructions to
determine models of packing and organization. The model system to be employed is
the liver, because there is a great deal of background information available for
connexin32 gap junctions in liver. In addition, these techniques will be applied
to patterns of expression of Cx26 in liver. Subsequently, the methods and
results developed with the liver tissue system will be applied to other tissue
systems, such as heart tissue and Schwann cells. ***
