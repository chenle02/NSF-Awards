This project in computer networking concerns traffic integration in the
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) layer, particularly problems relating to
bandwidth allocation and traffic control. The investigator has proposed an ATM
traffic control framework, a central portion of which is the traffic control
module (TCM). The effort involves: i) analytical and experimental work on
traffic characterization, ii) TCM parameter evaluation and engineering, iii)
performance analysis of the TCM serving statistically multiplexed call sequences
and class definition, iv) scheduling multiple traffic classes, v) deterministic
description of an incoming call sequence in terms of the parameters of the TCM,
vi) creation of a UNIX-based prototyping environment on which the evolving
traffic control framework can be tested, experimented with, and demonstrated.
