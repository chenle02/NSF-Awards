This research evaluates the feasibility of producing a Non-Destructive
Evaluation (NDE) expert system. The study will incorporate elements of computer-
enhanced ultrasonic signal processing, artificial intelligence "learning"
capability, state-of-the-art fracture mechanics analytical tools, and all
relevant metallurgical and design data necessary to emulate the decisions of the
panel(s) of experts typically involved in generating and dispositioniong NDE
data. The demonstration system will serve as a model for the development of a
general purpose, prototype NDE expert system.
