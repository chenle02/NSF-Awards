This project enables students to learn physical size characterization of
particles, real time data acquisition, data manipulation and graphic display
using a computer controlled particle size analyzer This project broadens and
strengthens the educational exposure of both the environmental engineering and
the occupational safety and health students by creating a modern particle
technology teaching laboratory. This award is being matched by an equal amount
from the principal investigator's institution.
