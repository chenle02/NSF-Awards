This proposal seeks support for an analytical instrument designed to separate
and quantify lipid classes. The instrument, known commercially as an Iatroscan,
combines two principles: thin-layer chromatography (TLC) with flame ionization
detection (FID). The advent of the Iatroscan, less than a decade ago, made
possible sensitive, rapid quantitation of lipid classes from planktonic
organisms, seston, and sediments. Lipid class composition from as little as a
single copepod can be analyzed, now permitting lipids to be used as a tool in
the study of population biology. Purchase of an Iatroscan will permit one study
to be completed and a preliminary exploration conducted as a foundation for
future research. First, the effects of an oceanic front on copepod nutrition
will be evaluated. The hypothesis will be tested that interspecific differences
exist in nutritional responses of 3 suspension-feeding copepods to the Ensenada
front, a persistent, deep-water frontal system in the California Current. The
species of interest are Eucalanus californicus, Metridia pacifica, and Calanus
pacificus californicus. Storage lipids (wax esters, triacylglycerols) and gut
fluorescence will be used as "condition factors," to assess the nutritional
status of these 3 species on a series of lines that intersect the frontal
region. Secondly, the possibility that vertically subdivided copepod populations
can be differentiated by lipid profiles will be explored. The latter issue bears
on the problem of the continuous/discontinuous character of zooplankton
population growth as well as the vertical transport of lipids by migratory
zooplankton. Both the effects of the Ensenda front on zooplankton nutrition and
the vertical lipid variation study will be done with existing zooplankton
samples that were collected for this purpose and frozen during cruises in 1988
(ZBI and Fronts '88).
