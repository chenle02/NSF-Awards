*** 96-60634 Vreeke This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
Project will develop a total organic carbon (TOC) analyzer suitable for long
term, on-site monitoring. The analytical technique relies on the quantitative
oxidation of dissolved and suspended organics to carbon dioxide by the
photocatalytic action of titanium dioxide. The rapid equilibrium of the
resulting carbon dioxide with carbonate species allows it to be detected by a
conductivity measurement. The presence of preexisting, conducting inorganic
carbon species and dissolved ionic species will be accounted for using an
additional conductivity measurement before the titanium dioxide-catalyzed
photooxidation. The sensing strategy will require a differential conductivity
measurement. The benefit to this analytical approach is the absence of
consumables. Size of the analyzer will be minimized by integrating the fluid
handling and conductivity electrodes onto a silicon wafer. This will be
accomplished using a microlithography-created flow system and titanium dioxide
reaction chamber. The flow system's small dimensions and therefore small fluid
volumes will drastically reduce the power requirements and allow the entire
device to be contained in a portable unit. Commercial applications are expected
for sensors that enable rapid on-site determination of total organic carbon.
Such uses will be made in real-time monitoring in effluent streams from waste
treatment sites, power generation facilities, and chemical processing plants.
