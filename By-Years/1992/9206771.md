This award will provide two-thirds of the funding needed to acquire optical
microscopy equipment that will be housed in the Department of Geological
Sciences at Southern Methodist University. The University is committed to
providing the remaining funds necessary for the acquisition. The optical
equipment to be acquired consists of a Nomarski differential interference
contrast system which is particularly useful in the study of microscopic
textural features of rock- forming minerals such as compositional zoning and
dissolution surfaces in volcanic rocks. The Principal Investigator, colleagues,
and students in the Department of Geological Sciences at Southern Methodist
University are engaged in basic research on the growth of volcanos and the
record of their growth as seen in the microscopic details of crystal growth
patterns in lava.
