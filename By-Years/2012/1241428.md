This workshop, hosted by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications
(NCSA) and the Institute for Computing in Humanities, Arts and the Social
Sciences (I-CHASS), convenes leading practitioners and scholars of innovation to
collectively consider how education in the US might be reconfigured to both
support and teach innovation as a core curriculum mission, with a focus on STEM
education. Workshop participants identify and articulate strategies for creating
and sustaining learning environments that promise the development of innovative
thinking skills, behaviors and dispositions and that reward students, faculty
and administrator for practicing and tuning these skills. A wiki or other
private online space will be created where participants will be encouraged to
continue discussions or comment further on ideas generated over the course of
the workshop. Mapping social networks of and among participants provides
insights into how innovation practices are shared and spread across
relationships and networks. Findings from the workshop will be made available to
others through a public web site.
