Cluster varieties are certain highly symmetric and structured geometric spaces.
Over the last twenty years, cluster varieties have turned up throughout
geometry, representation theory and mathematical physics. Cluster algebras are
algebraic structures which allow us to compute with cluster varieties and
understand their structure. This research project pursues two lines of
investigation in order to better understand cluster varieties. The project
provides training opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first line of investigation is to construct
cluster structures on braid varieties, Richardson varieties, and related spaces.
These are geometric objects which originally arose in representation theory and
have recently been discovered to play important roles in knot theory.
Constructing cluster structures on these spaces will allow us to use all the
techniques from cluster theory to explore these spaces. The second line of
investigation is to develop relationships between cluster varieties and Coxeter
groups, which describe the symmetries of collections of reflecting mirrors. This
has been extensively done for cluster algebras "of finite type", which
correspond to Coxeter groups with finitely many reflections, but an analogous
story should exist for all cluster algebras, and this project proposes to
develop it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
