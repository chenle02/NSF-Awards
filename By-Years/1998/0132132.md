The Integrated Coastal Management Sustainability Education Project is designed
to help insure that&lt;br/&gt;future practitioners of coastal management are
well prepared to address the lack of sustainability of &lt;br/&gt;environmental
management processes in South-East Asia. In order to meet this goal, the
results&lt;br/&gt;from an ongoing research project which focuses on process
sustainability will be translated into&lt;br/&gt;educational materials, imbedded
into an ongoing distance learning program and disseminated to
the&lt;br/&gt;public over the Internet.
