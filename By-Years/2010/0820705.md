Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of stereotyping and prejudice is a
central research domain in social psychology. The reasons are apparent. Social
problems ranging from discrimination in housing or the workplace to genocide are
based on ingroup/outgroup categorizations and the stereotypes and attitudes
associated with those categories. The PI has conducted research in this area for
the past 15 years and has emphasized the fact that stereotypes serve as judgment
standards against which individual group members are evaluated. Indeed, the bulk
of this research has documented shifting standards effects in judgment and
behavior. The goal of the research proposed here is to examine the role of
stereotypes and shifting judgment standards in the communication and translation
of subjective language. The present proposal outlines 4 experimental studies to
examine the communication and translation of stereotype-based evaluations. A
unifying theme of the proposed research is that stereotypes exert a wide-ranging
influence on social life in that they pervade our language, our interpretations
of what others say and do, our decisions about others, and our thoughts about
ourselves. This research has clear possibilities for extension into domains as
diverse as political and health communication. In addition, the project research
will enhance the training of graduate and undergraduate students who will work
as research assistants.
