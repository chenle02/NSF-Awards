Modeling of functions and data approximation are two fundamental tools in
computational geometry, computer graphics, and data analytics. For example, when
an airplane wing is designed, rather than modeling the wing as one large object,
the wing is conceptually broken into a number of small triangles, computations
are performed on these small patches, and then the results are assembled back
together into a coherent result. This research project studies this technique,
and others like it, using tools from computational and symbolic algebra. Results
of the research are expected to advance theoretical understanding of these
approximations, as well as to provide potential speed-ups to computations used
in computer graphics and industrial design.

This research focuses on analysis and implementation of three central methods in
approximation theory and geometric modeling: generalized barycentric
coordinates, multidimensional splines, and polynomial interpolation. These
methods involve algebraic techniques; from the computational standpoint this
means that tools of symbolic algebra are applicable. The goal in all these
projects is to compute the dimension of some space of functions, generally in
terms of combinatorial and geometric data, and if possible to find a basis for
that space. The theoretical tools to be employed are homological algebra and
algebraic geometry; the investigations also use computation as a vehicle for
experiment. The project will result in development of specialized software,
which will be integrated into the Macaulay2 software package.
