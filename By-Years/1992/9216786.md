This project will study the processes governing the distribution of Be and B in
marine sediments. Once the behavior of these elements is understood, they have
the potential to serve as sensitive tracers of aqueous fluids in magma
generation, and will be especially useful in studying the origin of island arc
magmas. This project will quantify the occurrence of the elements and their
isotopes in porewaters and sediments from a wide range of marine sediment
lithologies and perform an experiment with labelled samples at high pressure and
temperature, in order to determine how the elements behave in hydrothermal
systems.
