In this proposal Dr. McCarty explores the regulatory mechanism which controls
and integrates expression of diverse developmental responses related to seed
maturation in maize. Mutations in the Viviparous-1 (Vp-1) gene block much or all
of maturation related gene expression in embryo and aleurone tissues of the
developing seed. Two seemingly unrelated groups of genes are regulated by Vp1:
1) An embryo maturation set including various late embryogenesis abundant genes
(LEA's) and the 7s globulin genes. These genes are also regulated by the
hormone, abscisic acid. 2) The second set includes the genes of the anthocyanin
pathway. Dr. McCarty has shown that Vp1 activates the anthocyanin pathway by
activating a second regulatory gene, C1. Thus, these genes function as a
regulatory hierarchy. His results suggest that Vp1 is a novel transcription
factor. By expressing the Vp1 gene in maize protoplasts, he is able to
characterize regulatory sequences involved in regulation of C1 and Em, a LEA
gene of wheat. This system also provides a functional assay for the Vp-1
protein. His objectives are to 1) Determine how Vp-1 regulates transcription of
target genes, 2) Use mutagenesis to define functionally important sequences in
the Vp1 protein, 3) Identify factors that interact with Vp1, 4) Characterize
Vp1's role in development using ectopic expression and 5) Characterize
transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of Vp-1 expression.
