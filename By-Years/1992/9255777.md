Twin Cities Public Television (TCPT) purposes to develop "Newton's Apple
Multimedia Collection" from their unique collection of multimedia-based science
instruction materials built from the successful PBS series. These materials will
be designed to stimulate creativity and improve the quality of teaching and
learning for all grade levels. This pilot project will include three discs of 25
to 30 segments selected from over 200 in the areas of physical, life and earth
sciences. Technology education will be included in many of the video segments
and addressed in greater detail in the printed support materials. Each segment
will be from 5 to 10 minutes to supplement active classroom learning. It will
include the development of video teacher workshops, printed teacher support
materials and computer software. The video discs will be produced in Spanish and
English and a videodisc version for the hearing impaired. This project has a
well documented rationale on conceptual change, curriculum development models,
and effectiveness of videodisc technology and television usage.
