9633501 Fryer The PIs study the relationship between the structure of South
Marina forearc and sites of volcanism and fluid venting. Venting areas are
accessible in the Mariana convergent plate system because its lacks an
accretionary sediment wedge. The compilation of bathymetric and sonar imagery
data will provide a basis from which to map seafloor structures. Seismic and MR1
survey will identify sites for detailed observations of fluid venting. Six
channel seismic reflection data will be gathered during a month-long cruise.
