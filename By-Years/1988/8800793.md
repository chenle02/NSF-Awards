Iowa State University will host a four-day conference in June 1988, on the
applications and methods of algebraic logic and universal algebra in theoretical
computer science. Their primary goal is to bring together computer scientists
and mathematicians working in this area to explore the interests and problems
they have in common, and establish some avenues of communication.
