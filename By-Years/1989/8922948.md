In this project, the P.I.'s will analyze data from BEMPEX (Barotropic
ElectroMagnetic and Pressure Experiment), an experiment in the North Pacific
which included bottom pressure, electromagnetic current measurements,
conventional current measurements, and hydrography. The data will be used to
study the barotropic current field, which is difficult to measure, but of
fundamental importance to understanding basin-scale dynamics.
