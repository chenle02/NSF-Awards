The objective of this collaborative research is to enhance the scientific
knowledge of material properties, modeling, and manufacturing at the scale of a
few millimeters to several microns in size. The results of this project will be
a viable micro-forming process. The approach will combined fundamental and
applied research with respect to physical interactions between workpiece and
tool, processing parameters, and scaling effects of material properties, which
prevent optimized macro-forming processes to be simply miniaturized to
components on the micro/meso-scale. This knowledge will then be applied to
devise a micro-forming process that will produce more accurate parts faster, for
less cost, and with higher aspect ratios. The research results will be validated
through extensive material testing, micro-forming system testing, and
comparisons between the numerical simulation and experimental results.
&lt;br/&gt;The knowledge gained through this research at the micro/meso-scale
will lead to an effective and efficient micro-forming process. The
implementation of such a micro-manufacturing process will lead to further micro-
components and systems for biomedical, telecommunication, and environmental
monitoring applications, which will benefit society as a whole. Also, the
findings will be incorporated into university courses and disseminated through
seminars, short courses, journal articles and the internet, which will
contribute to the micro/meso-scale knowledge base. Finally, the undergraduate
and graduate students involved with the research will benefit from the
interactions amongst the academic (U New Hampshire, Northwestern U) and industry
(Alcoa, GOALI partner) collaborators on this interdisciplinary project.
