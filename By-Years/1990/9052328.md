Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is widely used as a practical tool in
engineering and applied science, even though it is generally absent from
university curricula and textbooks. Vigorous development by manufacturers has
produced systems which are no more expensive than other types of engineering
geophysical equipment. The graphical cross sections produced by GPR will make it
suitable for use by non.engineers or at a very early stage of instruction. The
equipment is also used in a highly quantitative mode by transferring the data to
graphic workstations. Our curricula lack hands.on experience with this modern
tool, and we propose to correct deficiency by acquiring GPR instrumentation and
incorporating it into four departmental curricula: 1. Geological Engineering,
Geology, and Geophysics 2. Civil and Environmental Engineering 3. Electrical
engineering 4. Social Science (Archaeology) GPR will impact twenty.nine courses
in four departments and the Women in Engineering and Minorities in Engineering
Programs.
