I am interested in quantitative aspects of Geometric Calculus of Variations. In
1951 J.P. Serre proved that every two points on a closed Riemannian manifold can
be connected by an infinite set of distinct geodesics. I would like to prove
that the lengths of the first k of them admit an upper bound of the form
f(n,k)d, where n is the dimension and d is the diameter of the manifold. I am
interested in similar curvature-free upper bounds for the length of the shortest
periodic geodesic and the smallest area of a minimal surface. I am also
interested in distribution of geodesic segments between a fixed pair of points
and geodesic nets on a manifold. In another direction I would like to extend my
previous results on fractal features of Morse landscapes of Riemannian
functionals to scale-invariant Riemannian functionals involving a lower bound
for the Ricci curvature. This would involve proving some new results about
Riemannian manifolds with Ricci curvature bounded from below.



The notion of a closed Riemannian manifold is a higher dimensional
generalization of a closed surface, like the surface of a donut, or a sphere. We
plan to study connections between ``sizes" of various extremal objects on a
closed Riemannian manifold and the ``size" of the manifold. Examples of extremal
objects include geodesic segments (i.e. straightest curves between two points),
periodic geodesics (i.e. straight curves on manifolds that smoothly close on
themselves), geodesic nets (objects that arize when one tries to connect three
or more points by a shortest tree) and minimal surfaces (i.e. mathematical
models of soap bubbles). In another direction we plan to study "optimal" shapes
of higher dimensional manifolds. Our approach to this last question involves
ideas coming from different areas of Mathematics, including Computability
Theory.
