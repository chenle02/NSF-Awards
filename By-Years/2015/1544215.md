Title: 2015 Oregon Programming Languages Summer School (OPLSS) on Types, Logic,
Semantics, and Verification&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides student
travel and subsistence for the 2015 Oregon Programming Languages Summer School
(OPLSS). This summer school provides an important and valuable educational
opportunity for students to study theoretical topics related to programming
languages and methods/verification. The focus of this year's school is "Types,
Logics, Semantics, and Verification". The students who attend are from a large
number of countries. The broader significance and importance include building
international community and cooperation in foundational research areas, and
enhancing education of US students, including women and underrepresented
minorities, with exposure to and interaction with leading-edge research and
researchers. The school will thus train the next generation of programming
languages, compilers and software engineering researchers in both industry and
academia.
