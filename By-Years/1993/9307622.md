mentoring program for minority undergraduate students. Each student will
participate in a faculty mentor's research group during the full calendar year.
Student stipends, faculty tutoring and an outreach component highlight this
project in which Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics will be stressed. The
project will be coordinated into the activities of the Alliances for Minority
Participation (AMP) and the Research Careers for Minority Scholars (RCMS) in the
state of California. %%% With this award, the Directorate of Mathematics and
Physical Sciences and the Directorate of Education and Human Resources are co-
supporting Dr. William M. Jackson of the Department of Chemistry and Dr. Rodney
W. Cole of the Department of Physics at the University of California, Davis. The
focus of the project is the development of a comprehensive mentoring program for
minority undergraduate students in science. ***
