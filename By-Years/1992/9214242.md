This three-year award supports U.S.-U.K. cooperative research in condensed
matter physics between Paul A. Sokol of Pennsylvania State University and
William G. Stirling of the University of Keele in Staffordshire, United Kingdom.
The investigators propose to conduct a series of neutron scattering
investigations of quantum liquids. The collaboration will take advantage of
unique neutron scattering instrumentation at ISIS (Rutherford Appleton
Laboratory) and the IPNS pulsed neutron sources (Argonne National Laboratory).
They will study systems where quantum effects dominate the microscopic
properties, as well as the final state effects in liquid helium, the properties
of liquid helium mixtures and the effects of restricted geometries on the
momentum distribution of liquid helium. Both the U.S. and British investigators
bring to this collaboration their experimental expertise and will jointly
conduct with their students the measurements and the data analysis. The British
instrument has the capabilities for measuring momentum distributions in quantum
liquids. This will be complemented by temperature, pressure and concentration
measurements on the Argonne spectrometer. Liquid helium is an important element
in superconductivity. Quantum effects dominate the behavior in helium's
condensed phases and are responsible for its unique properties such as
superfluidity. Through studies of momentum distribution, the investigators will
gain a unique view and significant insight into the microscopic dynamics of
these systems. The proposed joint studies represent detailed investigations of
momentum distribution in liquids and will add substantially to our knowledge.
