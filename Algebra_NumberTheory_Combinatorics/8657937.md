The research of this Presidential Young Investigator concerns the theory of
automorphic forms and the applications of the Selberg trace formula. More
specifically he will work on the cohomology of arithmetic groups where he will
work on his conjecture that non-trivial cohomology always occurs in a certain
"main dimension". He also hopes to use cohomology to prove new cases of
Langlands functoriality. In addition he will study base change and orbital
integrals. This leads to results on the Hasse-Weil zeta functions for some
Shimura varieties. Finally he will work on rationality properties of Hecke
eigenvalues and special values of L-functions. This research is some of the most
important in the very current area of the so called Langlands program. This
program combines modern analysis, algebraic geometry and algebra to solve some
of the deepest problems in number theory. It has also been very influential
through out mathematics. The mastery of all the theory that goes into the work
is difficult enough, and Clozel has manipulated these machines in a very
effective way in the past. His current program is among the very most promising
in all of number theory.
