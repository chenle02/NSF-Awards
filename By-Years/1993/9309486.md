9309486 Acar As part of this proposal, an optimal controller based on artificial
neural networks will be developed for a class of nonlinear systems. The Proposed
controller will be capable of adapting and optimizing a receding horizon
quadratic cost function in real time for a system which has unknown
nonlinearities in its state variables. The complete controller design will
consist of various stages of modeling the nonlinearities, estimating future
values of the system states, designing a critic for the cost, and learning the
optimal control in real time. All these stages of the controller design will
involve various types of neural networks which may utilize different forms of
supervised learning methods integrated with the control problem. Briefly the
objectives of this work are as follows. developing and simulating a real- time
optimal controller based on neural networks. Comparing its performance with the
(off-line) optimal controller and two other neural network based variations.
Obtaining some stability bounds (or attraction regions) of the neural network
controlled system experimentally and analytically. Implementing the controller
on the two hardware experiments in the Neuro-Controller Laboratory at the
University of Missouri-Rolla. ***
