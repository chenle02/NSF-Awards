A recently-discovered connection between the constructive type theory and
homotopy theory is investigated using the tools of higher- dimensional algebra.
Martin-Lof type theory extends the lambda- calculus by admitting dependent types
and terms, and is at least as strong as second-order logic. It is also used as
the basis of several high-level programming languages because of its combination
of expressive strength and desirable proof-theoretic properties. The system is
interpreted into axiomatic homotopy theory using the framework of Quillen model
categories and relying on related algebraic methods involving (weak) higher-
dimensional groupoids. This permits logical methods to be combined with
algebraic and topological ones, admitting theoretical and computational
applications of type theory in homotopy and higher-dimensional algebra.

This research pursues a surprising connection between Geometry, Algebra, and
Logic which was discovered by the PI and is now under active investigation by
several researchers worldwide. In addition to its importance in foundations of
mathematics, it has strong potential for direct applications in computer
science. Logical systems of the kind investigated are used extensively in
programming language design and implementation. The new geometric and algebraic
interpretations are of use both in securing the correctness of applied systems
and as a theoretical model of the computational paradigms implemented by such
systems. Conversely, computational applications in geometry and algebra are made
likely by the well-developed computational implementations of the logical
system. The broader impact of the research is both in applications in science
and technology and in graduate education. A doctoral student in Carnegie
Mellon's Pure and Applied Logic program is partially supported under this
research project. The student is being trained in the relevant areas of logic,
topology, and algebra, and conducts joint research with the PI, eventually
leading to the degree of PhD.
