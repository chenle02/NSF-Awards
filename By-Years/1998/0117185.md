Since the 1980s, job stability for American workers has been falling as
employers pursue increased flexibility in employment systems. Traditionally
vulnerable groups such as young workers and blacks have experienced the largest
decreases in stability, but even hitherto stable workers such as older managers
and professionals have been affected. This project investigates the economic
consequences of frequent job changes for workers who first entered the labor
market in the early 1980s. Because worker and labor market characteristics shape
the relationship between mobility and wages, the economic effects of instability
are unlikely to be uniform. The project thus explores the conditions under which
job instability creates better or worse wage
outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using data from the National Longitudinal Study
of Youth from 1979 to 1998, the analysis identifies how three main contextual
factors shape the relationship between mobility patterns and wage profiles: 1)
workers' reasons for changing jobs, 2) patterns of job change, 3) and types of
labor markets in which the changes occur. The results offer theoretical insights
into the consequences of economic change for worker well-being, and policy
implications for addressing the needs of workers without a permanent
employer.&lt;br/&gt;
