Lapidus will investigate sharpened forms of the asymptotic formula for the
eigenvalue distribution of Laplacians with various boundary conditions. The goal
is to make yet clearer the role of the Minkowski dimension of the boundary in
this distribution. There are analogous formulas for the trace of the associated
heat semigroup. The case in which not only the boundary of the domain, but the
domain itself, is fractal will be studied. The relationship between the geometry
of a manifold and the invariants of the elliptic differential operators on it is
one of the main unifying themes of contemporary mathematics. The case of a
region with fractal boundary, so irregular that its dimension is no longer an
integer, has been the setting for some recent breakthroughs relating spectra
information to geometry. This work has applications to the study of porous media
and the scattering of waves from fractal surfaces.
