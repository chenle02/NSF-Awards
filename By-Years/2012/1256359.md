This award funds two conferences in the fall of 2012 that bring together leading
scholars to discuss issues that are important for the future of survey research
methods in the social, behavioral, and economic sciences. High quality survey
research is critical for these sciences. However, the cost of survey methods
continues to increase. New insights into best practices on optimal measurement
suggest new procedures might be a path to maximizing response rates and data
accuracy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conferences will address two separate issues:
survey methods and data linking and dissemination. The conferences will bring
together leading experts to help develop a research agenda in survey methods.
The results of the conferences will include a written report and a website that
will document the conference presentations via recordings and
visuals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because many government agencies and private firms
also use survey methods to gather information, the broader impacts of better
surveys will be substantial.
