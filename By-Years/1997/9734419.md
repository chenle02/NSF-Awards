The goal of this research is to develop machine-learning approaches for
integrating additional resources into the inductive-learning paradigm and to
apply these new approaches to numerous real-world problems. Many scientific and
industrial problems can be better understood by learning from samples of the
task under consideration. For this reason, the machine learning and statistics
communities devote considerable research effort in generating inductive-learning
algorithms that try to learn the true concept of a task from a set of its
examples. Often times, however, once has additional resources readily available,
but largely unused, that can significantly improve the concept that these
learning algorithms generate. These resources include prior knowledge describing
what is currently known about the domain as well as available computer cycles.
The focus of this proposal is to extend and apply a successful learning system
that consists of utilizing a novel combination of inductive learning (focusing
on ensembles, genetic algorithms, and neural networks), anytime learning, and
background knowledge. Natural applications of this framework include information
filtering, object recognition in digital images, drug design, as well as many
other domains traditionally tackled with expert systems.
