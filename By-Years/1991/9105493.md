Paleoecological studies have demonstrated that shifts in the transition areas
between grasslands and forests have occurred in response to climate change, but
few such studies have examined tropical or subtropical grasslands. This doctoral
dissertation project will examine the Holocene vegetation dynamics of the
southwestern Louisiana prairie, a subtropical grassland. Pollen, charcoal, and
stratigraphic analyses will be used to reconstruct the vegetation history and to
identify controlling factors in the development and maintenance of this
subtropical grassland. Core of lake bottom sediments from Lake Arthur, an
estuarine lake with a drainage basin entirely within the natural tall-grass
prairie, will yield at least a 6000-year record. Vertical profiles from Prien
Lake, with a similar origin but with a drainage basin outside the prairie, will
be used to detect possible shifts in the grassland. This project will provide
the first radiocarbon-dated pollen record of the southwestern Louisiana prairie
and will be one of few data points for the entire American tropics and
subtropics that contain a detailed Holocene history of savanna vegetation. It
will provide a rare opportunity to examine the sensitivity of prairie vegetation
to climate change in a subtropical context, thus adding to broader
understandings of the effects of climatic changes. In addressing the factors of
fire, edaphic control, and human disturbance, the project will add further to
this understanding by answering questions concerning the origin and evolution of
a southern grassland. This project also will provide an excellent opportunity
for a promising young scholar to continue to develop independent research
skills.
