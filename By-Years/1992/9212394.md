This Research Planning Grant will be used to assess the feasibility of
conducting a long-term study that would provide a major theoretical and
methodological advancement of previous research on trends in female labor force
participation. The study will determine the feasibility of developing more
refined measures of supply and demand for women's labor by, and develop a more
comprehensive model of women's labor force participation. The planning
activities consist of locating appropriate data, developing measures of supply
and demand, and developing the statistical models. If the outcome of the
planning phase is positive, then the research resulting from it can be expected
to make a major contribution to the sociological study of women's labor force
participation in the United States.
