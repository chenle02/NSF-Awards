This award will provide funds for the support of a workshop on climate-scale
variations in the Southern Ocean to be held at the Lamont-Doherty Earth
Observatory of Columbia University in October 2001. The task of the workshop
will be to produce a document for the US CLIVAR Scientific Steering Committee,
presenting priority research and sustained observational activities within the
Southern Ocean that reach Clivar objectives. Four themes are presented to help
guide the process: (1) Ocean circulation and overturning within the circumpolar
belt, including the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, intermediate water, and
subantarctic mode water production. (2) Ocean circulation and overturning within
the Antarctic zone and regional sea-air fluxes, including processes leading to
ventilation of the deep ocean. (3) Large scale variability of the Southern Ocean
and its relationship to global climate phenomena, including the Antarctic
Circumpolar Wave. (4) Ocean circulation and its regulation of air-sea
partitioning of carbon dioxide. The workshop participants will also consider new
observational techniques applicable to the Southern Ocean environment,
particularly those that require special ship capable for handling of new
observing platforms (e.g. autonomous vehicles). The Southern Ocean is the major
site of interocean exchange and ocean overturning. It provides a heat source for
the atmosphere, regulating to a significant degree the distribution of sea ice
and perhaps even affecting glacial ice mass balance. The Antarctic Circumpolar
Current and descent of "antarctic" waters shape much of the global ocean
stratification. Interannual and lower frequency variability within the Southern
Ocean has been linked to patterns of global climate variability. The CLIVAR SSC
has endorsed the convening of this workshop, recognizing that the Southern Ocean
clearly has relevance to CLIVAR goals. ***
