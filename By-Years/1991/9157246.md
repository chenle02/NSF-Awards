With the Presidential Young Investigator Award, Dr. Peralta, a cellular and
molecular neurobiologist, will continue to unravel the mechanisms by which
neurotransmitters act in the brain. He has already made major advances in this
field when he isolated the molecular clones encoding five related but distinct
subtypes of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. These cholinergic receptors
regulate the activity of potassium, calcium and chloride ion channels involved
in neurotransmission. In addition, muscarinic receptors control a variety of
physiological responses involved in heart rate and breathing. Dr. Peralta is now
concentrating on the second messenger system regulated by each of the receptor
subtypes and has found that the different receptor subtypes regulated different
systems. Moreover, he is finding that the subtypes also evoke differences in the
kinetics and magnitude of calcium release. Since calcium dependent events are
critical for neurotransmitter secretion, Dr. Peralta's work will have a major
impact on elucidating the mechanisms that are likely to play a role in neuronal
communication within the brain.
