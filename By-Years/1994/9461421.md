In the crude and #6 oil storage tanks, precipitation of the suspended particles,
water and other chemicals results in continuous building up of sludge material
on the tank bottom. Over time the sludge material condenses into a hard asphalt
like compound. The material contains highly corrosive elements that deteriorates
the surface preparations and corrodes the tank and seam welds. The build-up may
reach several feet, reducing tank capacity and creating enormous cleaning and
inspection problems. The disposal of the hazardous sludge material requires
great care and is very costly (a major clean-up costs between one half and one
million dollars). The objective of this SBIR effort is to develop an integrated
robotic system that entirely eliminates the build-up of the hard sludge material
and cleans and prepares tank surfaces and welds for in-situ inspection. The
system can operate in the present tanks without requiring any modification. The
present safety and sludge material disposal problems are eliminated. The Phase I
effort involves a detailed technical and economical feasibility study of the
proposed system. As part of the Phase II effort, a working prototype will be
constructed and fully tested. Both efforts are performed with close
collaboration of a local utility company.
