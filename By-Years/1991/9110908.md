Much research focuses on the development of specialized architectures. To
increase the utility of task-oriented or specialized parallel networks, one can
simulate one parallel network on another. Of primary interest are lower bounds
on the cost of such simulation. This project investigates the actual performance
of proposed theoretical embeddings strategies by simulating them on a hypercube
machine. The contribution of this practical investigation will be to establish
how quickly the increase in embedding costs prohibit an actual simulation. By
simulating different architectures on the hypercube, one may compare how similar
measures of embedding costs, and their growth, are affected by architectural
design. For example, an edge congestion cost greater than one may be more
deleterious for an asymmetric network. Furthermore, the effects of even a slight
increase in such a cost may have more dramatic effects in asymmetric
architectures. However, such differences may be minimized if the cost can be
localized or redistributed. Pure embeddings do not consider these possible
revisions but a simulation may suggest an efficient means for obtaining
improvements.
