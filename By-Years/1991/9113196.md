This project continues a study of type systems for the -calculus and functional
programming languages. The emphasis is on type- reconstruction problems.
Algebraic characterizations of type- reconstruction problems give rise to new
and more general forms of unification, often with applications in other areas of
computer science. Together with type-reconstruction problems, the expressive
powers of the formalisms considered are to be compared and calibrated. Principal
topics include: generalized type structures (especially polymorphism, coercions,
existential types), decision procedures for unification problems and their
complexity, programming features characterized by complexity classes.
