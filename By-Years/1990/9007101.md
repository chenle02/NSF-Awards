A series of computer experiments will be performed to explore heat transfer
mechanisms close to the critical point of the H2O system. Many studies are now
using dated equations of state whose quality is especially suspect in the near
critical region; the proposed experiments will either confirm their utility or
demonstrate that they are woefully inadequate. The role of the critical point
may be far more profound than previously thought; conditions in hydrothermal
systems may even be predictable by very simple formulations, thereby reducing
enormous numerical computations to routing calculations. Previous complications
may be a consequence of numerical inaccuracies caused by amplification of errors
in the convection term in the equations in the region of nonlinear fluid
properties. In other words, this work may result in improvement and
simplification of models used to represent ore-forming and geothermal systems in
an important temperature-pressure region.
