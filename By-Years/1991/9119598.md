This proposal combines the experimental and theoretical efforts of one
ceramist, one chemist, and one applied mathematician, to seek a fundamental
understanding of the basis of phase stability of zirconia and fluorite related
materials; and the origin of fatigue behavior and the development of appropriate
constitutive relationships of transformation toughened ceramics. EXAFS and XANES
techniques will be used to coordinate with the mechanical properties of zirconia
polymorphs. Analytical and computational modelling will be complemented by
deformation and fracture experiments, under monotonic, cyclic, high strain rate,
and high pressure loading conditions. %%%% This research promises to provide new
insights to the micromodelling of transformation toughening of zirconia
ceramics. It starts from the viewpoint of shear-dilatant plasticity. Information
to be gained on phase stability of oxides is important not only for zirconia
ceramics, but also to other oxide systems as well.
