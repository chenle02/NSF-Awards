The research will focus on the theory and techniques needed to develop a robust
and efficient algorithm for the general mixed integer programming problem.
Topics that will be studied include efficient formulation, preprocessing,
decomposition, logical testing, linear programming, constraint generation,
branching and parallel processing. The project will also involve the development
of a modular experimental code to test and evaluate the ideas and methodology
that result from the basic research. There is tremendous demand for an efficient
and robust mixed integer programming algorithm because a great variety of
practical problems can be formulated in this way. But many of the larger and
more difficult ones cannot be solved to (near) optimality in a reasonable amount
of time by the existing methodology. Some of these large mixed integer models
arise from optimization problems in the areas of logistics and manufacturing.
Thus, the development of efficient methods would have a significant impact on
improving the planning and operation of production and distribution processes.
