When unique but related species overlap geographically with one another, there
are specific conditions that determine whether they will fuse into one species
(a form of extinction), or will be able to evolve mechanisms to prevent the
exchange of genes between them. This research investigates conditions that allow
a third possibility, that two species may reach a stable state where they still
exchange some genes, but are yet able to retain their specific identities. The
research team will expand upon initial models that identified the existence of
these stable states of partial isolation, using mathematical models that exactly
replicate the effects of migration between populations, differential survival,
and mate choice. Specifically, initial models by the PI and others will be
extended in several ways to allow for additional phenomena that greatly extend
their applicability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Delineating the conditions that can
lead to partial isolation is important both in developing a basic understanding
of how species can remain distinct from one another, and in comprehending the
possible consequences of the breakdown of geographic barriers between species,
an increasingly common occurrence under human disturbance. As part of this
project, the PI will continue to develop a "mathematical track" in an
introductory biology course at UNC, which uses a variety of techniques to reduce
math anxiety, a problem documented to disproportionally affect the performance
of women. This track thus promotes both the participation of women in the
mathematical sciences and more generally addresses the need to integrate math
into the undergraduate biology curriculum.
