The World Wide Web contains a vast and ever-growing collection of music audio
files representing nearly every musical style, ensemble, genre, country,
culture, and time period. However, with the exception of the information
conveyed in the title, the contents of such audio files can only be understood
by listening to the files. Thus searches of audio files analogous to those
performed by text-based search engines are currently impossible. In this project
the PI will study and implement solutions to the "Signal to Score" problem in
which an audio file is transcribed into a format capturing information similar
to that contained in a printed musical score. The PI's approach splits the task
into two components: "Signal to Piano Roll" in which the musical signal is
transcribed into a MIDI-like representation, and "Rhythmic Parsing" in which the
piano roll representation is further transcribed into a musical score or
equivalent representation. The goal is to allow the generation of searchable
data bases that contain high level music descriptions, which could be used to
algorithmically answer questions on musical content such as "Is the audio file
likely to be a blues song?" or "What is the time signature of the music?"
