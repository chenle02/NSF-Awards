ABSTRACT P. K. Yeung Georgia Institute of Technology CTS-9411690 The proposal
is to upgrade an existing workstation rated at 30 Megaflops to beyond 100
Megaflops and also to increase storage and memory space. This equipment will be
used in support of two research projects: Diffusion with reaction and heating
effects and Lagrangian studies of turbulence and scalar transport. The first of
these is funded by an existing NSF Research Initiation Grant. The work is being
extended to included flows with exothermic reactions and fluids with variable
density. The inclusion of these effects implies the need for more CPU speed and
memory. The second project requires the tracking of many fluid particles and,
hence, large data sets are used. This will be facilitated by the additional
memory and disk space.
