This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY
2011, Broadening Participation. The fellowship supports a research and training
plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden
participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this
fellowship to Melissa Pespeni is "Revealing the genetic underpinnings of
morphological diversity in horned dung beetles." The host institution for this
research is Indiana University and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Armin Moczek.

Horned dung beetles in the genus Onthophagus are the most speciose genus in the
world, with some 2000 species described. These beetles originated in Africa and
diversified with the diversification of mammals by feeding on the dung of
specific mammal species. Most interestingly, species differ with radical
variations in horn morphology, changing the size, shape and number of horns
developing from their heads and thorax. Several genes that are known to be
important in the development of other insects that lack these novel horn
structures have been identified as critical for the development of diverse horn
morphologies in dung beetles. Recently developed genomic and gene expression
information make Onthophagus beetles a useful model for developmental biology in
general and a valuable biological system for this study of the genetic
underpinnings of morphological diversity and gene expression at various stages
of development and in morphologically distinct yet closely related species. The
scientific impacts include determining the genetic basis of evolutionary change
that enables or constrains adaptive evolution and evolutionary responses on a
changing planet.

Training objectives include learning developmental genetic techniques and
applying genome-wide studies in a comparative, evolutionary, and developmental
framework. Broader impacts of this fellowship include assisting conservation
efforts and inspiring interest in biology when shared in K-12 classrooms, with
undergraduates, at conferences, and in popular and scientific publications.
