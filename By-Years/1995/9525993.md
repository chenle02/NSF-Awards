9525993 Narayan Formation of low resistivity ohmic contacts that exhibit high
thermal stability, and planar interfaces has represented a major impediment to
III-V device technology. The primary thrust of this proposal is three-fold: (1)
structure and intrinsic electrical properties of novel Cu-Ge alloys as a
function of Ge concentration and ordering; (2) formation of low resistivity
ohmic contacts and correlations with interface structure and chemical
composition, substrate doping and anneal temperature; and (3) optimization of
parameters to obtain low-resistivity ohmic contacts and fabrication of test
device structures. We propose the formation of novel ohmic contacts with record
low contact resistivity and high temperature stability based on Cu-Ge alloys to
n- and p- type GaAs and related III-V compounds. The contact scheme will be
developed and optimized to fabricate advanced semiconductor test devices which
are expected to exhibit superior device properties and performance. ***
