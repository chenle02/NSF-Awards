This research effort characterizes sparse model recovery for general model
classes, extending existing results for generalized linear models and in
classification. The central goals of this proposal are: (a) to define sparsity
and target recovery in high dimensional - low sample size settings; (b) to show
that empirical risk minimization with a lasso-type penalty allows for target
recovery, under minimal assumptions. The investigators advance the use of a
novel type of oracle inequalities to show that the penalized empirical risk
minimizers adapt to the unknown sparsity of the underlying statistical model.
Special attention is given to random design regression and classification with a
reject option.

High dimensional data are increasingly common in many scientific disciplines
such as biological and medical sciences. Accurate estimation and implementation
of complex statistical models used for the analysis of such data are
challenging. The aim of this project is to develop a unified theory for the
analysis of computationally efficient procedures in high dimensional data
settings. The usefulness of these techniques will be demonstrated by
applications to gene expression data and concurrent EEG / fMRI data. The newly
introduced classification procedures have a built-in reject option that allows
for withholding decision in cases that are hard to classify. This greatly
improves the performance of tumor classification where the consequences of
misdiagnosis are severe. The software for these procedures will be made freely
available on the world wide web.
