9400011 Stevenson Migration is a widely recognized but poorly understood
phenomenon in the tropics. Species that migrate need special consideration when
developing conservation plans because they depend on at least two seasonal
habitats and they may rely on resources at stopover sites allow the migration
paths. Recently the east-west migration of butterflies over the mountains near
Monteverde, Costa Rica. A surprising large fraction, approximately 80% (260
species), of the extant Pacific slope and lowland fauna move seasonally to the
Atlantic side. We will quantify the magnitude, direction and temporal components
of migrants in the Monteverde region. Changes in population levels and local
resources of four focal species will be studied along the entire migration
route. A comparison of life-history, morphological, and physiological traits
will be used to rank habitat specialization and the migration capability of
species. Comparisons will also be made between migrants and residents of the dry
forest to examine their relative sensitivities to habitat fragmentation. A broad
geographic perspective on butterfly migration will be provided by surveys in
other parts of Costa Rica. Together these studies will advance the conservation
of tropical invertebrates and increase our ability to identify the unique
resource needs of migrant species.
