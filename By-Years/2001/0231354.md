In its 1996 report, Shaping the Future--New Expectations for Undergraduate
Education in Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology, the Advisory
Committee to the National Science Foundation Directorate of Education and Human
Resources charges college-level science educators to effectively use technology
to enhance learning and communication, and to develop curricula that take full
advantage of modern technology. Many of the key recommendations made to STEM
faculty in Shaping the Future are addressed in the design of the Chemistry is in
the News (CIITN) project. The overarching goal of CIITN project is to facilitate
learning activities by connecting real world social, economic, and political
issues to the teaching of organic chemistry. The activities consist in the
study, creation, and peer-review of CIITN projects online. A CIITN project
consists of (a link to) an electronically published news article from the
popular press or any online media and includes a tutorial/editorial and
questions. These activities are conducted in small collaborative groups, guided
by peer-learning assistants, in the context of large lecture settings and they
are aimed at undergraduate students majoring in science. The online tools and
components of the Chemistry is in the News project are being developed in order
to enable its nationwide implementation and adoption. We hold workshops at the
University of Missouri-Columbia for faculty development and symposia at American
Chemical Society meetings to disseminate the CIITN news projects. We hope that
with the Chemistry is in the News project we bring about broader and deeper
scientific literacy, a systemic change that is so desired by educators,
administrators and politicians alike.
