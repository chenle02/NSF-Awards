In this application, we propose to upgrade the existing Department of Biology
Optical Sectioning Microscope (OSM) Facility. We are requesting several pieces
of equipment that will facilitate the use of the instrument and provide new
capabilities that will enhance the facility. The OSM uses the computational
methods of out-of-focus light removal to provide high resolution 3-D images of
both living and fixed specimens. Its main advantage over confocal microscopy is
that is uses far lower levels of illumination to generate high quality images,
thereby minimizing the damage to living specimens. Our request for upgrading the
facility has four main components. First, we wish to add confocal and partially
confocal optics to the OSM, so that depending on the sensitivity of the
specimen, we may choose to apply computational methods to either non-confocal,
partially confocal or fully confocal images. Second, we propose to add the
capability for producing video output so that we have a means to store many
movies of 3-D time-lapse sequences for our own analysis, and also a means to
record representative movies for presentation to seminar audiences. Third, we
request improvements that will facilitate the storage, retrieval and hard copy
output of the massive data sets that we work with, so that the data are more
easily accessible. Fourth, we seek to add the capability for microinjection to
the OSM, so that several different sorts of in vivo injection experiments can be
performed expeditiously, The main purpose of all of these enhancements is to
make the instrument more accessible to the users and to remedy current
shortcomings in the facility. With the addition of these components, our OSM
facility will remain on the forefront of biological imaging and continue to
facilitate our research for many years to come.
