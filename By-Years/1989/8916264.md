In freely spawning invertebrates, fertilization success or failure may have a
major impact on recruitment and hence on population dynamics. Although the
process of fertilization has been studied extensively at the cellular and
molecular levels, the ecological question of how sperm encounter eggs remains
largely unresolved. Shallow-water echinoderms use light and other environmental
cues to synchronize their spawning. Many such cues are not available in the deep
sea; indeed, mechanisms facilitating fertilization in low-density, deep-sea
populations are completely unknown. Dr. Young and a collaborator has discovered
numerous sperm modifications (large sperm head, dimorphic sperm, bipolar sperm,
extensive energy stores) among deep-sea echinoids that could enhance
fertilization success. Preliminary data also indicate that some deep-sea sperm
remain viable for very long periods and that some adult echinoderms aggregate
for breeding. These investigators propose a multidisciplinary, comparative study
that relates gamete untrastructure and fertilization kinetics to the problem of
sperm-egg encounter in the deep sea. The approach includes shallow-water in situ
validation of equations that predict sperm concentration and fertilization
success and a comparison of fertilization kinetics between tropical bathyal
echinoderms and shallow-water temperate species living at the same temperature.
