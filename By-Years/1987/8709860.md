In the coming year, this research will concentrate on completing several of the
projects begun under previous support. The Class I membrane antigens of the
Major Histocompatibility Complex of the marsupial Monodelphis domestica will be
isolated and characterized using the Western blot procedure. Studies of the
baseline immune responses will be completed and attempts to tolerize newborns to
particulate and soluble antigens will be continued. Further data on the response
of lymphocytes to mitogens and the behavior of Monodelphis lymphocytes in mixed
lymphocyte cultures will be obtained. Studies will be continued of the
development of alpha- fetoprotein in animals of various stages, and antisera
against alpha- fetoprotein will be produced. Finally, studies will be continued
of the genetic control of the enzyme polymorphisms and blood groups already
defined. The major objective of this project is to study the immunogenetic and
biochemical genetic systems of a marsupial. Another objective is to involve
bright undergraduate students in basic research in an established and active
research laboratory.
