Undergraduate laboratory instruction in geology is being enhanced through the
development of a seismic system for the determination of subsurface structure.
Students can now gain experience using seismic reflection and seismic refraction
through the recent acquistion of an energy source allowing refraction
measurements to a 200-meter depth and reflection measurements to a 2-kilometer
depth. In addition, the storage, retrieval and analysis of seismic data in
digital form is now being used to acquaint students with modern seismic data
handling techniques.
