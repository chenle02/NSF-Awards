This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project proposes to
develop the database and associated software to enable analysis of protein
trafficking and localization. The system will be designed to enable drug
discovery researchers to identify, elucidate, eliminate and design leads and
targets, while facilitating the general training of researchers. During the
Phase I work, proteins involved in trafficking and diseases related to
mislocalization were identified, and a relational database to house information
on protein trafficking was constructed. Curation interface applications were
created to allow remote data entry, and graphical user interfaces designed to
maximize the utility of the information. The objective of this Phase II Project
is to exhaustively populate the database from the primary journal literature.
Selection of proteins involved in protein trafficking will be guided by relevant
human diseases and corresponding drug discovery efforts.

The commercial application of this project is in the area of biological
informatics. The potential users of the biological database to be developed in
this project would include pharmaceutical and drug discovery companies.
