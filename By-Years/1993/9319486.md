9319486 Zeigler It is a major challenge to the study of brain and behavior to
understand how complex movements are generated, and further, to understand how
the control systems for movement are put in place during an organisms
development. Grasping in the pigeon is functionally analogous to the prehensile
behavior of humans, but is mediated by a somewhat simpler neuromotor system --
the jaw. Dr. Zeigler's group will examine the ontogeny of grasping behavior in
pigeons and determine its relation to the development of the orosensory tactile
system of the jaw. These studies will greatly expand current ideas about how
sensory information is used to guide movement. The findings will have
significance for our understanding of the evolution of neural control, and have
practical payoffs by identifying control strategies for the guidance of motoric
systems. ***
