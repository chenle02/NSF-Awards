This research is on the design and implementation of ordered binary decision
diagram (OBDD) variable ordering and reordering methods. The work explores the
use of memory-efficient data structures, called Decision Diagrams (DD), to
describe the behavior of Boolean functions. Being developed is a methodology for
finding an ordering of the Boolean function variables so that the DD has minimal
size. This research exploits the use of conditional probabilities for the
purposes of variable ordering and dynamic reordering. Efficient techniques for
computation of the spectrum of a Boolean function using its OBDD representation
as input are being used. Software is being developed to manipulate OBDDs as well
as compute the probability values.
