This award will support the participation of US-based mathematicians, especially
women, graduate students, postdocs, and young faculty, in "A Conference in
Ergodic Theory: Dynamical Systems and Randomness" that will be held at the
Institut Henri Poincare' in Paris, France, from May 11-15, 2009.

This conference, which is to be cosponsored by a consortium of seven French
universities, has six major scientific themes: entropy and classification of
dynamical systems; smooth models of dynamical systems; rigidity phenomena in
ergodic theory; interactions of dynamics with combinatorics and number theory;
recurrence and convergence theorems; nilpotent ergodic theory. The format of the
conference is such that young people will have ample opportunities to speak. A
key purpose of this event is to promote the formation of collaborations between
the younger generation of American dynamicists and ergodic theorists and their
French counterparts.
