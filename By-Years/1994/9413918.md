Mass spectrometry has become one of the most powerful tools for measuring
molecular weights of peptides and proteins, and for determining their primary
structures. Thus mass spectrometry is of central importance to biotechnology,
biochemistry, and biological research. Fourier transform mass spectrometry is
emerging as the premier high- performance mass spectrometer for the analysis of
biological compounds. This proposal seeks funding to advance the development of
several high-performance capabilities of Fourier transform mass spectrometry for
peptide and protein analysis, and to make these readily available in a
commercial mass spectrometer. This project will be a joint effort between the
P.I. and Bruker Instruments, Inc., a manufacturer of a commercial Fourier
transform mass spectrometer. The requested funds will be used to purchase a
Fourier transform mass spectrometer from Bruker Instruments. Hardware, software,
and technique developments will be pursued jointly by the P.I. and Bruker
Instruments. In addition to the development efforts, this instrument will also
be used to support the research and training programs of members of the Center
for Metalloenzyme Studies, a NSF supported Research Training Group at the
University of Georgia.
