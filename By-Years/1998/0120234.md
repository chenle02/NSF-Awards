ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Christodoulos Floudas and James R. Broach
&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Princeton University&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
0120234&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the proposed work is to
combine molecular genetics with computational analysis to map the signal
transduction pathways in eucaryotic cells. Of special interest is the
topology/connectivity of the metabolic pathways. The initial system will be the
Ras and Tor signaling pathways in Saccahromyces cerevisiae. Data for whole
genome expression will be used to develop and validate pathway
maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
