9410874 Kareiva Corridors for animal dispersal are being increasingly examined
as a management option for reducing the risk of extinction in threatened
species. The idea is that these corridors encourage genetic diversity by the
exchange of individuals between different regions, and offer a vehicle for
recolonization of local populations that might go extinct due to chance
catastrophes. While corridors could clearly in theory be a cost-effective means
for promoting biodiversity, their biological efficacy is not established. In
fact, ecologists have not even devised a clear protocol for evaluating corridor
effectiveness. This research will assess the effectiveness of habitat corridors
for a threatened species in Oregon, where in fact local governments are
considering establishing corridors. Protocols will be developed for converting
observations of how animals move through habitats into predictions about the
likely value of corridors in conservation efforts. Small-scale experimental
corridors will be created and individuals will be moved into different habitat
types (or edges between habitat types) for observations of movement behavior.
