The aim of this project is to continue the development of the computerized
database of linguistic errors (slips of the tongue) initiated in 1992. The
interest in speech errors has grown enormously among linguists, psychologists,
and neuropsychologists in their attempts to understand how linguistic knowledge
is represented in the mind, how it is accessed in behavior, and the neurological
basis for such representation and processing. Many individual collections are
now in existence consisting of over 40,000 errors. Except for published
examples, there has been no way of sharing these data; this project hopes to
correct this problem by developing a database with the UCLA Speech Error Corpus
and the corpora collected by Merrill Garrett (University of Arizona), Stefanie
Shattuck-Hufnagle (MIT) and the late W.H.N. Hotopf (of the London School of
Economics). The program which has been written and the errors entered to date
have already been made available to a number of other investigators. When
finally established, both the software and the database (on CD-ROM or via ftp
site) will be widely distributed among all researchers interested in working
with such data . The program will be further updated to permit the inclusion of
crosslinguistic speech errors; entering of Spanish, Italian, French, Thai, and
Japanese errors has already begun. In addition, the special kinds of coding
needed to build a database of errors and disordered speech of aphasic
individuals following focal brain damage will be explored.
