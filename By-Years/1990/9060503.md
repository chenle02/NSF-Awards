This proposal describes the development of a new class of electroluminescent
devices which have exceptionally narrow band emission spectra and produce bright
colors. The devices are based on thin films of luminescent organometallic
compounds sandwiched between electron and hole injecting electrodes. New
organometallic complexes will be synthesized during the Phase I research period
and their luminescence properties studied with the complexes sandwiched between
electron and hole injecting electrodes. The luminescence spectra of the proposed
devices are considerably narrower than those of previous electrolunminescent
devices based on organic thin films. The color of the devices can be varied by
varying the organometallic complex.
