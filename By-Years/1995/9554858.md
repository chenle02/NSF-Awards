As part of a strategic plan to restructure the biology curriculum to emphasize
ways that scientists gain knowledge, the Dept. of Biological Sciences at Feffis
State University will revise the one-year introductory biology course to permit
students to experience the methods of science-- formulating and testing
hypotheses, designing and conducting experiments, analyzing and interpreting
data, and communicating results. The course will forge connections to other
disciplines and emphasize investigation. Professors from a wide range of
disciplines will discuss research-based CASE STUDIES with student research teams
and share interpretations of lab experiments via an e-mail BIONETWORK on the
University's WWW home page. The conceptual theme of the course will the
biological effects of LIGHT. Prospective biology teachers, biotechnology and
applied biology majors will be involved in the development and pilot testing of
the labs, then as research mentors to each of the lab sections. Prospective
biology teachers will be assigned to a special lab section of area high school
students enrolled under an educational partnership. A major goal is to develop a
series of RESEARCH CORES--systems that offer multiple options for student
research teams to design and conduct an experiment, analyze the data and present
their results using a multimedia "poster" There will be four 4- week research
units per semester, one in each of the following areas--in genetics/cell
biology, plant/animal physiology, ecology/behavior, and evolution. A development
team representing the disciplines of biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics,
geography and education will develop the case studies and research cores with
the assistance of biology education, biotechnology and applied biology majors.
