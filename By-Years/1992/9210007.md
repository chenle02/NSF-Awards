The high metabolism of hummingbirds is fueled principally by the sugar found in
nectar, but consumed along with the sugar is an excess of water that can amount
to several time the bird's own body mass per day. In hummingbirds, the kidney
and the gastrointestinal tract mush consequently play coordinated roles in the
regulation of water, electrolyte, and energy balance. Beuchat describes a series
of experiments, including measurements of GFR and tubular water reabsorption in
the kidney, and of water and glucose absorption in the intestine, that will
isolate fundamental components of the mechanisms hummingbirds use to regulate
energy, water, and electrolyte balance. The project's focus on basic kidney
function and on the integration of renal with intestinal function in
hummingbirds will provide fundamental information about the physiology of these
animals. In a broader perspective, this study will be the first to closely
examine the osmoregulatory physiology of a bird or mammal that is a model
organism for the study of chronic diuresis. Finally, this study will be first in
vivo test of the hypothesis that paracellular fluid flux activated by Na+-
coupled glucose transport can play a significant role in nutrient uptake in
vertebrates.
