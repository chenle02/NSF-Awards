Dr. Gwinn will continue studies of interstellar scattering with very long
baseline interferometry (VLBI). These studies probe the density fluctuations
responsible for interstellar scattering, particularly their spatial spectrum,
and the structures of the scattered sources. He will: (i) Further study
scattering of Hydroxyl masers in the source W49N; (ii) Study scattering of the
Vela pulsar; (iii) Attempt to resolve the emission region of the Vela pulsar at
nanoarcsecond scales, using the scattering disk as a lens; (iv) Observe
scattering from pulsars showing strong low frequency variability; and (v) Assess
the effects of scattering on astrometric observations of the millisecond pulsar
1937-214. Observations of pulsars will make use of VLBI in the snapshot, or
speckle, regime of scattering.
