The University of California Berkeley Museum of Paleontology (UCMP) will lead a
one-year virtual conference to establish a Professional Learning Community (PLC)
of community college instructors and graduate students to support the
development of teaching resources for diverse audiences. The PLC builds upon
existing partnerships with community colleges and resources developed as part of
the ACCESS (Advancing Community College Education and Student Success) program
to make the geosciences and practices of scientific inquiry more accessible to
all learners. While Earth science literacy and perspectives from diverse
stakeholders are essential for addressing 21st century societal and
environmental challenges, the geosciences remain one of the least diverse STEM
disciplines. By partnering with community colleges, the program will serve
students who identify as low-income, first-generation, or underrepresented
minorities. The ACCESS program is uniquely positioned to help enhance online and
in-person geoscience learning experiences for students while simultaneously
helping community college instructors and UC Berkeley graduate students develop
inclusive pedagogical practices to enhance their teaching skills.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ACCESS PLC will support the revision and
implementation of inquiry-based lessons for diverse audiences using active,
equitable, and inclusive learning practices known as Model-Based Inquiry.
Through a year-long series of workshops and meetings, the PLC will develop
lessons that deepen studentsâ€™ understanding of the Earth history and processes,
which is necessary to contextualize the complexity and urgency of global climate
and local environmental challenges. Efforts to enhance STEM education that focus
on issues related to diversity and inclusive practices are typically one-time
efforts and not a continual means of providing professional development and
support for instructors. Year-long support for instructors and iterative
development of resources in the UCMP ACCESS PLC will help transform and sustain
shifts in teaching practices as we face the ongoing challenges of providing
online and blended learning experiences for students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
