Disputes about environmental risks often reflect fundamental disagreements about
the definition and scope of the policy problem. Identifying how individuals
frame or conceptually define complex issues about environmental risk may be a
prerequisite for understanding the basis of many societal conflicts, and
individual differences in responding. The framework imposed upon information
affects the boundaries of discourse during a dispute, and frames-of reference
influence what values are salient for a given issue. This set of `operating`
values focuses individuals on specific aspects of the problem while guiding
policy choices. How conceptual frames organize information and experiences
regarding environmental risks, affect judgments and vary with the sociocultural
context of exposure are the guiding questions of this research. The project
consists of two studies examining in detail the process and consequences of
decision framing. Study #1 explores and measures in several lay populations the
different conceptual frames that may be evoked to structure environmental risk
problems, with a systematic look at the content of and variability in decision
frames across different ethnic and socioeconomic groups. The project then
considers how alternative framings of environmental risk issues, including an
equity or justice perspective, may affect the subjective value of decision
options, and whether effects are stable across different communities. The goal
of an additional pilot study is to complete preliminary work for the
construction of a scale measuring decision frames in diverse populations. These
studies target a variety of individuals for participation, including residents
of lower-income urban communities. Objectives are explored through multiple
methods including experimental, interview and multidimensional scaling
procedures, and provide information about the validity and reliability of
certain scientific procedures across diverse samples. From a policy perspective,
results may have implications for the resolution of conflict about technology or
environmental hazards, and the process of communicating about risk situations
across a wide range of communities.
