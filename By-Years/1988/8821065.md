This research will apply a recently developed, ultrasensitive interferometric
imaging technique to map, onto images of a living cell, the distribution of
motion of its macromolecules. The larger macromolecules can behave as optical
markers even though they may be spaced too closely to be optically resolved, and
interference between their scatterings of coherent incident light contains
statistically rich information about their relative disposition. This
information can be extracted by quantitative, pixel-by-pixel analysis of the map
intensities, and quantitative measures of the scales of length and time over
which their motions are correlated can be established even when the spatial
scale proves to be fine in comparison to an optical wavelength. Finally, the
structure and composition of skeletal muscle are such that the force generators
(crossbridges) themselves are its dominant Rayleigh scatterers. Interferometric
Rayleigh maps of intact skeletal muscle fibers developing steady tension are
thus likely to yield information that has an intimate and unusually direct
connection with the scale on which one of the Life Processes is organized. This
research represents a potentially major technical advance in our ability to
observe macromolecular movements in the living cell. The technique, once
perfected, can probably be adapted to other problems of regular movement at the
macromolecular level, also.
