This is an award of supercomputer time. The object is to design and implement
new algorithms which, by taking full advantage of parallel computing
capabilities, will effectively solve large- scale, constrained, nonlinear global
optimization problems on the shared-memory CRAY 2, CRAY X-MP, and CRAY Y-MP
supercomputers. Constrained global optimization problems arise in many important
areas of science and technology and include scheduling and allocation problems
with nonconvex objective functions and a variety of computer-aided design and
computational geometry applications. These kinds of optimization problems may
possess many constrained local optima, but an acceptable solution to the problem
requires that a global optimum, or a good approximation to it, be obtained.
Because of the inherent difficulty of computing the global optimum, the emphasis
of this research will be on the design and implementation of efficient
algorithms which obtain an approximate solution to these problems on parallel
computers in a reasonable amount of time. Typically these algorithms will find
both an approximate solution and guaranteed bounds on this solution, with the
accuracy of the approximate solution and the tightness of the bounds depending
on the amount of computation performed. In view of this approach, primary
interest is placed on the average, rather than worst case, behavior of these
algorithms, and the performance analysis of this behavior will require a
combination of both theoretical investigation and extensive computational
testing.
