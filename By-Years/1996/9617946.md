McCartney 9617946 The secular variability in various components of the
meridional overturning circulation of the North Atlantic and the linkages
between these components and the variability in the overlying atmosphere will be
examined by using historical oceanographic data. The work will address the
question of whether the decadal trends in warm water transformation, which co-
vary with the low frequency North Atlantic Oscillation, represent an oceanic
response that is passive, active or a coupled interaction. This proposal is a
contribution to the CLImate VARiability and predictability (CLIVAR) program.
