IBN-9317589 Tompkins Abstract Hawaiian Drosophila species appear to have evolved
very rapidly. This research project, at the interface of chemistry and biology,
investigates the extent to which the chemical communication systems of the
Hawaiian species have diverged from those of their continental counterparts.
Pheromones are chemicals synthesized by one individual that affect the behavior
of another individual. Dr. Laurie Tompkins, a biologist at Temple University,
and Dr. Larry L. Jackson, a chemist at Montana State University, are
investigating the pheromones of a Hawaiian Drosophila species, D. adiastola.
This species is of particular interest because males raise their abdomens over
their heads, emitting droplets of fluid, while performing courtship in response
to females. Drs. Tompkins and Jackson have discovered species-specific chemical
compounds in the males' droplets. Moreover, females of this species will mate
only with D. adiastola males, and they can distinguish D. adiastola males from
males of other, closely related species even if they cannot see the males. These
observations suggest that perception of the chemicals in males' droplets enables
females to distinguish different males. Accordingly, Drs. Tompkins and Jackson
will attempt to identify the pheromones in males' droplets. Drs. Tompkins and
Jackson have also shown that waxy compounds on the cuticle ("skin") of D.
adiastola females, many of which are species-specific, stimulate males to court
the females and enable them to distinguish D. adiastola females from females of
another, closely related species. The researchers will attempt to identify the
compounds on females' cuticles that enable males to tell different females
apart. In addition, since some of the waxy compounds on males' cuticles are
species- specific, the researchers will try to determine whether or not any of
these compounds acts as a pheromone.
