This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project identifies information
requirements in a low income community that could be supplied with resources on
the Internet, and develops a prototype application for supplying those
requirements. As the development of a National Information Infrastructure
progresses, and as greater concern is raised over the issue of universal access
for all Americans to the resources of the `information superhighway`, the
development of vernacular applications tailored to the needs of low income
communities is a matter of highest national priority. The prevailing design of
Internet applications is based upon a middle class style of information access.
Although `electronic redlining` is a regulatory concern, the question of
universal access must be answered not only in terms of `access where`, but also
in terms of `access by whom` and `access for what`. This study addresses this
issue by conducting anthropological field research on information resources and
strategy in a low-income neighborhood of Chicago. Wizdom Systems, Inc. will
profile the information requirements and acquisition patterns of low-income
groups; with rapid prototyping methods, they design broadband applications that
are demonstrably useful and valuable. The Phase I result would be a system
design and prototype for an Internet application tailored to low-income Black
communities.
