This research program is aimed at performing three precision experimental
searches for new physics beyond the standard model of particle physics. The
experiments use a maser operating simultaneously with Xe-129 and He-3. By
stabilizing one of the noble-gas masers to a frequency reference, the PI's group
can control the environment of the masers and then use the other maser as a
sensor for new physics. The experiments to be carried out include: (i) a
sensitive test of the fundamental Lorentz invariance (one of the fundamental
aspects of the theory of relativity) and CPT (Charge conjugation, Parity, and
Time reversal) symmetry for the neutron; (ii) an order-of-magnitude improved
search for the effects of torsion gravity, which arises if spacetime has a
Riemann-Cartan geometry; and (iii) a sensitive search for anomalous spin-spin
interactions in the neutron sector. For experiment (i) and (ii) the project is
expected to provide an order-of-magnitude improvement compared to the best
previous limits. Much of our understanding of fundamental physics would have to
be radically altered if an effect is observed. Experiment (iii) will provide a
first sensitive search of this effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of
the program include the application of the atomic physics based precision
measurement techniques of this research into the development of novel biomedical
imaging tools (for example magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at low magnetic
fields of hyperpolarized noble gas inhaled into human lungs), as well as the
development of a high-sensitivity magnetometer using nitrogen vacancy centers in
diamond. Other broader impacts include extensive student training with continued
successful focus on inclusion and training in precision measurements techniques
of students and postdocs who are members of underrepresented groups in science
and engineering.
