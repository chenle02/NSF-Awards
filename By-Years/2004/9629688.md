This award from the Chemical Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program and the Academic Research and Infrastructure (ARI) Program will assist
the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin Madison upgrade the
existing 11.74 Tesla NMR. This equipment will enhance research in a number of
areas including the following: (1) mechanistic transition metal organometallic
chemistry (2) synthesis and mechanistic studis of boron hydride clusters (3)
folding patterns in peptides and proteins, and (4) organosilicon chemistry.
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms
within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists
who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are
useful in the areas such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
