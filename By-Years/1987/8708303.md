This project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program will apply
the mathematical theory of Continuous Groups of Transformations to the chemical
problem of determination of molecular potential energy surfaces and relations
between surfaces. This will provide explicit functional forms for such surfaces
that can obviate much of the computer intensive work currently required to
characterize chemical processes at the molecular level.
