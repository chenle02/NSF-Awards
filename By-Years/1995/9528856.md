Renewed funding is provided to continue development and install an undersea
observatory that is connected to shore-based laboratories via a fiber-optic
cable. The Hawaii Undersea Geo-Observatory (HUGO) integrates marine fiberoptic
cable and submersible technologies to prmvide the ocean science community with
an unmanned laboratory on the ocean floor at the summit of Loihi seamount.
Loihi, an active submarine volcano, is located about 35 km southeast of the
Island of Hawaii. Its shallow summit (about 1000m below sea level), exciting
geology, earthquakes, frequent volcanic activity, and proximity to land make it
an ideal site to install a permanent geo-laboratory, and begin real-time
monitoring of processes occurring at the ocean floor. The modular observatory
has the potential to house more than 100 experiments from every ocean science
discipline, supplying experiments with electrical power, command capability, and
real-time continuous data transmission to shore. Once installed, scientists will
be able to study submarine volcanic, biological, and oceanographic processes
continuously. HUGO data will also be used by the U.S. Geological Survey Hawaiian
Volcano Observatory in their studies of Hawaiian volcanoes, and by the Pacific
Tsunami Warning Center in characterization of tsunamis from distant earthquakes.
HUGO earthquake and acoustic data will be made available to local schools for
teaching and projects, and sub-sets will be presented on the INTERNET. Initial
experiments will include a broad band hydrophone sampled at 42 KHz, which will
be sensitive to biological and other noises over a wide range of audio
frequencies. The use of cables to connect seafloor observatories and
experimental sites to shore is a strong area of interest for several factions of
the ocean science community. What is learned from this project will have
applications for future cable installations as well.
