This grant, funded under the Small Grants for Exploratory Research Program, will
study several elections markets in Germany for the parliamentary elections for a
unified Germany, scheduled to take place on December 2, 1990. Markets will be
designed to predict the outcome of the all-German election. The research will
yield important insights into the operation of both markets and elections. From
the standpoint of markets, it will be determined how successfully markets can
forecast an unprecedented event and, in the case of East Germany, how
successfully markets operate in a culture conditioned on a nonmarket economy.
From the standpoint of elections, the impact of various campaign practices and
events on the election outcome will be investigated. The cultural and
institutional differences among East Germany, West Germany and the United Sates
present unusual opportunities for comparative analysis of markets and election
campaigns.
