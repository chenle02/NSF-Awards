This proposal describes MRnet, the Minnesota Regional Network, which presently
links twenty-one public and private educational institutions and twenty private
research foundations, government agencies, and commercial businesses to each
other and to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second)
National Backbone network. MRnet plans to expand its capacity for connecting
education and research institutions and to expand its educational and user into
new regions of the state. This should encourage smaller institutions to take
advantage of information resources available on MRnet itself or through the
NSFNET. The items proposed for NSF support include: -Expansion of technical and
user services staff; -Creation of a new network hub in Rochester, MN; -Terminal
servers for connecting very small member institutions at a reasonable cost;
-Personnel for outreach, marketing, and support of new members.
