The study of "helpers at the nest" has received much attention in the avian
literature but comparatively little in mammals. The proposed study will be the
first extensive investigation in the order Rodentia and will provide insights
into the evolution of apparently altruistic behaviors that can be examined in
other species. Also, this study will examine the long-term effects of the
presence or absense of older siblings on the behavior and reproductive success
of younger sibs. The dynamics of family groups are important in population
processes in Microtus ochrogaster. Knowledge of the behavior of prairie voles
can be important in regulating population densities below a level which would
result in serious economic problems.//
