Abstract CTS-0133780 D. Corti, Purdue University

This proposal lies at the frontier in an area, self-assembly in dense
suspensions, in which theory lags behind rapidly evolving experimental
techniques. The focus on geometrically-based statistical mechanics and novel
simulations to address entropy-driven processes promises research at a high
intellectual level.

The theory has a clear physical basis and is relatively simple, but not easy,
and is complemented by an experimental effort in collaboration with a group
equipped to measure interparticle potentials directly. This approach might be
powerful and simple enough to provide guidance for experimentalists seeking to
self-assemble novel structures and to appeal to others applying statistical
mechanics. The educational effort wisely concentrates on the undergraduate
curriculum for chemical engineering, particularly the thermodynamic content.
There is much to gain from linking course content to physically accessible
topics in graduate research.
