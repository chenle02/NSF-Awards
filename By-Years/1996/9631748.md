Implementation of Work Teams Across Cultures: Factors Influencing Team
Effectiveness Organizations are increasingly introducing work teams as a means
of improving efficiency and responsiveness. Several questions remain, however,
as to how to best to manage such teams. For example, should direction for the
team be provided externally, or should the teams themselves be allowed to define
their own objectives and goals. In this research proposal, the PI notes that the
benefits of greater or lesser external direction in terms of team performance
will depend upon the motivational characteristics of the team and, for teams
located in different cultures, by differences in values and cognitive processes
across cultures.. This proposal outlines a three year research plan to examine
the implications of differences in cultural values and cognitive processes
regarding the appropriate level of external direction.
