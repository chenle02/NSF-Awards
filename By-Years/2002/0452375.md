In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Prof. James C. Weisshaar of the University of Wisconsin -
Madison and his graduate research students will use the methods of physical
chemistry to attempt to understand the fundamental mechanisms in a cell's plasma
membrane responsible for exocytosis. The primary tool will be single-molecule
fluorescence microscopy of mobile protein molecules on a synthetic planar lipid
bilayer. The methods developed should be applicable to other interesting
biophysical systems.

Besides the potential broader impact of the proposed research on other
biophysical systems, the young researchers working on this project will be
exposed to a unique interdisciplinary experience. In addition, Prof. Weisshaar
will incorporate aspects of his research into the undergraduate courses that he
teaches, and he will visit local community organizations to promote better
understanding of the modern research university.
