The work described in this proposal is based on two new principles associated
with general equilibria. These principles lead in turn to a new proof of the
fundamental existence theorem for general equilibria and new approaches to the
construction of algorithms for computing equilibria. The new proof of the
fundamental existence theorem provides interesting new insights into the nature
of equilibria, and suggests extensions to economies with externalities and
nonconvexities. This project also leads to new algorithms for actually computing
economic equilibria. These new algorithms appear to promise an increase in
computational efficiency and robustness over existing methods. This increase in
efficiency is based in part on the fact that the new algorithms require a fixed-
point solution in a space having dimension equal to the number of individuals
rather than the number of commodities. Typically this means a great reduction in
dimension and hence a similar reduction in computation time. This project
investigates the properties of these new algorithms as well as continuing the
theoretical research.
