*** ABSTRACT 9661263 Debs This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
project will complete the research required to introduce some basic new
functionality to the EPRI Operator Training Simulator (OTS) to meet the needs of
deregulated (restructured) electric utilities. A key element here is to upgrade
the EPRI-OTS to become an effective tool for training the ISO (Independent
System Operators) dispatchers for system operation. ISO engineers and management
staff will be able to use the enhanced product for operation planning and other
studies. The main objective of this work will be to integrate new models and
programs into the EPRI-OTS consisting of: (1) a novel Multi-Area Optimal Power
Flow; (2) simultaneous transfer capability coordination program; and (3)
measurement and evaluation of ancillary services program. Other objectives
relate to testing and evaluation of these programs and the preparation of a
Phase II plan. The result of the Phase I research will be a demonstrable product
which will clearly differentiate itself in the arena of Operator Training
Simulators for the deregulated electric utility. It is expected that the OTS
developed during this research will be implemented at most major electric
utilities--including an estimated 100+ United States and 50+ international
utilities who need the results of the proposed research and development. ***
