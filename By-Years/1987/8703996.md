The principal investigator has requested funds for the purchase of digital
conversion for UV/Vis/NIR Spectrophotometer. The instrumentation will be used in
undergraduate teaching and research as well as the principal investigator's
research. The principal investigator is studying the mechanism of proton
translocation by ATPase, cytochrome,. reductase, cytochrome oxidase, and
bacteriorhodopsin, especially the latter. Of particular interest is the role of
Asp 115 in bacteriorhodopsin. The upgraded Cary 14 will provide a unique data-
processing capability to users in chemistry, physics, and biology.
