Many questions in arithmetic can be phrased in terms of the superposition of
waves by way of the Fourier Transform. A basic question is "What do the
frequencies of these waves tell us about their interference and vice versa?".
The interference of the waves has to do with the magnitude of their
superposition, and the concentration of the interference can be made large by
choosing the frequencies according to a strict pattern. One of the questions
pursued by the PI is the converse: are these patterns necessary to achieve a
very concentrated superposition. This is called the Inverse Littlewood Problem.
The second question under investigation is an uncertainty principle. Suppose we
have two families of waves that can be used to decompose a signal, and these two
families are very incompatible. This incompatibility means we expect that a
simple wave from one family looks much more complicated as a superposition from
the second. A specific instance of this is whether a multiplicative character (a
very simple wave in one family) can be decomposed as an additive convolution (a
fairly simple superposition in another family). This is called Sarkozy's
Problem.

There is a long history of comparing the distribution and arithmetic structure
of sequences in number theory. Classically, the connection is observed by way of
the Fourier transform. Towards a better understanding of this phenomenon, the PI
plans to build upon recent results that relate the dimension of a finite subset
of a lattice to estimates on the L^1-norm of its associated Fourier series. This
area of investigation began with a conjecture of Littlewood on how small the L^1
-norm of the Fourier transform of a finite set of integers could be. The problem
was resolved independently by Konyagin and McGehee-Pigno-Smith in the 1980s.
Recently, questions have turned to classifying the extremizers in this problem,
and the PI has recently proved that they must be, in an appropriate sense, low-
dimensional. In this project he will develop the method further, by weakening
hypotheses and applying these results to problems in arithmetic reliant the L^1
norm. In the finite field setting, the PI and Petridis have made substantial
progress on a problem of Sarkozy concerning sumsets and the quadratic residues.
They have resolved the conjecture for almost all primes. The PI will develop the
ideas further so as to resolve the conjecture in earnest. Beyond this, he will
adapt the method to other problems, which in turn will lead to progress on
Vinogradov?s conjecture on the least non-residue.
