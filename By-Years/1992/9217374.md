The Grand Challenge Application Groups competition provides one mechanism for
the support of multidiscipinary teams of scientists and engineers to meet the
goals of the High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC) Initiative in
Fiscal Year 1992. The ideal proposal provided not only excellence in science:
focussed problem with potential for substantial impact in a critical area of
science and engineering) but also significant interactions between scientific
and computational activities, usually involving mathematical, computer or
computational scientists, that would have impact in high-performance
computational activity beyond the specific scientific or engineering problem
area(s) or discipline being studied. In the award to Scott, McCammon, Glowinski,
and Pettitt, the research will resolve several issues that will enable high-
performance computing to solve critical problems in biomolecular design. The
most obvious problem relates to the difficulty in using advanced computer
architectures. Secondly, new algorithms (mathematical and computer science-
based) and methods (physical science-based) are needed to solve problems with
reasonable efficiency. Finally, detailed understanding of what types of problems
can be treated with vastly improved computing resources is needed to guide and
provoke the development of both algorithms and software. The grand challenge
problem motivating the computational research include thermodynamic cycle
perturbation theory applied to ligand-binding proteins and Poisson-
Botzman/Brownian dynamics applied to protein design. The award will support
postdoctoral associates, graduate students, and the purchase of a high
performance computing system.
