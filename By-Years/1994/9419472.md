9419472 Schouten The principal investigators will evaluate the edge-driven model
for the kinematic evolution of the Gulf of Mexico. Two- dimensional and three-
dimensional analysis of magnetic edge anomalies around the Gulf rim will
determine the nature and distribution of magnetic boundaries that may represent
synchronous and diachronous parts of conjugate crustal boundaries of North
America and Yucatan. The produce will be a quantitative, continuous kinematic
solution for the opening of the Gulf of Mexico. ***
