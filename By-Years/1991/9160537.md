Light signals pass through optical processors via an interconnecting system of
wave guide structures. Fluorinated polymers, because of their outstanding
properties, are logical materials for use in fabricating these structures.
Fluoropolymers can be paired with other plastics of ceramics of higher
refractive index and "potentially" fabricated into wave guide structures using
an innovative micromachining technique known as LIGA Microforming. The ultimate
goal of this program (Phase I and II) is the direct fabrication of wave guide
structures by X-ray or deep UV lithography. New resist materials with
outstanding sensitivity, contrast, resolution, and adhesion are required for the
"Thick film" coatings necessary for micromachining. These resists will be
designed in the Phase I program. For the Phase I effort, we will synthesize two
promising candidates poly (trifluoroethyl methacrylate) and poly
(hexafluoroisopropyl methacrylate) and evaluate resist performance for both
X-ray and deep UV exposure. Each fluorinated monomer will be copolymerized with
3-oximino-2 butanone methacrylate to give improved sensitivity for deep-UV
exposure. The two copolymers will be evaluated for deep-UV properties neat and
also sensitized with p-t-butylbenzoic acid. The four polymers will be chemically
characterized and tested for application properties, sensitivity to deep-U and
X-ray (homopolymers only), contrast, resolution, and refractive index versus
wavelength. The developer and rinse cycle will be optimized for each polymer.
Resist materials and developers from Phase I will be further optimized in Phase
II and used for micromachining a wave guide.
