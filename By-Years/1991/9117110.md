9117110 Badler This is the third year of a three-year continuing grant. The
goal of this research is 3-D animation of facial expressions including those
conveying emotion correlated with the intonation of the voice. This includes
differentiation of timing, pitch and emphasis that are related to semantic
distinctions of discourse as "given" and "new" information. Until now, existing
systems have not taken into account the link between these two features. The
alogrithm to be used will embody rules that control these various modes of
expression. The choice of accents and their placement will be examined in
conjunction with whether the message is new or old. The facial model integrates
the action of each muscle or group of muscles as well as the propagation of
their movement. A two-person conversation model will also be investigated to
explore the roles of the listener and the speaker and how turn-taking is
established facially and by gestures.
