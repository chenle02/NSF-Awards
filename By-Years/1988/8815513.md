Within a unified framework made possible by the homotopy principle, this
project is to formulate, implement and analyse new interior point algorithms for
linear programming. Two broad classes of algorithms are distinguished. The first
class of algorithms path-follow using Euler predictor and Newton corrector
steps, and develop nonmonotonic iterates. Here the emphasis is on basic
formulation, implementation and analysis. The second class of algorithms utilize
restarts of the homotopy. They develop monotonic iterates, correspond to affine
rescaling variants of Karmarkar's projective algorithm, and mesh well with the
simplex algorithm. This project will develop an explicit null-space affine
rescaling approach in which search directions are computed inexactly. An
iterative method is the primary technique used to solve associated linear
systems.
