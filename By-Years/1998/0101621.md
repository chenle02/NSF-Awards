This is a three-year project to enhance the preparation of underserved students
for employment in the fields of manufacturing communications and information
technologies industries. The design to do this is to improve the teaching and
learning process in participating institutions by incorporating technology-based
curricular materials, preparing faculty in effective teaching practices, and
developing work-related technical learning experiences for faculty and students.
This initiative is building directly on the&lt;br/&gt;existing School to Work
Program (STWP) in the area of high technology. . The lead institution is the
University of Puerto Rico (UPR) at Aguadilla. Other partners are UPR at Humacao
and Bayamon, two 4-year institutions of the UPR system, 26 public high schools
currently participating in the STWP, and an array of local high-tech industries.
The project is serving 150 faculty members and
teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
