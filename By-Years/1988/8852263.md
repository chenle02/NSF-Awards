This award will provide funds to set up an undergraduate Developmental Biology
research laboratory to be used primarily by undergraduate Honors students. The
goal of the project is to promote a critical and independent scientific approach
during the execution of laboratory experiments in developmental biology by a
group of students who are both motivated and likely to enter some profession
related to Biology or other science. The funds from this award will be used to
equip a laboratory with the instrumentation to carry out several projects each
lasting several weeks over the semester. The projects will involve experiments
on 1.) Differentiation in cell culture; 2.) Gene expression in Drosophila, in
vitro fertilization; 3.) Maternal control of development; 4.) Induction of genes
during development. The instrumentation was selected on the basis of the
projects proposed by the faculty as being suitable for execution by advanced
undergraduate students. The major instruments include a variety of quality
microscopes and video recording and imaging equipment for the detailed analysis
of morphological and subcellular events. Gel electrophoresis equipment of the
analysis of proteins and nucleic acids. Centrifuges, spectrophotometer,
incubators, and balances for the preparation, isolation and characterization of
material. The grantee institution is matching this NSF award with funds from
non-Federal sources.
