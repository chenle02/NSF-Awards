The proposed research is for the development of the concept, design, and
implementation of a software-support/reconfigurable- hardware platform that
accepts an application program, written in C, and automatically generates both
the hardware-configuration data and the program to execute on a reconfigured
hardware. The initial application programs to be looked at are the kernel
algorithms currently used in speech processing, distributed decision-making,
computer vision, CAD of digital systems, robotics, and signal processing
algorithms. New Conversion techniques for the expanded set of C functions will
be developed. The construction of a limited hardware platform to verify the
expected advantages of the software system will be studied.
