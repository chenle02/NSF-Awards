DMS-9423746 PI: R. Beals, R. R. Coifman, P. W. Jones Abstract The principal
investigators will continuing their work in a number of related areas of
analysis: harmonic analysis, nonlinear Fourier analysis, and partial
differential equations, with applications to complex analysis, physical
problems, and numerical work. Beals and collaborators will make more use their
methods from Hamiltonian mechanics to investigate fundamental solutions for
subelliptic laplacians. Beals will also continue joint work on the quantized
three-wave interaction and on geophysical inverse problems. Coifman and Meyer
will continue to investigate nonlinear Fourier analysis and applications to
homogenization and nonlinear dependence. Coifman will also continue to develop
adapted wave form analysis to obtain geometric and numerical understanding of
oscillatory operators. Jones will continue his work on the fine properties of
harmonic measure and level lines of Green's function, as well as work on
singular integrals and d-bar problems related to corona problems and analytic
capacity. Jones also plans further investigations in quasiconformal mappings and
problems relating Sobolev spaces and geometry of sets. Analysis is the area of
mathematics that has grown directly from the invention of calculus and
differential equations. It provides a framework for attacking problems that
range from the purely mathematical and geometrical to the most concrete
scientific and technical questions. In turn, these problems have provided the
motivation for the continued refinement of the subject and, not incidentally,
its continued utility. Thus there is no precise dividing line between pure
theory and potential or actual application. For example, in little more than a
decade sophisticated techniques of pure harmonic analysis have emerged in
practice as wavelet analysis and have enormously extended the possibilities for
analysis and storage of digital data. The sub jects to be investigated in this
proposal reflect the full range of analysis as well as the actual and potential
interplay between "pure" and "applied." Some have a history of a century or more
and come from classical analysis and geometry, others have a history of decades
and are motivated by physics and geophysics, others have arisen in the last
decade and are connected with signal processing and the concrete use of
computers in science and technology.
