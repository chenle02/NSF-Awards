In the mineral processing industry, the energy-efficiency of comminution of
rocks/ores has not seen any major advances in the last few decades; the
fundamental process is still energy intensive and extremely indfficient. In
response to this situation, a radically different and new approach to the
problem was concieved and studied in Phase I. The approach centers around the
concept of hydraulically applying the input energy directly along grain
boundaries, microcavities and pores of the material, and generating the high
stress gradients necessary to effect fracture with a minimum of waste. The Phase
II Program involves the following tasks: (1) construction of a laboratory
prototype system with automated feedback controls and data acquisition system,
(2) collection of rock/ore samples and measurement of their physical properties,
(3) development of an analytical solution/model to simulate the process, and (4)
testing of the samples of the prototype.
