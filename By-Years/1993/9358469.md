9358469 McKinley Funded from a National Science Foundation Young Investigator
Award, research in Non-Newtonian Fluid Mechanics will be conducted. The approach
is experimental, through the use of integrated applications of Laser Doppler
Velocimetry and Digital Particle Image Velocimetry. Various fluid dynamic issues
related to instabilities in the flow of polymers and suspensions will be
explored. Polymer processes such as extrusion, spinning, and coating are subject
to various forms of instabilities, and a more accurate and realistic basis is
needed to predict and control stable performance of these systems. ***
