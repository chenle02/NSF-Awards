Project Summary The objective of this research is the understanding of the
physical processes associated with the interactions of laser-induced plasmas
with aerosol particles. The emphasis is on the basic plasma-particle
interactions, a complex problem given the highly transient nature of the laser-
induced plasma, plasma non-homogeneity, and the uncertainty as to the exact
mechanisms of aerosol particle dissociation. To elucidate the plasma science
coupled to each of these problems, a program is executed consisting of the
following: (1) the design and implementation of a laser-induced plasma
spectroscopy apparatus coupled with an electrostatic particle trap; this novel
experimental facility will enable the manipulation of individual submicron- to
micron-sized particles to realize spatially resolved measurements of their
interaction with laser-induced plasmas; (2) a comprehensive experimental
investigation of the laser-induced plasma-particle interactions, including time-
resolved measurements of the particle dissociation processes and subsequent
atomic diffusion processes; and (3) the formulation of optimal laser-induced
plasma excitation and atomic emission diagnostic schemes to improve laser-
induced plasma spectroscopy (LIPS) as an analytical technique based on the
fundamental plasma processes elucidated in the proposed experimental program.

This effort addresses such areas as plasmas in environmental science and plasma
diagnostics. Laser-induced plasma spectroscopy (LIPS) has become an important
contemporary analytical tool due to the relative simplicity of the technique,
the availability of robust electro-optic components, and the current interest in
real-time analytical tools in environmental and process monitoring. In
particular, recent interest in health risks and mortality associated with
ambient-air particulate matter has led to demands for advanced real-time
instrumentation for fine particulate analysis. Laser-induced plasma spectroscopy
is an ideal candidate for this. However, many questions remain regarding the
interactions of laser-induced plasmas with fine aerosol particles, including
particle vaporization/dissociation, atomic diffusion of aerosol constituent
atoms, and ensuing plasma optical emission. This program directly addresses
these key issues.

Broader impact

In addition to the experimental research program in plasma science, the proposed
research also functions to educate and train engineering students in the
important crosscutting fields of advanced measurement techniques and plasma
science. Such educational objectives are accomplished through graduate research,
undergraduate research, and significant incorporation of research elements into
the engineering curriculum.
