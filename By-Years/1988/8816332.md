The interstellar medium (ISM) is the stage on which the fundamental processes of
the evolution of galaxies are played out: star formation, interstellar heating
and enrichment, galaxy formation and evolution. Thus, developing a complete
picture of the universe requires understanding the interstellar medium within
galaxies. Although workshops and symposia have included studies of galaxian
interstellar media as part of their content, there has yet to be a single
meeting devoted exclusively to the gas and dust content of external galaxies.
Approximately 30 scientists will be supported to attend the Second Wyoming
conference on the Interstellar Medium: The Interstellar Medium in External
Galaxies. The meeting will be held in July, 1989.
