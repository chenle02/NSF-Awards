Objective: We propose to study Optical Parametric Oscillator (OPO) laser sources
for the 3 um to 12 um band fabricated as monolithic on-chip nanowaveguides using
standard lithographic tools. &lt;br/&gt;Specifically, we propose an OPO that (1)
is implemented as a monolithic, lithographically defined waveguide with integral
Bragg reflectors;&lt;br/&gt;(2) employs form birefringent structures for phase
matching; and (3) has a triply resonant cavity. The combination of all three of
these elements is necessary to create inexpensive and efficient OPO
sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: To the best of our knowledge,
phase-matched form birefringent waveguides have not yet been exploited in
resonant nanocavities to create OPOs. Triply resonant OPO cavities also, to the
best of our knowledge, have not been realized, and even doubly-resonant devices
are relatively recent. Therefore the proposed research is transformative in
nature as it will advance the fundamental understanding of (1) parametric
oscillation in multiply-resonant form-birefringent waveguide cavities, (2)
materials and processes that may be suitable for mass fabrication of such
cavities, leading to on-chip mid-infrared OPO laser sources, and (3) numerical
modeling of nonlinear interaction in resonant cavities, and numerical
optimization methods relating to the design of multiply-resonant
structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: The development of the proposed
compact and inexpensive on-chip mid-infrared source will lead to advances in
spectroscopic instrumentation, with applications to environmental science,
pollution monitoring, chemical threat detection and other areas. The project
will also play a significant role in the education, outreach and development of
human resources in science and engineering at the graduate and undergraduate
levels.&lt;br/&gt;
