Eastern boundary currents systems, like the California Current System, have a
high plankton biomass because circulation processes periodically force deep,
nutrient-rich water to the ocean surface. Linkage of physical and biological
models is proposed to relate mesoscale features (filaments, jets, and eddies) to
spatial and demographic shifts in population growth, fecundity and mortality.
The results of this research should improve the understanding of how diel
vertical migration and water circulation interact to affect the spatial
distribution and population success of important CCS zooplankton species such as
Calanus pacificus, Metridia pacifica and Euphausia pacifica.
