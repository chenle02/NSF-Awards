First-principles investigations of neutron and nuclear matter are at the
forefront of research activities in nuclear physics and take ample advantage of
the recent advances in high-performance computing. This project will lay the
groundwork for finite-temperature studies of nuclear physics by pursuing the
systematic study of strongly-coupled Fermi systems and by testing this approach
with related few- and many-body problems in atomic physics. The numerical
methods developed here focus on nonperturbative aspects of the nuclear many-body
problem and the results are expected to impact other fields such as atomic and
condensed matter physics, high-energy physics and astrophysics. The group will
establish a database of Monte Carlo configurations that will serve the
scientific community in the USA and abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
will promote an interdisciplinary study employing advanced first-principles
calculations in several fields, ranging from nuclear physics to condensed matter
and atomic physics. This will present unique opportunities for undergraduate and
graduate students to develop a broad understanding of various physical systems
and perform creative multidisciplinary research. The database developed here
will provide hands-on tools useful for teaching nonperturbative numerical
methods for students worldwide. Education at the undergraduate level will
benefit the local Computational Astronomy and Physics Research Experience for
Undergraduates (CAP-REU) program.
