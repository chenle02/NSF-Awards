This award will enable collaborative research between Drs. Ian R. Gibbons,
Barbara H. Gibbons and Dan Eshel of the University of Hawaii and Drs. Keiichi
Takahashi and Chikako Shingyoji of the University of Tokyo, Japan. They will
examine the mechanisms which regulate the sliding of sperm flagellar
microtubules and thereby produce bending movements. The investigators propose to
use sea urchin spermatozoa for their studies. Individual spermatozoa will be
held by suction at the tip of a specially shaped micropipette and the effects of
pipette movements on flagellar waveform will be analyzed. Transducers for
studying rapid mechanical transients and software for computer controlled
movement of the micropipette will be developed. The investigators will be
developing a new and potentially powerful way to analyze the still poorly
understood mechanism of ciliary motility. The complementary strengths of the two
laboratories will provide necessary expertise in a wide range of techniques,
including micromanipulation, protein modification, video microscopy,
hydrodynamic analysis, and real-time computer programming.
