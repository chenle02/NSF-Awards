9316264 Finnemore This award will support the travel of Dr. Douglas Finnemore
and an advanced graduate student from the Department of Physics and Astronomy at
Iowa State University to conduct cooperative research on microstructures,
critical current density and flux pinning in high temperature superconductors
with Prof. S. X. Dou at the University of New South Wales, School of Materials
Science and Engineering. Over a two-year period, a visit will be made each year
by Dr. Finnemore while his graduate student spends up to three months each year
collaborating with researchers in Dr. Dou's laboratory. The primary focus of
this research is on gaining an understanding of the kinetics of synthesis of
high temperature bismuth-based oxide superconductors and the relationship of
microstructure to fundamental transport properties. This project brings together
the expertise of the U.S. researchers and their x-ray technology for studying
melting and freezing of high temperature superconductors with the Australian
group's expertise in preparing new materials and uncovering new processing
procedures. Prof. Dou will make exchange visits to Iowa State University through
the support of the Australian Department of Industry, Technology and Regional
Development.
