With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Johns Hopkins University will
upgrade their 300 MHz and 400 MHz NMR Spectrometers. This equipment will enable
researchers to carry out studies on a) enzyme model complexes and new
porphyrinoid systems; b) synthesis of oligonucleotide bioconjugates; c)
bioinorganic modeling of metalloenzyme active sites and environmental inorganic
chemistry; d) photochemistry of inorganic coordination compounds; e) synthetic
organic chemistry; and f) structure and reactivity of organic intermediates.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies will have an impact in synthetic organic chemistry and biochemistry.
