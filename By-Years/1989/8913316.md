It is well established that the amino acid sequence of a protein determines how
the protein folds, and whether the protein is destined to be water soluble or
membrane-bound, and to which small molecules or other macromolecules the protein
binds. However, the atomic basis of these events of molecular recognition is not
yet understood well enough to permit many useful predictions from the knowledge
of the amino acid sequence alone. This is unfortunate, because many advances in
practical problems, such as drug and protein design, await further progress in
understanding these relationships. This proposal takes three directions in
addressing this central problem: (1) Crystal structure studies of small
amphiphilic proteins and of designed proteins, to elucidate rules of protein
folding, and rules for association of proteins with lipids and other apolar
surfaces: (2) Computations of energies of protein-folding and protein-lipid
association, using atomic solvation parameters, semi-empirical quantities that
represent an atom-based solvation (or hydrophobic) free energy; and (3)
Computational analysis of amino acid sequences, using extensions of the PROFILE
method which is a way of representing information about families amino acid
sequences in proteins.*** //
