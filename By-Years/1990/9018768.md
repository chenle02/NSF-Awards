The aim of this research program is to understand the mechanism for electron
transfer reactions in biological systems. The work is focussed on electron
tunneling pathways in proteins, i.e., how the protein environment mediates the
electron transfer reaction. The work is divided into three categories: 1)
Tunneling Pathways in Proteins - Searches for tunneling pathways in native and
modified will be performed. Dr. Onuchic will try to understand how details of
the protein structure define a tunneling pathway. New theoretical techniques
will be developed to understand inference effects in individual pathways as well
as between the pathways. 2) Dynamical Modulation of the Tunneling Maxtrix
Element - A tunneling pathway is composed of covalent bonds, through space
contacts, and hydrogen bonds. These though space contacts may be flexible, and
their motion may modulate the tunneling matrix element. Dr. Onuchic proposed to
investigate how this motion introduces a temperature dependence to the tunneling
matrix element. 3) Model Improvement and New Theoretical Aspects - New
theoretical calculations will be performed to improve the parameters used in the
model and to understand the importance of multi-electron effects on tunneling
pathways.
