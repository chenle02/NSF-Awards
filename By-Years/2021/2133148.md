The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project will improve treatment for children with communication impairments. The
project will develop a system that provides specialists and parents with reports
that have accurate, efficient, and easy-to-understand speech and language
evaluations with recommendations and suggestions, for better understanding the
children’s communication challenges and how to solve them. It will bridge the
gap between a clinical assessment and support at home, impacting clinical
outcomes by providing a more accurate assessment of child language developmental
needs. Consequently, this will result in more personalized education and
treatment, particularly for diverse communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses pain points
surrounding speech and language assessment with children with communication
impairments. The child’s language use must be captured in a natural setting to
obtain an accurate analysis. The solution is a flexible, self-customizing system
using a trained AI approach to evaluate speech and language skills, then provide
analytical feedback in key communication areas. To evaluate a child’s
communication skills, the system collects a language sample based on natural
adult-child social language interactions. Research objectives include: (1)
improvement and development of machine-learning modules, specifically the
language proficiency assessment, recommendation engine, recognition of child
voices, recognition of accents and dialects, and intonation detection; (2) an
autism screener development, to be used as a pre-diagnostic tool with eye-
tracking technology; and (3) web and mobile application development for data
collection by the child.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
