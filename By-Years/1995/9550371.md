Dr. Patricia McBride is collaborating with members of Princeton University's
Physics Department on studies of B physics at Collider Detectors. The studies
extend to topics related to Heavy Flavor Physics and CP Violation. The main
focus of this research is on design studies for a hadron collider experiment
dedicated to B physics and on the development of particle physics detectors,
particularly in the area of particle identification. Interactive activities
include: a seminar series in which speakers are invited to the give lectures on
research topics in physics in which lectures include women who are active in
research both at the junior and senior level; organizing a series of informal
seminars for the graduate students designed to be pedagogical in nature and
provide background material on a variety of research topics; teaching an
introductory physics course.
