9314377 Houston This two year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in
physical chemistry between Paul Houston, Cornell University, and Francois Rostas
of the Paris Observatory in Meudon. The objective of their research is to
develop a tunable vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) laser light source for the wavelength
range 110-170 nm and its application to spectroscopy and dissociation dynamics
of carbon dioxide (CO2). The laser is considered the light source of choice and
necessity for investigating photo- dissociation of carbon dioxide (CO2) into
carbon-oxygen and oxygen at low wavelengths. The U.S. investigator brings to
this collaboration extensive expertise in molecular dynamics, especially in the
area of photo-chemically laser dissociated molecules. This is complemented by
the French investigator's expertise in VUV spectroscopy of diatomic and small
polyatomic molecules of astrophysical importance. Carbon dioxide is an important
atmospheric and interstellar constituent. In the earth's atmosphere, it has a
profound effect on the thermal balance. It is also the principal constituent of
the atmosphere of Mars and Venus. This project will advance our understanding of
its optical properties and its photochemical processes. ***
