In this proposal, a group of researchers from the University of Washington
request support for participation in two experiments at the energy frontiers.
The ALEPH experiment at the LEP is a successful collaboration at the highest
energies in electron-positron collisions, and running on the ZO has provided the
field with an impressive set of tests of the Standard Model. More tests will be
carried out at still higher energies, and discovery potential is high. The ATLAS
experiment at CERN has the range to explore the Higg's boson and the world of
supersymmetric particles.
