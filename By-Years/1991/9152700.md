The Mathematical Sciences Department at Worcester Polytechnic Institute is
redesigning its undergraduate calculus and linear algebra curriculum in order to
take advantage of new technology and direct the focus of the course more towards
engineering applications. This new approach involves bringing substantial
applications from nonlinear programming into the calculus and linear algebra
sequence, as many of these problems involve immediate applications of the basic
concepts taught in these courses. A second focus of the new sequence involves
mathematics majors in the development of course materials, including
instructional software, as part of their senior year projects.
