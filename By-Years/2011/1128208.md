The objective of this program is the experimental demonstration of
transformative silicon photonic devices for optical delay line integrated
circuits. Specifically, novel electronically-tuned analog delay lines, low-loss
digital delay lines, optical amplifiers enhanced for high gain and monolithic
integration, and switches designed for high interchannel isolation are proposed.
Several of these devices will be eventually monolithically integrated on the
same silicon wafer and a multi-channel integrated photonic circuit will be
demonstrated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is the application of
the program?s outcomes in optical storage, telecommunications, optical
interconnects, etc. True-time delay lines in optical domain have been pursued to
replace bulky and lossy coaxial cables. The proposed integrated photonic
solutions on silicon are advantageous in many ways and can lead to a
transformative lightweight and electronics-compatible
platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are outreach to all levels of
education and diffusion into the society. The merger of key fields of research
will drive future scientific breakthroughs and educate multifaceted
undergraduate and graduate students. The PI will participate as a ?super-
scientist? in a local elementary school. High school students will be brought to
campus for scientific field trips and tours of laboratories. Outreach projects
for underrepresented minorities are highlighted to provide research experience
for undergraduates and expose them to science and engineering disciplines. The
proposed multidisciplinary work may play a role in more advanced
telecommunication, biophotonic and information technology systems with direct
impact on the daily life of our society.
