9354105 Klapper The conference proposed is absolutely necessary if the
Eisenhower National Clearinghouse for Mathematics and Science Education is to
achieve its purpose of helping educators to locate all science and mathematics
instructional materials funded by Federal government. There currently are
databases created by government agencies such as NASA, NIH, DC and ED. All of
them contain references to science and mathematics instructional materials. If
the ultimate user is to be served with a minimum of frustration, a one source
inquiry is required. The Eisenhower National Clearinghouse wants to bring
together all the potential participants in a federation of databases that would
subscribe to standard protocols. To the user it appear that there is one source,
rather that further references that would require additional inquiries. ***
