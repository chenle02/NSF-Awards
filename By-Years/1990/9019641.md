This Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers is made to Dr. Sylvia T.
Ceyer of the Department of Chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. Ceyer will initiate a new project integrating laser spectroscopy
with molecular beam surface techniques. The goal of the project is to determine
the contribution of electronic effects to the interaction of molecules with
surfaces. The difference in vibrational energy of molecules scattered from
excited and unexcited silicon surfaces is attributable to the electronic
component of the interaction. %%% The NSF Faculty Award for Women recognizes the
high quality of the awardee's record in teaching and scholarship as well as
potential for continued significant contributions to scientific research, the
academic profession, and the education of future scientists. Particularly
noteworthy achievements are Ceyer's research on the dynamics of molecule-surface
interaction and outstanding undergraduate teaching.
