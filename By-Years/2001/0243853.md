This Exploratory Grant for Exploratory Research will provide
support&lt;br/&gt;for the fabrication of components of a forward pion detector
(FPD)&lt;br/&gt;to be installed in the STAR detector at the Relativistic Heavy
Ion&lt;br/&gt;Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory in anticipation
of&lt;br/&gt;the 2003 experimental run. Measurement of neutral pion
production&lt;br/&gt;by transversely polarized proton beams can provide to our
knowledge&lt;br/&gt;of the gluon distribution in the proton. Preliminary runs
with&lt;br/&gt;simple detectors have produced results which motivate the
present&lt;br/&gt;design, and narrow equipment installation windows at RHIC
have&lt;br/&gt;contributed a time urgency to this project.&lt;br/&gt;
