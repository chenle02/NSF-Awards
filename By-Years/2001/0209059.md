This project will develop authorization mechanisms for secure information access
by a large community of users in an open environment. The research problem is to
formalize the trust that is associated with each user for granting privileges of
access to data warehouse and the World Wide Web. Evidence is used to prove
certain propertied of a user in order to build a trust model. Evidence is
formalized and a computational model for the reliability of evidence is
developed. This research combines the concepts of role-based access control,
user behaviors and profiles, mathematical theory of evidence, and data mining.
This research contributes to the design and develo0pment of a trust-enhanced
role mapping server, For adaptive authorization, this server cooperates with
existing role-based access control mechanisms. A series of experiments are
planned to study the performance issues of the trust model prototype. Efficient
and adaptive algorithms for role assignment will be developed as a result of
these experimental studies. This research will provide a framework for secure
authorization systems within applications in the semantic web, e-commerce,
airport security procedures, intelligence gathering and policymaking in
military, homeland security and database access in general.
