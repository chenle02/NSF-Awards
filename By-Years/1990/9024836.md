This renewal award is made in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program to the University of North Carolina in support of the research
of Dr. Maurice Brookhart. The focus of the research is on olefin polymerization,
oligomerization and dimerization using cationic, electrophilic late transition
metal catalysts. These reactions are of major commercial importance. Catalytic
polymerization, oligomerization and dimerization reactions of olefins and
functionalized olefins with cationic cobalt, rhodium, nickel and palladium
complexes will be studied. Fundamental mechanisms of these reactions will be
elucidated by spectroscopic studies of intermediates formed in the catalytic
reactions. Emphasis will be on determining the resting state of the catalyst and
the details of the key carbon-carbon bond forming steps. Characterization of the
resulting polymers and oligomers, particularly structure, molecular weight
distribution, extent of branching and placement of functional groups, will be
carried out.
