This project will allow the researcher, an anthropologist at the Museum of the
American Indian, to study the environmental adaptation of the Lubicon Lake Cree
of the forest in northern Alberta, Canada. The social organization of the group
will be analyzed as it relates to their reliance for subsistence on the moose,
the primary game animal in the area. Other groups in adjacent areas relied upon
Moose and other game as well as fish. These Indians are the last surviving
hunting bands in Canada and have continued a fairly traditional economy. The
study will examine scientific, government and missionary records pertaining to
the Cree and their use of game populations, the archives of the Hudson's Bay
company and other records of the fur trade in Winnipeg, and involve ethnographic
fieldwork on Cree hunting and social organization. This project is significant
because the researcher will obtain information on native subsistence for
relatively little cost due to his extensive previous experience with this group.
The Indians have developed economic strategies that allowed them to survive in
the fragile arctic environment for many years, and improved understanding of
these native practices can help more industrialized societies survive and
prosper in similar environments.
