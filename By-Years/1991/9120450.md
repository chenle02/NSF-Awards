Manatees are endangered species of the Order Sirenia and exhibit several
unusual traits in brain anatomy which appear to be related to their unique
lifestyle. Manatees have an annual death rate of approximately 150 individuals
from a total population of about 1500-2000. This fact, coupled with their slow
reproductive replacement rate, leads to the real possibility exists that we are
witnessing the last opportunity to study the biology of these unique mammals.
Each mammalian species represents an "experiment" by nature and every unusual
species helps define the range of possible evolutionary outcomes, increases our
understanding of evolutionary potential, and enables the reconstruction of the
evolutionary history of the brain. At present, we have some understanding of how
certain peculiar features of manatee brains may be correlated with their unique
ecological niche; for example, the small brain/body-weight ratio, smooth
cerebral hemispheres, and low cell densities in the cortex. The present research
will enable the identification of different cortical areas in the manatee based
on cellular staining patterns and will suggest functional roles for these
regions through comparisons with other mammalian species. Computer-generated
three- dimensional reconstructions of cerebral hemispheres and determination of
the volumes of the major brain divisions are also major objectives.
