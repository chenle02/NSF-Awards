This two-year award for US-Spain cooperative research in PDE-based image
processing involves research groups headed by Tony Chan at UCLA and Gene Golub
at Stanford University and by two Spanish researchers, Antonio Marquina and Pep
Mulet at the University of Valencia, Spain. The objective of the research is to
investigate the following problems: the design of computational techniques for
total variation (TV) image restoration, the use of spatial adaptivity to better
recover local details in TV image restoration, and combining the advantages of
nonlinear diffusion models and wavelet denoising models. The collaboration takes
advantage of the complementary expertise of the US and Spanish groups.
