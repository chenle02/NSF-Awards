They will measure soft x-ray emission spectra excited by light from the low
energy storage ring of the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven
National Laboratory. The measurements are made with a spectrometer facility
recently constructed with support from NSF, and the three institutions
participating in the research (Univ. of Tenn., National Bureau of Standards, and
the Oak Ridge National Laboratory). The spectrometer facility is unique in its
use of photon excitation, its wide energy range (100-1000 eV photons), high
resolution, and superior measuring efficiency. X-ray emission spectroscopy
permits the detailed study of the electronic states of elements, of individual
components of compounds and alloys, and of impurities, clusters and minor
contituents imbedded in solid systems. It is less surface sensitive than
electron spectroscopies, and when combined with photon excitation, is useful for
the study of fragile compounds that are damaged by electron excitation. Several
experiments are planned: studies of light metal alloys, Boron alloys and
compounds, high Tc superconducting alloys, semiconducting compounds, rare gas
solids, clusters imbedded in various solid matrices, and multilayer systems.
