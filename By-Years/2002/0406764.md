Groups at Iowa State University and the University of Maine will collaborate in
a coordinated program of research and research-based curriculum development in
thermal physics, targeting both introductory general physics courses and
advanced-level undergraduate courses. The research component involves one-on-one
student interviews, written pre- and post-test questions, and multiple-choice
surveys. This research is then applied to the development of curricular
materials intended to improve student understanding in a manner consistent with
active-learning methods previously shown be effective in physics instruction.
The curriculum will in turn be evaluated for its effectiveness at addressing the
student difficulties previously identified through research.

This project will provide insight into student learning of fundamental concepts
in thermal physics. Instructional materials will be designed specifically to
address student difficulties found in the research, and will utilize proven
pedagogical techniques to increase their effectiveness. The dissemination of
both the research results and of the curricular materials will improve
instruction in thermal physics nationally and internationally.
