Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research Mentoring for Junior Faculty in Human
Sciences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Richard Fabes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The need to
develop competitive grantsmanship skills is particularly evident among junior
faculty. Senior faculty from Arizona State University and Auburn University
propose to bring together outstanding junior faculty from departments of Human
Sciences to interact with, and learn from, senior faculty who have been
successful in obtaining research funding. The objective of the workshop is to
establish a mechanism whereby senior faculty provide guidance and mentoring to
these junior faculty in order to increase their abilities in obtaining research
support. Underrepresented young scholars in Human Science programs will be
specifically targeted for participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
