In this five-year project the investigators propose to study the currently most
important and exciting topics from a variety of fields within high-energy
theory. In the field of Standard Model physics, The PI's proposes to use lattice
simulations to find theoretical predictions for B and D meson physics
observables at a few percent levels, some of which will be measured soon with
comparable accuracy at CLEO-c. They plan to use the recently developed soft-
collinear effective theory and QCD factorization to study processes of great
importance in heavy-flavor phenomenology. Ultimately, both of these studies
should lead us to a more precise determination of the fundamental mixing
parameters in the quark sector. In the area of physics beyond the Standard
Model, they propose to study theories with extra dimensions, with particular
emphasis on applications to possible new mechanisms for electroweak symmetry
breaking, perhaps the most pressing issue in particle physics today. They also
plan to study the flavor aspects of various new models of electroweak symmetry
breaking. The PIs plan to study topics on the interface of particle physics and
cosmology. In particular, they will study the consequences of brane inflation
both from string theory and an effective theory point of view. On the more
formal side, there is also proposed a study of low-dimensional quantum field
theories, in particular limit cycle properties of the renormalization group.
