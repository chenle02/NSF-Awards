This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the
development of a technology for advanced geophysical density measurements and
the monitoring of fluid fronts in soils based on the passive detection of
naturally occurring cosmic rays. The primary application area for this project
is the mining sector, where the technology may be able to drive efficiency
improvements (up to 10%) in the recovery of copper and other key metals. These
efficiencies could potentially result in a value opportunity of close to $1
billion per year in the US alone. The technology can also be applied to
monitoring the stability of dams and levees, a widely-recognized ongoing
concern, where it can provide safety and environmental benefits to the industry
and society at large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this
project is primarily related to both the continued development of field-ready
instrumentation and of original data inversion methodologies. This includes: i)
validation of the prototype sensor developed in Phase I under control
conditions; ii) development and testing of fit-for-purpose conveyance and other
hardware required for remote operation; iii) development of an original, three-
dimensional data reconstruction algorithm driven by customer needs; and iv)
development of commercially ready answer products and user interfaces. These
innovations will serve to demonstrate the feasibility, technology readiness, and
value of the proposed solution to the mining industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
