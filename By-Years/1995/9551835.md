The college is purchasing a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FT-IR) for
the improvement of undergraduate chemistry laboratories. The instrument is used
at all levels of instruction including Introduction to Chemistry, as well as
General, Organic, Analytical, and Physical Chemistry. In addition the FT-IR is
available for use in the college's outreach program, which involves 1-day visits
by high school chemistry classes to use laboratory facilities. In comparison
with the older, dispersive technology, the FT-IR rapid-scanning ability and
reduced sample preparation minimizes student waiting time, making possible more
extensive experimentation during a laboratory period. This is especially
important for the larger lab sections with 15-20 students. In intermediate-level
courses, students learn to use the unique computer-enhanced capabilities of the
instrument, including displaying, zooming, scaling, transforming, assigning,
storing, and printing data. Essential parameters of FT-IR being examined in
these courses include signal averaging, repetitive scanning, resolution
comparisons, standards collections, and search-match comparisons with a spectral
database. The enhanced wavelength range and resolution of allows students to
study chemical mixtures. The upper-level Physical Chemistry course uses the
instrument to obtain molecular parameters, such as bond strength from
vibrational spectra of simple molecules.
