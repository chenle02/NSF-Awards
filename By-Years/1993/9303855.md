This project explores the properties of matter at low temperatures. Advantage
is taken of the well-established properties of He-4 at low temperatures to
illuminate a number of problems in condensed maatter physics. One sub-project
addresses the influence of controlled defects on the critical phenomena of a
pure system. The introduction of a low density structural impurity into liquid
helium can produce a striking alteration in the critical pehnomena. An
understanding of this problem will enhance our understanding of the role of
defects for a wider range of phase transitions. A second area is the study of
boson localization in He-4 films adsorbed on a heterogeneous substrate. The
study of the physics of a boson system, such a a helium film in the random
potential of aheterogeneous substrate, offers an interesting complement to
studies of the metal-insulator transition and the superconductor- insulator
transition in dirty superconductors. A third topic will be the study of a
dissipative flow of superfluid helium through a porous medium. This is a boson
analog to the technologically important problem of the vortex liquid and flux-
flow regimes of high Tc superconductors. %%% This project explores the
properties of matter at very low temperatures--below minus 450 degrees
Fahrenheit. The project deals with a superfluid, helium, which exhibits behavior
which, by analogy, can be related to phenomena in other materials, particularly
high Tc superconductors. In addition, the research deals with phase transitions
and provides fundamental information bearing on solid-liquid melting (and other
transformations) that occurs in all materials.
