The proposal for supporting the construction of a RICH (Ring Imaging Cherenkov)
detector for the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer as a cosmic ray detector on the
Space Station. The proposed work include: construction and test of the RICH
detector, participation in the Data Acquisition System of the RICH detector,
computer simulation of the RICH detector for optimization and analysis.
