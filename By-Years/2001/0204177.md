ABSTRACT DMS - 0204177. PI: Peter Petersen

The PI proposes to investigate manifolds with integral curvature bounds as
opposed to the usual pointwise curvature bounds. Many traditional results carry
over, but people do not have a complete picture of what can go wrong with the
weaker curvature assumptions. The second and main part of the proposal addresses
the specific but very hard question of which 3-sphere bundles over the 4-sphere
have positive curvature. Only one of these spaces, namely the 7-sphere, is know
to have positive curvature. We expect that several exotic spheres of this type
have positive curvature and also that we will get some interesting infinite
families of manifolds in dimensions 6 and 7 out of this project.

The PI is proposing to work on two separate projects. The first deals with
gleaning information from objects where one has fuzzy rather than specific
assumptions about how they curve. The PI has already established some
interesting results in this direction, but much is still unknown. The second and
more ambitious part is an investigation of how round one can make twisted
objects. Here one imagines a sphere as perfectly round and untwisted. There are
no intuitive examples in the dimensions that can be visualized, but in dimension
7 there apear to be several objects which are not spheres but still could be
fairly round. A positive solution to this problem would solve one very prominent
problem and two lesser known problems.
