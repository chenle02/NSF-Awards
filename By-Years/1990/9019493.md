The application of magnetotellurics (MIT) will be used for the exploration and
interpretation of oceanic basement. By using new analytical methods, MI data
from 13 different areas will be interpreted and synthesized in terms of the
nature of the oceanic basement within a single tectonic element, i.e. the
Pacific Ocean.
