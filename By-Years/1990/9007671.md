Gracillariids are a family of minute colorful moths comprising more than 1500
species world.wide. In their early developmental stages they live as "leaf
miners" on woody plants, and they constitute an economic pest in some areas.
Unlike most animals, the early stages of gracillariid development are more
diversified and structurally complex (especially for sap.feeding forms) than the
later stages, which converge on the generalized morphology of a moth. Dr. David
Wagner proposes a taxonomic revision of the North American species of the
family. Geographic ranges, life histories, host associations, and morphological
data from reared specimens will be synthesized. These data will also be used to
reconstruct the evolutionary relationships among North American species. The
proposed research has implications beyond gracillariid specialists. The proposed
revision will facilitate ecological research and will help attempts to control
this economically important pest. The resulting genealogical framework will
allow future studies to explore the evolution of different life histories and
developmental pathways. This group and this research project will attract the
attention of developmental biologists, ecologists, systematists, functional
morphologists, and evolutionary biologists in general.
