9618029 Heid Pennsylvania State University is developing, field testing, and
revising a modular secondary school mathematics curriculum for use by students
who have regular access to: calculator or computer technology that includes a
linked computer algebra system (CAS) and dynamic geometry tool; calculator-based
data-gathering tools; and electronic data bases. The materials are developed in
strands of content that are expected to consume six-to-nine weeks of class time;
the strands could be put together sequentially to form a year-long course and
several strands would be developed as stand-alone units usable in conjunction
with some of the emerging NSF-funded, comprehensive curricula. Considerable
attention is paid to preparing the pilot- and field-test teachers to handle the
material and these experiences are used to develop materials to help other
teachers use the instructional materials. A comprehensive study is being made
that will include an evaluation of the instructional materials and research into
the level of students' understanding of the mathematics topics studied.
