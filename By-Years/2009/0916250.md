This protein threading project at University of Georgia develops high throughput
computer programs for accurate protein tertiary structure prediction based on a
new conformational graph modeling of protein amino acid tertiary interactions.
The modeling approach enables the following three novel, effective components
together to achieve the project goal: (1) a very efficient sequence-structure
alignment method that can incorporate sophisticated energy functions to improve
fold recognition accuracy, (2) a simultaneous backbone prediction and side chain
packing method to improve threading alignment accuracy, and (3) a semi-threading
method to improve the accuracy of new structure prediction. This project also
enriches the interdisciplinary education programs at University of Georgia,
allowing computer science students to implement protein threading programs and
visualization tools, and bioinformatics and biology students to develop
threading methods, test data, and evaluate and disseminate results.
