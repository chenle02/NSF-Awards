Dr. Champion will use resonance Raman and Rayleigh scattering techniques to
probe the electronic and nuclear structure/function relationships of biological
molecules such as the heme and iron sulfur proteins. He hopes to achieve a
better understanding of the resonant light scattering properties of these
molecules and to apply this knowledge to the elucidation of their mechanism of
action. Related techniques, such as electronic absorption spectroscopy, will
also be used and theoretical relationships that link a variety of experimental
measurements will be developed. This work is significant not only in its
relationship to biological science but also in its connection to the
understanding of basic light-matter interactions.
