The first three enzymes of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis are the same from
bacteria to humans. Yet the structure, organization, and regulation of the
enzymes and their respective genes have changed considerably. In mammals the
enzymes, carbamyl phosphate synthetase II, aspartate transcarbamylase, and
dihyroorotase, are found together in a single translation product called CAD.
Most studies have been limited to biochemical analysis of purified protein or
proteolytic fragments derived from it. However, we have developed a strategy for
expressing individual enzymatic domains of hamster CAD in E. coli. This now
allows us to introduce genetic changes into the DNA sequence and observe the
effects on enzyme structure and function. For this work we will exploit this
strategy for analyzing each enzyme of the CAD protein and for comparing the CAD
domains to their monofunctional counterparts in bacteria. Through a series of
experiments involving molecular biological, genetic, and biochemical methods, we
hope to learn much about the structure, function, and evolution of a
multifunctional protein that plays a key role in an important biosynthetic
pathway.
