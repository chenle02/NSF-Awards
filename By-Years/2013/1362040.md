The I/UCRC for Novel High-Voltage/Temperature Materials and Structures plans to
work jointly with electric utility, aerospace, nuclear, military, environmental,
automotive, health, and other industries with needs of novel HV/T materials and
structures. The objectives of the Center are: (1) Design of novel and evaluation
of existing HV/T energy transmission/transfer multifunctional materials for next
generation composite conductors, insulators, underground cables, towers, and
other electric power transmission structures; (2) Design and development of
novel advanced high energy transfer materials for aerospace, oil/gas,
automotive, and other industrial applications; (3) Failure prediction and
prevention of HV/T materials and structures under in-service conditions through
state-of-the-art multi-scale modeling and material performance evaluations; (4)
Development of new failure monitoring techniques and material repair methods in
HV/T materials under laboratory conditions and their subsequent transfer to in-
service inspection and repair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed I/UCRC will
seek to create a diverse and interdisciplinary educational, research and
business environment for (1) undergraduate and graduate students, including
those from underrepresented groups, funded by the research projects of the
Center; (2) faculty members from a variety of disciplines, including junior
faculty starting their academic careers; (3) utility, aerospace and national lab
engineers and designers developing various types of HV/T materials and
structures; and (4) utility managers supervising HV transmission lines across
the country. The Center intends to enhance the reputation of the U.S. HV/T
manufacturing around the world and, in particular, improve the level of
confidence among the potential users of novel HV/T structures. The center
targets long-term benefit to infrastructure, manufacturing, energy transport and
efficiency of the electric grid, and the durability of other HV/T and high
energy transfer structures.&lt;br/&gt;
