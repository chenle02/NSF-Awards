This project is providing (a) scholarships to low-income, academically talented
students in a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)
discipline and (b) a robust student support system to ensure success. The
program builds on the successful strategies and components of a prior Computer
Science, Engineering, and Mathematics (CSEMS) supported program.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: STEM scholarships allow students to
reduce time devoted to employment and increase time available for studying. This
translates into improved academic success and increased student retention, and
transfer of a greater number of students to four-year institutions. Integrating
scholarship recipients into the academic and professional development activities
of the District's Mathematics, Engineering, and Science Achievement (MESA)
programs provides opportunities for mentoring by faculty and academic
counselors, as well as working professionals in the scientific and engineering
disciplines. It also exposes scholarship recipients to opportunities to engage
in mentored research and intern programs locally throughout the year and
nationally during summers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The state has
a high concentration of science and engineering jobs, and this project is
providing students with skills to help fill those jobs. Financial support and
professional development allow scholarship recipients to join the workforce in a
timely manner as fully prepared scientists and engineers who can directly
contribute to the American and global society. In addition, this project
supports a large number of first-generation students and students from
underrepresented groups in STEM fields and thus helps to increase the diversity
of the workforce.
