9721455 Alyssa Goodman Dr. Alyssa Goodman will carry out a project that will
offer quantitative new measures of how the material between the stars, known as
the interstellar medium, is distributed. She will develop new quantitative
methods for analyzing both numerical simulations and observed data sets, and to
use these methods to bridge the gap in our understanding of the relationship
between numerical simulations and the interstellar medium. Upon completion, the
project should provide the astronomical community with an optimized set of
physically-motivated statistical diagnostics that best capture the properties of
a three-dimensional map of interstellar material, either simulated or observed.
Such statistical diagnostics will become invaluable probes of the physical
properties of star forming regions, supernova remnants, large galactic clouds,
and diffuse clouds in our Galaxy. ***
