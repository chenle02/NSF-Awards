The PIs propose to increase the utility of a variety of existing radar systems
through the design and construction of a flexible, high-performance radar
processor. On the basis of recent tests at Arecibo Observatory, Puerto Rico,
major improvements in the resolution and accuracy of the incoherent scatter
observations were achieved through the implementation of computationally
intensive radar techniques. Other radar systems can be used to monitor the
geospace environment and man-made modifications to the upper atmosphere. This
project is aimed at expanding the scope of research performed at several
national observatories and greatly increase the amount of information that can
be extracted from existing atmospheric radars.
