9629415 Bridgham The goal of this research is to understand the important
factors that structure peatlands in space and time. Major attributes of interest
are plant community composition, net primary production, accumulation of carbon
in soil organic matter, and trace gas emissions. It is hypothesized that four
major environmental gradients (climate, pH/alkalinity, water-table height, and
limiting nutrients) are the primary factors structuring peatland ecosystems.
Previous research has focused upon climate change impacts on peatlands and the
potential enhancement of trace gas emissions under future climatic regimes. An
additional parallel research program will be conducted that focuses on the
relative roles of nutrients and alkalinity as major factors influencing
peatlands. Innovative educational activities will be integrated with an active
research program to provide students with first-hand experience in the theory
and practice of ecology.
