The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to preserve the integrity of communication
channels for business enterprises, financial institutions, and consumers.
Attackers operate like businesses by investing in campaigns and generate returns
by using stolen credentials to gain network access, inject ransomware, or commit
direct fraud. The innovation aims to prevent $4 B a year in financial scams
through robust and enduring countermeasures. 90% of large enterprise customer
breaches start from email or p2p/SMS messages that trick customers and employees
into revealing sensitive information. An average phishing attack spans 21 hours
between the first and last victim and the detection of each attack occurs an
average 9 hours after the first victim. This gives attackers a window of
opportunity during which most of the damage is done. This project seeks to
identify and protect against such attacks through a real-time machine learning
system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase II project develops a method for
storing data in a blockchain in a high-performing manner, to ensure quality
training of ML/AI models, and production level inference. The innovation
addresses the challenge of data drift and adversarial AI attacks where the
provenance of the data is unknown. The Phase II project also leverages swarm
intelligence as a new consensus mechanism specifically designed for more
democratic online group-to-group collaboration in a distributed system. The
project's innovations will expand the understanding of telecommunications, the
economics of smishing and vishing, and 5G security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
