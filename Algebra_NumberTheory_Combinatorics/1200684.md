This proposal is motivated by the theory of automorphic forms and L-functions.
The emphasis is on the interplay between harmonic analysis and ergodic theory.
The primary focus is the analysis of Whittaker periods. Whittaker periods of
automorphic forms occur very frequently in many problems. Our goal is to have a
complete theory and to prove sharp results. The proposal contains three closely
related projects. A project motivated by the geometry of number concerns the
uniform distribution of the skewness of integral flags in euclidean space. A
related analytic problem is to estimate global Whittaker periods. We shall
improve significantly previous results in the literature using global methods
from ergodic theory. The third problem concerns local Whittaker functions. We
want to establish the conjectural asymptotic behavior of Whittaker functions at
infinity. There are several outcomes of proving this conjecture as well as
applications to automorphic forms. The PI will apply methods from geometry and
representation theory.

Number theory is among the oldest branches in mathematics and basic arithmetic
is taught in elementary school. Applications to technology are prevalent:
communication systems, data processing, cryptographic algorithms. L-functions
capture fundamental information about prime numbers which appear everywhere. The
Langlands program is a vast network of conjectures and results motivated by the
interplay between representation theory and number theory. The proposed research
will provide a new bridge between the Langlands program and several topics in
analysis and representation theory. This will deepen our understanding and
knowledge through identifying profound analogies and stimulate collaboration
between experts in different fields. Because of its history the interface
between analysis and number theory has plenty of longstanding problems; the
analysis of periods and L-functions is a central theme and driving force. The
proposed research provides theoretical results which can be used as prospective
tools in many different problems: numerical investigations by different teams,
vanishing of special values and arithmetic cycles, moments, period bounds and
subconvexity problems. The PI will continue to teach and mentor students
research projects: junior papers, senior and PhD thesis, disseminating knowledge
and discoveries while promoting learning through the investigation of open
problems.
