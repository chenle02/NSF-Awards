This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
demonstrate the&lt;br/&gt;feasibility of an innovative approach to fabricating
microfluidic devices for bioassays&lt;br/&gt;within a Micro Total Analytical
System (`TAS) format. The device will be based on&lt;br/&gt;electrowetting on
dielectric (EWOD) technology, and will offer potential lower
fabrication&lt;br/&gt;costs for numerous applications. The EWOD approach for
microfluidics is to transport&lt;br/&gt;droplets, as opposed to continuous
liquids, along an electronically programmable path on a&lt;br/&gt;large array of
driving micropads, rather than through fixed microchannels. The
EWOD&lt;br/&gt;mechanism is inherently effective for droplets, and appears well
suited for open two&lt;br/&gt;dimensional microfluidic array applications, and
use with physiological fluids. An EWOD&lt;br/&gt;microfluidic device will be
capable of manipulating droplets of physiological fluids.&lt;br/&gt;Feasibility
will be demonstrated by implementing a heterogeneous
chemiluminescent&lt;br/&gt;immunoassay for ferritin in blood serum on an EWOD
device. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main commercial application of this project
will be in the area of medical diagnostics. &lt;br/&gt;Additional applications
would include bioassays for homeland security and
environmental&lt;br/&gt;monitoring and for sampling systems to support DNA and
protein microarray assays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
