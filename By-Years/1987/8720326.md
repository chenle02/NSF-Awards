The study will involve diamond-anvil experiments coupled with laser heating,
spectrographic, and synchrotron x-ray diffraction techniques to determine phase
equilibrium in the mantle and core of the earth. Combination of high-pressure
and synchrotron techniques provides the opportunity to improve current earth
models significantly by providing experimental data on mineralogical and
geochemical relations of the entire mantle-core system. It is proposed to build
on current experimental results obtained at conditions equivalent to those of
the transition zone to study in situ reversible phase relations. The second part
of the study is to examine concepts of major element partitioning over the
extensive pressure-temperature range of the lower mantle. The third part of the
study will be an experimental examination of the core mantle boundary by
determining the equilibrium (or the lack of equilibrium) between silicate-oxide-
metal assemblages. The fourth part of the study will be a determination of the
phase equilibria of core compositions.
