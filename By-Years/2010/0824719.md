Abstract for ?Nanoscale Mechanics of Bulk Amorphous Metals? P. M. Voyles and D.
S. Stone

The goal of this project is to understand structure-property relationships in
bulk amorphous metals. Broadband nanoindentation creep will be used to measure
plastic deformation of selected alloys under constrained conditions which
suppress failure at low strain. The activation volume and activation energy of
plastic deformation will be derived from creep data covering 5-6 orders of
magnitude in strain rate. Fluctuation microscopy, which is based on spatial
fluctuations in electron nanodiffraction, will be used to measure the nanometer-
scale structure in the same alloys. Comparing the creep data and structure data
should reveal how structure controls deformation, perhaps through controlling
the size, critical strain, and density of shear transformation zones.

Bulk amorphous metals are a new class of metal alloys. Their exceptional
properties, such as hardness greater than conventional steels, but at lower
density, high tensile strength, high yield strength, high elastic limit, and
excellent corrosion resistance, point to exciting applications as structural
materials or in biomedical implants and tools. Those applications will benefit
if plastic deformation can be understood and eventually controlled at atomic and
nanometer length scales, which is one of the long-term goals of this project.
This project will also promote engineering education by involving undergraduates
from groups historically underrepresented in engineering in forefront
engineering research, and by disseminating methods and examples in forefront
electron microscopy characterization of materials via a publicly accessible web
database.
