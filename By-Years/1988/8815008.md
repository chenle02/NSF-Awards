Although the topic has been a principal focus of meteorological studies for
decades, cyclogenesis, both in the tropics and extratropics, is far from being
well understood. Further, the exact conditions that determine whether cyclones
become intense storms or, in the tropics, hurricanes are not known. Under this
award, the principal investigator, Dr. Emanuel, will investigate cyclogenesis
from a number of aspects, employing both observational and theoretical methods.
His participation in the field phase of ERICA (Experiment on Rapidly
Intensifying Cyclones in the Atlantic) will allow him to test his hypothesis
that extratropical storm intensification is due to wind-dependent flux of
sensible and/or latent heat from the ocean surface. He also will explore the
dynamics of continental cyclones by analyzing the roles of potential vorticity
and surface temperature. On the topic of tropical cyclogenesis, Dr. Emanuel will
continue his research to identify a threshold which governs hurricane
intensification as well as develop a new diagnostic model based on angular
momentum coordinates for simulating hurricanes. This research is very likely to
substantially advance our understanding of cyclones and, ultimately, to improve
their prediction. Dr. Emanuel is one of the best young scientists in the field
and well known for his innovative approaches to research.
