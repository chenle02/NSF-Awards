The Friday Harbor Laboratories (FHL) of the University of Washington is a
marine station focussed upon research in zoology, oceanography, botany and
fisheries. It is located in the San Juan Islands where an unusual diversity and
richness of marine life occurs. Research projects conducted at FHL have helped
to reveal the important ecological relationships which underlie the health and
stability of the marine environment; have determined the effects of physical,
biological and environmental factors on eggs, larvae and juveniles of the many
invertebrate and plant species which reside at the base of the marine food web;
and have led to the development and use model organisms for the study of
embryos, functional morphology and physiology. This project will fill a major
gap at FHL. The marine environment is richly endowed with planktonic fishes.
This is especially true in the Pacific Northwest region. However, surprisingly
little is known about the identity and role of most fish larvae in the plankton.
Furthermore, a great deal is yet to be learned about the physiology and
mechanics of adult fish, especially non-commercial species. The project will
provide funds to construct and equip a laboratory to allow work in these areas.
