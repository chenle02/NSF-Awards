Abstract: The goal of the project is to advance knowledge in some well-known
areas of complex analysis, including the problems of conformal welding,
diffusion limited aggregation, and the ergodic theory of harmonic measure on
Julia sets.

Conformal mappings and harmonic measure are major and classical tools in the
study of two-dimensional objects. They have been used in science and engineering
for many years. Recently, there has been considerable interest in the extension
of the classical theory to some classes of sets which have complicated
("fractal", "chaotic") structure and typically arise in dynamical systems or as
random objects. Some of the most interesting examples include so-called
"Laplacian clusters," certain random aggregates whose rate of growth depends on
harmonic measure. Laplacian clusters serve as mathematical models for a large
number of natural phenomena such as the process of diffusion limited
aggregation, which has surfaced recently as a model for the formation of
crystals, viscous fingering, and dielectric breakdown. Laplacian clusters have
been extensively studied in the physical literature. The project will explore
this topic, along with some other basic open problems concerning the general
theory of conformal mappings and harmonic measure, as well as applications to
dynamical and random fractals.
