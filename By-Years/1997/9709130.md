ABSTRACT OPP-9709130 SWIFT, JAMES UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA - SAN DIEGO This
project will utilize a Canadian Coast Guard icebreaker to conduct an
oceanographic transect from the Alaskan coastline to a position in the Beaufort
Sea (Canada Basin) where a large, multidisciplinary research program, Surface
Heat Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) Ocean, will be conducted. The goal of the
transect will be to examine the origin and large-scale circulation of the water
in the Canada Basin. Significant changes in the circulation and origin of waters
in the Canada Basin have been observed and this project will determine the
present conditions for comparison to the prior observations. The changes
observed over the past several years could be a harbinger of global-scale
climate changes that are driving fundamental circulation changes or, simply, the
interannual fluctuation of currents that is independent of long-term climate
change. This project will add an important component to the understanding of
global change on circulation in the Arctic Ocean.
