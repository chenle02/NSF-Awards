In response to increased competition from producers throughout the world and to
more volatile patterns of consumer demand, industrial firms in the U.S. and
elsewhere have developed new forms of "flexible production" that allow them to
quickly adjust to changes in demand. The abilities of U.S. firms to maintain a
competitive position in an increasingly interdependent global economy will
depend to a great extent on how well they pioneer and adopt new, more efficient
forms of production. These new forms of production have dramatic impacts on the
location of production, which in turn affects social, economic, and demographic
development in regions where industrial operations are established, grow, or
decline. Social and management scientists have examined the general character of
the new forms of flexible industrial production, but the locational
ramifications of these changes have been examined only in isolated case studies
focusing on single regions. This project will build on work already undertaken
in Mexico and Europe to compare how different forms of flexible production have
been adopted and have altered the geography of production for automobile
companies in the U.S., England, Italy, and Yugoslavia. Data on economic
conditions, policies, and company operations will be gathered and analyzed, and
lengthy interviews with high-ranking executives of about a dozen automobile
manufacturers will provide the basis for a controlled assessment of how
different companies have responded to different socio-economic and market
conditions. The results of this project are expected to be presented in a book
that will compare flexible production and its geographic impacts in at least
seven nations. This project will generate better understandings of how
automobile companies and other manufacturers have adapted to changes in markets
and other economic forces and of how different forms of flexible production
affect patterns of development and economic activity. To the extent that the
success of other forms of operation can be gauged within the context of broader
socio-economic and market settings, the information gathered in this report
should facilitate more effective decision making corporate executives and
publicly accountable decision makers. This carefully constructed comparative
analysis also will provide a basis for testing some of the new theories about
industrial operations, economic development, and urban location that have been
formulated recently by scholars in geography and related disciplines.
