We propose to investigate the waveforms, amplitudes, and traveltimes of body
waves from earthquakes and explosions to examine the detailed velocity structure
of subducting slabs in the depth range 0 to 1500. Creager and Jordon (1986)
propose that penetration of subducting slabs under the Kurile Islands and other
subduction zones to depths of at least 1000 km is necessary to explain travel
time anomalies of deep earthquakes. Such penetration would also affect the
amplitudes and waveforms of the body waves from earthquakes. Methods we have
recently developed allow the calculation of the waveform and amplitude effects
of high-velocity, subducting slabs. A preliminary review of available data show
that we can test and refine seismic models of slabs with these new methods. We
propose, as well, to refine models of slabs in the upper mantle, which
empirically cause even greater waveform, amplitude and timing anomalies than the
deep slabs. Our method may also help to locate where the earthquakes occur
relative to the high-velocity slab (e.g., toward the top or in the middle).
Reconciliation of the amplitude, waveform distortion, and timing of body waves
from deep events is necessary to understand the geometry of slabs near and below
the 650 km discontinuity.
