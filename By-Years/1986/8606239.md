This research is aimed at detecting wear and breakage of cutting tools through
the monitoring of cutting forces, even when the cutting variables (speed, feed,
depth-of-cut) vary and the workpiece hardness changes during machining. A
mathematical model of the machining process will be developed and stored in the
control computer of the machine tool which will separate the wear and gbreakage
effect on cutting forces from those of the other parameters, thus enabling the
on-line detection of tool wear and breakage. The model will updated online as
the machining progresses.
