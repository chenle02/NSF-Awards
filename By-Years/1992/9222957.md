Verification and logic simulation systems shall be developed within this
undertaking and dedicated to projects involving VLSI design-for test. Individual
projects include: * Diagnostic chip for IEEE Standard 1149.1 boundary-scan
boards. * Self-test using MISR and parallel shift register sequence generator. *
Burst-error correcting and self-repair ROM. * Test by approximation of Boolean
function system.
