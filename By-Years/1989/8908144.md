The project to be performed examines neural mechanisms responsible for
processing information coming from the skin and transforming that cutaneous
information into an adaptive motor response. Dr. Paul Stein studies the scratch
reflex, a complex behavior produced by the spinal cord. He has developed a
spinal cord preparation that, in the absence of movement-related sensory
feedback, selects which of the three distinct motor output patterns is an
appropriate response to a tactile stimulus and generates that motor output
pattern. The process of selection implies that a decision is made. Therefore,
neural mechanisms for making motor decisions are intrinsic to the spinal cord.
The goal of this project is to reveal these mechanisms.
