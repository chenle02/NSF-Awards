Project Abstract Economists commonly use game theory to model strategic
interactions between buyers and sellers, firms and unions, presidents and
parliaments, competing firms, and competing countries. However, little
connection has been made between the increasingly sophisticated and contending
theories of such games and actual behavior in these situations, limiting the
applicability of game theory. Recent advances in experimental methods have made
available new possibilities for testing theoretical models. The proposed
research will bridge the gap between theoretical games and behavioral
applications. Models of games will be developed that are more firmly grounded in
theories of individual behavior. The models will then be used to derive testable
implications. These in turn will provide the foundations for an experimental
investigation of the models and the applications to specific economic questions.
