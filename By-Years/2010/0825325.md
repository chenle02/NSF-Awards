This award will provide funds to acquire a new stable isotope ratio mass
spectrometer (IRMS), and two peripheral systems - an elemental analyzers for
continuous flow applications of 15N/14N and 13C/12C isotopes and a high
temperature pyrolysis system (TCEA) for analysis of D/H and 18O/16O analyses of
organics - for the University of Southern California stable isotope facility.
The new instrumentation will augment the labs analytical capabilities and
improve overall analytical efficiency and minimize downtime. Eleven regular
faculty and their students use the USC facility and, because it is an open-use
laboratory, it is also serves to an educational facility. Students are trained
to operate and maintain the instruments as well as being instructed in how to
prepare samples for mass spectrometry. The laboratory employs several
undergraduate work study students each year, and a number of these students have
gone on to careers in environmental studies as a result of their experiences in
the laboratory.
