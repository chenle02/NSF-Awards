This is a project by Dr. Fuchs to study the biophysical mechanisms by which
brainstem neurons exert inhibition of the sensory receptor cells of the cochlea.
The sensitivity of the inner ear is controlled by central neurons whose axons
project to the cochlea and there release the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine
(ACh) to inhibit the cochlear cell (hair cells). While the actions of ACh are
well-known on nerve and muscle, the hair cell cholinergic receptor and its
physiological effect, are quite unusual. ACh inhibits hair cells first causing
calcium entry, followed by a calcium-activated potassium current which actually
hyperpolarizes, and inhibits, the cell. These actions are mediated by a
neurotransmitter receptor that appears to be related to the nicotinic receptors
of nerve and muscle. While unusual, there is some evidence that similar
cholinergic effects may occur elsewhere in the brain. Dr. Fuchs will identify
and study the mechanism of cholinergic inhibition of cochlear hair cells and its
developmental regulation. He will use state-of-the-art techniques to explore
these mechanisms and the hair cell ACh receptor will be characterized both
pharmacologically and physiologically. This detailed study of the hair cell ACh
receptor will provide fundamental insights into brain cholinergic systems.***//
