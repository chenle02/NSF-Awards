Approximately one year after suspending services in Austin following the defeat
of Proposition 1, Uber and Lyft relaunched ridesharing services in Austin on May
29, 2017. Services resumed in response to Texas House bill 100, which created a
statewide regulatory framework for transportation network companies that
superseded local ordinances. In response to this development, this Grants for
Rapid Response Research (RAPID) collaborative research project will analyze
changes to travel behavior after a service disruption has ended. The project
represents a unique natural experiment to measure the impact of these services
on city infrastructure and the economy. The motivating research question is,
"How does the restoration of ride-sourcing services impact travel behavior
particularly with regards to number of trips, mode choice and vehicle ownership"
A comparative case is provided by the collapse and subsequent reconstruction of
the I-35W Bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in which a 25 percent reduction in
usage was seen following opening of a replacement bridge.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will design and implement a travel survey of
ride-sourcing passengers in order to quantify the impact on travel behavior as a
result of Uber and Lyft restoring ridesharing services in Austin, TX. The survey
will utilize a non-random, opt-in sampling methodology, to be administered over
an approximate two-month period. The survey data will not be weighted or
expanded, as the full universe of former ridesharing passengers is not known.
Expected research results have the potential to capture adaptations by
passengers and organizations in response to service restoration. The results are
also expected to inform ongoing discussions on the impact of similar events on
mobility in other cities. Methods for data coding as well as the data themselves
will be made available to support subsequent research.
