The objective of this conference is to explore the role of biotechnology in
minerals and fossil-fuels processing, and to determine the direction of future
research in mineral bioprocessing. It is planned to have seven different
technical sessions covering all the major and targeted areas. Anticipated
participants will be from academia, government, and industry. At the end of the
conference, proceedings covering all the technical presentations, panel
discussions, and future research directions in minerals and fossil-fuels
bioprocessing will be published.
