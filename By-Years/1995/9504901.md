CTS-9504901 Gavalas Cal Tech The fundamentals of in-situ formation of zeolite
films on porous substrates will be studied in order to synthesize membranes of
high permeance and selectivity. Films of ZSM-5 and zeolite A will be grown on
porous alumina plates or tubes placed in clear solutions of suitable
compositions maintained at appropriate temperature and autogeneous pressure.
Control of crystal size, film quality and thickness will be achieved by varying
the pore size of the substrate and synthesis conditions. Characterization and
permeation experimelts will be performed to evaluate the performance of the
membrane in important gas separations. The research may lead to the development
of improved zeolite membranes with potential applications in separations,
catalysis and reaction engineering.
