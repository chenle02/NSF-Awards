9553176 Saha This Presidential Faculty Fellow award is to a young
neurobiologist. Her research is on basic issues concerning the mechanism by
which the brain develops from a simple sheet of cells into a highly complex
structure. The role of several genes in mediating tissue interactions are
studied, using the frog Xenopus as a model system, with the major focus on
reciprocal interactions between the nerve tissue and the blood vascular system
during early embryonic development. Her teaching includes neurobiology courses
and courses to non-majors on the history of biology, an active outreach program
to elementary and middle schools, and summer courses to high school teachers and
gifted high school teachers. The impact of both the research and education will
be high and extend beyond neurobiology to science education in general.
