This research uses genetic variation to trace the origins of the peoples
residing in the Pacific Islands that spread southeast from New Guinea into near
and remote Oceania. By using high-resolution data from the human mitochondrial
DNA genome, the natives of these Islands and of New Guinea will be compared and
contrasted with the surrounding populations in Polynesia, Micronesia, Indonesia,
Southeast and Southwest Asia. Through these comparisons, links between the
peoples of these regions can be established and the origins of each population
can be ascertained. This research is particularly aimed at investigating the
links between language and genetic variation. While language and DNA are not
physically linked together, they do reside in the same individual, and language
undoubtedly plays some role in mate acquisition. Therefore, the researchers will
investigate whether languages that are grouped together into higher order
language families (e.g. Austronesian and Papuan) coincide with genetic groupings
of individuals in the Pacific and the surrounding areas. This approach can be
extended to any part of the planet, and to other behaviors besides language, and
indeed to other species.

This study makes use of previously collected samples, collected by the
investigator and collaborators, and greatly increases the level of genetic
resolution through collection of significantly longer DNA sequences. The
research brings together linguistic, cultural, geographic, biological and
genetic data to construct a picture of the initial and subsequent peoplings of
Melanesia, and to determine the origins of these diverse populations. This work
also brings together a team of a dozen experts on the Pacific to analyze the
results and construct the population genetic models. Undergraduate and graduate
students will be directly involved in the data collection and analysis of the
data, continuing a long tradition in the Merriwether lab of involving
undergraduates directly in molecular anthropological research.
