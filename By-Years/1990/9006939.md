This Grant for Exploratory Research is in the general area of analytical and
surface chemistry and in the subfield of mass spectrometry. Professor Peter
Williams of Arizona State University will study the production of molecular ion
species from laser volatilization of frozen aqueous matrices of DNA. The goal is
to minimize the fragmentation of the DNA and preserve the molecular weight
distribution of the biological molecule. The development of a suitable means to
use mass spectrometry to sequence biological molecules will result. Via the use
of a novel energy deposition mechanism, both the absorptivity and the phase
transformation thermodynamics of the matrix are used to preserve structure. The
construction of a high resolution flight tube for time of flight mass
spectrometry will allow immediate understanding of the role of laser energy
deposition parameters on the minimization of fragmentation.
