9601873 Greene We propose to purchase a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur Flow
Cytometer. This system will include two laser, four- color capability, and a
sorting system. Also included is a computer, data analysis software, and a data
storage system. Flow cytometry is now an essential technology for modern
oceanographic studies. Flow cytometry is the best method for rapid analysis of
the picoplankton, organisms less than 2 p.m in size, which are the dominant
autotrophic and heterotrophic plankton in most open ocean environments. Faculty
in the Oceanography Department at Texas A&amp;M University currently have funded
projects based in both the North Atlantic and North Pacific central gyres which
would utilize the capabilities of the flow cytometer to analyze picoplankton
populations. Other research projects in the Department of Oceanography which
would benefit greatly from this instrument include the study of the cell
division in eukaryotic marine phytoplankton, the analysis of picoplankton
cultures, plankton studies using molecular probes, coastal studies of nitrifying
bacteria, and stable isotope studies of the microbial loop. An annual training
course in the theory and use of the flow cytometer would be offered to
undergraduate and graduate students, and this facility will be used to attract
graduate students to Texas A&amp;M. A plan for management of the facility is
also outlined. ***
