Recent national studies have identified serious deficiencies in mechanical
tolerancing and metrology standards and practices, and in the teaching of these
in universities, training institutes, and industry. The central problem
underlying all of these deficiencies is the lack of proper scientific
foundations for mechanical tolerancing. In essence, tolerancing and metrology
evolved from shop-floor practice, and are taught and applied as collections of
special-case techniques. This project pursues four related lines of research to
improve this situation: (1) development of a semi-formal mathematical
codification for the main principles of the ANSI Y14.5 tolerancing standard,
initially in the form of a monograph and/or course notes for engineering
students; (2) extension of the codification with mathematical and computational
techniques for analyzing the accumulation of geometric tolerances (i.e.,
generalization of one- dimension tolerance stacking). Such techniques are
important in design for assembly; (3) linking of the codification to metrology
practices, with selective research on open issues in dimensional and surface
modeling; and (4) exploratory research in functional tolerancing (i.e., control
of the effects of spatial variability on the performance of designed artifacts).
