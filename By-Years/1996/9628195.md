9628195 Jacobsen This project is to determine the 187Os/186Os ratios in
continental crust materials (primarily river suspended loads) to constrain the
Os isotopic composition of the continental crust. The PI's will establish the
187Os/186Os variations in relation to the 143Nd/144Nd variations in continental
materials. The results will be used to constrain models of crust-mantle
differentiation and crustal recycling into the mantel, to provide constraints on
the Os isotopic composition of the bulk silicate Earth, and to conduct mass
balance considerations for the Os isotopic variations in crust and mantle
reservoirs. Measurements will be carried out by N-TIMS isotope dilution methods.
Data will be obtained on well characterized samples. The PIs will develop
geochemical models for the budgets of Re and Os and their relation to the
incompatible, lithophile elements in the depleted mantle, continental crust, and
other potentially significant reservoirs in the silicate Earth. The ultimate
goal is to understand the geochemical behavior of Re and Os in the Earth's
crust-mantle system and the utility of this system as a tracer for crust-mantle
evolution processes.
