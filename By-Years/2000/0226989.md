The New Jersey Math and Science Partnership (NJ-MSP) unites Rutgers, Rowan and
Kean Universities with twelve school districts. Eight of the districts were
among thirty plaintiffs in New Jersey's 20-year-long Abbott vs. Burke
litigation, and have recently benefited from remedies ordered by the state
Supreme Court. The twelve districts that come together within NJ-MSP are
characterized as small- and medium-sized urban districts with poor, high-
minority and low achieving student populations. The partners' schools enroll
over 75,000 students of whom 27% are African American and 31% are Hispanic.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of NJ-MSP are to:&lt;br/&gt;1. Increase
achievement and reduce achievement gaps in science and mathematics for all
preK-12 students in partner school districts by (a) working to develop and
implement strategic plans for each district; (b) working to develop internal
leadership structures and practices to carry out the strategic plans; and (c)
providing well-designed, continuing professional development.&lt;br/&gt;2.
Increase and sustain the number, quality and diversity of preK-12 teachers of
mathematics and science in partner school districts by (a) providing potential
teachers with experiences that will help them see teaching as an attractive
career; (b) improving preservice teachers' content knowledge by reshaping
university math and science courses; and (c) carrying out induction programs for
new middle and high school teachers.&lt;br/&gt;3. Document outcomes by (a)
analyzing changes in student achievement and (b) documenting project
activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
