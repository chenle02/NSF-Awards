CR-0121633&lt;br/&gt;ITR/SY+SI: Language Technology for Trustless Software
Dissemination&lt;br/&gt;Karl Crary, Robert Harper, Peter Lee, Frank
Pfenning&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
investigates the theoretical and engineering basis for &lt;br/&gt;the trustless
dissemination of software in an untrusted environment. &lt;br/&gt;To make this
possible the project investigates machine-checkable&lt;br/&gt;certificates of
compliance with security, integrity, and privacy&lt;br/&gt;requirements. Such
checkable certificates allow participants to&lt;br/&gt;verify the intrinsic
properties of disseminated software, rather than&lt;br/&gt;extrinsic properties
such as the software's point of origin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To obtain checkable
certificates the project develops certifying&lt;br/&gt;compilers that equip
their object code with formal representations &lt;br/&gt;of proofs of properties
of the code. Specifically, the project&lt;br/&gt;investigates the use of proof-
carrying code, typed intermediate&lt;br/&gt;languages, and typed assembly
languages for this purpose. In each&lt;br/&gt;case certificate verification is
reduced to type-checking in a&lt;br/&gt;suitable type
system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To demonstrate the utility of trustless software
dissemination, the&lt;br/&gt;project develops an infrastructure for building
applications that&lt;br/&gt;exploit the computational resources of a network of
computers. The&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure consists of a "steward" running on host
computers that&lt;br/&gt;accepts and verifies certified binaries before
installing and&lt;br/&gt;executing them, and certifying compilers that generate
certified&lt;br/&gt;binaries for distribution on the
network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scope of the investigation includes the theory
of specification&lt;br/&gt;and certification, and the systems building required
to implement&lt;br/&gt;these ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
