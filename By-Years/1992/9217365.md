A premise of this Grand Challenge Application project is that high performance
computing environments and numerical play vital roles both in unraveling the
complex physics and chemistry occurring in the environment, but also in shaping
design of cost effective public policies. Distributed heterogeneous computing
systems offer the potential to revolutionize the current approach to
environmental modeling. Research is carried out to improve the models, their
mapping onto advanced architectures, and to create a flexible environment that
enbables more widespread use of the tools.
