The deepening economic crises in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union and the
economic stagnation in China, have political causes and consequences that
contemporary political science is ill equipped to analyze. Few of the most
powerful theories developed for western regimes apply in the former eastern bloc
nations. Area studies experts are theoretically uninformed and know too little
about either political economy or systematic research methods. This research
training workshop attempts to remedy this situation by bringing together some of
the Soviet area specialists, democratic theorists, and research methodologists
for a series of intensive sessions. The senior participants will benefit from
the interdisciplinary exchange of ideas and participating graduate students will
have an unusual opportunity to work with and synthesize the ideas of the leaders
in the field.
