Chemistry (12) The is project is creating a model for integrating the use of a
combined FT-Raman and FT-IR instrument into several laboratory courses taken by
chemistry majors and chemical, polymer, and textile engineers at different
levels of difficulty. Experiments, which are being primarily adapted from
research literature, are designed to fit the needs of analytical, bioanalytical
and physical chemistry education in a wide variety of disciplines. The
combination of Raman spectroscopy complementary to IR spectroscopy and in
conjunction with multivariate data evaluation techniques is of great pedagogical
value for fundamental understanding of molecular spectroscopy at the basic and
advanced undergraduate level. Furthermore, using the same instrumental method
for addressing scientific questions in different disciplines facilitates
interdisciplinary thinking and provides an enhanced learning experience.
