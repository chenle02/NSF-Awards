This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the
Chemistry Research Instrumentation Programs. Georgia Southern University (GSU)
is acquiring single crystal diffractometer equipped with a high-flux Cu X-ray
source, a Hybrid Photon Counting (HPC) detector, and a cryogenic device to
support the research of Gary Guillet and colleagues Clifford Padgett, Brandon
Quillian, and Arpita Saha. In general, an X-ray diffractometer allows accurate
and precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule,
including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the
spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies
described here impact many areas, including organic chemistry, physical
chemistry, inorganic chemistry, magnetic materials, and organometallic
chemistry. organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and
biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as
research and research training of undergraduate and graduate students in
chemistry and biochemistry at this institution and the surrounding region. The
facility serves as a regional XRD resource benefitting students and faculty from
primarily undergraduate institutions within the state of Georgia with impacts
outside GSU with interactions with PUI and HBCU institutions such as Savannah
State University (HBCU), Albany State University (HBCU), University of North
Georgia, and Georgia College.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is aimed at
enhancing research and education at all levels. Research enabled by the
instrument is focused on the study and characterization of the structure of
novel extended metal atom chain complexes that contain unique metal-metal
bonding interactions, halogen-bonded adducts using N-oxides, green
hydroarylation catalysts, and Mn cluster complexes with single-molecule magnetic
properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
