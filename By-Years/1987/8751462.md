A collaboration of staff from the University of California at Berkeley's
Lawrence Hall of Science, School of Education, and the Cooperative Extension
Service (4-H) will develop and implement SERIES (Science Experiences and
Resources for Informal Education Settings), a state-wide informal science
education program for the California State 4-H system. Over a three year period
they will adapt existing science curricula and generate new materials for use in
informal 4-H settings around the theme of science relevant to societal concerns,
with an agricultural technology focus. They will design and test a comprehensive
training model using the materials to insure their effective use by volunteer
leaders, and develop an extensive cadre of CES staff and volunteer trainers
skilled in training volunteer teachers in the use of the curriculum materials.
The resulting curriculum and training materials will be published and made
available at cost to all 4-H clubs. The project will directly benefit 100 paid
and volunteer trainers, 1800 volunteer leaders and 12,600 youth participants,
and will indirectly benefit the more than 60,000 youth enrolled in California
4-H programs each year.
