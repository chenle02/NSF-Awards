With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Billups will synthesize very
reactive compounds of theoretical interest under conditions of matrix isolation
in argon near zero degrees Kelvin. Structures of these compounds will be
determined by low temperature x-ray, FTIR, and UV/visible spectroscopy.
Bifunctional cycloproparenes will be synthesized and polymerized with silver ion
catalysis to produce a series of new aromatic materials including polyacenes,
polyphenanthrenes, molecular strips, and novel graphite-like molecules with
holes. A major focus of the research of Dr. Billups is the synthesis of unique
organic compounds through new procedures discovered in his laboratory. These
novel approaches will create new substances that have interesting bulk
properties for the construction of new materials. The use of reactive metal
atoms will cause organic compounds to react by processes that are unconventional
and will transform hydrocarbons into useful substances.
