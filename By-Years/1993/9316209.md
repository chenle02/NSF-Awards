This work has four parts that deal with four areas of algorithmic research. The
first part, algorithms on strings, has a number of specific problems for which
improved algorithms will need new algorithmic techniques. In the second part,
the study of cryptographic protocols, concerns new protocols, and exploring
tradeoffs of security and communication for useful tasks. The third part,
problems in distributed computing, includes developing precise models and
improved algorithms. The fourth part, problems in dynamic graphs, involves the
development of algorithmic techniques for graph problems whose underlying graphs
may change. This research develops new general tools and techniques as well as
attacking the specific problems of special interest. It includes the design of
sequential, parallel, and distributed algorithms and protocols. Theoretical
considerations as well as practical ones are taken into account.
