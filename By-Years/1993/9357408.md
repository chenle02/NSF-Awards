9357408 Truong Dr. Thahn Truong is supported by an NSF Young Investigator Award
from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to pursue theoretical
research in the area of dynamics and mechanisms for proton transfer reactions in
solution. Truong will perform studies in the following three areas: 1) dynamics
and mechanistic studies of proton transfer in proteins; 2) dynamics and
mechanistic studies of heterogeneous catalysis reactions; and 3) "direct
dynamics" studies of chemical reactions in gas-phase, microsolvated states, and
in solution. The primary methodologies to be used in these studies include
molecular orbital theory and molecular dynamics. Variational transition state
theory calculations will employ semiclassical treatment for tunneling and
quantal treatment for vibrations directly from semiempirical molecular orbital
methods. %%% Proton transfer is ubiquitous and important in virtually all
biological systems. In spite of much experimental evidence of significant
quantum effects occuring in such processes, not a lot is known about the
detailed dynamics of this fundamental process at the molecular level. Truong's
research will explore the process of proton transfer in simple model systems in
order to better elucidate the mechanism for biological systems such as DNA base
pairs. ***
