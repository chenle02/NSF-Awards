The focus of this research is to design and implement an optimizing C* compiler
for hypercube multicomputers and distribute the compiler to the hypercube user
community. The compiler will translate C* into C. The use of C as a target
language takes advantage of existing C compilers to reduce development time and
expense. It also makes the compiler more portable. To move the compiler to other
hypercubes or shared memory multiprocessors, only the routing library must be
reimplemented. Preliminary results are encouraging. Hand-compiled C* programs
have achieved reasonable speedup on a commercial hypercube. The long-term goal
of the research is to investigate the power of the synchronous, data parallel
approach to parallel algorithm development. Many numerical and nonnumerical
algorithms can be expressed in an elegant fashion using this methodology. If C*
compilers can be written that allow for the reasonable efficient execution of
parallel algorithms on the Connection Machine, multicomputers, and shared memory
multiprocessors, then there would be a whole class of algorithms for which no
reprogramming would be necessary in order to move an application from one
parallel architecture to another.
