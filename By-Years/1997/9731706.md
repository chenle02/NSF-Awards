Recent field studies show that methyl halides gases (e.g., methyl chloride,
methyl bromide and methyl iodide) are released from rice paddies. Given the
worldwide cultivation of rice, this newly identified source is of potential
global importance. However, measurements are sparse. In addition, atmospheric
mixing ratios for the higher molecular weight analogs (chloro- and bromoethanes)
are poorly known and there exists little information concerning the emission
sources for these compounds. The potential importance of halomethanes and
haloethanes to the global atmosphere is due to their chemical behavior in the
atmosphere that is expected to be similar to the well studied and better
understood class of synthetic chlorofluorocarbons. Thus, methyl and ethyl halide
gases also may produce profound effects on the concentrations and distributions
of stratospheric ozone.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; This renewal project supports a
series of rice field measurements located in California and Texas. Flux chambers
will be placed over rice plants and samples will be collected into stainless
canisters, and analyzed for methyl and ethyl halides by gas chromatography/mass
spectrometry (GC/MS). The field experiments will produce quantitative data for
updating the current global emission estimates of methyl and ethyl halides. It
is possible these emission data will lead to revised calculations for the
lifetime of methyl bromide, thus changing the calculated impact of this gas on
stratospheric ozone concentrations and distributions. Further, the new emissions
data should lead to significant improvement in the current understanding of the
relative roles of natural and anthropogenic sources of methyl chloride and
methyl bromide. The benefit to atmospheric chemistry is the improved accuracy of
atmospheric models which investigate the global sources and sinks of alkyl
halide gases.&lt;br/&gt;
