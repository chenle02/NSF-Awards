9314819 Harlow The goals of the proposed research are (1) to examine
experimentally the limits and parameters of K uptake in clinopyroxenes from 5 to
15 GPa and 1200-1700oC, (2) to verify by x-ray diffraction, TEM, ATEM that K
enters the clinopyroxene structure and to characterize the structural
characteristics of this substitution, (3) to conduct additional experiments with
difference variance to produce coexisting clinopyroxene and other phases in
order to examine K-amphiboles and K-rich minerals, and (4) to begin to examine
Ba uptake in calcic phases, as a divalent analogue of K The proposed study has
relevance for determining potential reservoirs of K in the mantle, which is
central to understanding the source of K in mantle- derived rocks, mantle
metasomatism, K recycling by subduction, and the heat budget of the Earth.
