This award is to support research that will develop a continuous record of
glaciation over the last two to three glacial cycles in mid latitude South
America that can be compared to nearby ice core records and glaciomarine
sequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Field work will be undertaken to map moraines
and outwash terraces in detail. Surface exposure dating will be carried out to
provide a high-resolution chronostratigraphic framework within which
paleoclimate data can be placed. Soil analyses will be performed to provide
soil-moisture history for the region. Other analyses that will be performed to
fine-tune exposure surface dating include better estimates of boulder erosion
rates, and refinement of local production rates for cosmogenic
nuclides.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this proposed research
center on the development of a continuous high resolution record of southern
hemisphere glaciation. Successful development of this record holds the potential
for answering fundamental questions regarding synchrony of climate change in the
northern and southern hemispheres.
