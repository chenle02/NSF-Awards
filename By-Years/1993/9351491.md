The mathematics faculty of the University of Redlands is converting its
calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra courses from lecture
courses to laboratory courses featuring discovery-based learning in the context
of real-world models. The primary discovery tool for each of these courses is,
or will be, the computer. In fact, we intend for each classroom in which these
courses are taught to be equipped with one computer for each two students. Our
institutional commitment to small class sizes means we need two computer
classrooms with 13 computers in each. Redlands is now offering all of its first-
year calculus courses in a laboratory format; when a second computer classroom
is added, the third-semester calculus course and the differential equations and
linear algebra courses will be offered as laboratory courses as well. The
Redlands project reflects its faculty's belief, shared by mathematics educators
nationwide, that students learn best by actively discovering and exploring
mathematical concepts. The computer allows students to visualize and explore
complex models not tractable using more traditional algebraic or analytic
approaches. NSF Form 1295 (6/92)
