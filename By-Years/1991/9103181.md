In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry
Division, Weisman will study the kinetics and spectroscopy of azoalkanes and
small aromatic molecules subjected to nanosecond pulses of uv radiation. Light-
induced dissociation and isomerization studies of azoalkanes will be continued
and extended, and quantum mechanical calculations will be conducted to yield a
detailed mechanistic understanding of the photochemistry. Some transient
absorption and transient CARS experiments will be performed. %%% The mechanisms
by which energetically excited polyatomic molecules are relaxed down to their
unexcited ground energy state will be explored and clarified in this project.
Some of the relaxation schemes are complex and challenging to unravel.
Nonetheless, knowledge of the different steps involved in energy relaxation is
important to be able to predict the relative amounts of dissociations and
isomerizations that can occur in related molecular systems.
