Solar energy can be suited to tasks such as producing pure metals from their
ores by using concentrated sunlight to heat reactants to high enough
temperatures to initiate reactions. The PI plans to investigate the use of solar
energy as process heat to produce zinc and carbon monoxide from zinc oxide using
titanium trioxide. A two step high temperature process is planned: reduction of
zinc oxide (ZnO) with titanium sesquioxide (Ti2O3) to produce zinc and titanium
dioxide (TiO2) followed by reduction of TiO2 back to Ti2O3 by reaction with
carbon. He plans to determine the overall reaction rate for the conversion of
zinc oxide to metallic zinc using an electric furnace as the reactor. For the
cases where zinc evolves in the gas phase, the reactants experience a weight
loss which will be followed with a microbalance and recorded with a data
acquisition system. This data will be used to establish the rate. When zinc
forms as a liquid, the products will be quenched after specified run times. A
plot of zinc yield versus time will be used to determine the rate.***
