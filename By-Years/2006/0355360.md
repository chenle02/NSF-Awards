Paraproducts with Flag Singularities

Abstract

Over the last few years we have been working on developing further the theory
of multilinear singular integrals and their Carleson-type maximal analogs, in
connection with the spectral theory of one-dimensional Schroedinger operators.
We understood many of its beautiful features, but still much more work needs to
be done

The present Project is focused on creating a consistent multi-parameter theory
for these multilinear operators. The motivation for such a study is not only our
previous work, but also the desire of analysts of having a general Kato-Ponce
theory, so useful in PDE. Some of these operators have a very special multi-
parameter structure not seen among the previously studied operators in harmonic
analysis. Understanding their combinatorics is a deep and challenging study. Our
plan is to handle not only large classes of such paraproducts with "flag
singularities", but also "analytic series" of such operators. We believe that
these new techniques will have a broad impact to several problems in nonlinear
analysis.
