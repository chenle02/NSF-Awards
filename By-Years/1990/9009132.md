ABSTRACT This proposal is concerned with the accuracy of children's memory of
autobiographical events. Current research on memory suggests that repeated
questioning about a past event can enhance the consistency with which one
recalls the event. The PI intends to test various explanations of this finding
with children, to determine the factors that influence the accuracy (or
inaccuracy) of children's autobiographical memory. The research has important
implications not only for theories of memory, but for more practical concerns,
as well. For example, it may shed light on issues of the reliability of
children's courtroom testimony under repeated questioning, etc. This research
has the potential to expand our understanding of the factors that affect our
memories of important life events.
