9712763 Slowey This project will collect a set of gravity and large- diameter
piston cores on the slope of Oahu, Hawaii in water depths from 200-3500 m.
Stable isotopes and taxonomic composition of planktic and benthic foraminifera
will be analyzed in order to estimate past temperature and nutrient content of
surface and deep water masses. Resultant data will determine changes in regional
sea surface temperature and deep water production from the last glacial interval
to the present.
