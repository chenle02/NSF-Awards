This project is a demographic study of factors causing a rise in fertility in
Malaysia. The area has experienced economic devel- opment for several decades,
and usually that fact would lead to declining birth rates. However, since about
1970, fertility has increased. PI plans to focus on two potential explanations,
ethnic pride (and competition), and pro-natalist aspects of government policy.
Results of the research will advance demogra- phic understanding of determinants
of fertility, and will have implications for population control programs. The
project is partially supported by RAND Corporation, The Population Council, and
the Population Reference Bureau in addition to NSF.
