To enable a listener to localize a sound source, the auditory system suppresses
echoes that result from reflections of the sound off nearby objects.
Psychoacoustic experiments have provided evidence that some of this suppression
occurs within a group of nerve cells--the cochlear nuclear complex--which is the
first integrative stage in the auditory system. Anatomical and physiological
experiments on brain slices that include the cochlear nuclei have identified
neurons in the upper portion of the cochlear nuclear complex that are candidates
for mediating the echo suppression effect. The major purpose of these
experiments is to examine, physiologically, the suppression of echoes in the
cochlear nuclear complex and to determine whether the suppression is due to the
candidate neurons. Microelectrode recordings are made from single neurons to
various sound stimuli to study the effects of echo suppression, since even
though echos are suppressed for localization of a sound, they do make a
contribution to perception of the sound. Responses of neurons to pairs of
stimuli will be recorded to determine whether and under what conditions the
response to a second click is suppressed by the first. Also, responses will be
recorded from different neurons in the lower cochlear nucleus to determine
whether there are neurons that do not show echo suppression.
