9603152 Turgeon The work on phloem loading departs from the hypothesis that
loading of sugars is not universal, but that different mechanisms exist through
which sucrose is translocated from the companion cells to the phloem vessels
(sieve elements). The loading process involving stachyose and raffinose will be
analyzed in more detail in the proposed work to obtain a clear picture about the
functions of phlasmodesmata in loading, the contribution of the raffinose-series
of sugars to translocation, and on actual sugar concentrations in neighboring
cells. The demonstration that phloem loading does not occur, as it was
dogmatically assumed for many years, will considerably influence research in
basic plant physiology and in applied areas of breeding for increased crop
productivity.
