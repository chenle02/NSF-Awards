Professor Paul Rabinow is undertaking a Professional Development Fellowship at
the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) in Paris receiving training in
the innovative techniques of Yeast Artificial Cloning and DNA typing. He is
undertaking this training in biological methods in order to enable him to study
CEPH and two related institutions: Genethon, a high-tech facility organized to
rapidly identify disease genes and the Association Francaise Contre les
Myophathies (AFM), a `disease-group' concerned with the myopathies. Taken
together, the CEPH-Genethon-AFM embody a distinctive form of doing science, one
which links science, society and technology from the start. Given that the CEPH
has been more than competitive in its scientific and technical output, its
success poses the question about what the connection might be between its
commitment to integrating social concerns with cutting edge technology and
scientific advance. This institutional complex works and it is essential for
science policy studies to find out why. Professor Rabinow's training and
research are designed to address the issue using anthropological and historical
methods.
