The history of atmospheric circulation is an important element of
paleoclimatology and the best reconstructions of atmospheric circulation come
from analyzing the aeolian sediments found in deep sea cores. This proposal
requests support to use a series of new piston cores to reconstruct the history
of oceanic and atmospheric circulation in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. The
scientific goals of this study are to: 1) reconstruct the history of northern
hemisphere trade winds for the Pleistocene; 2) determine the relationship
between climate change and productivity in the equatorial Pacific; and 3)
determine the nature of orbital forcing and climatic-oceanic response in this
region. This research is important because it will provide documentation of the
response of the atmosphere to changes in climatic forcing, documentation of the
response of the oceans to changes in atmospheric circulation, and important data
bases to test the sensitivity of atmospheric General Circulation Models.
