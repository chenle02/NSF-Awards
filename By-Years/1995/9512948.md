Funds are requested for three ultracentrifuges (Beckman L7-80) and eight
ultracentrifuge rotors (two each of NVT65, 60Ti, SW-55Ti, and SW-41Ti) to be
located in the molecular biology core facility that serves laboratories in the
three departments of Biology, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, and Chemistry
at Wesleyan University. The ultracentrifuges will replace two instruments that
have recently become non-operational due to age related circumstances.
Acquisition of the three new instruments will bring to four the number of
ultracentrifuges on campus although use of the fourth machine will be limited
due to its age. The instruments will be used by the laboratories of seven major
and four minor users. They will also be used by two new faculty to be hired in
the areas of cell biology and molecular biology. The instruments are required
for standard methods in molecular biology and biochemistry including a number of
different subcellular fractionation methods for membrane preparations, and to
separate protein or protein/RNA complexes. Ultracentrifugation is also required
for certain DNA preparations where purity and yield are important. These methods
will be applied to several different projects. These include studies of:
Mechanisms of protein localization in E. coli; Identification of novel antigens
for Lyme disease diagnosis; Topology of a membrane associated regulator of
prokaryotic DNA replication; Dissection of Drosophila Paired protein function;
Formation of the mammalian visual cortex; Analysis of the cell division cycle in
yeast; Regulation of the 2(1) collagen gene in chick embryonic cartilage cells;
and the role of ferritin in defense against oxygen radical toxicity. Matching
funds from Wesleyan University will pay for 50% of the cost of the instruments.
