9414510 Anderson This proposal describes a three-year research plan directed
toward the experimental demonstration of GaN-based short-wavelength
semiconductor injection lasers and the investigation of several key scientific
and technological issues related to laser applications of the III-V nitrides.
Strong initial emphasis will be placed on the demonstration of A1GaN/GaN/InGaN
vertical-cavity surface- emitting laser (VCSEL) structures grown on 6H-SiC
substrates, although a broad range of material and device design issues directly
relevant to GaN-based heterostructure lasers and other devices will be
investigated throughout the course of the project. Theoretical and experimental
work will encompass growth and characterization of GaN, InGaN, and A1GaN
epilayers and heterostructures, heterostructure modeling, and VCSEL laser
modeling, design, fabrication, and characterization. Epitaxial growth,
structural characterization, and electrical characterization will be carried out
by researchers at Advanced Technology Materials, Inc. (ATMI) of Danbury, CT, who
are currently involved in the development of GaN-based semiconductors and will
be full collaborators on this project. This proposal is being submitted for
consideration as an Industry-University Cooperative Research Project (IUCRP)
under the NSF's Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaisons with Industry (GOALI)
program. ***
