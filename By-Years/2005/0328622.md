&lt;br/&gt;THIS PROJECT IS TO COMPUTE THE FLOW OF FLUID AND THE MOTION OF A
SOLID SPHERE IN A PRESSURE DRIVEN FLOW IN A ROUND PIPE BY THE METHOD DIRECT
SIMULATION. OUR INTEREST IS IN THE LIFT FORCE ON THE SPHERE. TWO DIFFERENT CODES
WILL BE USED TO COMPUTE THE SAME MOTION FOR VALIDATION. &lt;br/&gt; THE RESULTS
WILL BE POST PROCESSED FOR CORRELATIONS GIVING THE DIMENSIONLESS LIFT FORCE IN
TERMS OF POWERS OF THE GOVERNING PARAMETERS. THE GOAL IS TO GET DATA BASED
FORMULAS FOR LIFT FROM NUMERICAL DATA. THE FORMULAS WILL BE COMPARED WITH DATA
FROM REAL EXPERIMENTS.&lt;br/&gt;
