This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in inorganic
and organometallic chemistry between Kim Dunbar of Michigan State University and
Patrick Batail of the University of Paris, South (Orsay). The objective of the
research is to develop low dimensional materials that have useful electrical and
magnetic properties. The investigators will use dinuclear and cluster metal-
metal bonded compounds as precursors to reactions with redox-active organic
molecules which have functional groups capable of attaching to a metal. They
will synthesize three main types of materials: (1) covalently-linked one
dimensional materials consisting of alternating metal and p-organic groups; (2)
network polymers comprised of cross-linked metal units; and (3) metal complexes
of new phosphorus ligands. These are interesting materials because of their
potential for electrical and magnetic properties. The Michigan State group
brings to this collaboration experience in molecular chemistry. They have been
involved in the synthesis of new metal precursors for the design of molecular
based charge transfer polymers and materials. This is complemented by the French
group's expertise in theoretical solid state chemistry, conductivity, magnetism,
and their work on transition metal clusters. The collaboration allows the U.S.
investigator to expand her research to the materials area by taking advantage of
French expertise.
