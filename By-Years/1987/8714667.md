Several investigations will be carried out with the common aim of confronting
current ideas in theoretical physics and physical cosmology with observations.
*Theoretical studies will be made of gravitational lensing effects of cosmic
strings. These studies will be used to implement a systematic search for cosmic
string lens candidates in a digital sky survey database. Candidate systems will
then be submitted to a battery of additional observational screenings.
*Theoretical investigation will be made of line emission and line profiles in
models of high-redshift clouds producing absorption lines in Quasi-Stellar
Object (QSO) spectra. An observational search for their line emission will be
made and used to put limits on the high-redshift Ultraviolet (UV) background.
*Models will be made of various sources of small-angle anisotropy in the
microwave background and applied to recent detections at the Very Large Array
(VLA). New observations at a higher radio frequency will be made at the VLA to
distinguish between these models. *Theoretical models will be studied of the
effect of inhomogeneities from cosmic phase transitions on cosmic
nucleosynthesis. A critical evaluation will be made of the range of cosmic
baryon densities compatible with observations.
