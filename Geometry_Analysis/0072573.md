Abstract

Award: DMS-0072573 Principal Investigator: Chaim Goodman-Strauss

For nearly 40 years, beginning with work by H. Wang and R. Berger, the
undecidability of certain questions regarding tilings and aperiodic tilings have
been studied. But as we extend our horizons and consider tilings in more general
contexts than the Euclidean Plane, we see that many foundational questions are
still open. In any particular, reasonably well-defined setting (e.g., "tilings
in the hyperbolic plane by polygonal tiles, moved about by orientation-
preserving isometries"), there are several intertwined questions that may be
asked: 1) Is there a general method to determine whether a given set of
prototiles admits a tiling that includes a specified configuration? (Is the
"Completion Problem" decidable?; 2) Is there a general method to determine
whether a given set of prototiles can tile the space at all? (Is the "Domino
Problem" decidable?) 3) Is there a "weakly aperiodic" protoset? (Such a protoset
admits no tiling with a compact fundamental domain.); 4) Is there a "strongly
aperiodic" protoset? (Such a protoset admits no tiling that is invariant under
an infinite-cyclic symmetry); 5) Is there a computable bound on the Heesch
number of protosets?; Is there a computable bound on the isohedral number of
protosets?; 7) Is the period problem decidable? We consider conjectures
concerning some of these questions in two settings that have been thought about
for 20 years: protosets in the hyperbolic plane and monotiles in the Euclidean
plane; and we sketch a number of proposed approaches to these problems. We feel
these techniques should generalize and shed light on many foundation al issues
in discrete geometry.

We hope the project will be significant in several ways. First, these problems,
which have largely been seen as isolated from each other, can all be seen as
tightly connected. It is anticipated that techniques will arise that will shed
light on several aspects of this problem. But moreover, the techniques under
consideration may link these questions in several topics in low-dimensional
geometric topology and combinatorial algebra. Finally, questions of decidability
and tractability are one of the central concerns of theoretical computer
science; form one point of view, we are simply exploring a particular example,
but hope that the techniques we develop will be of more general use.
