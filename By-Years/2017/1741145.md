This award provides travel support for student participation in the Symposium on
Undergraduate Research to be held at the Laser Science XXXIII Conference. This
conference is of great importance to the vitality of atomic, molecular, and
optical physics in the United States because almost all work in this area
involves lasers in some way. The support of students through this award makes a
substantial contribution to the education and training of future scientists.
Students who graduate with a background in atomic, molecular, and optical
physics acquire a broad range of knowledge and skills that enable them to
contribute to progress in many areas of science and technology.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Laser Science XXXIII Conference, which this award
supports, is a joint meeting of the American Physical Society's Division of
Laser Science and the Optical Society of America's annual meeting to be held in
Washington, DC in September 2017. This Conference offers an opportunity for
students to present their research results and to interact with senior
scientists primarily from the United States, but also the broader international
community. Support is provided only for US students (students enrolled in US
universities).
