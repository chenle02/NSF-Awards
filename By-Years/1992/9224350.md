The recent revelation of apparent extremely large-scale structure in the cosmic
microwave background has led to new efforts to evaluate the structure in the
universe. The research activities to be supported under this grant will be
involved in tracing out such structure. Rich clusters of galaxies are efficient
samplers of the scales of interest. Recent analyses of clusters from Abell's
(1958) and the new Abell, Corwin, and Olowin (1989) catalog of southern rich
clusters reveal evidence of three dimensional superclustering. However,
redshifts have been measured for less than 25% of these clusters, and the
present knowledge of the three dimensional distribution of these clusters has
some uncertainties. These uncertainties will be significantly reduced by this
work, which will obtain redshifts of over 300 of these clusters, so that a
deeper, more complete and reliable sample is available for studies of large-
scale structure.
