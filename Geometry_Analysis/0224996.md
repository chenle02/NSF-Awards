This award supports U.S. participation in a conference to be held in January
2003 in Cuernavaca, Mexico. The conference, titled "Complex Geometry and
Dynamics," is being organized in honor of Alberto Verjovsky of the Universidad
Nacional Autonoma de Mexico and will range widely over the fields of dynamics
and geometry.

The award will fund conference travel expenses of 25 junior U.S. participants
and several speakers. A special feature of the conference that will particularly
serve the junior participants is a set of short courses offered by M. Brunella,
E. Ghys, and Y. Eliashberg.
