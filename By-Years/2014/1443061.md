The large quantities of data produced by modern solar telescopes provide a rich
and rapidly growing opportunity for discovery. These large data sets create an
unprecedented ability to observe correlations between phenomena that have
previously gone unexplored. However, to harness the power of these large data
sets, it is necessary to provide the solar physics and space weather communities
with software tools that will rapidly and accurately catalog, explore, track and
correlate solar phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops tools for
processing large volumes of spatio-temporal solar data. Initially, the team
enables tracking of all solar events previously identified by an international
consortium (the Feature Finding Team of the Solar Dynamics Observatory) and
reported to the Heliophysics Event Knowledgebase (HEK). Next, the team develops
systematic spatiotemporal characterizations of solar event types, and identifies
spatiotemporal co-occurrence patterns. Throughout the project, the team
disseminates the generated data, discovered patterns, and developed software
tools to the community. By adding an ability to track features previously
identified by an international consortium, the project has potential to advance
knowledge of solar phenomena, and the impact of such phenomena on space weather.
