The Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division of the National Science
Foundation will support the research program of Professor Wilfred Tysoe of the
University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Dr. Tysoe and his students will explore
oxidative reaction pathways on model gold-palladium alloy catalysts, using a
combination of surface science spectroscopic probes and computational modeling
of the reaction processes. The work focuses on developing a molecular level
understanding of reaction pathways for vinyl acetate monomer synthesis, direct
hydrogen peroxide synthesis, and CO and alcohol oxidation reactions. The nature
of the surface oxygen displaying catalytic activity will be probed in these
studies. Fundamental insights obtained in these studies will aid in the design
and development of active catalysts for commercial application. The work also
provides a training ground for students in this technologically important field.
Women and underrepresented minority students make up a large portion of the
research team.
