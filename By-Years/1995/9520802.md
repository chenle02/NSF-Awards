In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Scott Anderson
of the University of Utah will study the reaction dynamics of simple polyatomic
ions using reactant vibrational mode selection and high resolution ion beam
techniques. Systems which will be investigated include the reactions of water
ions with hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and water molecules, and the reaction of
nitrous oxide ions with carbon monoxide molecules. These studies will include
the development of pulsed field ionization techniques to produce vibrational
state selectivity in the reactant ions. This work will advance the understanding
of the vibrational mode dependence of reaction mechanisms, and the manner in
which reactant energy is partitioned into product states. This work is expected
to provide benchmarks for further theoretical work on these systems. The amount
and nature of vibrational energy in a reactant molecule can cause dramatic
changes in the relative amounts of different products of chemical reactions.
Professor Anderson's work will determine how this vibrational energy will affect
the products of several ion molecule reactions. The results of this work will
provide information on methods of controlling chemical reactions to produce a
single product to the exclusion of other unwanted products.
