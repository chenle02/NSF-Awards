This award will help support the Big Sky Conference on Discrete Mathematics
which is held in Missoula, Montana. There are two main objectives of the
conference. First, the conference is designed to bring together researchers and
educators from the geographical area with interests in discrete mathematics in
order for them to share ideas, present their work, and collaborate. Topics for
the conference cover areas of discrete mathematics including combinatorics,
graph theory, discrete geometry, design theory and theoretical computer science.
The conference attracts mathematicians and computer scientists from western US
and Canada and in doing so has strengthened the discrete mathematics community
in the region. The conference also includes two research-level invited
addresses. One is given by a senior-level experienced mathematician and the
other by a younger researcher who has made significant contributions to the
field. The presence of these internationally-known researchers greatly enhances
the conference. Secondly, the conference seeks to provide an opportunity for
students, teachers, and others in the region to learn more about contemporary
mathematics. This award provides support for undergraduate and graduate students
to attend the conference and present their work. In addition, a public lecture
(given by one of the invited speakers) is an integral part of the Big Sky
Conference. The audience, comprised of people of all ages and many different
walks of life, is treated to a dynamic lecture on the beauty and relevance of
mathematics. The conference will be hosted by The University of Montana.

The Big Sky Conference on Discrete Math is held in the early fall at The
University of Montana. The primary focus of the conference is stimulation and
dissemination of research and creative ideas in discrete mathematics. This
includes promoting collaboration among regional colleagues, supporting student
research, and demonstrating to the general populace that mathematics is a
dynamic evolving field with applications in modern society. The events of the
conference include contributed talks by faculty and students and three invited
addresses. One of the principle speakers is an internationally acclaimed
specialist and outstanding expositor. This speaker gives a research level
seminar and a public lecture. With attendance at the public lecture between 300
and 500 people, public awareness of mathematics has flourished during the years
of the Big Sky Conference. The other speaker is a younger researcher who has
made a significant contribution to an area of discrete mathematics. This person
typically gives a specialized talk about a recent advancement in the field. The
conference attracts researchers, educators, and students from the US and Canada,
especially those in the northwest region.
