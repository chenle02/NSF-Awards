This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a new approach
to building a microarray (biochip) printing system. The result is expected to be
a proven design capable of spotting sub-picoliter droplets of biofluids onto
substrates at a tenfold to hundredfold speed improvement over existing systems.
A second design will be a very low cost (under $4,000) and reliable printer
suitable for the tens of thousands of biotechnology labs worldwide. The research
objectives are to use modeling and systematic testing to optimize an
electrohydrodynamic droplet ejection mechanism based on Taylor instability and
adapt it for microarray printing. Although the droplet emission phenomenon has
been observed in a few research papers, it has not been adequately characterized
and adapted to the requirements of a high capacity microarray printing system
used in a production environment. The Phase I research would involve a study of
the droplet ejection mechanism, including voltage patterns, nozzle shape,
grounding grids, dielectric constants of materials, and substrate separation
from nozzle. These results will be incorporated into proprietary designs for the
microarray printers.

The commercial application of this project is in the area of microarrays.
Clinical genomic applications (disease diagnosis, drug sensitivity testing, and
forensics) will require production of standard and custom microarrays (biochips)
by the millions. Although ongoing genetic and proteomic research is making these
applications possible, an important missing link is a technology for a large
improvement in the speed, cost, and reliability of the mass production of
microarrays. This project expects to address this market niche.
