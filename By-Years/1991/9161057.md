This is a SBIR Phase I effort. This work is to determine the feasibility of
developing remote voice interface which addresses the problem of handling users'
spontaneous correction of their own errors or of those made by a listener. In
this case the listener is a speech recognition system. The objectives include
building a linguist model for error correction using the taking of telephone
numbers as an example. Based on these results, vocabulary and grammar models for
error correction will be created, using existing tools, and integrated in their
Soliloquy voice interface software system and then an evaluation will be
performed. Applications include remote data entry, database inquiries, computer
control, call sorting and other environments.
