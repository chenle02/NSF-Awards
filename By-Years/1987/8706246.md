The San Diego Museum of Man has long had outstanding anthropological
collections. Two of their most important are the Oaxacan Indian costumes and the
Southwest Native American textile collection. The Oaxacan collection consists of
800 pieces collected from over 150 villages and the Southwest textile collection
contains representations of a wide variety of styles, weaves, and time periods
of objects made by Navajo, Rio Grande Pueblo, Hopi, and Rio Grande Spanish-
Americans. Both collections are well documented; they are irreplaceable,
represen- ting old traditions that are disappearing due to contact with Western
European and American cultures. The existing storage facilities for these
textiles is limited and detrimental to the textiles. Cabinetry is dated and does
not meet contemporary standards of collections management retard the deteriora-
tion of the collections due overcrowding, pollution, fumes from untreated wooden
shelving, dust, and fading due to light. The new equipment will insure the
safety of the collection and allow resear- chers greater access.
