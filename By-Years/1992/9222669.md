9222669 Ho This action is to instrument 0a permanent reinforced earth structure
or tried-back wall located in a seismic region of California. This geotechnical
structure utilizes inclusions (such as tie-backs, soil nails, reinforcing strips
and geotextiles) to provide stability. The purpose of the instrumentation is to
provide a means to collect data on the response to a future earthquake: the
response of these structures to seismic loading is unknown. The measured
response will be compared to the predicted performance, thereby providing the
necessary link between design and performance. Periodic maintenance of the
instrumentation and the retrieval of measured data will be coordinated between
the U.S. Geological Survey and Washington State University. ***
