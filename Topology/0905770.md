The PI will work with Behrstock to complete the quasi-isometric classification
of 3-manifold groups (or equivalently, the bi-Lipschitz classification of
universal covers of 3-manifolds), which has involved a large number of
researchers for over a decade. He will also use bi-Lipschitz geometry and knot-
theoretic tools in the search for more flexible approaches to classification
questions for complex surface singularities. For hyperbolic manifolds there are
postulated connections between geometric, representation-theoretic, and quantum
based invariants of manifolds, and the PI will work towards specific conjectures
relating these invariants. The PI will also continue his investigation of
commensurability properties of 3-manifolds.

This proposal addresses questions concerning 3-dimensional space forms that
arise from disparate areas of mathematics. These questions create interactions
of low dimensional topology with algebra, algebraic geometry, number theory, and
theoretical physics. Links between disparate areas provide much of the power of
mathematics, and strengthening these links increases the power. Specific tools
that will be used are the study of the geometry up to bounded distortion ("bi-
Lipschitz geometry") and the use of algebraic and number-theoretic invariants.
