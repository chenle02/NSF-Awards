This project is presenting a team of community college students, four-year
college students, and technical high school students with a real marine
engineering problem to be solved over the course of a one-semester elective
laboratory engineering course. The four-year college students are acting at the
project engineers; the community college students are acting as a commercial
laboratory testing facility; and the high school students are the engineering
technicians. The project being presented to the students involves the
development of an underwater marking applicator which can be operated by the
grappling arm of the submersible vessel ALVIN. When this vessel is on an
undersea geophysics mission, there is a need for making markings or attaching
tags to rocks of geophysical interest. Participation in a technical project of
this nature is providing the students with experiences that enhance their
technical knowledge and abilities. Institutions involved in this project are
Upper Cape Cod Regional Technical High School, Bristol Community College, and
the Massachusetts Maritime Academy in partnership with the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution.
