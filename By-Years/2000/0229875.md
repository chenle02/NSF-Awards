The Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI) will develop "Outdoors Indoors,
an Interactive Natural Science Exhibition for Young Children," ages 3-8, and
their families. Two 2,500 sq. ft. versions of the exhibition will be developed
-- one to be installed at OMSI and the other to travel. Building on children's
innate curiosity about the natural world, the exhibition invites visitors to
explore a woodland environment where they can develop process skills and learn
natural science concepts. The exhibition will also focus on ways that parents
can help encourage their children's science learning, both through exhibit
activities and through exploration of the natural world outdoors. Bilingual text
(English and Spanish) will help make the exhibition accessible to a diverse
audience. Ancillary materials for families and educators will further enhance
learning.
