9411842 Tittmann The Research Equipment Grant will make it possible for the
Engineering Science and Mechanics Department at Pennsylvania State University to
purchase Atomic Force Microscopy equipment which will be dedicated to the
formation of an Engineering Nano Characterization (ENC) Center to support
research and education in engineering. The equipment will be used for various
research projects including; characterization of thermo-mechanical damage in gas
turbine materials, in-situ evaluation of surface corrosion on A1 and Mg alloys,
optimization of surface engineering and coating technology, surface diagnostics
for nanofabrication of Micro Electro-Mechanical systems (MEMS) and
characterization of grain boundary microstructure in semi solid A1 alloys for
metal working. The ENC Center will be used by faculty and graduate students for
research and for laboratory education of both undergraduate and graduate
students in NDE and Failure Analysis Prevention courses. An estimated 30
students and 10 faculty per year will use the ENC Center Facilities. ***
