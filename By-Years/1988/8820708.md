Experimental evidence from both the atmosphere and the laboratory indicates
that the presence of solutes can suppress the spontaneous ice nucleation rate in
supercooled aqueous solution drops. We propose to study this phenomenon in the
laboratory under atmospheric conditions, with complementary field and
theoretical studies. The proposed laboratory measurements will be made in the
University of Missouri Cloud Simulation Facility, using methods previously
developed for ice nucleation studies in pure water drops. The solutes for the
study will be derived from the CCN used to form the liquid drops. These aerosols
will include both laboratory generated aerosols and those collected by aircraft
from atmosphere. Ice crystal collections will be used for growth habit studies
and air filter samples will be used for chemical analysis. Complementary aerosol
deliquescence studies at low temperature will be made so that theoretical models
can correctly treat the onset of the condensation process in a rising parcel of
air.//
