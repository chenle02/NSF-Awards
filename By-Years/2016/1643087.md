Proposal: 1643087&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: The 13th U.S. Korea Forum on
Nanotechnology: Brain Inspired Computing and Nano Biomimetics for Energy &amp;
Water Sustainability- Sept.26-27,2016, Seoul Korea&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: John
Myung&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Carnegie-Mellon
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshop Goal: To empower a common platform for
scientists and engineers from both countries to accommodate urgent technology
contribution brain-inspired computing and sustainable Water &amp; Energy (WE)
technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nontechnical:&lt;br/&gt;This Forum will
actively encourage partnerships in nanotechnology for novel computer
architecture and WE sustainability to have a huge impact in nanoscience, in
addition to strengthening achievements and assessing the progress on
recommendations made during the previous Forums. We also aim for exchanging
young scientists, including the graduate students. The Forum proceedings and
findings will be published on Carnegie Mellon website, and will be available to
a broad audience in addition Published as a special issue journal
publication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical:&lt;br/&gt;The novel contribution of
this Forum is its ability to bring together a bi-national community of expert
researchers and innovators who are working on the leading edge of brain-inspired
computing and nano-biomimetics for sustainable WE. The proposed forum will
simulate efforts to promote nanotechnology for the next generation by fully
utilizing nanotechnology convergence and biomimetric methods. The outcome will
lead to milestone for the timely technology. Along with the exchange of ideas
among the leading scientists and engineers in nanotechnology area, this Forum
will recommend timely new paradigms in this field for the next decade and
promote collaborative initiatives between the two countries. This Forum will
contribute to society, and the global environment and econo.
