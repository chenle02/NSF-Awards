This research will explore the basis for the subjective experiences associated
with memory, question answering, and evaluation. The research is guided by a
model in which such experiences depend on an inference about the ease with which
ideas come to mind. One set of experiments will investigate whether the
experience of remembering is based on the ease with which ideas come to mind
during recall attempts. The particular ideas that come to mind during recall
will be manipulated independently of the actual to- be-remembered events,
thereby creating memory illusions. Other experiments will investigate whether
the experience of confidence in answers to world knowledge questions and the
evaluation of the difficulty of questions is based on the ease with which
answers come to mind. Prior exposure to the right or wrong answers will make
those answers come to mind readily in response to the questions, thereby
creating illusions of knowing and underestimations of question difficulty. The
research will add to our understanding of the factors that create errors of
memory and judgment in a variety of domains, including education, eyewitness
testimony, and clinical memory disorders.
