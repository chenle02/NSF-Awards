This award will fund Undergraduate Design Projects to develop custom assist
devices for persons with disabilities. A group of students and the investigators
on the grant will work with health care personnel and patients at the
Rehabilitation Unit of the Medical College of Ohio on these projects. Six
projects per year will be executed and written reports on the completed projects
will be submitted for an annual publication. This type of undertaking is
important since not only will it provide meaningful projects for engineering
students to complete as part of their undergraduate design requirements, but it
will also benefit a population where customization is often needed for
rehabilitation devices.
