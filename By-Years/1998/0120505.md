This U.S.-Croatian research project between Martin Saunders of Yale University
and his partner, Olga Kronja of the University of Zagreb, examines the
biological pathways important in the formation of steroids and triterpenoids.
The researchers seek new fundamental knowledge about the physical organic
chemistry of carbocations, including protosteryl cation in animals and
dammarenyl cation in plants. These are to be investigated using both
experimental techniques and quantum chemical
calculations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The US-Croatian team intends to determine the
structural features specific for rearrangement of naturally occurring
carbocation in biosynthesis. To do so the researchers will investigate the
following groups of model carbocations and their parent alcohols or chlorides:
1) the tert-amyl cation, 2) the methylated and deuterated derivatives of
2-cyclopenyl-e-propyl cation and 3) the carbocation derivatives of
bicyclo[3.2.0]noname with various alkyl groups at C-1 and C-8. The research plan
includes: (a) NMR spectroscopic studies on stable solutions of model
carbocations and their isotopically labeled analogues in non-nucleophillic
solution, (b) quantum chemical calculations with the model cation and natural
cations themselves, and (c) analysis of the rearrangement processes of the model
compound in aqueous or nonpolar solvents. Results should yield new insight into
details of structure and rearrangements related to chemical behavior of the
carbocations involved in biosynthesis of steroids. If successful, this may have
implications for future medical research designed to synthesize artificial
hormones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project in organic dynamics of chemistry
fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling
leading experts in the United States and Central Europe to combine complementary
talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
