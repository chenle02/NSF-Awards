Thermodynamic and Kinematic aspects of the formation and transport of silicate
liquids in the Earth's deep interior are critically dependent on the equations
of state of both the liquid and solid components. The range of liquid silicate
compositions that have been studied at significantly high pressures is currently
too narrow to allow quantitative evaluation of petrologic theories without also
including many rather speculative assumptions. Additionally, the thermal part of
the liquid equations of state is almost completely unconstrained by existing
experimental data. The PI will conduct new molten silicate compression studies
using the new 80 mm shock wave facility at the University of Chicago. New target
designs and instrumentation strategies will be developed to achieve an order of
magnitude improvement in precision. These changes will eliminate subjective
aspects of the data analysis, and will greatly facilitate the determination of
the thermal part of the Hugoniot equation of state.
