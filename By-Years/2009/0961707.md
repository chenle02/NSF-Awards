This research project encompasses two distinct but closely related projects.
Both deal with statistics methods for estimating causal effects in settings with
binary treatments: units either receive one of two levels of a treatment, and
one is interested in the difference in average outcomes under these two levels
of the treatment. In many observational (non-randomized) studies, researchers
attempt to estimate causal effects by comparing outcomes for pairs of units, one
treated and one not treated, with identical similar values for observed pre-
treatment variables. The key assumption is that after eliminating differences in
outcomes due to differences in covariates, the remaining differences can be
attributed to the causal effect of the treatment. Implementing such matching
estimators can be difficult if there are many covariates. A seminal paper by
Rosenbaum and Rubin (Biometrika, 1984) shows that in settings with multiple
covariates matching on a scalar function of these covariates, the propensity
score, can eliminate all biases associated with differences in covariates. This
method has been widely applied. In settings where the propensity score is
unknown, however, the asymptotic distribution for the matching estimator has not
been derived. In fact, it has been shown that commonly used methods for
constructing confidence intervals based on resampling methods such as the
bootstrap are not valid. The researchers will develop statistical methods that
allow them to derive the asymptotic distribution for matching estimators where
the matching is on the estimated propensity score. They will develop and exploit
a new martingale representation for matching estimators, and show that this
sheds new light on their asymptotic distribution. The investigators will then
show how to use this representation to derive the asymptotic distribution for
the case of matching on the propensity score. Given the widespread use of this
matching method, these results will be useful
to&lt;br/&gt;practitioners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Matching
estimators are often used to evaluate the effectiveness of public interventions.
As a result, valid inferential tools for matching estimators are likely to have
substantial impact in empirical practice. This project will produce freely
available software to implement the proposed methods.
