The objective of Dr. Sajovic's project is to do preliminary experiments to
identify and study molecules involved in the general phenomenon of binding of
growth cones to target cells. In particular he hopes to be able to focus on
those growth cones that have specific high affinity GABA uptake systems. He will
use the calcium phosphate coprecipitate method of DNA-mediated gene transfer to
generate transfected cells expressing target cell proteins involved in the
binding of growth cones. These cells will be screened for the binding of
radiolabelled growth cones made by the fractionation of neonatal rat forebrain.
Membrane preparations from binding-positive transfectants will be used to
immunize guinea pigs. Monospecific reagents will be generated from polyclonal
antisera by absorption with naive (untransfected) L cell membranes, and the use
of a Lambda gtll cDNA expression library made from embryonic brain. In this
approach, each positive recombinant phage isolate that is selected from the
library with one serum is grown in bulk, and its fusion protein used to affinity
purify a monospecifc activity from that serum. At the same time he will generate
and characterize monclonal antibodies against proteins of the growth cone
proper. All of these reagents will be characterized as follows: ability to block
binding of growth cones to transfectants or other target cells; biochemical
specificity in immunoprecipitations and Western blots; and immunohistochemical
staining pattern. Each monospecific reagent will thus allow him to characterize
a particular protein involved in growth cone-target binding.
