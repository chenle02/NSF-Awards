9633719 Chen Theoretical studies will be made of the stability and dynamic
evolution of mesoscopic microstructures during phase transformations and
materials processing. The main objective is to develop a unified model which can
efficiently be employed to study not only the multi-domain structures with
competing short- and long-range interactions in a single crystal, but also the
multi-grain and multi- phase microstructures in ceramic materials of
technological interest. A continuum field approach is used and three specific
problems will be investigated: domain formation and dynamics in ferroelectric
oxides as a result of competing electrostatic energy, elastic energy and domain
wall energy; the formation of nanoscale ordered domains in relaxor
ferroelectrics; and, the kinetics of microstructural evolution in multi-grain
materials driven by the reduction in the total interfacial energy. %%% This
grant studies an important fundamental problem in materials research which has
critical technological implications. Namely, analytical and numerical methods
will be used to study and understand the evolution of microstructure in
materials as they go through changes in phase. This is an extremely difficult
fundamental problem which directly impacts materials processing. The particular
systems to be studied are ceramic materials in which control of the
microstructure has direct bearing on material proerties. Of special interest in
this research will be ferroelectric materials which have applications as sensors
and optical components. ***
