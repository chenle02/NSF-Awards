The proposed research involves exploration of the feasibility of developing a
methodology for considering the potential organizational impact of the technical
design decisions made in implementing automated manufacturing systems. First, a
generalizable typology of critical design decisions will be developed. Then,
categories of design decisions that are likely to cause organizational changes
will be identified and the range of design options will be examined. Finally, a
matrix of typology of technical options vs. organizational impacts will be
developed, to identify which types of options are critical in terms of their
impact on the organization. The study will examine the technical design process
of a robot line in a machine shop at Xerox Corp., Apple Corporation's automated
insertion machines, and John Deere's FMS cells. From these three very different
types of automation design, a set of generalizable results are expected to be
drawn.
