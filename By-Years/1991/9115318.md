Complex analysis has developed vigorously in this century. In particular, there
has been great progress in the theory of functions of several complex variables;
this progress has come about as a result of efforts made in many other important
areas of mathematics. Three areas in particular have had a profound influence on
the development of several complex variables. These are the methods of partial
differential equations, the methods of complex differential geometry, and the
methods of algebraic geometry. This conference will focus on stimulating more
interaction among the diverse branches of the subject and emphasizing ideas
common to all the above areas. This project will support a one-week Conference
on Several Complex Variables to be held at Princeton University from March
16-20, 1992. This conference will be held in honor of R. C. Gunning and J. J.
Kohn. In addition to the ten principal speakers who will give hour long
addresses, there will be opportunities for shorter talks and more informal
discussions. A refereed proceedings of the conference is being planned for
publication.
