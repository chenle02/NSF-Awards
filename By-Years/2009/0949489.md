Complex organisms such as animals and plants are made up of many different types
of cells. Different types of cells organize together to form organs (like the
heart or kidney), where the cells must work together to function. The genes and
molecules that cells use to coordinate their development and make these complex
structures are not well understood. This project uses a simple, microscopic
animal (the worm, C. elegans) to identify genes important for organ development,
and to study how these genes work during organ formation. The research findings
will identify how the complexity of multicellular organisms is achieved. They
will also decode the DNA sequence information that results in a gene turning
'on' in certain cells, or 'off' in others. Because of the simple research
organism and the straightforward experimental methods, the research project is
integrated into a training program for future research scientists and
innovators. Undergraduate research teams will learn current techniques in
molecular and cellular biology, participate in experimental design and
discovery, practice scientific communication skills, and develop team-building
and leadership abilities, as they complete the research objectives.
