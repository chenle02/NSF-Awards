Massachusetts Institute of Technology requests support from NSF for connection
of Worcester Foundation of Experimental Biology, Simmons College, Bentley
College, Babson College, Wheaton College, and Roger Williams College to the New
England Academic Research Network (NEARnet) which is the NSF mid-level network
that serves the New England area. A primary goal of NEARnet is to facilitate
collaborative projects and sharing of resources between institution, including
those outside the state. NEARnet will provide operations management and
information services and it will give the six universities a connection to the
NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone
network. The each of the universities has written a description of its
organization and a statement of the benefits of Internet access that it expects
including: greater functionality and network speed to be able to access
supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being able to
implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty research will
benefit from the links. This is also a unique opportunity for the schools to
explore innovative educational resources. Their diversity will expose NEARnet to
a broader range of user requirements. Nearnet will use the information obtained
by serving this diverse group for the benefit of New England's academic and
research community.***//
