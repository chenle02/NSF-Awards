This three year project is development of professional materials for teachers
of mathematics. Building on experience in an earlier teacher enhancement project
that focused on mathematical communication as a support to learning, this effort
will develop and pilot a long-term teacher enhancement model for the improvement
of mathematics education for elementary school teachers. In particular, they
will develop, implement, and pilot a package of print and video materials for
professional development, to be used by "explorer" teachers in small inservice
group settings. Teachers who have been working with the PIs in a previous
related project will be involved in the development; the materials will be pilot
tested with teachers in Boston and Chelsea public schools. Cost sharing is
provided by school districts and TERC as 19% of the NSF award.
