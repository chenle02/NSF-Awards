9311305 HARRIS This research tests the theory that exclusive water use rights
prevent sustainable resource use. The project examines the socioeconomic and
hydrological consequences of a water law enacted in 1990 to promote sustainable
groundwater use on Gran Canaria, Canary Islands, Spain. The research will
investigate whether the water law is accomplishing its purpose, or whether it
instead is inadvertently preventing sustainable groundwater use by protecting
exclusive rights while imposing monitoring costs and encouraging institutional
links between water users' associations. The investigator will collect interview
and archival data from two towns with different ecological, hydrological, and
social contexts. The research will make an important contribution to scientific
knowledge about the impact of water use laws on social behavior and therefore on
the capacity of such a law to bring about a desired result. ***
