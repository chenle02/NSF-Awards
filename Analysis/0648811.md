The Fields Institute will mount an intensive program on New Trends in Harmonic
Analysis during the period January 2008 through June 2008. A large number of
researchers and postdoctoral fellows will be in residence at the Institute
during this period, and more will visit during the program's three workshops. A
significant number of postdoctoral fellows will visit the Institute for the
entire program. The Fields Institute will fund the program and support it
logistically. This application uses funding from the NSF to bring US
mathematicians to this program and support them while they are there. The funds
will be used principally to support mathematicians, especially junior
mathematicians, who do not have other sources of support.
