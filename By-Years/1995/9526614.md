9526614 Kent The PIs propose to test the fundamental configuration of Pangea in
the late Triassic by obtaining a sequence of paleomagnetic pole positions
registered to a magnetic polarity stratigraphy from the thick Triassic section
in the Argana rift basin of Morocco. These data will be compared to the
cyclostratigraphically calibrated sequence of geomagnetic reversals and
paleopoles that they have recently obtained for about 30 my of the Late Triassic
and earliest Jurassic from scientific drilling in the Newark rift basin of
eastern North America and the two sets of data will be used to discriminate
between the main classes of Pangea models. ***
