This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
is in the area of organometallic chemistry. The goals of the project are to
provide additional direct experimental evidence for the recently discovered
transition metal complexes of the trihydrogen cation, to establish the
structures of these complexes, and to synthesize additional examples of such
complexes. Structural information will be obtained by a combination of solution
and solid state NMR spectroscopy, variable temperature IR spectroscopy, and
X-ray and neutron diffraction. The results of this project will be relevant to
industrially important hydrogenation reactions and will provide new challenges
to theoreticians who are concerned with chemical bonding.
