The Carnegie Institute of Washington is awarded a grant to develop an existing
model organism database into a resource for comparative plant genomics. The
Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) provides online access to genomic data
for the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana to over 35,000 plant biology
researchers worldwide each month. Data housed in this resource include
Arabidopsis gene structure and function data gathered from the extensive
research literature for this plant which can be applied to better understand the
genetic basis for traits in other plants, including food, feed and bioenergy
crop species as well as ecologically important plant species. To promote such
understanding and make the transfer of knowledge from Arabidopsis to other plant
species more efficient, the project will modify the existing database and
website to store and display genomic data from other plants and provide tools to
compare genome maps, nucleotide and protein sequences, and orthologous genes
from other plant genomes. The proposed work will also expand a pilot project in
which academic journals partner with TAIR to efficiently incorporate newly
discovered gene function data into the database, increasing the availability and
impact of the new results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding basic plant
biology is essential to meeting current and future worldwide food and energy
needs. TAIR serves as a foundational component of the plant biology research and
education infrastructure, providing access to fundamental plant biology datasets
and tools for students and researchers at institutions of all types and sizes
across the United States and around the globe. An email-based help desk handles
over a thousand questions per year ranging from requests for basic plant biology
facts by high school students and undergraduates to requests for highly
specialized custom datasets from graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. An
extensive outreach program includes conference workshops, tutorials and online
help. TAIR can be accessed at http://arabidopsis.org.
