This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
program. It is a study of world primary commodity markets, seeking to develop a
comprehensive framework for analysis of their operation based on examination of
the evolution of the world coffee market. Data will be used to evaluate and
integrate three alternative modes of analysis: bargaining power theory,
commodity agreement theory, and political negotiation theory. The research will
not only contribute to historical sociology and economic sociology, but it will
augment the knowledge base for understanding relations between advanced
industrial nations and the Third World nations which are dependent upon
commodity exports. In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the
research, this award will materially assist a highly promising student in
completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation. Thus it contributes to future
scientific manpower and the thorough training of the next generation of
sociologists.
