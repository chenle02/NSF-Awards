SRS 9616859 Vonortas This research project aims to develop a database on
European research joint ventures (RJVs) and conduct empirical analysis on issues
such as the incentives of firms to form RJVs, the impact of RJVs on the overall
expenditures and profitability of member firms. RJVs are one of the arrangements
whereby firms join forces to undertake research and development of common
interest. These arrangements have become increasingly common and important for
the competitive strategies of firms in high technology industries. This database
will be complementary and comparable to a database currently in progress on U.
S. firms and will enable analysis of possible differences between U. S-based
research joint ventures and those that are European based. This database also
will provide additional opportunity to empirically test theoretical economics
and business literature on RJVs. ***
