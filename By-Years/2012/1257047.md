Cellulose microfibrils provide strength to plant cell walls, as well as to the
numerous commercial products made from wood and other plant fibers. Whereas
cellulose provides desirable strength and durability in many applications, the
biofuel industry would benefit from a supply of cellulose that is more
susceptible to enzymatic or chemical breakdown. The structure and physical
properties of cellulose microfibrils arise through the biosynthetic process and
thus can potentially be modified. Cellulose is synthesized by membrane complexes
(CSCs) that, in seed plants, consist of 24-36 cellulose synthase subunits of
three different types arranged in a rosette shape. Comparative studies of algae
and plants have demonstrated a relationship between CSC shape and cellulose
microfibril structure. However, the factors that determine CSC shape are
unknown. The CSCs of the model moss species, Physcomitrella patens, have a
rosette shape like those of vascular plants, but they differ from seed plant
CSCs in subunit composition. The investigators will use biochemical, genetic and
molecular approaches to determine the subunit composition of the Physcomitrella
patens CSCs and test specific hypotheses pertaining to their evolutionary
origin. By clarifying the evolutionary history of cellulose synthase, the
results of this investigation will guide efforts to determine the contributions
of each of the distinct cellulose synthase types to the assembly and function of
seed plant CSCs. The broader impacts of this project include training of
graduate and undergraduate students, including those from underrepresented
groups; development of learning modules for middle and high school students
focusing on analysis and interpretation of data generated by graduate and
undergraduate students; and generation of fundamental knowledge about the
mechanism of cellulose biosynthesis that may contribute to efforts to
genetically manipulate cellulose biosynthesis in commercial plants.
