8903484 Baker The principal investigator will study the limit at high Reynolds
number of shear layers in incompressible fluid using three different methods--
vortex methods, spectral methods, and finite difference methods. Classically,
the limit is thought to be a vortex sheet, but recent studies suggest that
vortex sheets develop curvature singularities in finite time, and that at the
time of singularity formation, the vortex sheet changes from a weak solution to
a measure-valued solution of Euler equations. Moreover, different
regularizations may lead to different results, making the nature of the limit of
vanishing viscosity a central concern. The different numerical methods are
considered in order to obtain a direct check on the accuracy of the results, to
make a direct comparison of the performance of these methods on shear flows and
to identify areas for improvement in each method. Results of the numerical
calculations will be used to study how viscous effects modify the tendency for
vortex sheets to develop curvature singularities. Numerical results will also be
used to help answer the open mathematical question: do different regularizations
of the Euler equations converge to different limits as the regularization
vanishes?
