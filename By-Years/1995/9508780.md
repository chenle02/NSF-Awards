9508780 Hacke This award supports a 24-month Science and Technology Agency of
Japan Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Peter Hacke of the Electrotechnical
Laboratory of the Agency of Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) within the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) in Tsukuba, Japan. Dr. Hacke
will work with Dr. Hideyo Okushi at the Electrotechnical Laboratory examining
the physics of the gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductor. The proposed research
aims to determine the nature of the impurities and defects in GaN that create
carrier traps in the band gap that can reduce device performance. Specifically,
the investigators would like to determine the cause of the deep donor levels
known to exist in n-type GaN and examine for the existence of deeper levels. As
a postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Hacke will have the opportunity to become familiar
with research techniques and equipment at the Electrotechnical Laboratory while
contributing to the overall research effort. Therefore, this proposal fulfills
the objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific
knowledge through an international collaboration. ***
