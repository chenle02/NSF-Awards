PowerWorld Corp. will develop a new software package to help the electric power
industry understand the issues involved in market power, the ability to raise
rates profitable over a period of time. This is a key issues in the deregulation
of the utility industry, which will result in an unbundling of the traditionally
vertically integrated untilities, into relatively independent entities. The
software package developed will contain effective visualisation techniques
designed to facilitate the comprehension of market power issues by those who do
not have a background in electrical power engineering, and will be based on a
user-friendly and highly interactive simulation package developed by researchers
at the Univ. of Illinois Power and Energy Systems Group under the direction of
Prof. T. Overbye.
