This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "Random
Physical Systems" held in Puerto Natales, Chile, on December 11-15, 2018. The
meeting, part of the 2018 Mathematical Physics Month in Chile, is organized
under the auspices of the Pontificia Universidad Catolica (PUC) de Chile and the
Universidad de Magallanes. The conference focuses on recent developments in
analysis, especially in the fields of mathematical physics and probability. This
award gives US-based students, early-career researchers, members of
underrepresented groups, and researchers without other sources of support an
opportunity to attend and participate in the
conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The international conference "Random Physical
Systems" will gather researchers in probability and mathematical physics to
discuss topics of current research regarding random physical systems. The topics
covered include random disordered systems, universality, the multi/many-particle
Anderson model, random processes, statistical mechanics, and interacting
particle systems. A main goal of the conference is to expose graduate students
and postdoctoral associates to the latest research on random physical systems.
The meeting will include four mini-courses in addition to research talks on a
broad range of topics, allowing young researchers to learn about current
activity and to meet other mathematicians working in random physical systems.
