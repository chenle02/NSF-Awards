This project is establishing a Center to address pressing needs in the
undergraduate program at different curricular levels. As a result, General
Biology for majors now addresses entry-level molecular biology concepts in their
laboratory. Molecular biology technologies are also being added to core courses
such as cell biology, genetics, and immunology. The Biotechnology Center
provides a well-equipped and centralized laboratory that is shared by students
in several courses. The Biotechnology Center is also a valuable resource for
undergraduate students pursuing independent research projects. Finally, the
Center enhances the department's teacher training program by providing a nucleus
for summer courses in biotechnology for pre-service and high school teachers.
