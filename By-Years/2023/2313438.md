With the support of the Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) program in the
Division of Chemistry, Professor Kate Carroll from the University of Florida
will investigate post-translational protein cysteine modifications. Cysteine
plays essential roles in protecting the cell from oxidative damage through its
thiol functional group. The importance of thiol modifications has been
recognized by chemists and biologists alike, however, their impact on the
chemical reactivity of sulfur has not been systematically studied until now.
Through synthesis and physical-organic characterization, Dr. Carrollâ€™s research
explores how different cysteinyl thiol group modifications endow the sulfur atom
with distinct chemical properties. This research will allow graduate students to
gain specialized training in organosulfur chemistry and effective protein
bioconjugation strategies. This project will also be integrated into an outreach
program to introduce high school and undergraduate students to the science of
bioorthogonal reactions.

This research project seeks to expand the fundamental science of electrophilic
sulfur chemistry. The reactivity of electrophilic sulfur species are being
investigated by kinetic and thermodynamic evaluation of models using time-
resolved nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry
(MS). Reactivity is to be studied by generating small molecule models using
advanced methods and new reactions in organosulfur chemistry. A range of post-
translational thiol modifications identified as central to reversible redox
regulation in biology are being targeted for study. The sulfur-based
functionalities to be studied include cyclic sulfenamides, polarized disulfides,
and S-sulfonates. Information gleaned from these studies is expected to provide
both mechanistic guidance and new research tools in support of the investigation
of protein cysteine oxidation-reduction chemistry in biology, particularly in
dynamic redox environments.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
