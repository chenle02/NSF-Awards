The International Conference on Biomolecular Engineering Asia 2018 (ICBE Asia
2018) is sponsored by the American Institute of Chemical Engineering. It will be
held in Singapore on January 8-10, 2018.   This international conference will
bring together biologists, chemists, and engineers to discuss ways in which
their disciplines can collaborate to find novel solutions to problems that are
limiting the development of new technologies and therapies. The meeting
addresses the mission of NSF, which has been increasingly committed to
integrating the engineering sciences with the life sciences, encouraging
research and development in multidisciplinary areas, educating the next
generation of young scientists, aiding translational medicine and supporting
cutting edge science to answer current and future challenges as well as making
sure US-based scientists interact internationally. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topics
will focus on development of foundational technologies for biomolecular
engineering across length. There will be three conference topics, presented in a
single-track format. Foundational Technologies for Biomolecular Engineering will
focus on new tools and platforms developed to enable engineering of molecules,
cells, and multi-cellular entities. Biomolecular Programming - from DNA to
Community will present programming approaches that can be applied to a single
length scale or across multiple length scales, including bioprocess engineering,
microbiome programming, and molecular networks. Translational Biomolecular
Engineering will showcase applications ranging from the production of high value
chemicals, to cellular immunotherapies, to catalytic protein materials. The
peer-reviewed conference proceedings will be published in a special issue of
Biotechnology Progress, a joint publication of the ACS and AIChE.
