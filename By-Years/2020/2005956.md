Innovation has been examined from multiple perspectives nevertheless; the impact
of process and product innovation on firm performance is mixed. To better
estimate the relationship between R&amp;D investment and firm performance, this
project will consider new data that allows for a clear distinction between
different forms of R&amp;D investment, product vs. process innovation and firm
performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Center for Science and
Engineering Statistics (NCSES) Business Research and Development Survey (BRDIS)
data provide rich data firm level to examine the effect of R&amp;D investment on
firm product innovation and process innovation, through the Census Bureau Census
Data Center. This exploratory work will begin to examine the data series that
begins in 2011. &lt;br/&gt;
