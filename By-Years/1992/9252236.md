This project develops an expert system data acquisition and analysis program for
teaching one-dimensional consolidation testing and triaxial shear testing in the
undergraduate soil mechanics laboratory. These tests are used to predict the
amount of settlement that foundations will undergo and the factor of safety
against foundation collapse. Expert systems are powerful tools with many
engineering applications. The programs allow students to answer their own
questions by using a mouse and clicking on the screen area hot spots to display
and analyze a problem. One of the objectives of the project is give
undergraduates early exposure to this tool so that they may develop their own
applications once they are part of the workforce. This project connects data
acquisition and computer equipment to existing laboratory equipment. The
equipment enables digital loads and displacements to be recorded and analyzed
using the expert systems program. The expert systems program uses color screens
that depict sketches and equations relevant to the topics of consolidation and
triaxial shear to assist students in learning these specific topics.
