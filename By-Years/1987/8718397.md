Professor Meierding's research on marble weathering promises to provide
important data on the chronology and extent of air pollution in cities in the
northeastern United States over the last century. Meierding will measure
weathering on large numbers of Vermont marble monuments in cities throughout
eastern North America. Weathering attributable to sulphur dioxide will be
estimated by comparing weathering rates among cities known to have had high
sulphur dioxide concentrations with weathering rates in cities where sulphur
dioxide has been low. Measurements will be adjusted as appropriate for local
conditions and pollution sources. Detailed measurement and mapping of marble
deterioration will yield important data on the locational and temporal incidence
of air pollution, including acid rain, and on the effects of such pollutants.
The results of this research will provide baseline data for studies of the
causes of long-term change in the atmospheric environment of the northeastern
United States.
