A major objective of the Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference is to
bring together every two years leading members of the scientific community,
graduate students, and post docs to discuss new, cutting-edge research projects
in marine chemistry within an informal setting. In 2011, the Chemical
Oceanography Gordon Research Conference will be held August 14-19, 2011 at
Proctor Academy in New Hampshire. The theme for this year's conference will be
"Linking the Time and Space Scales of Chemical Oceanography" and will emphasize
the need to comprehend the response of the ocean to anthropogenic forcing within
the context of a mechanic understanding of the underlying processes and an
historical perspective for how the processes have changed over time. The primary
goal of the conference is to provide a forum that brings together scientists
that are leading contributors in the field of marine chemistry and graduate
students/postdocs to exchange ideas on new, innovative research. Presentations
and discussions at the 2011 Gordon Conference will center around the following
session topics: (1) The Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill: A Status Report; (2) The
Marine Phosphorus Cycle: Past, Present and Future; (3) New Insights Into the
Marine Nitrogen Cycle; (4) Chemical Oceanography in Deep Time; (5) Glacial-
Interglacial Changes in Ocean Chemistry; (6) Trace Element Cycling in the
Oceans: Biotic Influences and Responses; (7) Submarine Groundwater Discharge;
(8) Carbon Processing in the Coastal Ocean; and (9) Benthic Biogeochemical
Processes Across Space and Time. The Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research
Conference has become recognized as an important venue to exchange ideas in the
interdisciplinary field of marine chemistry and to forge new scientific
alliances. For this reason, the National Science Foundation, along with the
Gordon Research Conference, will co-sponsor the participation of at least 17
graduate student/post docs and 33 invited speakers/discussion leaders/chairs in
the 2011 Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference.
