This award is towards support of a two-day symposium to celebrate the
contributions of George Philander. The following five key questions will be
addressed at the meeting: (i) What is the relative importance of the
thermohaline and wind-driven components of the oceanic circulation to the
Earth's climate? (ii) Do conditions in polar regions determine conditions in the
tropics, or vice versa? (iii) How can records of recurrent Ice Ages be used to
develop testable hypotheses for climate models? (iv) What tests can records of
recurrent Ice Age provide for climate models? (v) Why is global warming so
polarizing? A key goal of the symposium is to engage a younger generation of
scientists in scientific discussion that crosses disciplinary boundaries. NSF
funding will cover participant travel costs including support for young
scientists to attend the symposium.
