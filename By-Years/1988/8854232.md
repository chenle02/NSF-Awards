Economics faculty are participating in one week workshops to learn instructional
techniques that utilize laboratory experiments by undergraduate students who are
enrolled in principles of economics and intermediate theory classes. These
techniques demonstrate to students the basis and applicability of economic
theory and provide valuable feedback to instructors on student perceptions of
theory. The students are not asked to accept hypotheses about markets, but
rather to test hypotheses. The experiments demonstrate to students the validity
of the hypotheses and the conditions under which they can predict economic
behavior. Utilizing computer facilities at the Economic Science Laboratory at
the university, the faculty are participating in established experiments and
learn the techniques for designing experiments for undergraduate instruction.
The workshops are adding a new dimension to instruction and improving the
teaching and understanding of undergraduate economics.
