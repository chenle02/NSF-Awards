The post-peak response of soils governs the behavior of soil masses subjected
to moderate to high levels of strain; this occurs during earthquake-induced flow
failures, such as slope instabilities or bearing capacity failure. Examples of
earthquake-induced flow failures are the failure of the Lower San Fernando dam
in 1971, failure of tailings dams in Chile in 1965 and 1985, and the bearing
capacity failures in Niigata, Japan, in 1964. The objective of this research
program is to provide experimental evidence of the nature of the post-peak
response of soils and to cast these results into a manageable theoretical
framework. The concept of an undrained steady- state strength as a limiting
shearing resistance for a soil undergoing steady-state deformations provides a
framework for evaluating liquefaction and flow slide potential. It is imperative
that uniform strains develop in laboratory tests used to define this
relationship; thus the uniformity of deformation is being examined
experimentally by shearing specimens of saturated sands in both servo-
controlled, heavily-instrumented plane strain compression and a standard
triaxial device.
