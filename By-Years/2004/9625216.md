9625216 Povirk The goals of this CAREER development award are to gain a
fundamental understanding of the factors that control film integrity and to
identify materials and processes that lead to reliable and durable
metallizations. The proposed research on thin films and interfacial fracture is
timely and exciting and there is a good balance of the experimental and the
theoretical work proposed. The educational plan shows a strong commitment to
teaching and outreach activities and leadership potential in these areas is
clearly evident. ***
