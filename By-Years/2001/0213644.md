It is proposed to purchase a rheometer for the purpose of research and research
training in the dynamics of non-Newtonian fluids. More specifically, research
will be performed on polymer melts, multiphase systems, and biomedical
materials. This equipment will be used by six faculty members in Chemical
Engineering and Mechanical Engineering Departments of CUNY City College, and one
faculty member of Columbia University.
