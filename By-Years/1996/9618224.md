9618224 Forsythe Numerical modeling of self-consistent two-dimensional
treatments of solid mantle flow coupled with magma flow beneath mid-ocean ridges
will be undertaken in order to put constraints on the flow processes occurring
at this tectonic setting. Specifically, a model that incorporates chemical
heterogeneity in the mantle will be integrated into the flow model in an effort
to understand the complex geochemical signature of incompatible elements in mid-
ocean ridge basalts. The ability of the models to qualitatively explain the
composition of mid-ocean ridge basalts from diverse areas will be tested and the
results incorporated into geophysical models interactively. This project
represents a fully integrated, collaborative effort designed to produce a
theoretical model of mantle flow and melt production beneath mid-ocean ridges
that reconciles the diverse constraints of major and trace-element and isotopic
composition of mid-ocean ridge basalts with seismological and geophysical
observations.
