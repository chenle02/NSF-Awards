The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve
the literacy of blind people by enabling improved access to digital content.
Currently blind people rely heavily on text-to-speech software and audiobooks to
digest digital context. However, listening does not delivery the same sense of
immediacy and literacy as reading braille. Also, audio technology and single
line displays cannot deliver spatial information, e.g. mathematical equations,
diagrams, and graphs, which are critical to literacy in science, technology, and
math-related subjects. Commercial electronic tactile displays exist, but due to
the complexity and cost of the underlying technology, the devices are
prohibitively expensive and are limited to a single line of braille. An
affordable full-page tactile display delivering multiple lines of braille and
tactile graphics would significantly improve blind people's access to digital
technology. New technology can improve literacy rates, education outcomes and
overall lifestyle of blind people. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The I-Corps project
will assess the commercial viability of using a patented microfluidic technology
for developing a full-page tactile display. Based on the technology, a
microfluidic chip can reduce the complexity and cost of controlling a large
number of densely-packed pneumatic actuators. A large array of thousands of
individually controllable features is possible. The pneumatic actuators are
integrated directly into the microfluidic chip using large-scale integration,
making the device low-cost and highly scalable. Pressure-based actuation ensures
that even tightly placed features will maintain relatively high force outputs.
These are all essential features for building dense-array tactile displays,
particularly ones that are low-cost and suitable for rendering braille and
tactile graphics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
