Researchers have identified molecular genetic techniques to identify cryptic
lineages of invasive aquatic plants - lineages that cannot be easily
distinguished using traditional visual identification. These lineages frequently
differ in traits that are relevant to their management, such as how they respond
to herbicides. In particular, some lineages are herbicide resistant, which is an
important emerging issue in aquatic ecosystem management.

A major challenge for the successful and economically efficient management of
invasive aquatic plant species is the ability to accurately determine which
lineage(s) are present in a lake or pond before prescribing a specific
management activity. For example, it is critical to distinguish invasive
lineages from native species because native species are not typically permitted
for management activities. Similarly, it is desirable to predict response to
herbicides before they are applied, as herbicide failures have adverse economic
and environmental effects. Thus, there is immediate need to translate basic
research into commercial risk assessment tools that will provide knowledge-based
management strategies for individual lakes.
