In multiscale modeling hierarchy, the Boltzmann and related kinetic equations
serve as a building block that bridges atomistic and continuum models. These
equations describe the non-equilibrium dynamics of a gas or system comprised of
a large number of particles in random motion and constantly colliding with each
other, and have found applications in various fields such as rarefied gas/plasma
dynamics, radiative transfer, semiconductor modeling, etc. The prominent
challenges associated with numerically approximating the Boltzmann-like
equations are the expense of evaluating the collision term - a high-dimensional,
nonlinear, nonlocal integral operator. Fast algorithms developed in this project
will greatly advance the state-of-the-art simulation of collisional kinetic
equations, and will enable scientists and engineers to effectively handle more
complex systems that have previously not been feasible, due to the enormous
expense of evaluating the collision term.

The new algorithms will be based on spectral approximation which stands out for
its superior accuracy among the available Boltzmann solvers. To reduce the huge
computational cost of conventional spectral methods, the main idea is to exploit
and leverage the convolutional and low-rank structure in the collision integral.
Four specific aims will be addressed: 1) fast algorithms for the Boltzmann
collision operator with general collision kernel that will allow efficient
simulation of particle interactions beyond hard sphere model; 2) fast algorithms
for the multi-species Boltzmann equation, which would be invaluable for
describing gaseous mixtures; 3)fast algorithms for the inelastic Boltzmann
equation, which have immediate application in modeling granular materials; 4) a
fast deterministic solver for the Schrodinger-quantum Boltzmann system modeling
the kinetics of Bose-Einstein condensate at finite temperature.
