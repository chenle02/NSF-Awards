The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Division of Chemistry
supports Professors Manabu Shiraiwa and Sergey Nizkorodov for studies of biomass
burning aerosols. Biomass burning is an important source of atmospheric
particulate matter in the era of global climate change, as the frequency and
intensity of wildfires have been increasing. Biomass burning organic aerosol
(BBOA) particles contain various redox-active compounds, which can trigger the
formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that play a central role in chemical
transformation of organic compounds in the atmosphere. For better assessment of
BBOA influence on air quality and climate, a molecular-level and mechanistic
understanding of ROS multiphase chemistry and photochemistry by BBOA particles
is needed. Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in this
research. Minority junior high school students will be hosted with a seminar on
biomass burning aerosols and hands-on experiments to stimulate their interests
on environmental chemical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims at
elucidating chemical mechanism and kinetics of ROS formation from redox-active
components in BBOA particles. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy will
be applied to quantify the formation of ROS in BBOA surrogate mixtures and BBOA
generated by pyrolysis and smoldering combustion of biomass samples. Chemical
composition of BBOA particles will be characterized using an ultra-high-
performance liquid chromatograph coupled to a high-resolution mass spectrometer.
Impacts of photochemical aging on formation of ROS will be assessed to advance
mechanistic understanding of BBOA aging processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
