In this award, supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Prof. Sandra Greer of the University of Maryland, College
Park will conduct research studying complex nanostructures and phase transitions
in aqueous polymer solutions. The samples will be studied with viscometry, size-
exclusion chromatography, small-angle neutron scattering and dynamic light-
scattering techniques. The ultimate goal of the research is to develop a deeper
understanding of the underlying mechanisms for the behaviors of aqueous polymer
systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately, the research may result in useful
ways of improving the control of polymer molecular weight, as well as having
eventual applications in nanotechnology and biomimetic systems. The proposed
research will be carried out by undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral
researchers, working with Prof. Greer.&lt;br/&gt;
