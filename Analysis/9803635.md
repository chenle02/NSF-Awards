For a broad class of families of 2-dimensional dissipative diffeomorphisms,
sufficient conditions for the existence of attractors carrying Sinai-Ruelle-
Bowen measures will be investigated. The study of ergodic properties of these
measures and of geometric structure of the respective attractors is proposed.
The project is based on joint research with S. Newhouse. One of the main tools
is the new technique of distortion estimates for two-dimensional maps with
unbounded derivatives. The basic example is a family of piecewise smooth
transformations defined on a finite number of rectangles which are all mapped
hyperbolically except for one, which is mapped parabolically. No underlying one-
dimensional maps are assumed. The technique is based on a system of initial
conditions, which can be numerically checked, such as expansion, contraction,
initial distortions and dependence of these quantities on the parameters and can
be applied to a variety of models. This project involves the investigation of
the phenomenon of random oscillations in deterministic systems. This type of
oscillation arises in a variety of mathematical models in physics, chemistry,
and biology. The behavior of such systems depends on exterior parameters. For
some parameters, systems exhibit stationary or periodic solutions. However for
other parameters, the same systems behave randomly. More precisely, random
solutions may appear with higher probability than periodic ones. The goal of
this work is to give strict mathematical conditions which imply random behavior.
Sufficient conditions can be checked numerically, which provides straightforward
applications to the real systems.
