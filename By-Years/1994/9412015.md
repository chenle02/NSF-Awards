94120215 Lau A Fourier Transform Spectrometer(FTS) will be purchased which will
be dedicated to support research in compound semiconductor materials and
devices. The spectrometer will be used for several research projects, including
in particular: (1) THz semiconductor sources, (2) Two-dimensional electron gas
hot-electron mixers and detectors for the FIR region (3) Tensile-strained
semiconductor quantum-well lasers, (4) Superlattice-based Solar cells, (5)
Complex Permittivity and integrated waveguide applications of semiconductor
superlattices, (6) Unipolar Avalanche Multiplication in III-V semiconductor
quantum wells, (7) Impurity identification of OMVPE grown high-purity III-V
semiconductors. All of the above on-going research will greatly benefit from the
acquisition of the FTS, which will be specified to cover a spectral range
extended to the far-infrared. ***
