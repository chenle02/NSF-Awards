Toxic dinoflagellates bloom sporadically in coastal waters throughout the
world, often causing outbreaks of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP). The
recurrent economic and public health impacts of these blooms range from human
illness and death to extensive quarantine of shellfish resources. Although the
chemical structure and pharmacological activity of the PSP toxins are well
understood, their metabolic role within the dinoflagellate remains unknown, as
are the factors that cause variability in toxicity between isolates from
different regions or in one isolate under different growth conditions. Within
the context of a regional population of Alexandrium (formerly Gonyanulax)
species, Dr. Anderson will continue investigations in four general research
areas. Specifically, he will examine: a) the dynamics of toxin production with
major emphasis on the link we are now hypothesizing between toxin production and
the dinoflagellate cell cycle; b) the physiology of toxin production, through
studies on the causes and effects of elevated free arginine concentrations in
the cell and identification of proteins involved in toxin synthesis; c) toxin
localization and function through immunocytochemical studies at the
ultrastructural level and efforts to purify and characterize a saxitoxin-binding
complex from the dinoflagellate nucleus; and d) population comparisons through
mating studies and development of molecular methods to discriminate between
closely-related isolates of Alexandrium.
