This award supports the conduct of an National Science Foundation Faculty Early
Career Development (CAREER) Program Proposal Writing Workshop. The workshop will
be held in St. Louis, Missouri, on March 21 and 22, 2016. It is expected that
there will be about 200 attendees. The workshop will have a one-and-a-half-day
format including a training session on good proposal writing practices, talks by
previous CAREER awardees, a mock CAREER proposal panel review, and a review
session during which the attendees will have a chance to obtain reviews on
project summaries of their own draft CAREER proposals. The attendees will also
have an opportunity to interact with NSF Program Directors both one-on-one and
in mock panels.

This workshop will help to prepare young faculty for careers in education by
giving them tools and skills of good proposal writing and by preparing them to
write and submit better CAREER proposals. The results of the workshop include
training for young faculty, better opportunity for young faculty with an
emphasis on women and minority faculty, higher award success rates for the
attendees, and ultimately better research resulting from better written
proposals.
