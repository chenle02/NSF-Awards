The purpose of this project is to establish a laboratory in physiological
psychology. This laboratory will provide upper- level undergraduates with the
opportunity to learn first-hand the methods that enable researchers to bridge
the gap between physiology and behavior. The acquisition of neurosurgical,
histological and behavioral equipment will allow students to engage in a variety
of exercises which demonstrate the application of both modern and traditional
techniques. The establishment of this laboratory will improve the psychology
curriculum by expanding current course offerings in upper- division laboratory
courses. In addition, the quality and quantity of independent student research
projects will improve.
