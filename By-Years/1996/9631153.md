9631153 Bustamante This application describes a series of experiments designed
to investigate the response of DNA, proteins, and their complexes when subjected
to mechanical stress. These studies are a continuation of previous effects by
this laboratory to employ methods such as Optical Tweezers and Scanning Force
Microscopy (SFM) to investigate the mechanical response of single molecules. The
proposed studies are divided into three main groups: i) Studies of the elastic
response of single dsDNA molecules; ii) Studies of the elastic response of RecA-
DNA filaments; and iii) Studies of the mechanical denaturation of single
molecules of T4 lysozyme and titin. %%% The results of these studies will
provide completely new insights into the nature and magnitude of the
intramolecular forces that hold together biological structures. In fact,
previously published work on the elasticity of single dsDNA molecules has
already resulted in the characterization of three distinctive regimes of DNA
elasticity. These three regimes are likely to play different roles in the
process of recombination in vivo. The experiments proposed here will extend
these studies to directly investigate the mechanical properties of the
recombinant filaments and the denaturation of single protein molecules. ***
