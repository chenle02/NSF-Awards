This award provides one-half the funding required to purchase an X-ray
diffractometer (XRD) system to be installed and operated in the Department of
Geography, Geology, and Planning at Southwest Missouri State University. The
University is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary. The XRD
system will be used primarily by students and faculty of the Department of
Geography, Geology, and Planning, as well as other campus users from the
departments of Agriculture, Chemistry and Physics. Currently active projects
needing the capability of the XRD system include: analyzing the clay mineralogy
of glacial sediments in Missouri for stratigraphic ordering, mineralogical
studies of the Proterozoic granites of Missouri, soils studies, and determining
the effect of ionic complexes on the crystal structure of clay minerals and
their properties.
