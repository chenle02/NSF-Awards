The metamorphic and structural consequences of ridge subduction along a
convergent margin are not well known, but is significant because virtually all
convergent margins will ultimately consume a spreading center. This
collaborative project between EAR90-18717 and EAR90-20391 will examine the
Chugach metamorphic complex which possesses several unusual features that can be
attributed to ridge subduction in the Tertiary. Work will focus on the anomalous
low P, high T metamorphic and the structural and kinematic setting which
accompanied the formation of this metamorphic assemblage. Results will lead to a
general model for ridge subduction-related tectonics.
