The Artic regions are playing an increasingly important national role in the
search for resources (petroleum and minerals), living space, and environmental
and social development. Although an active science research effort exists, there
is a need to develop an agenda for academically based basic engineering
research. Engineering disciplines can contribute research that will provide
solutions for problems in cold regions in the areas of geotechnical, mining,
prtroleum, structural, naval architecture, transportation, acoustical,
electrical, mechanical, environmental, instrumentation, coastal, particularly,
materials and ice engineering. The proposed workshop will address the needed
research projects, instrumentation and facility development, university,
industry, government liaison and interaction, information transfer to the
engineering design community, and effective education and training needs.
Participants from universities, professional societies, interdisciplinary
groups, government agencies (federal and state), design companies, resource
industries will attend the workshop. Workshop participants will review three
recent pertinent reports that broadly identify research needs, develop a
strategy appropriate for the the university environment, and help prepare a
final report.
