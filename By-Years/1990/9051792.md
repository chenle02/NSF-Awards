This project introduces lower division engineering students to state-of-the-art
scientific computing environment. Key components of this environment include two
high-performance workstations, a widely-used scientific subprogram library, and
a very high-level problem solving environment. A color PostScript printer
provides state-of-the-art printing capability. Equipment support for the
introductory course in scientific computing previously consisted of an IBM
mainframe and attached terminals; this new instrumentation expands an existing
NSF-funded laboratory, thus allowing the course to demonstrate modern methods in
problem solving and scientific software development. Students gain a knowledge
of the capabilities of existing software libraries and systems and then learn to
critically evaluate problems in order to recognize which ones require custom-
designed software, which may be approached using library routines, and which may
be rapidly solved with a very high-level programming language. Problems
requiring varying amounts of computational resources will be solved so that
students will acquire expertise in the selection of the appropriate hardware
environment. The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal
investigator's institution.
