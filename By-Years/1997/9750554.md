The Department of Chemistry at San Jose State University is strongly committed
to undergraduate education and research in the chemical sciences. Recent
curricular developments in the department have encouraged the development of a
spiral approach to laboratory instrumentation. Two Fourier Transform Infrared
(FTIR) spectrometers have been purchased for use by students in courses
throughout the curriculum. Students are introduced to the Fourier Transform
Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy early in their freshman year. Experiments
incorporating FTIR laboratory experiments have been coupled with existing
experiments in organic, physical, and instrumental analysis laboratories. A new
inorganic chemistry laboratory and a new multidivisional capstone laboratory
course provides additional experiments which use the FTIR to solve experimental
problems covering topics relevant to the surrounding scientific and industrial
communities (i.e., Silicon Valley). *
