This research project will study the function of the vertebrate eye. Certain
proteins in the retina of the eye undergo changes in concentration or
conformation when subjected to different environmental conditions. One group of
proteins found in the outer segment of the photoreceptor cell are chemically
altered after exposure to light. Much less is known about the proteins contained
in the terminal end of the photoreceptor cell. This structure is important
because the terminal makes contact with the nerve cells which connect to higher
brain centers. Within these terminal regions are "ribbon-like" structures
containing a unique protein (88kD), which may be necessary for photoreceptor
cells to communicate with nerve cells. Immunological and ultrastructural
techniques such as monoclonal antibodies and electron microscopy will be used to
study the 88kD protein in the photoreceptor terminal. Once localized, the 88kD
protein will be purified and isolated. The gene for this protein will be cloned
and the 88kD protein sequence will be compared to other similar proteins in
national databases. These studies will provide insight into the mechanisms of
cellular communication between the eye and the brain. It may also lead to
advances in the study of retinal diseases.
