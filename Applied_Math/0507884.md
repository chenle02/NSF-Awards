Title: Fluid Dynamics With Large BV Data

This project is a study of systems of conservation laws, focussed on the
equations of fluid dynamics in one space dimension. The main problem under
consideration is the existence and structure of solutions having large BV data.
The P.I. will prove two major results: the first is the existence of solutions
to the equations of isentropic gas dynamics with large data (including the
vacuum), and the second is the construction of time-periodic shockless solutions
of the Euler equations of gas dynamics.

This project extends mature results for solutions having small data to the
physically in- teresting regime of large data, and makes accessible many
fundamental questions for systems with large data. These include the structure
of solutions, decay, uniqueness and continuous dependence, and convergence of
viscous and/or relaxation approximations. Moreover, the periodic solutions
developed here contain a number of new features not previously known in
hyperbolic systems, such as a group velocity, sustainability of solutions, and
soliton-like traveling waves. The results of this project also raise challenging
questions for numerical analysts and experimentalists.
