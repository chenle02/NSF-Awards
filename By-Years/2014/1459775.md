Inflation is an important macroeconomic phenomenon. Individuals, firms, and
governments are concerned not just about the current inflation rate but also
about future possible inflation levels. The PI team will use an innovative
method to measure expectations about the future possible inflation rate. They
will construct this measure from daily data on option contracts on the realized
future inflation level; these options are now widely sold. The new measure will
be created based on option sales between 2009 and 2013, with future horizons
from 1 to 10 years ahead of the sales date, and will include measures for the
entire distribution of future inflation in the US, the United Kingdom, the Euro
area, and Japan. The PIs will then use these data to answer three different
questions. First: How do we measure the fiscal capacity of a central bank?
Second: Are expectations about future inflation levels well anchored? And (3)
how large are the costs of inflation to total economic social welfare?
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will use the data to construct monthly risk-
adjusted inflation distributions for the different horizons and areas. These are
market-based forecasts of the entire distribution of future inflation. Because
there are data both for average inflation over N years and for annual inflation
for each of these N years, the data also include information on inflation
dynamics. Measuring the fiscal capacity of a central bank requires calculating
the market value of the bank's assets as well as calculating the present value
of seigniorage revenues. The project will give estimates of the sensitivity of
these values to higher inflation. The team will also compare their measures to
survey-based measures of expectations about future inflation. Because they will
be able to measure how much private agents appear to be willing to pay to remove
all inflation risk, the measure will also let the team develop a new way to
measure the welfare costs of inflation.
