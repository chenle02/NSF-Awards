This is a one.year collaborative research project with Dr. Blake Temple,
University of California at Davis and Dr. Randall Leveque, University of
Washington working with Professor Wang Jinghua, Institute of Systems Science,
Academia Sinica and Professor Lin Longwei, Zhongshan University, to study
nonlinear waves using numerical and analytical methods. This project studies an
important field of applied mathematics. The U.S. group is known for its work on
the hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. The Chinese team has made
significant progress in the area of wave interactions and large time step
methods. Both areas are needed for understanding nonlinear waves, and jointly
they can advance this field of applied mathematics.
