0217420&lt;br/&gt;Zaera&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Pan-American Advanced Studies
Institute (PASI) will support Dr. Francisco Zaera of the University of
California, Riverside in coordination with Dr. Francisco Machado of the Central
University of Venezuela and Dr. Alfonso Loaiza of the University of the Andes in
Merida, Venezuela. The main objectives of this PASI are to familiarize advanced
graduate students, post-doctoral and junior scientists from the Americas on
recent advances in surface science and catalysis as well as foster new inter-
American research collaborations. The program will formally introduce beginning
scientists to modern experimental techniques in surface science and to the
latest theoretical methods used to study surface chemical phenomena. The
proposed activity will be followed by a Symposium that will bring together
research groups from Latin America and the United States to discuss the latest
results in surface science and catalysis.&lt;br/&gt;
