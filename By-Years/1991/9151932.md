The department of physics is creating a new introductory level physics sequence
of courses emphasizing laboratory experience. Building upon a new first-year
course, which contains major units on 20th century physics, a sophomore level a
course in Contemporary Physics focuses on recent important physics research
results. The contemporary physics laboratory is designed to give the students
hands-on experience with fundamental ideas needed to understand the significance
of the recent results.This project provides instrumentation for experiments in
gamma ray and x-ray spectroscopy to illustrate basic concepts in nuclear and
atomic physics. Six laboratory stations are provided with a personal computer-
based multichannel analyzer and a scintillation detector or a low- energy
germanium detector and associated electronics. The personal computers are also
being used in interfacing to other physics instrumentation in the Sophomore
laboratory. The spectroscopy equipment is sufficiently sophisticated for use in
advanced level student independent projects, including neutron activation
analysis and x-ray fluorescence studies of trace elements.
