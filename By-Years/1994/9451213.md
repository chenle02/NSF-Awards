9451213 Leger A unique senior photonics laboratory is developed that combines
the resources and talents of the University of Minnesota with those of local
industry. Formal laboratory education takes place both at the university and at
selected industrial laboratories, giving the students first-hand experience with
sophisticated equipment and real-world problems. In addition, the university
laboratories are designed to take advantage of industrial expertise and
materials, and to give students exposure in areas important to industry. The
laboratory includes a state-of-the-art coherent imaging and measurement system,
and a fundamental experimental testbed for a series of experiments in fiber and
integrated optics.
