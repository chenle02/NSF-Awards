ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DEB-0407916&lt;br/&gt;Dissertation Research: Tree
species influences on soil microbial communities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tim Fahey,
Cornell University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increases in carbon dioxide and nitrogen
deposition have been predicted to alter the distribution and abundance of tree
species in northeastern forests. How changes in tree species will influence
forest ecosystems requires a better understanding of the relationship between
tree species and soil microorganisms. The goals of this research are to examine
how tree species influence soil microbes, and to examine how different types of
soil microbes affect carbon and nitrogen cycling in forests. The research will
be conducted at the Turkey Hill Plantations in Dryden, NY where plots of
individual tree species were planted in a common soil 60+ years ago. Preliminary
results suggest that tree species have a large influence on carbon and nitrogen
cycling in these plots and that the differences may result, in part, from
differences in soil microbes. Establishing links between tree species, soil
microbes and carbon and nitrogen cycling is critical to assessing ecosystem-
level responses to global change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
