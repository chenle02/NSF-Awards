9415001 Finger The award is for creating a methodology for acquiring process
models of novel manufacturing processes using statistical methods, physical
models, and experimentation. The process that will be studied is the shape
deposition melting process, which is a solid freeform fabrication process. The
part is built up by successively depositing molten materials, such as steel and
copper, in thin layers using a microcasting process. Other subprocesses used are
thermal spraying, shot peening, and machining. Only the microcasting and
machining subprocesses will be studied using the proposed methodology.
Statistical design of experiments will be used to create coarse process models
that identify important process variables and relationships among them. For
subprocesses not well understood at present, models will be developed based on
the underlying physics of the subprocesses. Surrogate models of different levels
of complexity and detail will also be abstracted from the detailed models. The
methodology to be developed is particularly useful for studying the shape
deposition process which is a rapid prototyping process. More conventional
processes would also benefit from the methodology.
