This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfields of gas phase reactions and mass spectrometry. The focus of this
research is to develop methods for structural characterization of large
biomolecules and to study the fundamentals of ion trapping and ion detection
using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR). A large emphasis of
this project will be placed on understanding dissociation reactions of peptides
after photodissociation or reaction with organo-alkali metal ions. Specific
studies are proposed to examine the factors which influence the ICR signal of
various species which are analyzed using FT-ICR. This research is designed to
better understand how large biomolecules will break apart in the gas phase after
absortion of relatively high energy photons or reactions with alkali metal ion
species. The ultimate goal of this research is to provide better capabilities
for characterization of high molecular weight biomolecules.
