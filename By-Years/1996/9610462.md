This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, addresses the dynamics of high energy particle bombardment of organic
surfaces, and the laser ablation of these systems. The computational studies of
this project focus on questions of angular distribution and identity of
sputtered species, and in the case of the laser ablation simulations, also
consider the possibility of excitation and relaxation processes in the
desorption. Close interaction with experimentalists studying these processes is
a hallmark of the computational studies being carried out here by Professor
Garrison and her students at Pennsylvania State University. The detailed
understanding of these processes is essential to the development of processing
and analytical techniques in the semiconductor industry and in the analysis of
biomaterials and organic interfaces. A detailed understanding of the dynamics of
ion or photon induced desorption of organic species from organic thin films is
necessary for the development of analysis tools in the electronic materials
industry and for the design of biomaterials and biocompatible interfaces. One
approach to developing this understanding is to simulate the processes
computationally, and to search for insights into the processes based on these
simulations. This is the goal of this research project.
