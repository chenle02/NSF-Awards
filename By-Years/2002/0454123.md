Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Program: NSF 04-588 CISE Computing
Research Infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;Title: CRI: SEAT: Soft Error Analysis Toolset
&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: CNS-0454123 &lt;br/&gt;PI: Narayanan, Vijaykrishnan
&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Pennsylvania State Univ University Park
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project: &lt;br/&gt;Researchers at The Pennsylvania State
University will develop the Soft Error Analysis Toolset (SEAT) and accompanying
datasets as a community resource. Soft Errors are unwanted state changes in
integrated circuits due to radiation such as cosmic rays. The investigators will
have access to the Breazeale TRIGA nuclear research reactor at Penn State to
gather actual data on radiation effects on devices such as microprocessors and
FPGA's. In addition to experimental data gathering, the project will develop a
toolset to model effects and support design at various levels: circuit analysis,
logic analysis, and architecture analysis. These tools will be used in new
courses in reliable design at Penn State. The data, tools and courses will be
made available to other universities.&lt;br/&gt;
