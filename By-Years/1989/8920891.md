This project includes two research efforts related to the Cedar project:
enlargement of the Cedar shared memory and architectural studies for new large-
scale multiprocessors. The memory enlargement allows realistic benchmarks to be
run on the machine, which facilitates the architectural studies. The studies to
be carried out include investigations of memory hierarchy organization in
multiprocessors, cache design, virtual memory, and new techniques for processor
synchronization and instruction execution. These topics are being investigated
analytically, by simulation, and experimentally on the enlarged Cedar.
