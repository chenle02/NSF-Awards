The goal of this research is to develop a systematic approach to shaping the
response of nonlinear systems to applied forcing mechanisms with the aim of
controlling or at least influencing the system behavior. A longer term goal,
currently being pursued only at an experimental level, is also to take advantage
of exotic nonlinear behavior to achieve a system response which cannot be
realized with a linear system. This proposal focuses on the development of a
theory of steady- state response and to an unanticipated solution of the
"nonlinear regulator problem", for small deviations from an equilibrium. One
rather promising new frontier involves a structure of the solution of the
regulator problem which seems particularly amenable to a computational
implementation of the resulting feedback law. Indeed, the compution requires the
off-line solution of a nonlinear partial differential equation which is
apparently the analogue, for nonlinear systems, of the Riccati equation of
linear control systems.
