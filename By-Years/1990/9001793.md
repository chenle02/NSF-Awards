Work to be done on this project falls into two related classes. The first,
infinite dimensional nonlinear programming problems, concerns the modeling of
optimal control problems for partial differential equations, functional
differential equations and other equations as infinite dimensional nonlinear
programming problems. Goals include developing necessary conditions for the
existence of minima and for the convergence of sequences of suboptimal elements.
The second theme, optimal control theory of partial differential and functional
differential equations concerns application of results from the first part to
problems such as optimal deformation problems - especially in the presence of
obstacles. The results are likely to include versions of Pontryagin's maximum
principle, constancy and vanishing of the Hamiltonian and convergence estimates.
Attention will also be given to boundary control questions, where results
(compared to distributed parameter systems) are sparse. Application to specific
equations will be made.
