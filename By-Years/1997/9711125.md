The early 18th century origins of modern automation pose a problem for the
history of ideas as well as for the history of techniques. At the beginning of
that century projects in mechanization were mostly amusements, such as decorated
music boxes and ringing mechanisms on clocks. The in the first decades of the
century, automata-makers began to apply their art to the resolution of
philosophical problems. By the end of the century the problems they studied were
predominantly industrial. Paralleling this move of mechanization from popular
amusement to philosophy to industry, a modern conception of automation developed
from an initial diversity of artistic, philosophical and experimental devices.
The proposed research will begin an investigation of this transformation, using
primary and secondary materials located predominantly in Paris, France, and at
the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.
