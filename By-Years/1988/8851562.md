A Fourier transform infrared spectrometer has been acquired and is being used in
introductory organic chemistry, advanced organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry,
chemical instrumentation, physical chemistry and chemistry research. The FT-IR
is being used to supplement existing laboratory techniques for elucidating
structure, providing alternate methods of quantitative analysis and allowing for
more sophisticated experimentation in upper division courses. In addition,
Fourier transform methodology is being incorporated into the laboratory for the
first time. Data manipulation and spectral search capabilities of the FT-IR make
it a powerful learning tool for students. Experience with the FT-IR is assisting
the students in remaining competitive in the job market where FT-IR is fast
becoming the norm. The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources.
