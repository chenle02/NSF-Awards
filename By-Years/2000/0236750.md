0236750&lt;br/&gt;Schaap&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will support the costs
of developing a Feedback Syringe Pump Method (FSPM) for the rapid, precise, and
direct determination of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (K) and water
retention in soil samples. The system will be fully automated and will require
minimal operator attention. Phased developments will include: 1) construction of
a prototype system to optimize and test various system components and control
methods, and 2) development of a system for routine measurements that would
accommodate six to eight samples at a time. These activities will involve
collaboration between the University of California at Riverside and the George
E. Brown Jr. Salinity Laboratory (USDA-ARS) in Riverside. Funds will purchase
materials necessary for development of the FSPM and will support part of the
salary for the PI and a postdoc. No NSF funding is requested for the activities
of the collaborator or the GEBJ Salinity
Laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
