The Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Irvine will
establish a new upper division elective laboratory course to provide students
with a basic introduction to materials science. In this course, students will
synthesize organic polymers, macroporous polymers, magnetic oxides, thin-film
metals, non-stoichiometric compounds, and pure single crystals. They will then
characterize these materials using a variety of instrumental methods, as to
chemical composition and physical properties. The additional instrumentation
will reinforce and extend education in physical chemistry, organo-metallic
chemistry, and quantitative analysis, filling a deficiency in laboratory
experience in the Department's program, but also addressing a future need for
persons with experience in solid state materials science.
