In November 2007, at the request of the Office of High Energy Physics of the
Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation, the High Energy
Physics Advisory Panel reconstituted the Particle Physics Project Prioritization
Panel for the purpose of developing a plan for US particle physics for the
coming decade under a variety of budget assumptions. The P5 panel presented its
report, ?US Particle Physics: Scientific Opportunities, A Strategic Plan for the
Next Ten Years?, to the HEPAP on May 29, 2008 and HEPAP gave the report its
unanimous approval. The DOE Office of High Energy Physics and NSF Physics
Division have agreed to share the cost of printing 5,000 copies of the final
report for distribution to funding agencies, policy makers, universities, the
national and international scientific community and the interested
public&lt;br/&gt;
