Dunning The objectives of the research are 1) to investigate ultra- low energy
electron-molecule collisions using high Rydberg atoms, 2) to examine the
response of highly excited atoms to electric fields of short duration and 3) to
investigate the behavior of atoms near a solid surface. The use of highly
excited Rydberg atoms now enables these experiments to be carried out under
conditions which will produce meaningful data which can be compared to theory.
