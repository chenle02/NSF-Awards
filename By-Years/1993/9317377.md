9317377 Draayer The objectives of the proposed research is to achieve a
microscopic understanding of the origin of good pseudo-spin symmetry in heavy
deformed nuclei. This special symmetry is manifest in the occurrence of pseudo
spin-orbit doublets in heavy (rare earth and actinide) deformed odd-A nuclei
with measured magnetic moments that lie close to the asymptotic pseudo-Nilsson
values. The existence of good pseudo-spin symmetry means there is hope for being
able to carry out detailed shell-model calculations for heavy deformed nuclei
within the pseudo-LS and pseudo-SU (3) pictures, following J.P. Elliott's lead
in the application of this symmetry for light deformed nuclei. ***
