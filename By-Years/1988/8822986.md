What is the nature of the decision-making process used by executives
responsible for managing tourist-oriented service organizations confronting
disaster evacuation advisories? No research has been directed toward this
question. The proposed research has six objectives: 1) to assess plans made by
executives responsible for tourist- oriented private firms to assist them in
making decisions related to evacuation of their organization when threatened
with disaster; 2) to identify factors that account for the variation in this
planning; 3) to describe the sequence of behavior that culminates in actual
evacuation decisions; 4) to identify factors that account for the variation in
these decisions, e.g., social characteristics, organizational structures and
community qualities; 5) to describe established and emergent organizational
policies designed to guide employee behavior; and 6) to formulate policy
recommendations for emergency managers and business executives. A two-phased
comparative field study methodology will be used. Phase I field studies will
assess evacuation planning in three different sized exemplary communities and
will identify factors that account for variation. Phase II field studies will be
completed following two major disasters, actual or threatened, wherein
evacuations occurred.
