Nonlinear wave equations give a mathematical description for many phenomena in
optics, fluid dynamics, and a variety of other physical systems. Such a
description is instrumental for predicting behavior and designing engineering
devices, such as optical switches for information transmission. Even when it is
not possible to completely determine the solutions to such equations, the system
can often be understood satisfactorily by considering an appropriate
approximation, such as long time or small dispersion. A rich and maturing
asymptotic theory has been developed for the somewhat idealized integrable wave
equations. However, in order to provide accurate predictions for more realistic
physical systems, it is necessary to extend the current models to account for
issues including coupling or interference, higher-order corrections, and
boundaries. By taking advantage of recent mathematical advances, this project
will improve available methods to better model these three effects. Specific
applications of the models studied include the development of all-optical
switches, Raman scattering, flux propagation in superconducting Josephson
junctions, and hydrodynamic turbulence.

The research aims to enhance the physical applicability of current models of
nonlinear wave propagation through the following three projects: (1) Extension
of the small-dispersion theory to multicomponent systems, including the three-
wave resonant interaction equations, to develop better mathematical models of
coupled systems. (2) Establishing results on the long-time behavior and onset of
instabilities in near-integrable equations, such as Hamiltonian perturbations of
the sine-Gordon equation, in order to better incorporate higher-order physical
effects that may not be negligible. (3) Extending the unified transform method
to understand small-dispersion behavior on finite or semi-finite domains.
Analysis of the defocusing nonlinear Schrodinger, massive Thirring, and related
equations will improve models where boundary effects are important.
