Professor Shimozono studies combinatorial structures arising in representation
theory and algebraic geometry. With Allen Knutson and Ezra Miller, he proved a
conjecture of Buch and Fulton for the torus equivariant cohomology classes of
degeneracy loci associated with an equioriented type A quiver, which generalizes
the Giambelli-Thom-Porteous formula for determinantal varieties. He will study
the equivariant K-theoretic and cohomology classes of degeneracy loci associated
with other quivers. This research has applications to the Schubert calculus and
the geometry of flag varieties. Shimozono will continue his research on
combinatorial problems arising in the representation theory of classical and
affine Lie algebras and Weyl groups. With Mike Zabrocki, he has discovered new
creation operators for characters of classical type, which, together with
crystal graph techniques, will be applied to the problem of finding explicit
combinatorial formulae for affine Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials. He also plans to
continue his study of crystal bases of finite-dimensional modules over quantum
affine algebras, with applications to branching and fusion multiplicities in
conformal field theories and statistical mechanics.

Shimozono's research on quiver loci is related to some classical mathematics
with current applications. For example, the cohomology classes of quiver loci
may be viewed as polynomials which generalize the classical polynomials known as
subresultants. Subresultants are used in computer algebra systems to efficiently
compute the greatest common divisor of a collection of polynomials, and may also
be used to find the number of common zeroes of a pair of polynomials without
factoring them. His research on affine crystal bases involves the study of
certain highly symmetrical graphs with colored edges. The symmetries exhibited
by these graphs appear in many areas of mathematics and physics, such as in the
low-temperature behavior of statistical mechanical models involving particles
situated on a two-dimensional lattice.
