Bedinger 9707384 The long term objective of the research in my laboratory is to
understand molecular events in the reproduction of higher plants, including
gametogenesis and pollination. The study of pollen-specific gene products,
including the Pex (Pollen-extensin) proteins, has been the focus of a major
effort. Although we have performed molecular and localization studies on these
proteins that strongly suggest that they play an important role in pollination,
we lack the genetic data that firmly establishes that the Pex proteins are
essential for pollen function. One way to obtain this data is through the use of
antisense-expressing transgenic plants. We have cloned both maize and tomato
versions of the Pex genes. This proposal is to fund visits to two laboratories
to learn how to transform tomato (and tomato pollen) and maize, and to analyze
the transgenic plants that are produced. Our assays for pollen function
encompass genetic transmission of mutant genotypes, pollen structure, pollen
tube germination and structure, and pollen-pistil interactions.
