Ten one day workshops will be presented to promote the immediate and widespread
use of graphing calculators into the undergraduate mathematics curriculum. This
project will provide 250 undergraduate math faculty with (1) detailed training
on the mechanics of the calculator, (2) ideas as to how the calculator can be
used in specific courses, (3) the opportunity to develop instructional materials
for those courses, and (4) the opportunity to share their experiences with
colleagues. The four member project team will visit 10 community college
campuses to give these workshops to interested two- and four-year college
mathematics faculty. Each participant will receive a TI-81 graphing calculator
and each institution a calculator projector kit to encourage instructors to
continually explore potential uses of graphing calculators in mathematics
instruction. The project director will create, edit, and publish a newsletter,
and three follow- up meetings are scheduled so that participating faculty can
share their experiences.
