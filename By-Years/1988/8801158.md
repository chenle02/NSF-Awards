Robert Brooks will investigate connections between the geometry of a surface
and the eigenvalues of the Laplacian. Work on these problems was popularized
some years ago by questions such as "Can you hear the shape of a drum?". If you
have perfect pitch then you can in theory detect the harmonics of the drum, that
is the eigenvalues of the Laplacian. So the question is how much geometry of a
surface can be detected from knowledge of these eigenvalues. Brooks' work will
focus on the study of the small eigenvalues of hyperbolic manifolds and
isospectral problems on compact manifolds. There are already estimates for the
low eigenvalues of compact manifolds. Brooks will work to extend these to the
finite volume case. This is a non-trivial extension but certainly a natural one
since a key ingredient of earlier estimates is the the notion of injectivity
radius which is zero for non-compact finite volume manifolds. His work on
isospectral problems is concerned with a study of the topology of sets of
isospectral metrics in a given conformal class. The intention here is to apply
the solution of the Yamabe problem to the geometry of three dimensional
manifolds.
