This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program
entitled NUE: Integration of Nanotechnology Engineering Education into
"Introduction to Materials Science for Engineering (ENGR-1600)", at Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute (RPI) under the direction of Dr. Daniel Lewis, will
develop and implement a new set of hands-on, discovery based, laboratory
demonstrations and teaching modules for introducing undergraduates to the
science, engineering, and societal aspects of nanotechnology through the core
engineering course "Introduction to Materials Science for Engineering
(ENGR-1600)". This work will provide a model for future institutionalization of
nanotechnology throughout the undergraduate curriculum by developing the basic
concepts needed in upper level courses.
