Galaxies are thought to form primarily through the merging of smaller galaxies
and the accretion of cold gas from the intergalactic medium (IGM). The aim of
this project is to directly detect the low mass building blocks of present-day
galaxies like the Milky Way and the signatures of gas transport from the IGM
into gaseous halos and disks. The collaborating team will make use of
spectroscopic observations that can provide higher contrast between faint
galaxies and the sky background than broad- or narrow-band imaging, and will
take advantage of recent increases in instrumental sensitivity and their access
to large telescopes. The team will carry out 4 distinct sub-projects: (1)
Spectroscopic searches for Lyman-alpha emission from the IGM and high redshift
galaxies. The aim is to reveal the spatial extent, kinematics and energetics of
gas in the early stages of galaxy formation. (2) Line-profile analysis of bright
Lyman-alpha galaxies. The data will be used to constrain the relative importance
of infall and outflow in galaxies. (3) High resolution spectroscopy of MgII
absorption systems in the spectra of background quasi-stellar objects (QSOs).
These data will be used to understand the origin of cool gas clouds in galaxies
without current star formation. (4) A deep, two-dimensional Balmer-alpha search
of local galaxies in an effort to detect cool halo clouds condensing from the
halo onto the disk. These projects are intended to be available as doctoral
dissertation projects for graduate students in the Carnegie Institution's pre-
doctoral fellowship program. The Principal Investigator will also participate in
supervising undergraduate students from the Claremont Colleges in astronomy
research.
