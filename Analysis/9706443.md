Proposal: DMS-9706443 PI: Svetlana Jitomirskaya This research involves
localization type effects for Schrodinger operators and for quantum spin
systems, percolation, and contact processes in disordered environments, and the
general study of spectra and wave functions of Schrodinger operators. The main
objective is to develop methods of proving localization type effects for
Schrodinger operators with deterministic potentials. The other goal is to study
the relation between spectral and quantum-dynamical properties and long time
behavior as they relate to generalized eigenfunctions, particularly in the
multidimensional case. Another goal of the proposed research is to study
singular continuous spectrum that exhibits critical behavior, particularly for
models where it appears for critical values (or intervals) of the parameters.
The proposed research is centered around the fundamental properties of
disordered systems that serve as models of systems with impurities. Impurities
can substantially change various properties of the media and can thus be used to
create materials with desired properties. In just this way transistors are made
of materials with impurities. Disordered systems are also used in modeling many
micro and macro effects: from quantum localization to earthquakes. The proposed
topics include studying properties of highly disordered systems of Quantum
Mechanics and of systems at critical levels of disorder that demonstrate highly
unstable behavior.
