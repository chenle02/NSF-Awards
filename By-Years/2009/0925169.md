This proposal expands the online resources developed by the National Snow and
Ice Data Center, Arctic Sea Ice News & Analysis
[http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews]. The public yearns for reliable science
information to understand the decline in Arctic sea ice and its relationship to
climate change. Readership of the current website includes media, decision
makers, internet-savvy readers, educators, and scientists of the future. To date
NSIDC has developed web content primarily for a science audience with near-real
time data and analysis. The current website received 501,680 views during the
second half of 2008 (Google Analytics). This award supports the development of a
new ?Icelights: Questions of the Moment? section to augment the Frequently Asked
Questions page. Through "Icelights," the website will offer easily
understandable science pieces that are relevant and timely. The project will
support personnel who can respond to questions of the moment posed by the
readers and make the questions and answers available to others in a searchable
web format. These new features to the NSIDC website offered by Icelights are a
cost-effective way to reach a large, diverse audience with up-to-date science
and answers to their questions.
