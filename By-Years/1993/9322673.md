9322673 Walschap The scope of research covers the differential geometry of
metric and totally geodesic foliations on Riemannian manifolds with focus on
curvature questions. The latter involve techniques from ergodic theory and
topology to analyze growth conditions. This research has potential applications
to mathematical physics. ***
