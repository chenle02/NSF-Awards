The Department of Mathematics at Florida State University in conjunction with
The Department of Mathematics at The University of Arkansas is organizing the
conference "Clifford Analysis and Related Topics" to take place at Florida State
University during December 15, 16 and 17, 2014. A conference has been
established: http://www.math.fsu.edu/cart2014/. The motivation for this
conference is to bring together top researchers in this field along with
students and early career mathematicians to discuss and collaborate on recent
and continuing research. Such interactions are especially valuable to students.
Clifford Analysis has ties to many other branches of mathematics as well as
important applications in physics and in particular to signal processing. This
award supports travel for participants in the conference.

Clifford analysis is based Clifford algebras in the same way that complex
analysis is based on the complex numbers. Indeed the complex numbers are a
simple Clifford algebra. However higher dimensional Clifford algebras are
noncommutative and contain zero divisors. The topics of this conference include
compactification of Clifford algebras and their Mobius geometry, representation
theory of conformal and orthogonal groups, Clifford analysis on Heisenberg
groups, and subelliptic Dirac operators on CR manifolds.
