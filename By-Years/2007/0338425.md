Observational research with a Na wind and temperature lidar, currently located
at the Maui Space Surveillance Complex (a USAF facility) on Mt. Haleakala, HI,
is continued. The 3.7 m aperture lidar is the centerpiece of a suite of optical
and radar instrumentation located nearby for the purpose of collaborative
studies of dynamics in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MALT). The
research focus is three-fold. The first task quantifies the gravity wave induced
vertical flux of horizontal momentum including directional information relevant
to ducting. The directional aspect of gravity waves is used to help determine
the location of generating sources. The second task is quantification of gravity
wave phase and velocity using both optical and radar measurement techniques, to
detect and compare both high frequency and low frequency wave phase and wave
speed. The third task is to study and quantify gravity wave induced heat and
constituent fluxes in the MALT region.
