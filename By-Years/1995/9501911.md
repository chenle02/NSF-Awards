ABSTRACT Norris UVA CTS-9501911 Aerogels are unusual materials composed of
nanometer-sized particles and pores. Silica aerogels have extremely low density,
and the microstructure gives them unusual thermophysical properties that allow
important applications such as for electrical and thermal insulators. This
research centers on determining the thermal properties of thin-film aerogels,
for which standard experimental techniques and analyses cannot be applied.
Fractal analysis will be applied to understanding the properties of thin-films
from their microstructure, and experiments will be carried out to determine the
thermal conductivity of thin-film aerogels on substrates and to demonstrate the
existance of length-scale effects at the microscale at room temperatures. The
educational plan emphasizes bringing statistical methods, including design of
experiments, into the engineering curriculum. In addition, the PI has plans for
expanding an already strong mentoring program for encouraging women to enter
engineering, both in the university and with junior high and high-school
students.
