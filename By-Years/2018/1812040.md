The Fall 2018 meeting of the Texas Geometry and Topology Conference will be at
Rice University on November 9-11, 2018. To date the Texas Geometry and Topology
Conference has been held spring and fall since its founding in 1989, a total of
58 times. The conference has become an extremely successful semiannual event in
the Southwest. The next series of conferences will have seven primary host
universities: Rice University, Texas A&amp;M University, The University of Texas
at Austin, University of Houston, Texas Tech University, and (jointly) Texas
Christian University and The University of Texas at
Arlington.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By design, the Texas Geometry and Topology
Conference has two high-impact foci. First, the conference makes it possible for
the community of geometers and topologists from Texas and surrounding states (a
huge geographic region) to meet and share mathematics on a regular basis. In so
doing, the conference is committed to bring researchers of national and
international stature to discuss their research as well as offering a venue for
regional scholars and early career researchers. This stimulates individual
research and generates productive cooperative efforts between schools. Second,
the conference is committed to the strengthening and enrichment of the
mathematics personnel base. In order that there be no barrier to participation,
the conference is widely advertised, participation is open, and there are no
registration fees. Graduate students, junior faculty, women, minorities, and
persons with disabilities are especially encouraged to participate and to apply
for support. Furthermore the conference is partnering with two historically
black universities (Fayetteville State University and Prairie View A&amp;M
University) on a project to foster research opportunities for select junior
faculty at these institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The

reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
