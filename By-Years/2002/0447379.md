A grant has been awarded to the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign under
the direction of Dr. Colin Favret for partial support of the digitization of
300,000 specimens of ants, bees, and wasps (Hymenoptera) in the Illinois Natural
History Survey insect collection. The Hymenoptera data of interest include the
identity, or species name, of each and every specimen, and where and when it was
collected. The insects themselves date from throughout the 20th Century and
include particularly valuable sets of bees, sawflies, and parasitic wasps,
including host and pollen records. All the collection localities in the United
States will be researched and assigned latitude and longitude coordinates
allowing for easy mapping of species distributions in time and
space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three graduate students will be trained over the
course of the project. They will learn the details of collection and data
management and have a unique opportunity to work closely with a significant
collection of scientific specimens. Visiting entomologists will also be
recruited to update the identification of various insect groups, providing them
with a hands-on experience that would otherwise be unavailable. Finally, a large
number of undergraduate students will be directly involved in data entry. They
will gain an appreciation for the significance of the project and learn the
basic tools of insect classification. Many will also be involved in ancillary
projects such as field collecting, thereby gaining an understanding of the
source and significance of the very data they will be working
with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hymenoptera include many groups of economic
importance. Many are important as control agents for insect pests of
agriculture. Bees are important plant pollinators and ants disperse plant seeds.
Over 100 species of ants in the United States are non-native, and two of them,
the Argentine and red imported fire ants, alone cost billions annually in damage
and control efforts. Other Hymenoptera are of similar economic significance. The
data gathered by the project will provide valuable tools for documenting species
declines or local extinctions, the historical presence of particular species,
changes in species distribution, range expansion of invasive species, for
ecological restoration, assessments of biodiversity, and for conservation. All
the data gathered by the project will be served on the Internet for free and
easy access, and they will be standardized so as to conform to the third-party
standards such as those of the Global Biodiversity Information
Facility.&lt;br/&gt;
