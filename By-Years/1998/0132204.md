0132204 Daniel

Funds from this grant will support the acquisition of a state-of-the-art
scanning electron microscope (SEM) with an environmental cell which allows for
imaging of hydrated samples at variable pressures. The so-called environmental
SEM (ESEM) will also be configured with an energy dispersive x-ray spectrometer
(EDS) to allow for quantitative compositional analysis of samples. The ESEM
facility at Bucknell will support the research programs of faculty members Chris
Daniel (metamorphic petrology/structural geology), Beth Capaldi (entomology),
Carl Kirby (environmental geochemistry) and Margot Vigeant (Chemical
Engineering) and their students at this liberal arts institution. Specific
research thrusts include investigations of the Proterozoic tectonic history of
the southwestern U.S. based on SEM and EMP analyses of metamorphic phases to
elucidate their P-T history and patterns of chemical zoning, investigations of
bacterial interactions with solid iron phases found in rocks exposed to acid
mine drainage, studies of biofilms on medical devices and industrial piping and
structural studies of live pollen-insect interactions to elucidate insect
sensory structures and mechanisms. ***
