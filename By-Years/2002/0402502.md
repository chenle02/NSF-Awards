AST-0402502&lt;br/&gt;Melia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Galactic Center is being
actively explored at radio, sub-millimeter, infrared, X-ray and gamma-ray
wavelengths, with unprecedented clarity and spectral resolution. This research
will study in detail the strong field effects associated with the central black
hole, with the expectation that they will produce observationally testable
signatures. Diverse lines of evidence, such as the 80 minute period at
wavelength 1.3 millimeters, the 17 minute modulation of infrared emission, and
the 10 minute variability during X-ray flares, argue for a new intense
theoretical investigation into the structure of spacetime close to the black
hole. Using semi-analytical analysis, numerical methods, and ray-tracing
calculations, this project will consider these variabilities, as well as the
tentative 106 day periodicity at centimeter wavelengths, and develop a
theoretical framework for the eventual imaging of the black hole accretion
system's shadow using millimeter and sub-millimeter global-baseline
interferometry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This investigator has many years of
experience training young scientists, many of whom have gone on to become
scientific leaders in their own right. He is also very effective at bringing
science to a wider audience, via books, tours, and many public presentations.
