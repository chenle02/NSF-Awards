The purpose of this research is to investigate three related topics in the area
of financial economics. The first topic will explore the impact of hedging
strategies, such as programed trading, on the volatility of the stock market. In
recent years, the stock market has become much more volatile. This fact was
dramatized by the October 19, 1987 crash, and there remains great debate about
what may be causing this increased volatility. The author will develop a
theoretical model of stock market equilibrium in the presence of dynamic hedging
strategies and asymmetric information in order to investigate this volatility.
The second topic involves developing a theoretical model of asset pricing in the
presence of transactions costs and durable consumption goods. The third topic
will focus on developing a model of the control and governance of the
corporation by introducing life cycle considerations. Much of the current
literature assumes that shareholders own the corporation and the role of
corporate governance is to develop a mechanism to maximize the value of
stockholder wealth. However, from a corporate life cycle perspective, the
entrepreneur who sets up a corporation may desire to choose a governance
structure which gives him greater control at the expense of shareholder wealth.
This work will increase our understanding of the allocation of voting rights and
control in corporate arrangements. This project can be expected to make several
important contributions. The work on stock market volatility should provide a
better understanding of what is causing increased instability in financial
markets. This in turn may suggest strategies for modifying market rules to bring
about more orderly capital markets. The work on corporate governance should
produce useful insights into merger and takeover behavior. The introduction of
life cycle considerations may explain the reluctance of entrepreneurs to release
control at early stages of the corporation. At an earlier stage, corporations
may be much less vulnerable to hostile takeovers than is commonly thought.
