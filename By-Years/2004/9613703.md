9613703 This NSF-CONACyT collaborative research project is on very high level
programming languages that will facilitate flexible ways of problem as well as
query specification. The term "very high level" is used to mean a declarative
(as opposed to a conventional, procedural) language, in which the emphasis is on
what a program should compute rather than on the details of how the computation
should be carried out. The focus of the research is on sets, which are central
in applications of database query languages and logical specifications of
problems. While previous research has laid the foundations for a set-oriented
declarative language, the new research will expand the paradigm with two
important capabilities: constraints and preferences. In this programming
paradigm, a user can specify the mandatory requirements (or constraints) of a
problem and also the optional requirements (or preferences) that guide the
search for optimal solutions. In considering how to formulate preferences based
upon aggregate values, the research will examine how to integrate sets,
constraints, and preferences. The proposed research covers design and
implementation issues, as well as applications, and will be carried out in
collaboration with Professor Mauricio Osorio, at the Universidad de las
Americas, Puebla, Mexico. ***
