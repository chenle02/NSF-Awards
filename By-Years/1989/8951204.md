This project will integrate the use of modern microcomputer system development
tools into the undergraduate computer engineering curriculum. The equipment,
which is to be placed in the microcomputer project laboratory, includes six IRM
PC/AT-compatible personal computers, each equipped with computer-aided logic
design and simulation software, programmable logic device development
capability, and modern cross-development software which will allow students to
use a high-level language (C) along with assembly language to develop software
for laboratory projects. Six logic analyzers will also be added to the
laboratory. These modern development tools are used extensively in the high-
technology industry and government laboratories which are the primary employers
of Wright State University's computer engineering graduates. Their integration
into the computer engineering laboratory program will significantly enhance the
value of WSU's program to the community and better prepare computer engineering
graduates to be immediately productive in the jobs which they will enter upon
graduation. The end result will be to promote the use of modern development
tools in those companies which are not already using them, and to increase their
effectiveness where they are already using them, and to increase their
effectiveness where they are already being employed.
