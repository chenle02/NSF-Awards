Abstract/Brutsaert, 97-08622 Boundary Layer Soundings and Regional Surface Heat
Fluxes in the Southern Great P!ains This award provides funding for three years
for research to investigate surface heat fluxes (both turbulent and radiative)
at regional scales from natural land surfaces. One principal aim of the work is
to find ways to allow derivation of surface fluxes over larger areas than the
characteristic scales of 10 m to 100 m imposed by currently available
measurement technology. Better characterization of these quantities is needed
for many reasons, not least of which is the need for improvement of global
climate models. The work is to be carried out at the DoB ARM/CART site in the
Southern Great Plains at the border between Kansas and Oklahoma. The site is
highly instrumented and is probably the best site in the world for the planned
research, and several focused special observing periods will occur during the
next three years while the research is being carried out. The synergy that will
be achieved as a result of this cooperation will be excellent. The results will
he of considerable value in dynamic climate modeling and hydrological
applications.
