9301393 R.A. Amos This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project deals with the design, synthesis and evaluation of biocompatible,
photoderivatizing reagents for surface treatment of plastics used in biomedical
applications. This approach will permit the selection of the polymer solely on
the basis of physical and mechanical properties and then provide a tenacious,
covalently-bound surface coating which imparts the required biocompatibility.
This Phase II project will seek to optimize the synthesis and use of the new
fluorinated azide photoreagents developed during Phase I and to develop
additional compounds which will further explore optimizing the activation
wavelength and enhancing reactivity towards less reactive polymer surfaces.
Coating reagents will be assessed for their ability to impart a lubricating
surface. A variety of polymer substrates will be utilized with a focus on
specific medical devices provided by prospective client companies. This SBIR
Phase II project will continue the advances initially started in the Phase I
project. An important goal of the SBIR Program is the ultimate conversion of
NSF-supported research into technological innovation and commercialization. ***
