This research will update diurnally varying insolation rates using water vapor
data from recent global climatologies that overlap the UARS experiment. This
enables direct comparison between observed and modeled tides. The main objective
is to clarify the effect of tropospheric heating on the seasonal and inter-
annual variability of the propagating diurnal tide in the mesosphere and lower
thermosphere. This study will enable tide modelers to sort out tropospheric
forcing from other mechanisms of tidal variability, such as gravity-wave drag
and mean wind influences. The PI's findings will contribute substantially to
understanding the temporal variation of tides and global mean circulations in
the mesosphere and lower thermosphere.
