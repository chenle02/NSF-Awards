Abstract 9623170 Coakley Funds are requested to cover the costs of gravity and
bathymetry data acquisition in the Arctic Ocean for a study of the Arctic Mid
Ocean Ridge (AMOR) and the adjacent sliver of continental crust, the Lomonosov
Ridge. In concert with the physical oceanographic program, we would like to
collect additional long bathymetric and gravity anomaly profiles across the
combined Lomonosov Ridge and AMOR. This data, combined with the collected on
previous submarine science cruises, will permit the construction of regional
scale maps across much of the basin within the operational area. The advance of
plate tectonics into the Arctic Ocean basin has reached only to the Lomonosov
Ridge. The Arctic Mid Ocean Ridge is the northern extension of the Mid Atlantic
Ridge. It is perhaps the slowest spreading ridge on earth. Propagation of the
AMOR into the Arctic Ocean separated the Lomonosov Ridge from the northern edge
of Eurasia beginning at about 58Ma. This separation has continued up until the
present time. Maps produced during this study will be used to define transverse
structures in the ridge (the geometry of half graben bounding faults and
transfer zones) and the morphology of the AMOR. The regional lines will also be
useful for studies of isostatic compensation of both the Lomonosov Ridge and the
AMOR as well as defining he transition from the Lomonosov Ridge to the adjacent
enigmatic Alpha-Mendeleev Ridge.
