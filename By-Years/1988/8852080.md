This project supports enhancement of this institution's computer science course
in real-time and system level software development. Undergraduate students are
exposed to a laboratory having dedicated machines (so that system level errors
during software development do not disrupt other users) and high-level software
development support and modern interfacing equipment so that practical projects
can be carried out in the lab. The equipment supporting this lab includes; VME-
bus based microcomputers with serial and parallel ports, floppy disk controller
and drive and interrupt capabilities; debug monitor; and, cross-assembler. This
award is being matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
