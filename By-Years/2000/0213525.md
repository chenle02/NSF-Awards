Professor Carlier and his students will first study the structures of lithiated
nitriles in solution. They will use a variety of NMR spectroscopic techniques in
these studies. Computational studies will be used to compliment and direct
experimental work and have led the PI to propose the study of these lithiation
reactions in noncoordinating hydrocarbon solvents. Carbon metallated nitriles
discovered in these studies will then be used in an enantioselective
deprotonation/alkylation reaction sequence which will be applied to
enantioselective syntheses of alpha, alpha-disubstituted-alpha-amino
acids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular
Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Paul R. Carlier of the
Department of Chemistry at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.
Professor Carlier and his students will study the structures and reaction
chemistry of a class of molecules known as lithiated nitriles. The structures
will be predicted using computational chemistry and modelling techniques then
studied spectroscopically using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Nitriles which can be lithiated on the carbon next to the nitrile functional
group will then be used in enantioselective carbon-carbon bond forming reactions
called alkylation reactions. These alkylation reactions produce molecules which
are chiral (have two nonsuperimposable mirror images) and make only one of the
two possible forms (a single enantiomer). Development of this family of
reactions is one of the most important problems facing the pharmaceutical
industry today. Students trained during the course of this work will gain skills
in computational chemistry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and organic
synthesis. These skills are needed by the pharmaceutical and speciality
chemicals industries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
