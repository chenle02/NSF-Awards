This dissertation research project in cultural anthropology will study the
cultural meanings of heavy public drinking among fishermen in Kodiak, Alaska.
The cultural pressures to drink will be examined by interviewing and observing
captains and crewmen in three fisheries. The importance of status, and of the
differing constraints imposed by the different fishery regimes, will be
analyzed. Fishermen who have stopped drinking, through membership in alcoholics
anonymous, will be interviewed to assess their reaction to the cultural norm
which facilitates heavy drinking among fishermen. This research is important
because substance abuse is one of the major problems in the world, and is
especially pronounced among Native Americans. This project should provide
insight into the cultural norms governing heavy drinking, and the means people
use to control the need to drink.
