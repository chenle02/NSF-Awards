Description: This project supports collaboration by Dr. Joseph Liu, Professor
of Engineering at Brown University, and an Egyptian scientist: Dr. Reda
Mankabadi, Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Cairo University. The research
deals with the various facets of heat transfer under longitudinal vorticity
systems. This includes the effect of various manifestations of vorticity systems
when faced with different leading edge structures or fine-grained turbulence in
the boundary layer. The effect of fluid injection as well as compressibility due
to large temperature load effects will also be studied. Applications are
directed at flow and heat transfer configurations in independent experimental
efforts elsewhere. The methods used will include analyses and numerical
computations including spectra and finite-difference schemes. The proposed
research should provide a better understanding of heat transfer enhancement,
resulting from the appearance of streamwise vortices, that is essential in the
heat (and material) transfer control and augmentation. It should provide
improvement in design of new devices in applications such as heat transfer
problems in turbomachinery and heat exchangers. Scope: This project brings
together two scientists with long experiences and capabilities in research in
the field of turbomachinery analysis. The collaborative project seeks
improvements in the design and manufacture of heat exchangers, particularly
those used in power stations, and thus contribute to the loss reduction and
energy savings in both countries. The work will involve participation of
graduate students and dissemination of research background and results to
undergraduate students. The project meets the objectives of the Division of
International Programs.
