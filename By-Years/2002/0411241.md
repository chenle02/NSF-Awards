Discipline: Civil Engineering (54)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this
project is to integrate active learning (specifically, Problem-Based Learning-
PBL) with an array of instructional technologies (including eTEACH adapted for
the University of Wisconsin) to enhance both teaching and learning. The PBL
models being adapted are drawn from sucessful applications at the University of
Delware, San Diego State University, University of California-Irvine, and
others. CME 430 - Land Development, traditionally a lecture-based content-
oriented course has been transformed into a technologically advanced course that
uses problem-based-learning (PBL) as the primary pedagogical tool. A design-
build project is being used to provide the PBL experience. The Industry Advisory
Team (IAT) meets regularly to assist the project. The team played a vital role
in the development of the assessment and evaluation tools. The NDSU Information
Technology Services unit provides support for three hands-on computer lab
sessions related to web page development. Several course lecture sequences were
converted to Power Point and are integrated with the video sequences in eTEACH
throughout the course. The development of the Personal Response System (PRS) is
underway.
