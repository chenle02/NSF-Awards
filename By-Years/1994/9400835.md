This award supports research in algebraic geometry. There are two objectives of
the project. The first is to obtain universal realtions for the values of
Donaldson polynomials on classes of algebraic curvs of arbitrary genus and self-
intersection. The second is to understand global properties of moduli spaces of
bector bundles on surfaces. The research is in the field of algebraic geometry,
one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to the
point where it has, in the past ten years, solved problems that have stood for
centuries. Originally, it treated figures defined in the plane by the simplest
of equations, namely polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not only from
algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it is extensively
used in those fields. Moreover it has proved itself useful in fields as diverse
as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding theory and
robotics.
