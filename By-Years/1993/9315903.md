9315903 Bigio This is investigate the feasibility of developing global measures
of mixing to be used in the evaluation of mixer designs and to compare the
performance of various mixing configurations based on mixing performance. The
quantitative evaluation of mixing extent is a critical problem in polymer and
elastomer processing and the proposed approach, which attempts to develop a
quantitative relationship between the global details of mixing and chaos theory,
is a novel one. If an easily evaluated, global measure of mixing can be
developed, the selection and optimization of the mixing aspects polymer and
elastomer processing can be quantitatively evaluated. At present, materials are
typically "overmixed" because of uncertainty in the mixing efficiency. Such
practices are both time and energy inefficient.
