The proposed research shall systematically investigate the role of laser shaping
parameters in optimizing material removal rates, surface quality, mechanical
properties and residual stresses in laser shaped silicon carbide and SiC/SiC
ceramics. This understanding will be used to machine complex shapes and then
compare such bodies; for the surface finish, mechanical properties and material
removal rates; with those produced by the diamond grinding, water jet cutting
and ultrasonic machining. The proposed research opportunity will give Dr. Todd
an avenue to advance her career and establish an interdisciplinary activities
such as supervising the graduate students in both materials and mechanical
engineering at Illinois Institute of Technology The PI will investigate the role
of laser shaping parameters in laser shaped ceramics and compare those with
materials machined by other techniques such as diamond grinding, water jet
cutting and ultrasonic techniques.
