This award will provide participant support for younger scientists to
participate in Neutrino 2014, the XXVI International Conference on Neutrino
Physics and Astrophysics to be held on June 2-7, 2014 in Boston, MA. Topics of
discussion will be the new neutrino experiments, new experimental results and
the new understanding of them. The Conference will emphasize all sub-fields of
neutrino physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award has a particular focus on
early career scientists and graduate students. The Conference is important in
the education of such young scientists not only because of the presentations
they listen to, but also because during the Conference they directly communicate
with the leading neutrino researchers from around the world who are present at
this International Conference. In addition, the international character of the
Conference fosters the global interaction of the young scientists in this
fundamentally global research endeavor. Furthermore, there will a week-long
exhibit at the Boston Museum of Science which will include spectacular event
displays, actual hardware and talks by leading neutrino physicists, intended for
a general audience.
