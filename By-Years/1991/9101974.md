This project involves further investigation in the area of generation of test
cases for NP-hard problems. This area has to do with the design of efficient
algorithms to produce instances of NP- hard problems with known answers, in such
a way that the sets of instances produced are useful for the empirical testing
of approximation algorithms for these problems. Previous work consisted of
theoretical results concerning the existence of different types of test case
generators, and the design of test case construction algorithms for certain NP-
hard graph problems. For the proposed research the overall goals are to improve
on the generation procedures, to expand their applicability, and to gain more
insight into the relationship between the instances generated by the procedures
and the problem or application instances. The project will include consideration
of construction algorithms for problems in different application areas; and the
investigation, through both analytical and empirical means, of the effect of
well- known approximation algorithms on sets of generated instances.
