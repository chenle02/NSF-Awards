ABSTRACT



An international conference on Complex Analysis will be held on the campus of
the University of Wisconsin-Madison from March 16 to March 19, 2006. The focus
of the meeting will be on Recent rends in complex analysis. The emphasis will be
on the Cauchy-Riemann and related partial differential equations, analyticity
and algebraicity of CR-mappings and equivalence of real submanifolds, Levi-flat
hypersurfaces, solvability of invariant non-principal type operators, analytic
hypoellipticity, interpolation and sampling, proper holomorphic maps, almost
complex manifolds and infinite dimensional complex analysis.

The conference will provide opportunities for an easy exchange of ideas and
consolidation of recent progress in Complex Analysis. In addition, researchers
from Europe and the United States who would not otherwise have the opportunity
to collaborate will find one by this meeting. Moreover the conference will
enable students and recent PhD. graduates to meet leading researchers in the
area and learn about the important unsolved problems.
