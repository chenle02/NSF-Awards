With the support of the Chemistry of Life Processes program of the Division of
Chemistry, Andrew Murkin of the University at Buffalo, the State University of
New York, is studying the mechanisms of isomerization in organic and enzymatic
reactions. Isomerization—the conversion of one compound into another without a
change in molecular formula—is critical to the synthesis of many chemicals and
biomolecules. Three examples of a specific isomerization reaction will be
investigated, one using organic compounds in the presence of a catalyst and the
other two using enzymes from organisms that cause severe infections such as
tuberculosis. Learning how these reactions proceed may lead to the development
of improved catalysts and of pharmaceuticals that act by inhibiting enzymes
associated with various diseases. Educational development will be provided to
undergraduate and graduate students of diverse backgrounds, and local teachers
will be trained to develop hands-on lessons that introduce enzymes to K–12
students.

This project seeks to determine the mechanisms of Lewis acid- and enzyme-
catalyzed rearrangement of alpha-ketol substrates using substituent effects and
kinetic isotope effects (KIEs). The BF3-catalyzed rearrangement of
dibenzylglycolaldehyde derivatives will be investigated first, and estimates the
transition state structure will be established by quantum mechanical
calculations that utilize the experimental results on the nature of the rate-
determining step. This structure will serve as a model for comparison with the
transition states of two enzyme-catalyzed reactions that also involve
rearrangement of alpha-ketols. Of the two enzymes, one is expected to utilize a
mechanism analogous to the Lewis acid-catalyzed reaction and should be directly
comparable. Most evidence to date on the second enzyme, however, favors an
alternative mechanism not possible for the first enzyme. This project therefore
aims to clarify this uncertainty, the outcome of which may guide the design of
inhibitors tailored to these enzymes. In the longer term, these studies have the
potential to guide the development of transition state analogue inhibitors for
isomerase enzymes.
