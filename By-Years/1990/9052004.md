The aim of this project is a significant increase in the quality and timeliness
of science education offered at California Polytechnic State University. The
project is providing a bridge between the discipline gaps in biochemistry,
organic chemistry physical chemistry and polymer chemistry by incorporating a
High Resolution Fourier Transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (FT-NMR)
Spectrometer into the Chemistry Department. FT-NMR is an important instrumental
technique which is widely used in all areas of chemistry, materials science,
biology and medicine. This instrument is being used routinely for teaching
purposes in sophomore, junior and senior courses, where modern NMR experiments
can be incorporated into the curricula to educate students, develop their powers
of critical thinking, and encourage them to pursue careers in science. The
instrument is also enabling undergraduate student to carry out meaningful
individual research projects with faculty advisors in each of the above
mentioned areas. The project is having a major impact on the vitality and
productivity of the Chemistry Department. The University is contributing in
excess of 300% of the NSF funds.
