The published record indicates that a multiplicity of fluids is involved in
mantle processes leading to the formation of kimberlites and diamonds. It is the
purpose of the proposed work to contribute to the clarification of the emerging
very complex picture of diamond growth and mantle metasomatism. In particular
the PI will attempt to trace the distribution and origin of highly 13C depleted
mantle carbon further, following the leeds developed by the work carried out so
far. A major new thrust of the proposed work will be the examination of the
oxygen isotope record of silicate in inclusions in diamonds and the carbon
isotopic composition of the host. The studies will be carried out on suites of
samples for which an asthenospheric origin can be postulated as well as on
diamonds which were formed at shallower levels. The results of the work will
provide an important constraint for hypotheses proposing subduction related
origins of diamonds which were formed at 400 to 500 km depth. It is also planned
to delineate further the various mantle carbon reservoirs that are presently
under discussion, and to establish the joint 813C and 818O record left by mantle
metasomatic events.
