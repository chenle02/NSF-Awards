The theory of purity that arises in abelian group theory and, more generally,
module theory may be developed (Crawley-Boevey) in the setting of a locally
finitely presented category. The prototypical example of such a category is the
category of flat (left) modules over a ring R. The pure-injective objects of the
category of flat R-modules are the flat cotorsion modules. The existence of
cotorsion envelopes in the category of left R-modules is a consequence of the
Flat Cover Conjecture (proved by Bican, El Bashir and Enochs). The project
proposes to develop a theory of flat cotorsion modules that generalizes the
classical theory of pure-injective modules over R.

Ring Theory is the area of Algebra that concentrates on the interaction between
possible notions of multiplication and addition. The representation theory of
rings, better known as Representation Theory, is devoted to the study of
modules. These mathematical structures generalize the concept of a vector space
and provide a medium where such instances of multiplication and addition may
manifest themselves. The Model Theory of Modules proposes to understand modules
from the point of view of Mathematical Logic. Thus one is not only interested in
solving linear equations, but also in deciding when a sentence in the
appropriate formal language becomes true when it is assigned a given
interpretation. The modules that arise most naturally from this point of view
(and are the subject of this project) are the pure-injective, or algebraically
compact, modules. They also occur prominently in the classical (non-logical)
approach to Representation Theory and so provide fruitful ground for further
interaction between Algebra and Mathematical Logic.
