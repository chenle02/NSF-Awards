In this project the investigator focuses on linear representations of Gaussian
random fields. He considers models that either avoid explicit computation of the
covariance matrix or do so for relatively small dimensions. The correlation
functions of the considered processes are very general, avoiding particular
symmetries or stationarity. The PI considers models that work in domains of
general dimension and, in particular, on the sphere, for gridded and non-gridded
data. The PI uses hierarchical methods of inference to account for measurement
errors and different sources of information. He develops statistically rigorous
procedures to summarize the information of dynamically evolving random fields in
a reduced number of time series and designs fast Monte Carlo methods that take
advantage of parallel architectures.

The investigator studies statistical models for spatial and spatio-temporal
processes observed at a large number of locations and time steps. The PI's
research addresses the need for increasingly sophisticated models that can deal
with different sources of information, include expert opinion and handle
effectively several sources of uncertainty. While operating on large datasets,
the PI's models consider time evolving dynamics and spatial heterogeneity. This
allows for the analysis of phenomena on global scales, making good use of state
of the art inferential and computational methods. An example of a problem where
unified inferences from a variety of data sources is needed is the prediction of
future climate from different climate models. Climate change prediction
currently has a large societal impact. This research provides tools to enhance
our quantitative understanding of the uncertainties involved in such
predictions. This will improve the ability of decision makers to make quality
policy decisions.
