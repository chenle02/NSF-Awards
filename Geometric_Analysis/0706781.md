The PI proposes to continue his research in geometric structures on low-
dimensional manifolds, deformations of discrete groups, and moduli of surface
group representations. One problem involves completing the classification
problem for proper affine actions, a basic problem in geometry whose history
stretches back to the classification of Euclidean crystallographic groups in the
early 20th century. In the last 25 years, the classification in 3 dimensions has
been reduced to a problem in 2-dimensional hyperbolic geometry. Another side of
this general problem stems from the observation that deformation spaces of
geometric structures are themselves locally modeled on representation spaces of
fundamental groups. This naturally leads to dynamical questions on actions of
mapping class groups. Moduli spaces of surface group representations support
invariant Poisson structures, as well as finer structures depending on a
conformal structure. The dependence of these as the Riemann surface varies over
Teichmueller space is crucial to understanding dynamics of surface group
representations.

This research focuses on the relation between topology and geometry. While
topology concerns the loose qualitative organization of patterns of points,
geometry concerns quantitative measurements such as distance, angle and area.
These two viewpoints are compared through symmetries, leading to algebraic
calculations involving groups. The Experimental Geometry Lab has been a center
for the PI and his students and collaborators (at all levels) to develop tools
for these calculations and visualization. Many of the above projects have an
experimental component and the PI will continue to work with students (from high
school to postdocs) to develop user-friendly software to assist in their
investigation and dissemination.
