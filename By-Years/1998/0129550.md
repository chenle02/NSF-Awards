ABSTRACT Proposat #: CMS-0129550 PI: Arun Phadke Institution: Virginia
Polytechnic Institute and State University Date: July 6, 2001 This workshop
brings together 30 teams of awardees funded by NSF under the 2000 ETI initiative
to discuss and disseminate the results of the exploratory research. The research
targeted a broad class of complex engineering systems in the modern service
industry: those that transport of people, goods, energy, and information,
including highways, railways, air transport, shipping, gas-, fuel-, and water
distribution pipelines, power distribution grids, communications networks and
the Internet. The workshop, scheduled for August 13-14, 2001 in Washington, DC,
is also intended to foster a sense of community among the participants which
would lead to cross-fertilization of ideas belonging to the different fields of
engineering.
