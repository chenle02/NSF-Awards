The Division of Chemistry supports Daniel de Lill of the University of Nevada at
Reno as an American Competitiveness in Chemistry Fellow. Dr. de Lill will
synthesize and characterize new ligands for the complexation and sensitization
of lanthanide ions. In addition, he will study the ability of the lanthanide-
ligand complexes to bind to nanocrystalline quantum dots. The latter work will
be carried out in collaboration with scientists at Los Alamos National
Laboratory. For his plan for broadening participation, the PI will work with
media and public relations experts to create and promote YouTube videos,
suitable for young audiences, highlighting the impact of chemistry in modern
society.

Research like that of Dr. de Lill is aimed at developing new materials for
better phosphorescent materials, as well as developing a better understanding of
how current materials work. The ultimate goal of research like this is to
develop new materials with improved performance in lighting, displays and other
applications. The efforts at broadening participation being pursued by Dr. de
Lill are aimed at increasing the participation of young people from
underrepresented groups in the sciences.
