The sizes and numbers of gas bubbles in water are reflected in the
susceptibility to cavitation and in the acoustical properties. Acoustic probing
is a simple and robust experimental method for obtaining information about the
population of bubbles; however, the conversion of the measured data requires
solution of a complex ill-posed inverse problem. This project will incorporate
the multi-phase character of the bubbles into the model used for solving
problems of this kind. Multi-phase flow and bubble dynamics will be modelled to
obtain proper equations for determination of the bubble population; and the
resulting ill-posed problems will be solved by regularization. This solid
theoretical framework can be used to design instruments for accurate
determination of the bubble population.
