The transport properties of electrons and phonons in systems with lateral
dimensions less than the dominant phonon wavelength will be studied. Typically,
this criterion is met in structures with lateral dimensions less than 100nm and
at lattice temperatures below 1K. Wires of these dimensions will be defined on a
substrate using electron-beam techniques. In order to avoid the effects of
coupling between the substrate phonons and the modes of the wire, the structures
will be made free-standing using etching techniques. At sufficiently low
temperatures, they expect to observe spatial quantization of the phonons in the
wires and so a commensurate reduction in the dimensionality describing the
phonon spectrum. Details of the spectrum will be ascertained by studying the
conductance variations of metallic wires that are shorter than the inelastic
scattering length of the electrons. In longer wires, magneto-conductance
measurements will be used to study the electron-phonon interaction in systems of
reduced phonon and electron dimensionality. Finally, he will investigate phonon
scattering processes and phonon localization effects in free-standing dielectric
and semiconducting wires.
