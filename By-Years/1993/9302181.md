9302182 Dawson This award supports the Peromyscus (Deer Mouse) Genetic Stock
Center. The Stock Center contains thirty well- characterized mutant lines and
six stocks of "wild-type" animals representing five species. Two highly inbred
strains of deer mouse are also maintained. Live and preserved animals, fresh and
frozen tissues, molecular libraries and probes, and other materials derived from
Peromyscus are provided to the scientific community as a resource. Utilization
of the Stock Center has nearly quadrupled since 1986. A total of 3230 animals
and specimens were supplied to external researchers in 27 states during the past
5 1/2 years. Expansion of the Center will include two additional species, P.
truei, P. boylii, and one or more inbred strains of white-footed mouse (P.
leucopus). Enhancement of the electronic interface capacity with genetic data
bases for other species requires installation of a highspeed computer
workstation. Improved organization of the reference collection of reprints,
photographs and other reference materials will be accomplished. Completion of a
Peromyscus gene catalog and its entry into an electronic database is projected.
The peromyscus Molecular Bank will accelerate its acquisition of a wide variety
of peromyscine unique sequence probes and diversity of DNA libraries and promote
their utilization. Current services and activities of the Stock Center,
including publication of PEROMYSCUS NEWSLETTER, will continue. ***
