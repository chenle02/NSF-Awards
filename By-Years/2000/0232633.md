This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
engineered closed cell ceramic foams, suitable for low temperature processing,
to replace lower performing metallic and open cell ceramic foams now in
widespread use. Design specific requirements will be accommodated by ceramic
selection, porosity control and reinforcement technique. A unique capability to
be developed is self-healing of cracks to prevent damage to fiber reinforcements
in hot gas environments. The project includes fluid flow and finite element
modeling. Samples will be fabricated and mechanical and thermal measurements
taken to explore material performance sensitivity to key design variables. It is
anticipated that the research will result in a family of low cost, low density,
self-healing ceramic foams, with widespread application.

Commercially, closed cell ceramic foams will improve the performance of high
temperature systems used in the power, chemical and transportation industries,
resulting in three major benefits to society; lower process cost, reduced
consumption of fossil fuel and lower pollution levels.
