This award from the U.S.- Argentina Cooperative Science Program supports
research in materials science to be conducted by Dr. Saul Oseroff of San Diego
state University and Dr. Manuel Tovar of the Centro Atomico Bariloche (CAB), Rio
Negro, Argentina. The project focuses on the study of correlation of the
magnetic and superconducting properties of doped R2CuO4 compounds. The project
centers on the possibility of finding a correlation between the appearance of a
weak ferromagnetic component (WF) and loss of superconductivity in the heavier
rare-earth cuprates. Compounds, which when doped with Ce or Th, do not become
superconductors. A series of experiments are proposed including ones involving
the effects of hydrostatic and axial pressure on the magnetic and
superconducting properties. The project continues an active and successful
collaboration between two able and productive groups. *** //
