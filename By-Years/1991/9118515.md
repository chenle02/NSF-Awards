The principal investigator will study rocks from the Proterozoic crust of the
midcontinent region of the USA, utilizing age-dating and other geochemical
techniques. The main aim of the present work is to better understand the extent
of older basement beneath granite-rhyolite provinces, as well as the genesis of
the granite- rhyolite magmas. This work is important in helping us understand
the geologic evolution of North America.
