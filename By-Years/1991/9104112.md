Unusual structural, electronic, thermodynamic, and reactivity characteristics of
the actinide and related elements will be determined. Phenomena to be
investigated include metal-ligand bond enthalpies and reaction thermodynamics,
metal-heteroelement bond chemistry, ancillary ligand effects and
enantioselective transformations, the activation of hydrocarbon and related
molecules, metal-metalloid and metal-metal bonds, as well as unusual oxidation
states and ligands. The long range goal is to understand those structural and
electronic factors which modulate chemical reactivity, and to capitalize on
features which stimulate new or enhanced modes of chemical reactivity. %%% In
this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of the
Chemistry Division, Dr. Tobin J. Marks of Northwestern University will continue
studies of the organometallic chemistry of actinide and related elements. The
basic scientific goal is to understand the factors that determine chemical
reactivity, a knowledge that may allow enhanced reactivity of certain catalyst
systems. The results may also be of use in dealing with nuclear wastes and
learning more about their effect on the environment.
