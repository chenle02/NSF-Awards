Support is provided for renovating a high capacity (2,000 Kips) Baldwin
compression machine so that it will serve a multi-user high pressure temperature
research apparatus. Typical planned projects requiring the specific research
equipment include: experimental and numerical investigation of the compaction of
metal and ceramic powers for forming structural elements over wide ranges of
pressure and temperature, and fundamental investigations of engineering
properties of high strength cementitious materials. Other applications of this
research equipment include the investigation of problems associated with
geological materials and rock mechanics. To make effective use of the test
machine as a research tool, the machine would be retrofitted with a new
hydraulic power supply, an electronic closed-loop control unit, and a pressure
die module of about 6-in. diameter in the l0-50 Ksi and l,200 degrees C ranges
of pressure and temperature for consolidating powders into structural elements.
