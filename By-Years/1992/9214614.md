PROGRAM: Academic Research Infrastructure Program Summary: The Academic
Research Infrastructure (ARI) program supports 1) acquisition or development of
major research instrumentation, and/or 2) repair, renovation, or in exceptional
cases, replacement of obsolete science and engineering research facilities. This
proposal from the University of South Florida (USF) requests funds to purchase
an transmission electron microscope. The instrument will be operated as a
shared-use facility to support research and teaching efforts of scientists in
the St. Petersburg/Tampa area at USF and Eckerd College. The instrument will be
housed in the new Marine Science Building at USF, and USF will provide a full-
time technician to support the instrument. The University will also supply
matching funds to purchase the instrument.
