This grant is for continued research in four areas of active vision: pre-
categorical gaze control for estimating kinetic depth, time to adjacency,
symmetry, and relative motion; object identification and tracking using
opponent-color histograms; spatial memory and saccadic gaze control using
object-centered frames of reference; and connectionist architectures for real-
time task management.
