9312635 Sogah The synthesis and characterization of polypeptide-based hybrid
polymers of controlled architecture will be explored. The long- term objective
of this program is to find ways to induce higher- order conformationally defined
structures into synthetic polymers by combining biochemical concepts, organic
chemistry and polymer chemistry, and lay the ground work for predictable control
of polymer chain folding. Methods will be sought to control the sequence,
topology and surface functionality of synthetic polymers. There are three parts
to the project: The first one involves design, synthesis and characterization of
repetitive oligopeptides of controlled sequence and high propensity to form
reverse-turns (beta-turns), pleated beta-sheets and alpha-helices. The second
part concerns the design and synthesis of novel organic, non- peptidic beta-turn
mimics that are convergent and rigid for controlling chain folding and topology
of advanced materials. Two broad classes of organic motifs will be targeted: (i)
flat U-shaped motifs, designed specifically to induce sheets, and (ii) non-
planar symmetric motifs for initiation of helical and twisted ribbon-like
structures. The final part involves linking the oligopeptides and the turn
mimics to give oligomeric telechelic building blocks containing either diamino
or dicarboxyl end groups. Polycondensation with diisocyanates, diacid chlorides,
diamines and/or diols, will be carried out to give novel hybrid polymers. For
materials of controlled sequence and topology, Alpha-Beta-type oligomeric
building blocks containing alpha-amino, omega-activated carboxyl groups will be
synthesized. Polymerization of these will give the expected polymers of
controlled sequence, predetermined chain folding and judiciously placed
functional groups. Physical properties, such as thermal and elastic behavior,
modulus, tensile and compressive strengths will be measured. The capability to
predictably control chain folding of synthetic polymers is expected to lead to
novel polymers of predetermined modulus and controlled crystallization.
Potential applications are anticipated in preparation of chiral catalysts,
chromatographic packing materials for chiral separations, biocompatible polymers
and in electronics. It is anticipated that the polymers will degrade into
environmentally benign by-products. ***
