In recent years deformation of algebraic and topological structures has given
rise to important structures such as quantum groups, vertex algebras, and
homotopy Lie algebras which in turn have important connections with other areas
of mathematics and physics. The representation theory of quantum groups and
vertex algebras are better understood than the representation theory of homotopy
Lie algebras. An NSF/ CBMS regional conference on "Deformation Theory of
Algebras and Modules" is proposed to be held at North Carolina State University
during the week of May 16 - May 20, 2011 with Professor Martin Markl of the
Mathematical Institute of the Czech Academy as the principal lecturer who will
deliver ten lectures on deformations of algebras and modules. Professor Markl
will shed new light on these seemingly unrelated algebraic structures. This in
turn will generate discussions among participating algebraists, topologists as
well as mathematical physicists to explore new frontiers of research in
deformation theory. It is hoped that this will lead to research collaborations
among participants. In particular, it may result in a better understanding of
the representations of homotopy Lie algebras.

A major objective of this conference is to foster new collaborations among
algebraists and topologists working on various aspects of deformation theory.
The proposed lecture series will be of immense educational value to the
participating graduate students and young researchers from universities in the
southeastern region of USA. Furthermore, this lecture series will help enhance
the research collaborations between researchers in USA and Eastern Europe, and
provide international exposure to participating US graduate students and junior
researchers. It will also help attract strong graduate students from Eastern
Europe to NCSU and other US universities in the southeastern region.
