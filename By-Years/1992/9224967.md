9224967 Ashe This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic
Program supports research by Dr. Arthur J. Ashe of the Chemistry Department,
University of Michigan, on organometallic compounds of Groups 13, 14, and 15.
Emphasis would be placed on the investigation of borepins and other compounds
with multiple bonds to carbon, synthesis of polyacetylenes with heteroatoms on
the backbone, and secondary bonding in dibimuthines and related organobismuth
compounds. Compounds would be characterized by X-ray crystallography,
electrochemical measurements, and NMR studies. Delocalization and aromaticity in
borepins will be studied with the aid of computational methods and some novel
compounds of transition metals with bismolyls will be prepared. %%% The general
goal of this project is to investigate new compounds in which elements such as
boron, gallium, silicon, tin, and bismuth have multiple bonds to carbon. The
character and reactivity of these bonds are not well known. In addition, many of
these species will be associated with transition metals, introducing the
possibility that compounds with interesting solid state properties wil be
formed. ***
