This proposal requests funds to support student travel to the IEEE International
Conference on Software Maintenance (ICSM 2012) that will be hosted in Trento,
Italy in Sept 2012. This is an international conference and a top venue for
topics related to software development lifecycle. The conference is an
educational opportunity for the students and will help build the next generation
of researchers in this field. The international experience has the additional
broader impact of building a global workforce for science and engineering.
