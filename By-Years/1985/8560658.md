Many unicellular algae produce large quantities of oils as food storage
compounds and can be grown autotrophically in culture, requiring only light,
carbon dioxide, water and a few minerals. This research addresses the growth of
algal species autotrophically in the presence of 99.7% deuterium oxide (D20),
thereby replacing all the cellular hydrogen with deuterium and biologically
producing perdeuterated hydrocarbons. The objectives of this research are:
define optimal culture conditions and select strains of oil-producing algae
which exhibit exceptional growth in 99.7% D20; identify procedures for efficient
harvest of the cultures, extraction of the perdeuterated oils, and recycling of
the D20; characterize the lipid components produced by the oil-producing algae
during culture in D20; and design a test bed for comparison of the lubrication
capabilities of the oil extracted from the algae. The potential cost reduction
of the deuterated lubricants when produced biologically will undoubtedly
increase the scope of the use of these high performance compounds.
