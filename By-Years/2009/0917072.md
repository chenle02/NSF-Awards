This research addresses interactivity and scalability in automatically analyzing
large collections of video and multiple video streams processed continuously.
This work is developing mechanisms to enable real-time interactive video search
for user defined concepts using intelligent, active processing clusters and
methods for performing high-accuracy semantic video analysis from large amounts
of weakly-labeled video over distributed computing resources. The methods
leverage modern cluster file systems where data is stored on the local disks of
the compute servers, and the location of data is made available to the runtime
system to allow co-location of compution and storage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
specific research objectives are to allow co-location of compute and storage
through a runtime for parallel stream processing that parallelizes data
processing and machine learning tasks across a cluster of multi-core compute
nodes. The project also extends distributed versions of graphic model algorithms
to speed computation of both the basic low-level signal processing steps and for
the semantic analysis based on weakly labeled video data as currently available
on the web. The main outcome is to demonstrate vastly accelerated, complete
processing of parallel live video streams into a retrieval database with
immediate search capabilities and accessing cluster resources during interactive
search. The goal of this work is to develop principles for interactive
applications driven by real-time processing of high-rate streaming data. The
processing architecture and modules developed in this work will enable computer
vision and multimedia developers to efficiently apply and test their own methods
within this framework. &lt;br/&gt;
