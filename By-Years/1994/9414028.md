9414028 Beard The data-handling equipment supplied here will form the "Event
Reconstruction Facility" at Hampton University. This facility will allow the
reconstruction and analysis of data taken in the course of the study of nuclear
structure and properties at the CEBAF laboratory. This will allow a more active
research program at Hampton, and expand its present research significantly. ***
