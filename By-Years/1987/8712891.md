Catalytic surfaces for hydrocarbon cracking and dehydrogenation have been known
in the petroleum industry to become inactive after some use because of carbon or
"coke" coating. The proposed research is directed toward using such coatings,
preferably produced under conditions simulating the environment of such
operating machinery as the "adiabatic" diesel engine, as self-replenishing solid
lubricants. Continued wear of the carbon coatings would maintain catalytic
activity of the substrate. The operating temperatures in the piston-
ring/cylinder area of such a diesel engine and the preferred temperature of
catalytic coke generation by some transition metals happen to coincide in the
500-600 C range. Adsorption of combustion chamber gases on these carbons would
further reduce friction and wear. The same transition metals, in alloys or in or
on ceramics are also close to hydrocarbons. The suggested research program will
use pin-on-disk testers on reproducibly prepared samples and determine the
friction and wear rates, rates of carbon formation and rates of carbon oxidation
to help guide the design and materials selection for high temperature
lubrication in an engine environment.
