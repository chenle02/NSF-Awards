An important area of current astronomical research concerns the study of mass
loss of red giant stars as they evolve to white dwarfs through the "planetary
nebula" stage. Although this research is significant to an understanding of
stellar evolution in its own right, it is also important because planetary
nebulae are bright and may be observed comparatively easily. Thus, planetary
nebulae are particularly convenient objects to study to learn the properties of
"circumstellar matter", material which has has been recently ejected from hot
stars in densities intermediate between stellar and interstellar gas material.
Matter in a similar state also occurs around stars for different reasons, in
particular as "disks" around interacting binary stars, B-emission stars, and
dense molecular interstellar clouds. However, in these environments it is often
difficult to observe this gas and to diagnose its properties. The Principal
Investigator (PI) proposes to continue previous NSF-supported research on the
physical and chemical properties of matter as it leaves the star in a dense
"wind" and eventually mingles with ambient interstellar gas. The PI will
determine reaction rates among atoms, molecules, and radiation (starlight) in
order to understand the distribution of forms of matter (ions, neutral atoms,
and molecules). Because these atoms radiate away thermal energy that they absorb
from gas motions, this knowledge will lead to an understanding of the
temperature and density of matter at different distances from the star.
Comparisons of these theoretical predictions can then be made with new
observations from radio (millimeter wavelength) arrays. The correctness of the
models will then be evaluated.
