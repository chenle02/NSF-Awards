The purpose of this project is to study connections between different aspects of
geometry: birational geometry and differential geometry. Specifically, it deals
with natural questions on how many geometric objects possessing given properties
arising both in algebraic geometry and differential geometry do exist. Such
questions are known as "boundedness of classes of algebraic varieties." The
project is divided in two parts in which the PI will especially aim to
understand different geometrical aspects related to the boundedness of certain
classes of varieties (geometric objects defined as zero loci of polynomial
equations) and applications of such results. The main aim is to develop methods
that can be used to extend classical results in low-dimensional geometry to
higher dimensions using techniques arising from the developed in the last 20
years theory known as the "minimal model program." Some of these results will
have application to string theory in mathematical physics.

The first part of the project focuses on boundedness of Calabi-Yau varieties.
Even though Calabi-Yau manifolds are very simple algebraic varieties from many
points of view, their boundedness properties are still poorly understood. The
main goal of this part of the project is to study elliptic fibered Calabi-Yau
varieties. It is known that in low dimensions they satisfy interesting
boundedness properties and the PI intends to extend such results in arbitrary
dimension. These results have applications to the minimal model program, the
classification of algebraic varieties and F-theory. The last part of this
project aims to explore the implications of similar techniques to the theory of
Kahler-Einstein metric with cone-edge singularities. The main motivation for
this project is the study of the birational geometry of toroidal
compactifications of ball quotients and more generally of higher ranks locally
symmetric varieties. As part of this project, the PI intends to develop
techniques that eventually will work even with compactifications of finite
volume Kahler manifolds with pinched negative sectional curvature.
