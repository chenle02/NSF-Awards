ECS-9710297 Bai The blind system identification is a variant of the ordinary
system identification, in which the input signal to the system is unknown.
Despite its wide use in a host of communication and signal processing
applications, there is a lack of understanding and efficient schemes . Existing
methods of blind system identification can be devided into two categories. The
first one assumes some statistical information, usually a whiteness condition,
on the unknown input signal, and infeasible approach in many applications since
inputs are unknown. The second method is to use training signals and thus reduce
the blind system identification to the ordinary system identification. Although
simple, this method significantly reduces the efficiency because training
signals have sent again and again. For example, in the GSM standard for mobile
communication, more than one quarter of the communication capability is used to
send training signals instead of sending message signals. This project intends
to conduct a thorough study of the blind system identification problem based on
our preliminary study in which a new scheme was developed. To the best knowledge
of the author, the scheme we propose is the first and in fact the only blind
system identification scheme without requiring any a priori information on the
unknown input. The proposed research will build on our preliminary results and
focus on some fundamental issues as well as on developing algorithms. The
expected strategies for conducting such a study are outlined in the proposal.
