9505730 STEPHEN This renewal award supports development of instrumentation for
deploying seismometers in the deep ocean at a hole (OSN-1) drilled by the Ocean
Drilling Program near the island of Hawaii. The overall objective is to enable
measurement of seismic activity accurately and over long periods at ocean bottom
sites, to fill major gaps in recording worldwide earthquake activity which is
primarily limited to land measurements. With their previous award, these Woods
Hole Oceanographic Investigators, in collaboration with colleagues at Scripps
Institution of Oceanography, have prepared and tested (in a test well on land) a
seismograph system suitable for installation in a borehole. In the present work
they will prepare a suitable housing for the seismometer to withstand deep-
ocean pressures, and will design and build equipment to install the seismograph
and data recording package in the ocean bottom borehole from a ship at the sea
surface.
