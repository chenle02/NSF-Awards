Quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) are a method of computing via quantum
effects. QCA are arrays of quantum-dot cells with each cell containing a regular
arrangement of quantum dots and a limited number of electrons. The electrons are
allowed to tunnel between dots. The particular arrangement of cells reflects the
computational problem, while the lowest energy distribution of electrons
reflects the computational result. QCA have garnered much attention because they
seem to be physically realizable with slight improvements in current fabrication
techniques. Advantages include faster computation, denser circuits, and
extremely low power consumption.&lt;br/&gt;In a QCA circuit composed of
primitive QCA logic devices, the state of downstream devices can adversely
affect the state of upstream devices. A partial solution stems from redesigning
the primitive elements. One aspect of this work is to quantify the cost of
redesigned elements, to devise more cost-effective solutions, and to determine
the risks of using uncorrected devices. The second aspect involves designing QCA
for higher operational temperatures via architectural changes. The third aspect
concerns investigation of QCA-like devices with smoother energy spaces for
eliminating meta-stable states.&lt;br/&gt;The education plan includes the
development of a new CS/EE graduate course, entitled New Architectures for
Computing. The course will feature theory and practice concerning QCA, pure
quantum computing, DNA computing, and other novel architectures. The theory
portion will include modules stemming from portions of the research plan.
Students will chose a topic, perform a small but significant amount of original
research, and submit a paper to an appropriate venue.&lt;br/&gt;
