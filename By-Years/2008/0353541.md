With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor
Viktor V. Zhdankin, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of
Minnesota, Duluth, is exploring the chemistry of hypervalent compounds of iodine
and bismuth. His studies include the preparation and structural characterization
of new classes of hypervalent iodine- and bismuth-containing heterocycles, the
evaluation of synthetic approaches to organic derivatives of heptavalent iodine,
and the development of new synthetic methodologies based on hypervalent iodine
complexes, iodine heterocycles, amino acid-derived hypervalent iodine
dicarboxylates, and phosphorane-derived iodanes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this
Research in Undergraduate Institutions award, the Organic and Macromolecular
Chemistry Program is providing renewed support for the research efforts of
Professor Viktor V. Zhdankin, of the Department of Chemistry at the University
of Minnesota, Duluth. Through the study of new structural types of compounds
containing iodine or bismuth, Professor Zhdankin will enhance our understanding
of the structure and reactivity of these unusual compounds, develop new reagents
and procedures for organic synthesis, and search for new compounds with unusual
and useful properties. These studies will be carried out primarily by
undergraduate students from the University of Minnesota, Duluth.
