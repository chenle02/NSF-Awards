9408215 Adkins The structure of positronium is governed almost entirely by QED.
Strong and weak interactions are small compared to electrodynamic effects. The
research concentrates on the energy levels and decay rates of this system and is
designed to resolve the present discrepancies between theory and experiment.
Comparison of theory and experiment will provide an excellent test of the bound
state formalism and QED. ***
