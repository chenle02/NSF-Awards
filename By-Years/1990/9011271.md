This is a three.year collaborative Research project between Dr. George Keulks,
University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee and Dr. C. S. Fang of Institute of Physics,
Academia Sinica, Taiwan, sponsored by the AIT.CCNAA Cooperative Science Program.
This proposal was submitted by Dr. David Tong, who was a NSF Program Director
for the Condensed Matter Theory Program. Because NSF does not allow previous
program officers to negotiate with the Foundation within a year of the person's
departure, Dr. George Keulks replaces Dr. Tong as a P. I. for this proposal.
This proposal plans to study the formation of metal semiconductor interfaces and
subsequent growth of semiconductor substrates. The Institute of Physics Academia
Sinica in Taiwan has invested more than 1 million dollars in the acquisition of
state.of.the.art ultra.high vacuum spectroscopic instruments, which are
essential in making experimental measurements for testing Tong's semiconductor
structure model. At present, Taiwan's Institute of Physics is one of the few
places where such >measurements can be made and only place which makes
experimental >measurements on the metal, Ga. This study can expand our
understanding of surface structure, which is essential in the development of new
and advanced materials, many which have been used for making computer chips and
other electronics.
