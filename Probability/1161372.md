This mathematics research project belongs to the interface of probability,
convex geometry, and functional analysis. One of the main areas of investigation
is the non-asymptotic theory of random matrices, a new and rapidly developing
area of research, which analyzes spectral characteristics of a random matrix of
large, but fixed size, and strives to obtain bounds, which are valid with high
probability. The requirements for such bounds arise naturally in convex geometry
and geometric functional analysis, where random matrices are used to study
typical sections of a high-dimensional convex body. Another direction of this
research is the geometry of non-symmetric convex bodies, where the probabilistic
methods also play a crucial role.

Several components of this mathematics research project are motivated by
problems in computer science and engineering. These include signal
reconstruction problems arising in computer tomography, as well as questions
related to protecting privacy while releasing statistical information. Rudelson
and his collaborators will establish new connections between probability and
geometric functional analysis with the objective to study the spectral
properties of random matrices. Random matrices have become the main model for
signal reconstruction in wireless communication and can lead to a better
understanding of the convergence of many computer science algorithms.
