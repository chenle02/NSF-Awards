Theoretical research in physics will focus on studies of the quantum field
theory of physical systems at high temperatures and densities, and on studies of
the statistical properties of cosmic and fundamental strings. The work on
quantum field theory at high temperatures will explore the foundations of a
poorly - understood area of physics. This work will have broad applications in
both particle physics and condensed matter physics.
