Expertise creep (hereafter creep) occurs when an advisor gives advice on a topic
that extends beyond his or her knowledge. Creep is a problem because the same
lack of expertise that causes decision makers to seek advice, limits their
ability to evaluate advice quality. Since sound decision making depends on good
advice, this requires that prospective advisors who know very little about a
topic should be unwilling to give advice, while prospective advisors who know a
lot about the topic should give advice. Unfortunately, since people do not
generally know the true extent of their knowledge, the best that can be hoped
for is that prospective advisors will consult their subjective knowledge before
deciding whether or not to give advice. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on this
reasoning, the current research will explore the factors that moderate the
relationship between a prospective advisor's subjective knowledge and their
willingness to give advice (WTGA). Viable factors for examination are surfaced
from prior work on social compliance/resistance and Judge-Advisor Systems (JAS).
Research on resistance suggests that to resist a request, such as one for
advice, one must be motivated to care about the accuracy of his/her advice. This
idea gives rise to a number of different factors that should influence WTGA.
Likewise, the JAS literature has identified a number of factors that influence
willingness to use advice. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is
unique, in that for most of the past JAS studies, the advisor's knowledge level
is not considered or measured. Additionally, no prior studies have examined an
advisor?s WTGA and its relation to their subjective knowledge. The main
objective of this research is to fill this gap. A secondary objective is to
develop a normative standard for identifying when advisors creep beyond their
expertise.
