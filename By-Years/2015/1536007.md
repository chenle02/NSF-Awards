The International Gender Summit is held annually, to highlight the role and
status of women in STEM disciplines. This fifth summit, International Gender
Summit Africa 2015 (GSA), recognizes the multitude of scientific and economic
opportunities available on the continent. The summit will provide a link between
enhancing African economic prosperity and increasing the presence and status of
women in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chicago School of Professional
Psychology conducts a project titled Opportunities for UnderRepresented Scholars
(OURS), which provides leadership training, culminating in a post-graduate
certificate in academic leadership, to STEM women of color in faculty and
administrator positions at minority-serving institutions of higher education.
The project leaders and four alumnae of the program will attend and make
presentations on aspects of OURS at GSA, focusing primarily on concerted efforts
to: (1) raise awareness; (2) disseminate effective best practices; and (3)
contribute to the ongoing leadership development of women of color in the
academic STEM disciplines.
