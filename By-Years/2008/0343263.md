This planning grant for department level reform will create a new department of
electrical and computer engineering at the University of North Texas. The
establishment of the proposed program, coincident with the creation of a new
College of Engineering at the University of North Texas, will result in the
development of a model curriculum that represents a significant change in the
way we educate Electrical Engineering students. This innovative curriculum will
introduce students to integrated project-oriented industrial experiences at the
freshman level, with additional project-oriented courses added each semester.
Instructors recruited from nearby industries will help teach the project-
oriented courses. Such university-industry collaboration will help students
integrate theory and practice, ensuring that the engineering curriculum
continues to be relevant, competitive, and directed towards future technological
developments. While traditional programs in electrical engineering emphasize
modular structures and specialty disciplines this approach combines insights
from cognitive science with an appreciation of the practical challenges raised
by focusing students' attention on projects in a class. Thus, we propose to
integrate project-based learning throughout the curriculum. The expected
benefits of our approach include increased student participation in the learning
process (active learning and self-learning), enhanced communication skills,
adaptation of pedagogies to a wider set of learning styles, and promotion of
critical and proactive thinking. Major features of the approach are the
partnership between industry and the university, the focus on active learning,
the emphasis on teaming, and the importance of laboratory activities applied to
real-world problems.
