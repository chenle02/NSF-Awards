Recent research has indicated that it is surprisingly difficult to achieve
conceptual understanding in many fundamental topics in science. The primary
focus of this project will be learning studies aimed at fostering conceptual
understanding, where individuals or pairs of students are taken through a lesson
sequence and encouraged to think aloud during the sequence. A specific goal of
the project is to develop exemplary lessons that can foster conceptual change in
difficult areas. A more general goal is to identify critical learning processes
and teaching strategies in successful science lessons that can guide curriculum
developers and teacher trainers in other science areas. On the basis of
preliminary studies, we propose to develop a set of learning study methodologies
that use a combination of descriptive and experimental methods. In addition to
whether students are learning from the lessons, the studies will focus on
identifying which teaching strategies are critical and why students are learning
from them. Major outcomes of the project will include: (1) a set of exemplary
science lessons for promoting conceptual change; (2) new methodologies for
conducting learning studies in educational research; (3) descriptions of
critical learning processes; and (4) descriptions of general teaching strategies
for use in science lessons in other areas.
