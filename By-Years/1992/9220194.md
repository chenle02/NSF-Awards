The National Distance Learning Center (NDLC) at Owensboro Community College is
establishing a connection to NSFNET via an existing 1.544 million bits per
second line through the University of Kentucky and the SURANET mid-level
network. The connection enables the research and education community to access
the NDLC database over the Internet as well as by modem, as is done now.
Owensboro's faculty and students will also be able to communicate and
collaborate with the international scientific and educational community, and to
access network resources such as libraries, databases and supercomputers. This
award funds part of the costs for two years.
