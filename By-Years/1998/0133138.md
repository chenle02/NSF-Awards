The aim of this project is to develop an approach for conducting solid state
chemical synthesis that provides the degrees of synthetic freedom of the liquid
phase. The method utilizes molecules, as linear templates, to direct alignment
of reactive sites using the strength and directionality of hydrogen bonds. The
goals include: (1) expanding the methods to reaction homology by developing
families of templates and reactants and (2) applying products of the approach
for the design of a class of porous crystalline materials known as inverted
metal-organic frameworks. These materials will be engineered to possess tunable
pores of nanoscale dimensions lined with organic functionality. The ability to
synthesize the organic building blocks of these materials in the solid state
means that access to porous solids not achievable by other synthetic methods may
be realized. The program seeks to integrate research ideas with education at the
local, regional, and national level through events such as campus workshops that
introduce students to green chemistry and materials
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solid-state chemical techniques provide an
environmentally-friendly, or 'green' alternative to synthetic processes that
rely on toxic organic solvents or routes to new molecules and materials with
unique properties. For example, strategies for the design of porous crystalline
solids are of much interest owing to their promise to deliver materials with
properties that improve upon traditional and industrially important inorganic
solids such as zeolites, a class of materials i&lt;br/&gt;
