The general objective of this project is to fully explore the "change-Pumping
network (CPN)" concept, and to transform it into a very densely integrable
family of microelectronic neural networks. The CPN, in its generic form, is the
simplest interconnected array of MOS gated-diodes. It is capable of performing
inner product and thresholding operations in one direction and weighted
averaging in the opposite in a simultaneous fashion over the same synaptic
matrix. Yet, no visible feedback path exists in the array. This creates a very
rich bidirectional neural functionality in a very compact network. The research
plan includes the development and refinement of network synthesis procedures, a
search for self-learning ability and the entire design/fab/test cycle for
implementing five different target architectures. The goal is to extend the
knowledge base in neural network synthesis by offering a general procedure for
non-negative synaptic matrix design, and to help develop a knowledge base in
collective multistability Through an analysis of this fundamental concept.
