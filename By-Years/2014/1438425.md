This project examines the mechanical properties of liquid interfaces that are
coated by small particles. When the number of particles on a liquid interface is
large, the particles can form arrangements called mesostructures, which can
change the mechanical stiffness, permeability, appearance, or other properties
of the interface. The project will use a combination of experiments, theory, and
numerical calculations to show how mesostructure formation affects mechanical
properties of the interface. Interfaces covered with particles appear in a wide
variety of technological and biological applications including microcapsule
formulations for food products and drug delivery, separations in mining
operations, and improved, low-toxicity dispersants for treating oil
contamination in bodies of water. The information obtained in this project will
provide new methods for scientists and engineers to predict, analyze, and
control the mechanical properties of interfaces, which can lead to innovative
and mechanically robust products. This project will also support the training of
undergraduate and graduate students for careers in science or engineering, and
it will support outreach to K-12 students and teachers.

Particle-coated interfaces, called particle sheets, will be fabricated and their
stiffness (moduli) for stretching and bending will be measured. Particle sheets
will be subjected to stress or geometric distortion to identify three distinct
responses, wrinkling or buckling, tearing or cracking, and the formation of
particle-packing defects such as disclinations or dislocations. The response of
a particle sheet to uniaxial compression will provide the bending modulus. The
response to point-like forces imposed on the sheet by poking will provide the
stretching modulus. Changing the curvature of a particle sheet by confining it
on a curved interface will elucidate the competition among wrinkles, cracks and
particle-packing defects. The experimental and theoretical activities in this
project will lead to the development of a structural relaxation phase diagram
for thin sheets composed of particles.
