9418053 Bloomfield DNA functions in crowded, strongly interacting solutions. The
equilibrium and dynamic aspects of its behavior are strongly influenced by its
environment. When the volume occupancy of a solution reaches several tens of
percent, as it does within cells, simple extrapolations from dilute solution
behavior become totally inadequate. Experimental and theoretical approaches will
be applied to study the ways in which high polymer concentrations influence the
diffusion of DNA, and of proteins which bind to DNA. Fluorescence photo
bleaching recovery will be used as a major experimental technique, and modern
polymer theoretical concepts and computer simulation as theoretical tools. %%%
The goal in this project is to develop a solid experimental and theoretical
understanding of the ways in which high polymer concentrations influence the
diffusion of DNA, and of proteins which bind to DNA. This should shed light on
some important questions in cell biology, such as the segregation of plasmids
during cell division in microorganisms, and the location by binding proteins of
their specific binding sites in a background of nonspecific DNA. ***
