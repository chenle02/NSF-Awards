9311289 Espinosa The research to be performed in this investigation will explore
microcracking and inelasticity of ceramics and glasses; deformation mechanisms
occurring at the microlevel when such materials are subjected to high stresses
and strain rates; dynamic propagation of bimaterial cracks; critical conditions
for crack initiation and propagation as a function of mode mixity; dynamic
friction on films at various temperatures; local inelasticity, mircoplasticity
and microcracking in the frictional behavior of interfaces as a function of
surface characteristics and lubrication; thermomechanical characterization of
smart materials; identification of initiation sites for phase transformations,
incubation times and growth kinetics; and the derivation of multidimensional
constitutive models.
