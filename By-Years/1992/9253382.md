The National Center for Atmospheric Research NNCAR) is developing a traveling
interactive exhibit to parallel the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA)
deployment of Terminal Doppler Weather Radars (TDWR) at 47 airports across the
United States. This exhibit, titled "Burstbusters Taming Weather Hazards to
Aviation," will describe how the hazardous weather phenomena were identifies,
how technology was utilized to create a system to detect and predict them, and
how the new system will operate at airports to enhance safety and air traffic
efficiency. large groups of the population not routinely exposed to science
issues will be presented with this case study as an example of how public
science funding can directly affect their lives. The exhibit will capitalize on
this linkage to increase public literacy about the science and technology
processes and to promote parental advocacy of science education for their
children. Two copies of the exhibit will travel to approximately 20 airport
terminals and science museums from June 1993 through September 1995.//
