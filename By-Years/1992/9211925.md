The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division is
supporting research by Lionel Raff at Oklahoma State University on the
theoretical investigation of chemical processes under matrix isolation
conditions. The studies include reaction dynamics, energy transfer, mobility,
and diffusion of fluorine, oxygen, hydrogen, deuterium, and tritium atoms in
matrices of argon, krypton, and xenon. Further, addition reactions of fluorine
and chlorine to ethylene and of HBr to acetylene and subsequent elimination
reactions are being investigated. %%% Many chemical reactions and spectroscopic
properties can be studied most effectively by freezing the species of interest
in a matrix consisting of an inert gas. This research involves a theoretical
investigation of the dynamics of such reactions as well as molecular mobility
and energy transfer under such conditions.
