With an NSF "Small Grant for Exploratory Research", Dr. Amelia Clark will
conduct a brief field season of archaeological research in South Africa. She
will visit the site of Holley Shelter, located in KwaZulu Natal Province,
determine whether any intact archaeological sediment is present and if so, map
its stratigraphy. Slumped material will be removed and a protective sandbag wall
constructed. The site was excavated by an amateur archaeologist in the 1940s and
the results never published. Although Holley Shelter is known to contain a long
cultural sequence, because of the crude excavation techniques originally
employed necessary detail is lacking. It is also unknown whether original
sediments, said to remain after the excavation was completed are still intact
since slumping (to an unknown degree) is possible. Dr. Clark has obtained
landowner permission to work at the site and in this first step, she will
conduct an assessment which will permit her to determine whether future research
is feasible and, if so, how it may best be designed. She will utilize this
opportunity to examine other relevant collections.

The goal of Dr. Clark's longer term research is to gain insight into the
processes which lead to the emergence of behavioral modern humans. Because,
paleontological and genetic evidence indicate that the transition to the
biologically modern species occurred in sub-Saharan Africa and archaeological
data suggest that the behavioral transition took place there as well, much
research has focused on the appropriate time period in this region of the world.
Relevant material has been recovered in KwaZulu Natal and additional evidence
has the potential to clarify what is still a poorly understood picture. If
Holley Shelter does still contain intact archaeological bearing deposits
additional research at the site which employs current technology and precise
three dimensional recording of all artifacts has the potential for a high
scientific payoff.

This award will also further the career development of a young scientist at a
small undergraduate institution.
