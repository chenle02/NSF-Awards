This award supports the 7th Women-in-Theory Workshop at the Simons Institute for
the Theory of Computing in June 2022. The intended audience of the workshop is
graduate students in the field of theoretical computer science (TCS). Motivated
by the low overall number of female faculty members, researchers, and students
in TCS world-wide, the workshop has two goals. The first is to deliver an
invigorating educational program to the student participants by inviting leading
female researchers to present tutorials of their research topics. The second is
to provide an outstanding opportunity to bring together women students from
different institutions across the country and internationally, so as to foster a
sense of kinship and camaraderie, and to provide access to role models in this
area by having senior and junior faculty members and industrial researchers
present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The format of this workshop consists of technical
tutorials, a non-technical talk, a student rump session, and a panel discussion,
following the model of the first six workshops in this series. The first six
Women-in-Theory workshops were greeted with great enthusiasm both from the
participants and from the TCS research community at large. Since the first
workshop in 2008, the organizers have received overwhelmingly positive feedback
and many participants have matured to be successful researchers. These serve as
testimonials that the workshop is accomplishing its primary goal of helping
women become more successful in TCS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
