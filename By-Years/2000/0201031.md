ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Actuators (motors) are a key element of mechanical
design Significant advancements have been made using smart materials, with
piezoceramics delivering compact, high energy density actuators useful for
vibration, shape, flow and noise control. Unfortunately, current piezoceramic
actuation technologies suffer from reliability problems limiting their use in
practical applications. The fabrication of monolithic functionally graded
piezoceramic (MFGP) actuators promise to overcome the reliability issues
associated with delamination and stress discontinuities commonly found in the
current bonded-layered piezoceramic technologies. Additionally, MFGP's graded in
multiple directions could produce complex motions such as bending, twisting,
warping, and dimpling from a solid, one-piece actuator. The goal of this
research is to investigate the capabilities of monolithic functionally graded
piezoceramics to improve the reliability of piezoceramic actuators and to open
the door to multi-dimensional distributed piezoceramic actuation technologies.
Specific objectives of this research effort are:&lt;br/&gt;Develop analytical
and finite element models that accurately predict the quasi-static actuation
behavior and evaluate any performance penalties due to
grading.&lt;br/&gt;Experimentally characterize the variation in graded material
properties through monolithic functionally graded piezoceramics and extend the
current one-dimensional doping process to multi-
dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;Investigate the reliability of monolithic functionally
graded piezoceramics with respect to the current state of art of piezoceramic
benders. This research will begin to lay the fundamental science (models,
manufacturing processes, experimental data) for monolithic functionally graded
piezoelectrics enabling us to tap into the potential of piezoceramics for
reliable high performance and multi-dimensionally graded actuators for complex
motion in practical applications. &lt;br/&gt;
