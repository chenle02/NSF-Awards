The effects of deforestation on the extinction rates of plant species in
tropical rain forests are well documented. Less is known about the impact of
deforestation on the loss of genetic variation within tree species because there
is not enough information about the amount and patterns of spatial distribution
of genetic variation in natural populations. Genetic variation is considered to
be important in the long term survival of populations. Thus, information about
the amount and patterns of genetic variation within and among populations is
central to the design of appropriate measures to conserve tropical tree
populations. Equally important is to understand the genetic factors, such as
mating systems and the level of gene exchange among populations, which greatly
influence the distribution of genetic variation. Many tree species in tropical
rain forests have low population density. Small populations may lose genetic
variation, and may also be subject to inbreeding depression (deleterious effects
in reproductive output due to mating among close relatives). Thus, it is
paricularly important to study factors regulating genetic variation in species
that typically occur in low densities. The objectives of this research are to 1.
analyze the amount and patterns of genetic variation, 2. estimate effective
population size, 3. measure the rate of outcrossing (or inbreeding), 4.
determine the level of gene exchange among populations, and 5. examine the
effects of density on the level of inbreeding and reproductive output in natural
populations of tropical lowland rain forest trees. The field work will be
conducted at the La Selva Biological Field Station of the Organization for
Tropical Studies in Costa Rica, and the laboratory work at the University of
Massachusetts at Boston.
