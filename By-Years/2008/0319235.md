Interfaces play a critical role in controlling heat transport in nanostructures
and nanostructured materials because surfaces and interfaces limit the mean-
free-path of phonons and low values of the interface thermal conductance inhibit
the transfer of energy between dissimilar materials. Materials with high
densities of internal interfaces-e.g., short period superlattices and
multilayers, and nanocrystalline materials-show promise of providing low thermal
conductivity materials for thermoelectrics and thermal barrier coatings. The
goal of the proposed work is to establish a greater understanding of the thermal
conductance of interfaces by elucidating the mechanisms that limit heat
transport between similar materials and the mechanisms that produce anomalously
large transport between dissimilar materials. &lt;br/&gt;The research team will
study epitaxial films of TiN/MgO; Ag on H-terminated and clean Si; Au and Pt
films on H-terminated diamond; and nanolaminates of W/Al2O3 synthesized by
atomic-layer-deposition. These experiments will exploit the team's recent
advances in thermal property measurement using time-domain thermoreflectance.
The experimental methods being developed in this work are also enabling improved
metrology tools for characterizing heat-transfer in microscale devices.
