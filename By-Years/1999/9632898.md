9632898 Machta This grant supports the work of a mid-career materials theorist
who is getting involved in the interface between conventional materials
properties and the analysis and development of complex computational algorithms.
In particular, this grant supports further development and applications of the
invaded cluster algorithm, devised earlier by the PI. The other two projects
are: (1) investigation of computational complexity in collaboration with a
computer science colleague and (2) a collaboration with experimental colleagues
on the flow properties of fluids in porous media. %%% This grant supports work
at the interface of computer science and materials theory. There are projects
where the computational needs are such as to require whole new framework. The PI
has successfully proposed a highly efficient way to calculating the equilibrium
properties, called invaded cluster method. This grant further supports
development and applications of this work. There is a project to study the
complexity of a computation, a subject likely to be of considerable significance
in future. Finally there is a project to study fluid flow through the porous
media. ***
