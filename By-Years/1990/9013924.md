Description: This proposal supports the collaboration of Dr. Dilhan Kalyon of
Stevens Institute of Technology (SIT) and Dr. Erdal Bayramli of Middle East
Technical University (METU) in Turkey. The proposed research will be carried out
at both SIT and METU. Dr. Bayramli will prepare coatings at METU and Dr. Kalyon
will perform surface and rheological characterization experiments at SIT.
Project funding will allow Dr. Bayramli to spend two months per year at SIT and
Dr. Kalyon will visit METU for a similar period of time. Scope: This proposal
will bring together research scientists from two countries working in the area
of wall slippage of polymer melts. It is anticipated that this collaborative
research will result in a better understanding of the processability of
polymeric resins during various processing flows. Dr. Bayramli will have an
opportunity to become familiar with research techniques at SIT and, likewise,
Dr. Kalyon will benefit from the time he spends at METU. Therefore, this
proposal fulfils objectives of the Science in Developing Countries Program in
its exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge through an international
collaboration.
