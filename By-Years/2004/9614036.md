9614036 Williams This Minority Career Advancement Award (MCAA) project
addresses fundamental research issues of surfaces and interfaces in the
epitaxial growth of III-V semiconductor materials as part of a collaborative
research activity with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory on free standing
quantum wells. The approach is to selectively etch compositionally modulated
III-V heterostructures to produce quantum wells which are confined on both sides
by air, vacuum or suitable filler materials. Subsequent patterning then yields
quantum wells suspended horizontally between vertical support posts. This
structure is conducive for probing local properties of solids, e.g., the
interaction of quantum confined states with surface or interface states. Also
the inherent high contrast ratio between the barrier and suspended materials
allows the construction of efficient mirrors for a Fabry-Perot cavity with
dimension on the order of the spontaneous emission wavelength of the active
medium. Fundamental properties of these materials and structures as well as
device configurations will be explored. %%% The project addresses forefront
research issues in a topical area combining material science, physics and
engineering, and having high technological relevance. The research will
contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to important
aspects of electronic/photonic devices and integrated circuitry. The program
also provides for the integration of research and education through the training
of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant research area.
