SGER: Integrated Experimental and Numerical Modeling Study of Non-uniform
Sediment Transport in Meandering Channels&lt;br/&gt;PI: Jennifer Guohong Duan,
Department of Civil Engineering, Univ. of Arizona.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract
for the first year support:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed research is to
integrate experimental and numerical methods to investigate sediment transport
and sorting through meandering bends. The objective of the first year effort is
to set up basic experimental and numerical modeling facilities. The specific
tasks include constructing one sine-generated meandering flume and purchasing a
Pulse Coherent Acoustic Velocity Profiler. Experiments will be performed to
measure turbulent flow field in this flume. In the meantime, the PI will acquire
FLUENT user license and install and test it in a newly purchased computer
server. The research team will also conduct an intensive literature review
focusing on flow hydrodynamics and sediment transport studies in meandering
streams. After the first year, it's expected that the essential facilities (e.g.
flume, PCAVP) will be ready for performing further experimental and
computational mo&lt;br/&gt;
