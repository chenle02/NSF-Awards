Cell division and fusion are resource intensive activities, and thus the ability
of the yeast cell to coordinate the availability of nutrients in its environment
with reproduction is of great physiological importance. This project will
examine the role that glucose availability plays in yeast mating by testing the
hypothesis that glucose sensing and mating are interdependent. The glucose
sensor and the pheromone receptor are the only G protein coupled receptors
(GPCR) in yeast. The aims of this project include 1) assessing the effects of
pheromone stimulation on the glucose sensor, 2) examining the direct physical
interactions of the glucose sensing and pheromone receptors, and 3) identifying
interactions between components of the signaling pathways downstream of these
receptors.

Broader Impacts: This project, while enhancing our understanding of the
relationship between nutrient sensing and mating in yeast, will impact
undergraduate students and the science faculty at three primarily undergraduate
institutions. Undergraduate students will be exposed to biochemical research
during an intensive ten week summer project, with the opportunity to continue
their research during the academic year. These students will be involved in the
design, implementation, interpretation, and dissemination of the results of
their own experiments in a community of their peers. This project represents an
opportunity for the investigators to integrate their research into their
teaching, thereby enhancing the scientific education of hundreds of students at
the participating institutions. The students involved in this research will be
primarily from a typically underserved population (including under-represented
minorities) in rural Appalachia.
