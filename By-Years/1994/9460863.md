This SBIR Project will establish the feasibility of a neural network based
advanced intelligent motor controller for fuel cell powered Next Generation
Vehicles (NGV). The NGVs present control problems whose solution by conventional
controller technology may present unacceptable technical, schedule, and cost
risks. The neural network approach represents a revolutionary advancement to the
field of vehicle control. The key objectives of this project are: to establish
feasibility of a neural network based power control system for the NGV; to apply
to 4 wheel, 4 motor vehicle configuration; to determine the optimal paradigm for
NGV motor control; to determine optimal control by distributed vs. central
control; to meet national goals of three-times fuel efficiency with marketable
performance; and to plan and design for initial application to a bus in Phase
II, then transition the controller to other vehicle classes in Phase III.
