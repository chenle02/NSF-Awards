Sponges are important components of benthic marine communities, particularly
coral reefs. Organic extracts of their tissues have yielded a wealth of unusual
chemical compounds that are not involved in primary metabolism, and have no
known biological functions. The most commonly held theory is that these
compounds are distasteful to potential predators, but they may also protect
sponges from fouling or overgrowth. This project is a continuation of a research
program designed to assess the defenses of Caribbean demosponges, a group whose
taxonomy and chemistry is fairly well described, Because reef sponges are
abundant and sessile, because they have evolved elaborate putative structural
and chemical defenses, and are subject to grazing from generalist and specialist
predators, they provide a useful group for testing fundamental hypotheses
proposed by ecologists about plant defensive mechanisms.
