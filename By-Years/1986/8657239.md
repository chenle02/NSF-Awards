The principal investigator works in high energy or elementary particle physics
on an experiment to search for extremely rare modes of decay of the positive K
meson. The search is both for decays that are predicted by a very successful
theory of the weak and electromagnetic interactions, and for decays that are
unexpected by the theory, but that would cast light on currently unexplained
phenomena such as the apparent arrangement of elementary particles into
families. In terms of experimental techniques, the current work involves the
measurement of the energy of particles by a techniques known as calorimetry, the
detection of photons in the energy range 5 - 250 MeV, high speed analogue and
digital electronics, and computer simulation. A large magnetic spectrometer is
being built at Brookhaven National Laboratory. It consists of a scintillating
fiber target, drift and proportional chambers, and plastic scintillator
calorimeters.
