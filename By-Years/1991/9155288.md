This National Science Foundation grant was designed to expand NACME's existing
information program to reach more teachers, counselors and parents of minority
students at the junior and senior high school levels and, ultimately, to provide
more and better information to the students themselves. Materials produced under
the grant to convey the message that minority students can find rewarding,
attainable careers in mathematics and science-based fields, that financial aid
is available to help students prepare for such careers, that there are specific
academic prerequisites for students interested in studying engineering at the
college-level, and that there is a growing network of programs to encourage the
study of engineering and related technical fields among under represented
minority students. Specifically, this funding was used to develop, produce and
distribute: "Engineering, Your Key to the 21st Century" 30,000 brochures with
companion posters targeting junior high school students, parents and teachers.
"Financial Aid Unscrambled: A Guide for Minority Engineering Students" 30,000
books targeting high school seniors, teachers, guidance counselors and parents.
"Students Guide to Engineering Schools" 30,000 books targeting high school
students, teachers, guidance counselors and parents. "MEPs/USA: The Directory of
Precollege and University Minority Engineering Programs" 5,000 directories for
guidance counselors, teachers, program directors and other participants in the
field.
