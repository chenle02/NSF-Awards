This award is to study a paired sand-silt eolian system on the Columbia Plateau,
in order to better understand the sensitivity of mineral-dust aerosol emissions
to changes in vegetation, soil moisture and topography. This information will be
used to improve global dust model routines in general circulation models (GCM).

Field work will be undertaken to characterize the history and variability of
mineral-aerosol sources and chronology of dune and loess formation for the
Columbia Plateau since the last glacial maximum (LGM). Information will be
obtained on vegetation area and type, soil texture, soil moisture and
topographic features that resulted in the observed downwind accumulations.
Modeling will be used to improve the sensitivity of a global transport model
used in general circulation models (GCM) of the Earth climate system.

Atmospheric mineral aerosols are increasingly recognized as playing an important
role in radiative and biogeochemical forcing of climate. The broader impacts of
this proposed research center on documenting the evolution of an important
eolian sequence within a well-constrained chronologic framework to better
understand the processes responsible for and factors that effect mineral-aerosol
emissions.
