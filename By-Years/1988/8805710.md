A universal measuring microscope and a microhardness tester will be used to
improve the quality and broaden the scope of three projects in micromechanics
and micro-heat transfer research. The first and second projects involve studies
of micro-cracking and the associated toughening of structural ceramics and of
impact damage of ceramic coatings, respectively. Such studies will lead to
development of tougher and higher strength structural ceramics. The third
project involves a study of boiling inception and temperature overshoot with a
potential application for cooling high power microelectronic chips.
