0403846 Martinez This proposal is the "next step" in the development of
computational tools for the simulation and design of photoactive protein
devices. The complexity of photoactive protein complexes necessitates that
simulation tools be developed in such an incremental manner, and the steps to be
undertaken with the proposed research are reasonable. Dynamical expansion, or
"spawning", of the basis set is a key component of attempts to perform
electronic structure calculations in regions of potential energy surfaces where
Born-Oppenheimer breakdown occurs. Specifically, they will compute the effects
of subtle changes, such as the insertion of a charge, or steric crowding around
the key functional group, in the vicinity of a chromophore of three prototype
proteins: GFP, PYP, bR. The goal is to be able to predict, and therefore
control, the lifetime of the excited state by changing the structure and energy
of the excited state relative to the ground state using these "mutational"
changes.
