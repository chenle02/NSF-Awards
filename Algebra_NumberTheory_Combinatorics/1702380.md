In a celebrated memoir of 1860, Riemann studied a function known as the zeta
function, whose properties imply an approximate formula for the number of prime
numbers less than a given number. The optimal formula, still unproved, depends
on the Riemann hypothesis on the location of zeros of the zeta function. Prior
to the formulation of his celebrated hypothesis, Riemann stipulated a symmetry
of the zeta function in the form of a functional equation. Thanks to the
development of number theory following Riemann's memoir, we know that there is a
large family of functions which includes the zeta function; these functions
should encode numerical information about systems of polynomial equations, such
as the number of their solutions modulo a prime number as the prime number
varies. These functions should satisfy a generalized form of the Riemann
hypothesis as well as a functional equation. In the early 1970s, Langlands
proposed a visionary program predicting that all these functions can be viewed
from a radically different perspective. This project will develop new tools that
will aid in the development of Langlands' program.

Langlands' automorphic functoriality conjecture implies both meromorphic
continuation and functional equation of L-functions. The functoriality
conjecture remains largely unexplored beyond the endoscopic framework. In the
early 2000s, Langlands (on one side) and Braverman-Kazhdan (on the other),
formulated different general strategies to attack the functoriality conjecture
beyond endoscopy and the functional equation of L-functions. This project aims
to combine different elements of those proposals in a formulation of a new,
possibly more realistic, strategy. The focus will be on the understanding of
certain conjectural Schwartz spaces proposed by Braverman-Kazhdan, spaces of
orbital integrals studied by Langlands and others, and the Fourier and Hankel
transforms on those spaces. It is expected that geometry of arc spaces, which
are infinite dimensional, will play a major role in these studies.
