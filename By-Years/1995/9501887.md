understanding of how and why accidents and injuries occur in construction; to
assess the effectiveness of existing tools, technologies, and construction
methods in reducing accidents and injuries; to develop and test new technologies
to help reduce accidents and injuries; and to educate a new generation of
construction engineering and management students to appreciate the hazards of
construction craft work and begin to do something about it.
