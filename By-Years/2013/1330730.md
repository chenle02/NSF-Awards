Despite our increasing knowledge of the structures of sodium-coupled membrane
transport proteins, understanding the mechanism by which the energy of the
transmembrane electrochemical sodium ion gradient is translated into the coupled
transport of other molecules across the membrane is still a major challenge.
This project will test the central hypothesis that the allosteric interaction of
two substrate binding sites in the sodium/multivitamin transporter is required
for coupled transport. The results of this project are expected to lead to a
novel paradigm for the mechanism of ion-gradient coupled membrane transport, a
central feature in the biology of all living systems. Broader Impacts. This
project integrates teaching in molecular biological and membrane
biochemical/biophysical techniques within its overall scientific objectives
through hands-on education of the next generation of scientists (i.e., graduate
and undergraduate students, pre-college students, and K-12 science teachers).
Special consideration will be given to broadening the participation of women and
under-represented groups, and the PI?s outreach activities include the
international exchange of undergraduate and graduate students with Spain and
Germany.
