This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will provide an
interactive online social network incorporated into a mobile electronic device
such as an iPhone, to monitor and test the physiological state and sobriety of
users struggling with alcohol, chemical, and other dependencies. The proposed
innovation will improve the number and quality of support network contacts, and
provide those contacts in real-time, thereby providing a system that is expected
to significantly decrease relapse rates of recovering addicts. The system is
enabled by the novel integration of diverse technologies to significantly
improve the relapse rate of recovering alcoholics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader impact of this research in society results from the capability of the
system to address a critical social need: reducing the relapse rate of
recovering addicts. Presently, one third of the 500,000 addicts entering
rehabilitation centers each year will relapse within 4 years. Over 90% of those
will have their relapse in the first year after treatment (Polich, 1981). It is
well documented that the best social environment conducive to recovery is one in
which the addict has consistent interaction with support groups and frequent
monitoring for sobriety. The proposed innovation provides both of these through
a hand-held mobile device and online environment. The project will initially
focus on alcohol and chemical dependencies where both a significant need and a
well-established, mature market exist. Later embodiments will apply the same
methodologies to other dependencies and process addictions such as gambling and
eating disorders.
