High Frequency Miniature PiezoPump for Ventricular
Assist&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congenital
heart disease affects thousands of infants every year. One the most devastating
subclasses of this disease are single ventricle abnormalities, in which infants
are born with one functional ventricle instead two. Although researchers have
used traditional electromagnetic driven ventricular assist devices to aide
patients, these technologies are too bulky for children and are limited by their
inability to be miniaturized without loss in power density. Thus, the premise of
this proposal is that the use of piezoelectric materials in a hydraulic pump
offers an alternative to traditional electromagnetic VADs.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The novelty of the proposed research plan is the
development of a novel small scale high frequency piezoelectric cardiac assist
device that can be used as a power source to help children with single ventricle
circulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The intellectual merit of this proposal is
the development of a fundamental understanding of the relationship between
piezoelectric materials operated at high frequency and small-scale pump
components. The challenge here is to effectively transfer energy from the
piezoelectric to a simulated human circulation without direct blood contact.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this proposed research is the
interdisciplinary collaboration between engineers and doctors to develop devices
specifically tailored for children and patients. This research also gives
underrepresented students in high school and universities an opportunity to
conduct research and develop mentor style relationships with faculty and
graduate students at UCLA.
