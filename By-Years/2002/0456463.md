We propose to carry out a broad program in nuclear physics research following
closely the national priorities determined by the DOE-NSF Nuclear Science
Advisory Committee. Much of the research will be carried out with the new
RESOLUT rare isotope facility at the Florida State University Superconducting
Accelerator Laboratory. This will be directed toward astrophysical studies
related to the rapid proton capture process in nucleosynthesis, experimental
investigation of the structure of very light nuclei for comparison with
forefront ab-initio theoretical calculations, and exploration of how the
fundamental shell structure ("magic numbers") in atomic nuclei changes with
large proton or neutron excess. Closely related, complementary experiments will
also be carried out at the National Superconducting Accelerator Laboratory. The
unique FSU polarized lithium beam will also be used to characterize reactions of
astrophysical interest. A new type of motion in highly deformed, rapidly
rotating nuclei will be explored with Gammasphere &lt;br/&gt;at the ATLAS
facility. The FSU group constructed a major part of the PHENIX detector at the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and now proposes to study the production of
J/PSI particles to test how closely the experiments are able to reproduce the
quark-gluon plasma that existed in the earliest times of the Big Bang. Other
members of the FSU group propose to search for new elementary particles whose
unique quantum numbers will clearly prove that they involve excitations of the
gluons. Such particles are predicted by the best current models of quarks and
gluons, but have not been conclusively seen before. The experiment will be
performed at Jefferson Laboratory, which has already approved it with a high
rating.&lt;br/&gt;
