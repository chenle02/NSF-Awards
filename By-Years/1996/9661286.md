*** 96-61286 Cobern This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will develop novel, low-cost, compact, wide-range humidity sensors.
These sensors employ a unique molecular electronic technology, originally
developed for geophysical sensors. In this application, a polymer-metal compound
is used to adsorb and dissociate water molecules, thereby creating a conductive
path through the polymer film. The change in conductivity is measured and will
be used to determine water vapor concentration. Since no molecular water is
retained in the sensor, it is impervious to changes due to freezing. They will
have excellent repeatability and linearity and ultralow hysteresis. They are
expected to be rugged, contamination- and condensate-resistant, and produced by
standard thin-film technology. Phase I will determine the feasibility of these
sensors and to prepare prototypes for field testing. These sensors will be used
in various branches of atmospheric and environmental sciences to provide wide
range three-dimensional monitoring. Their low cost, small size, and high
performance will also make them useful in many industrial and commercial
applications. ***
