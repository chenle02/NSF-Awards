This research focuses on the compiler and architectural issues of concurrent
multithreaded architectures. These architectures allow multiple threads to be
active simultaneously to achieve multiple instruction issue in a single machine
cycle. The architectural research focuses on the design of thread execution
units that include support for communication between threads, for speculative
thread execution, and for thread pipelining. Simulation at the functional and
register-transfer levels will be the primary tool for this research. The
compiler research focuses on integrating optimization for thread and instruction
level parallelism. This research will take place in the context of modifications
to the gcc compiler. While threads can be used to allow multiple independent
programs to execute concurrently, the primary focus of this project is speeding
up the execution of a single program.
