Special Project: A Proposal for Assistance in Attending: ADMI '96-Building for
the Future: The Symposium on Computing at Minority Institutions This grant
provided travel assistance for faculty and students from minority institutions
to participate in the 1996 ADMI Symposium. The 1996 Symposium incorporated major
new themes: 1) to enable minority faculty to present papers on strategies for
increasing the number of CISE-discipline students from underrepresented
populations and to share these topics with representatives from major research
universities, and 2) to provide for inclusion of student participants, giving
them valuable experience in presenting research papers and providing for their
participation in graduate study workshops. Participants were chosen by a
selection committee following submission of their papers. A Conference
Proceedings is being published containing all of the papers presented at the
conference.
