The project goal is to develop students' life-long team problem solving and
communication skills through active learning experiences that simulate
industrial situations. These experiences create team design activities that
integrate problem solving, project planning, and oral and written
communications.The project objectives require curriculum reform that revises two
upper level courses and creates a new senior project design course. Both the
instructional technique and the content of the two upper level courses change to
prepare the student for the new senior project design experience.The
instructional method focuses on supplementing traditional lectures with
instructor-guided collaborative learning using computer control technology.
Course content in a revised microcontroller course introduces modern technology
such as C programming, logic analyzer use, and embedded design. An industrial
electronics course now covers programmable logic controllers, data acquisition,
and test instrument interfacing. These changes in course content require the
purchase of control computers, data acquisition and logic analyzer boards, test
instruments, and software.The senior capstone design course reinforces the
skills that are developed in the team approaches in the two revised courses.
Senior students will use the new equipment in team design projects that simulate
graduates first assignments in industry.Throughout the three courses students
use computer related projects as a vehicle to learn team communication and
problem solving techniques. Group communications skills include written and oral
exams, communication of team findings, generation of student portfolios, and
final presentations.
