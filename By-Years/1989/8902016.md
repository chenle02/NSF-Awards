The principal investigator will study the function-space approach to
statistics, in which the fitted model, but not necessarily the true model,
belongs to a finite-dimensional function space whose dimension can tend to
infinity as the amount of data tends to infinity. Most of the specific models of
this form that will be considered will be in the form of exponential families.
The functions spaces, themselves, will include B- splines, tensor-product
splines and finite-element spaces. Most of the results will be for experiments
involving independent trials, but some will involve Markov dependence and
stationary time series. The bulk of the effort will be devoted to mathematically
rigorous asymptotic results, but the confidence intervals under investigation
will also be studied by means of computer simulation.
