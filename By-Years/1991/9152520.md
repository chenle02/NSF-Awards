A multi-tool adaptor assembly for an existing commercial CGA robot and an
additional small commercial high-speed robot are incorporated into the current
robotic curriculum of the Engineering Technology Department. These items of
equipment are used in the laboratory experiments for courses in Robotic
Fundamentals, Computer-Aided Manufacturing, Sensors and Vision Systems, Computer
Integrated Manufacturing, and, on occasion, Special Problems.
