Jones will study almost everywhere convergence in analysis and ergodic theory.
He will investigate questions concerning almost everywhere convergence for
absolutely integrable functions, the central limit theorem on the real line and
its transference to the ergodic setting, and questions related to the solution
of an old problem of Hopf. Singular integral techniques will be further
developed and applied. This project involves research in ergodic theory. Ergodic
theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of systems whose
dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be followed in microscopic detail.
Under the heading "dynamics can be placed the modern theory of how groups of
abstract transformations act on smooth spaces. In this way ergodic theory makes
contact with geometry in its quest to classify flows on homogeneous spaces.
