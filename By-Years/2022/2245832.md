This project will study Liouville quantum gravity (LQG), a theory of random
surfaces. These random surfaces arise in various areas of theoretical physics.
In bosonic string theory, they can be used to model the surfaces swept out by a
string moving through space. They can also be viewed as models of gravity in two
dimensions. LQG surfaces have many interesting and surprising geometric
properties and are connected to a variety of other mathematical objects,
including various types of random curves, random permutations, and random
graphs. This project will address some of the most important open problems in
the subject. The awardee will also engage in outreach, mentorship, and
dissemination activities, including mentoring undergraduate and graduate
participation in the research, writing expository articles, organizing
conferences, and giving talks and mini-courses at conferences, seminars, and
summer schools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One goal of the project is to build a
better understanding of distances between points in LQG surfaces. Another goal
is to understand LQG surfaces in the so-called supercritical phase
(corresponding to central charge between 1 and 25), which is much less well
understood than the subcritical phase, but which is expected to be more
interesting from a string theory perspective. The awardee also plans to study
the extent to which one can make sense of the solutions to partial differential
equations on LQG surfaces, and to further explore the applications of LQG to
combinatorial objects, including planar maps, permutations, and
meanders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
