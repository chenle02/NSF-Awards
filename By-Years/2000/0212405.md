This Small Business Phase I Project is to develop a bioremediation technology
for treating groundwater contaminated with N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA). NDMA
is a potent carcinogen and an emerging groundwater contaminant in the United
States. Accordingly, the State of California has established an acceptable level
in drinking water for NDMA of only 20 ng/L. Current technologies for treating
NDMA, such as ultraviolet irradiation and carbon adsorption, are expensive
and/or ineffective for removing the contaminant to required levels. Envirogen
scientists have recently discovered a bacterial strain that is capable of
metabolizing NDMA during growth on a second substrate (i.e., by co-metabolism).
This bacterium is one of only a few strains that are known to degrade NDMA. In
the course of this Phase I project, the biodegradation of NDMA by this organism
andby other bacterial strains possessing similar broad specificity oxidase
enzymes will be examined. The most effective culture(s) will be seeded into
bioreactors and the abilities of these strains to remediate NDMA in groundwater
will be quantified. In addition, the potential to stimulate specific
microorganisms in contaminated aquifers to degrade NDMA by cosubstrate
application will be tested. The commercial application of this project is in the
area of wastewater treatment linked to municipal drinking water supplies.
Additional industrial and military uses of the core technology are also
expected.
