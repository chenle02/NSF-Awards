The Research Site of the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
(I/UCRC) entitled "Repair of Buildings and Bridges with Composites (RB2C)" at
North Carolina State University is an extension to the currently active I/UCRC
located at the University of Missouri-Rolla. The research site at North Carolina
State will focus on addressing the needs of the construction industry in
development of new and innovative structural components as well as
strengthening/repair methods for existing structures using advanced composite
materials. The primary research activities of the site will involve: use of the
three-dimensional weaving technology, developed by the College of Textiles at
North Carolina State University in cooperation with the textile industry and the
fiber producer; Installation, understanding, manufacturing and use of more
durable construction materials; Examination of the durability of the proposed
advanced construction materials under severe environmental conditions using the
unique environmental chamber installed at the Constructed Facilities Laboratory
(CFL), North Carolina State University; Develop new construction materials for
rehabilitation of steel structures using high strength and modulus composite
materials; and Standardization and code approval of products and design control,
education and transfer of technology to industry.
