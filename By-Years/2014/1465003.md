In this project, funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Cristina DeMeo of the Southern Illinois University
Edwardsville is investigating structural modifications of sialic acid
derivatives. Sialic acids are carbohydrates which are involved in numerous
biological phenomena, ranging from cell-cell adhesion and mobility to
oncogenesis and recognition by viruses and bacteria. The broader impacts include
advancing the chemistry of sialic acids, enabling access to important
biologically active sialic acids, and training undergraduate and Master's
students, with an emphasis on recruiting and training underrepresented
minorities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sialylations by chemical methods are often
complicated by the intrinsic structural features of sialic acids, making the
stereoselective synthesis of sialosides a challenge in carbohydrate chemistry.
With the ultimate goal of gaining a better understanding of the roles of
O-protecting groups in sialylations, this project is centered on the evaluation
of sialyl donors functionalized at O-4 and O-7 positions. In addition, the
research is addressing the influence of protecting groups at O-4 and N-5 on the
conformation of sialic acids.
