The application of hybrid neural network architectures can have advantages over
stochastic time series analysis techniques and other regression techniques in
forecasting. These nonlinear systems can exhibit the ability to represent
nonlinear mapping networks, to manage multivariate data, to manage temporal
relationships, and to function without the prior selection of a basis function.
This Phase I program will identify and characterize potential hybrid neural
network architectures which provide significant performance advantages over
presently used techniques in forecasting large scale nonlinear systems. In
addition, this program will compare the performance of currently used time
series techniques with the performance of specialized neural network
architectures. This project has strong commercial applications. Nonlinear
forecasting systems are particularly well suited for electric power forecasting,
econometric modelling, and transportation forecasting. With the addition of a
powerful user interface to the optimized nonlinear systems of Phase II, the
final system is expected to be very useful to the above mentioned industries.
Therefore, follow-on funding is fully expected.
