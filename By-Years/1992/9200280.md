A variety of superlattices, multilayers and metastable solids will be fabricated
primarily by multi-source advanced sputter deposition, and characteized by x-ray
diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and other techniques. The
superlattices and multilayers are designed to reveal finite-size effects and
dimensional crossover in magnetic and superconducting systems with various
correlation lengths. The realization and the origin of magnetic surface
anisotropy will be investigated. Paticular attention will be paid toward
perpendicular magnetization and its probable connection with magnetostriction.
In superconductor/magnetic multilayers, experiments are proposed to investigate
the relationship between the effects on superconductivity and the magnetic
ordering and conductivity of the magnetic layers. A number of metastable solid
systems will be studied in order to reveal new properties in structures
unattainable by conventional methods.
