This award supports students and postdoctoral scholars to attend the twenty-
first Workshop on Quantum Information Processing (QIP 2018). QIP is a flagship
international conference in theoretical quantum computation and information, and
has a long history in the field. This year up to 500 participants are
anticipated, continuing the tradition of having QIP act as the primary annual
meeting point for theoretical quantum information researchers worldwide.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;QIP 2018 will be hosted by QuTech at the Delft University
of Technology (Aula Congress Centre), located in Delft, The Netherlands, on
January 13-19, 2018. The funds will be used to provide 12-14 travel awards for
U.S.-based students and postdoctoral researchers. The aim is to support young
researchers who might not otherwise be able to attend QIP 2018 due to financial
shortfalls. Particular attention will be given to students who are female or
from underrepresented groups, and those with accepted papers at QIP 2018.
