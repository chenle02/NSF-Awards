The 3rd Optogenetic Technologies and Applications Conference will have an
expanded range of topics and will emphasize burgeoning areas of research such as
optogenetics in neuroscience, optogenetics in medicine and optogenetics in
biotechnology. The broader range of topics will allow the conference to host
scientists and engineers with diverse backgrounds. The conference will also
allow students and early career professionals to share their work and learn
about new advances in a rapidly growing field. Additionally, the conference will
promote the continuous growth of members of the optogenetic research community,
encouraging discussions among normally separated scientists and engineers and
encouraging collaborations, which are critical for the development of new
optogenetic technologies and applications for biotechnology and
medicine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optogenetics is an emerging technique that allows
researchers to use light in order to control living cells that have been
modified to be light sensitive. Optogenetics has a myriad of applications in
fields such as healthcare, energy, and chemical manufacturing. Because of rapid
advancements in optogenetics and its substantial potential for medical and
biotechnology applications, the 3rd Optogenetic Technologies and Applications
Conference showcases novel and cutting-edge research being conducted in the
field of optogenetics. The Conference touches on a broad range of topics
including advances in fundamental science, applications in cell signaling and
epigenetics, and applications to a number of fields including neuroscience,
cardiology, control of metabolism, and drug delivery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
