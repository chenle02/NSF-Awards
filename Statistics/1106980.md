Every network dataset poses unique challenges, but there is a growing toolkit of
methods that can be adapted to specific situations. This research will extend
that toolkit by continuing the development of machine learning ideas that
perform aggressive local variable selection to fit local metrics, thus allowing
nearby nodes to have similar models for edge formation, but distant nodes to
have very different models. Also, the research will provide a new approach to
goodness-of-fit assessment for network models, based upon minimum description
length inference.

Network modeling has emerged as a critical methodology across many fields of
science, including biochemistry, sociology, and Internet communication.
Important applications include social interactions leading to fission in baboon
troops, biochemical knowledge derived from protein-protein interactions, and
insight into the growth and structure of the Wikipedia. This research will
develop novel statistical models for network growth and new ways to assess how
well they explain a given dataset.
