Abstract

We propose to continue the Southern California Geometric Analysis Seminar
(SCGAS). This Seminar has been supported by the NSF since 1991. Geometric
analysis is an important part of modern mathematics and is related to many other
branches of mathematics. Using analysis as its main tool and differential
geometry, topology and algebraic geometry as foundations, it has solved a large
number of problems in global geometry, topology, several complex variables and
mathematical physics. There is much enthusiasm for its continuation among
geometers, analysts and mathematicians of related fields at institutions from
the southern California, as well as young geometric analysts cross the country.
It is the unique annual meeting of its kind in the Southern California area, and
continues to foster interest in geometric analysis at all levels.

The goal of this Seminar is to promote interaction among mathematicians in
Southern California who are interested in geometric analysis and related areas
and to introduce graduate students and post-docs to some of the best works in
geometric analysis. The SCGAS has become an important and anticipated event for
the Southern California region, as the success of the first sixteen meetings has
demonstrated. In fact the SCGAS also attracts a substantial number of
participants from all over the country. The Seminar, organized jointly by UC-San
Diego and UC-Irvine, will continue its commitment to encourage and support
participation of graduate students and recent PhDs, especially young women and
minority mathematicians, and will continue to invite top women mathematicians as
speakers. As a new feature to our proposal we will include a junior speaker for
the proposed meetings.
