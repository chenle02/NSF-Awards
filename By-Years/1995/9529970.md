9529970 Taylor The primary goal of this research is to advance and use a method,
which can easily by employed by the scientific community, for measuring species
specific growth rates of phytoplankton. The method follows a progression of
developments from the frequency of dividing cells technique, to the diel DNA
synthesis method, to the cell cycle approach for measuring growth rates. With
this method a conserved cell cycle protein, PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear
antigen) is used as a marker of cells which are about to divide. Fluorescent
antibodies are used to detect PCNA, and a standard epifluorescence microscope is
used for detecting presence or absence of antibodies and identifying species of
phytoplankton, thus making the method available to a broad range of
investigators. This research builds upon and advances established methodology
and will benefit a large segment of the biological oceanographic community. One
of the major goals of plankton biologists is to understand the causes of blooms
and the contribution of individual species as primary producers. The research
will establish a sound, fast affordable and rugged method for measuring species
specific growth rates, and will also provide basic information on cell cycle
proteins in phytoplankton. ***
