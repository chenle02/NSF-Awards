The Ohio State University and the University of Michigan are joining to conduct
feasibility and planning activities to establish an Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center for Precision Forming. This vision for the Center is
to achieve "Green, Clean and Lean" products and production. Its mission is to
serve as a center of excellence for the creation and dissemination of a
systematic body of knowledge in precision forming and fabrication of
lightweight-high strength materials of interest in this century, and ultimately
to impact the next generation products and production systems with precision
(quality), responsiveness (rapid development) and near-zero waste.
