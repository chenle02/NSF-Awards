Three projects are included in this Presidential Young Investigator Award:
partial oxidation in zeolites, filamentous materials, and water-gas shift
reactions. Partial oxidation reactions are studied using catalyst systems based
on zeolites prepared using multivalent ion- exchange cations such as iron,
copper, or cobalt. Experiments are designed to determine whether, for a given
cation-zeolite system, it is possible to alter the redox potential of the
multivalent sites by changing the ion loading, the silicon/aluminum ratio, or
the nature of other cation-exchange ions, or by framework substitution of other
atoms for aluminum. Catalytic kinetic studies are conducted using these
materials with emphasis on the partial oxidation of methane. Catalytic
production of carbon filaments is well studied and serves as the starting point
for attempts to alter the filament-producing catalyst so that subsequently it
can be used to catalyze the formation of a matrix around the filaments; this
would permit formation of composites in a single operation. Finally, the
mechanism by which rare earths promote the water-gas shift reaction over
sulfided cobalt-molybdenum catalysts is investigated.
