The Joint Oceanographic Institutions, Inc., will provide a broad range of
services in support of Federal interagency planning related to ocean sciences
over the next three years. These services will include, but not be limited to,
providing staff and logistics support for specific long-range planning
activities of the sponsoring Federal agencies, in- cluding some related to
global change; convening and organizing of sci- entific meetings, synposia, and
workshops; development and publication of documentation for such activities and
resulting reports; and assist- ing the Federal agencies in integrating these
long-range planning acti- vities with parallel activities of other countries at
the international level in order to assure that gaps in planned programs are
identified and filled and duplication of effort is minimized.
