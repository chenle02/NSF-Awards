0429948&lt;br/&gt;Insup Lee&lt;br/&gt;University of
Pennsylvania&lt;br/&gt;Extracting Traceable Formal Models from Natural Language
Policy Documents Insup Lee, Aravind Joshi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Policy plays an
important role in our lives and affects us in many ways, e.g., the Food and Drug
Administration's Code of Federal Regulations govern how to test blood for
communicable diseases.&lt;br/&gt;Ambiguities, conflicts, and incompleteness in
such policy documents could lead to situations that are undesirable and
unsafe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is to develop NLP (Natural
Language Processing) based techniques and methods for extracting formal models
from policy documents. These models are then analyzed for correctness
and&lt;br/&gt;consistency and also to used for conformance testing of
implementations of the policy. This is a collaborative effort between
researchers in NLP and Formal Methods and aims at producing an environment in
which policy can co-exist in natural and formal languages. For success and
usefulness of this approach, it is&lt;br/&gt;important to maintain
correspondence and traceability between these two representations of policy.
Furthermore, the large size of the policy bases and the complexity of the
documents warrant modularized&lt;br/&gt;extraction of models and then the
merging of these models. Existing NLP techniques need to be extended and
tailored to aid in the modular extraction of formal models. The merging of
extracted models also&lt;br/&gt;requires extensions and refinements to formal
method techniques. As our society relies more on computer-based systems, and on
medical devices in particular, the proposed research will help to improve the
reliability of such systems.&lt;br/&gt;
