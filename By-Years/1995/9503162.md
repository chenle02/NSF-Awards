Mitchell 9503162 This postdoctoral research will be on developing novel
techniques for the automatic programming of decentralized parallel architectures
such as cellular automata. Preliminary research performed has shown that genetic
algorithms (GAs) are promising techniques for designing one-dimensional cellular
automata to perform computations. The major effort will be in extending the work
from one- to two-dimensional systems, which will allow the design techniques to
apply to real-world parallel computation problems such as image processing,
pattern recognition, and image compression. This extension will require a number
of advances in the theory of spatial parallel computation as well as in the
theory and application of genetic algorithms.
