9614381 Spera This project will focus on constraining aspects of the magma
geneses processes at one of the most active volcanoes in the world, Mt. Etna.
Specifically, the study will concentrate on investigating correlations between
alkali enrichments and dramatic changes in Sr and Pb isotopic composition. To
assess whether these isotopic changes are more reasonably interpreted as the
result of crustal contamination or mantle heterogeneity, samples from six
historical flows will be studied with a combination of crystal size distribution
analysis (CSD) and microsampling of phenocrysts and microphenocrysts. This
technique will allow the documentation of how the isotopic composition of the
materials change with crystal size. Common isotopic signatures are expected for
phenocrysts and matrix if the variations in the chemistry of the magmas is the
result of heterogeneity in the source. Alternatively, changes in isotopic
composition associated with different crystal size distribution of phenocrysts
would imply the importance of crustal contamination as a petrogenetic process.
