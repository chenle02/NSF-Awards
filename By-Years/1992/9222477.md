We plan studies of the cell biological basis of learning and memory in Octopus
vulgaris. Octopus with 108 nerve cells has a highly developed brain. It is able
to learn to learn to discriminate shapes visually and textures by touch. We
believe that learning is accompanied by growth cone activity as in developing
brains reawakened on a limited scale as learning occurs. As essential feature of
growth cones is the extension of finger-like processes &lt;0.5 um in diameter
(filopodia) that can develop into new synapses. Their growth depends on actin
polymerization. We have shown by electron microscopy (EM) that filopodia are
present in learning neuropils in octopus and increase with touch learning and
that cytochalasin D, which blocks actin polymerization blocks touch learning
with a decrease in filopodial numbers. We have shown by electron microscopy (EM)
that filopodia are present in learning neuropils in octopus and increase with
touch learning with a decrease in filopodial numbers. Conversely nerve growth
factor facilitates touch learning. We have found a protein in octopus brain,
like one in Helisoma, antibodies to it to see if it blocks touch learning and
causes decreased filopodial counts. NO synthase inhibitors block LTP in rat
hippocampus and we have evidence that they block touch learning in octopus,
which we will pursue.***//
