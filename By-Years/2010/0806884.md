&lt;br/&gt;Four-year scholarships are being awarded to a cohort of academically
talented financially needy freshmen majoring in biology or bioinformatics.
Students are being recruited from areas of Virginia where the poverty rate is
above twenty percent. These areas include the rural Appalachian counties of
southwestern Virginia and urban Richmond City. The racial demographics differ;
Richmond is more than sixty percent minority, predominantly African American,
whereas the rural counties are over 97 % Caucasian. Approximately fifteen
scholarships are being awarded ranging from $5,000 to $10,000 annually with an
average scholarship amount of $7100. Scholarship amounts are determined by the
Cost of Attendance and the Expected Family
Contribution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scholars take common classes and
participate in a weekly seminar dedicated to the academic and career
preparation, research skills, ethics and diversity. These efforts are preparing
the scholars not only to be scientific leaders in biotechnology, but also to
increase diversity and collaboration within the
discipline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
