This Empirical Implications of Theoretical Models training award affords the
student the opportunity to take an additional year of courses at the University
of Michigan in formal and empirical training. The training will enable the
student to undertake a high quality research project on how the need to build
lawmaking coalitions with outsiders affects organizational decisions in the U.S.
House of Representatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The training has the broader
social value of enhancing understanding of the U.S. House of Representatives and
strengthens the research and teaching skills of this future member of the
professorate.&lt;br/&gt;
