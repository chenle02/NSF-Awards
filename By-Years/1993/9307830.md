Partitioning of large designs into smaller and more manageable parts is a very
important design task. In high-level synthesis of register-transfer level
designs, partitioning the specification is done prior to synthesizing the
designs. If the input specification is control-dominated, the specification is
partitioned into a set of states, or if the specification is data-dominated then
it is partitioned into a set of graphs. In either case, the sets of the
partition are synthesized independently and the complete design assembled
together. This research re-examines the partitioning problem, outlines some
concerns with existing techniques and presents a fresh approach to formulating
and solving the partitioning problem. Specifically, the effort focuses on a
data-path model which can be used for rapid-prototyping at the register-transfer
level design and for partitioning of the input specification. The solution to
these problems is achieved by scheduling the input specificiation onto the data-
path model. The scheduling result can then be interpreted from a rapid-
prototyping perspective or from a partitioning perspective as desired by the
designer. This method will handle several new constraints such as communication
and memory/register bank constraints, integrate floor planning with high-level
design tools, and will accept a more complete input specification including
loops and conditional branches. Our method will allow the designer to make
tradeoffs which were hitherto not possible. An example is tradeoffs between
communication overheads and performance of the design.
