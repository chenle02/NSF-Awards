9705064 Dobrowolska This is a renewal proposal to study semiconductor
heterostructures. Molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) will be used to fabricate three
new semiconductor systems: II-VI self-assembled quantum dots (QDs); diluted
magnetic III-V semiconductors; and II- VI semiconductor microcavities. The self-
assembled QD project will focus on investigation of CdSe QDs grown on ZnSe.
Formation of III-V magnetic systems will be attempted by MBE growth of solid
solutions of III-V compounds and Mn chalcogenides (e.g., MnTe). Finally,
fabrication of II-VI microcavities will focus on MBE fabrication of distributed
Bragg reflectors for ZnSe/ZnCdSe quantum well structures. The above systems will
be investigated by photoluminescence spectroscopy, optical absorption, and
magneto-optical methods. All three projects address fundamental issues relevant
to optoelectronic applications of semiconductor heterostructures. %%% This is a
renewal proposal to study semiconductor heterostructures. Thin film systems
consisting of alternating layers of dissimilar semiconductors
("heterostructures") play a critical role in technologically important devices,
such as light emitting diodes, semiconductor lasers, and sensors. Molecular beam
epitaxy is a method of forming such multilayers with unprecedented atomic-scale
perfection. The present project will apply this method to three new frontiers:
the formation of semiconductor structures on the scale of 100 atoms in all three
directions ("quantum dots"); the formation of technologically important magnetic
semiconductors whose properties can be varied by magnetic field; and fabrication
of "microcavities" of immediate importance to the operation of blue light
emitters. Optical studies of these systems are expected to pave the way toward
new optoelectronic applications. ***
