Historians have argued that journalists have become increasingly aggressive and
adversarial in their treatment of government officials and political candidates.
If so, this trend runs counter to established norms of politeness in interaction
and to rituals of deference to political leaders. This project investigates
whether and how a rise in adversarialness has emerged in presidential press
conferences - the major venue for relationships between the press and the
nations' top political leader. The press conference remains a central
institution of political communication where the president explains and
justifies policies, and where journalists discharge their questioning task under
public scrutiny. Thus recognizing the crucial importance of presidential press
conferences, the project examines the evolution of the practices journalists use
to question presidents, the level of deference or adversarialness embodied in
the questions, and the mix of journalistic, political, and historical factors
that explain patterns of questioning over the latter half of the twentieth
century.

Using a sample of presidential press conferences from Dwight Eisenhower (1953)
to Bill Clinton (2000), the project codes each question asked on the basis of
four primary dimensions of adversarialness: 1) initiative, 2) bluntness, 3)
assertiveness, and 4) hostility. Analysis of the data reveals if there has been
a general decline in deference and a rise of adversarialness, if changes relate
to specific historical events or individual presidents, if the introduction of
broadcast journalism and television cameras affects the type of questions, if
political partisanship explains some of the variation in questions, and if the
president's standing in the polls influences the style of questioning. The
answers the project provides to these questions enhance our understanding of the
institutions of the presidency and journalism, and their co-evolution over time.
