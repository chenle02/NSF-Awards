This project has two distinct parts, each suggested by problems of inference in
genomic experiments. The first problem arises because, typically, thousands of
genes are screened, and a smaller number are selected for further study.
Statistical inference must take this selection mechanism into account, otherwise
the actual confidence coefficient is smaller than the nominal level, and
approaches zero as the number of genes increases. The goal is to construct valid
frequentist confidence intervals for the means of the selected populations. This
will provide a confidence interval alternative to the False Discovery Rate. The
second problem deals with inference under model uncertainty, where the goal is
to account for the variability induced by the collection of models. Here a
Bayesian approach is taken, seeking to construct intervals accounting for model
uncertainty, investigate the impact of the choice of priors on model space, and
construct new search algorithms that take advantage of parallel processing and
can be used in the case when there are more covariates than observations.

The work will have impact in both genomic studies and high performance
computing. First, for inference from genomic studies, a valid statistical
procedure to screen results will be provided. Insuring that the inferences are
valid is of crucial importance, as illustrated by a recent NY Times article
where a genomic disease therapy was found to be useless, because of faulty
statistical inference (``How Bright Promise in Cancer Testing Fell Apart", NY
Times, July 7, 2011). Second, parallel processing algorithms, using high
performance computing, will be developed. These algorithms take advantage of the
abundance of processors typically available, and split the large genomic
selection problem across the many processors. This results in answers from these
statistical procedures that can be available in real time, and thus be relevant
in a clinical setting.
