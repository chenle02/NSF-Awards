Undergraduate chemistry instruction has been enhanced at Bethany College by the
acquisition of a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer. Students are provided
with opportunities to obtain real spectra of synthesis products and to study
chemical phenomena such as metal ion complexation and acid-base equilibria. This
acquisition is part of a five year plan by the Chemistry Department to improve
laboratory instrumentation.
