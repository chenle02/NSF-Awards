This award supports a new international REU site hosted at the University of
Michigan's Center for Ultrafast Optical Sciences (CUOS) with research
opportunities at Ecole Polytechnique, Ecole Nationale de Techniques Avancées
(ENSTA), and the Institut d'Optique in Palaiseau, France. The students will be
put into research teams that include 2 students, a faculty member at UM and a
faculty member in one of the Parisian institutions. The students will spend one
week in Ann Arbor, followed by 9 weeks in Paris. Each student will keep weekly
on-line research diaries for discussion in weekly video teleconferences with
each full group. A CUOS research scientist will accompany the students to Paris
and stay for two weeks to ensure that the students get a good start. The
students will be housed in a local dormitory in Ann Arbor and at the Cité
Universitaire in Paris. The research in all projects will all involve the use of
ultrafast lasers to discover very current, state-of-the art phenomena in a wide
range of fields including; relativistic optics, plasma physics, materials
spectroscopy, nanomachining, art restoration and conservation, patterned
biological cell templating, high power fiber lasers, plasma x-ray sources,
dynamics of nano-magnetic materials, terahertz imaging, biomedical imaging with
shaped pulses, fatigue life studies of materials, etc. This award is co-funded
by the Physics Division and the Office of International Science and Engineering.
