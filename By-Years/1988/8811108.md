This research develops software components for a fully automated system for
building knowledge bases about language. The knowledge bases produced are
structured to be compatible with computer systems for processing natural
language (natural language understanding, natural language generation, and
natural language translation systems, for example). The knowledge-acquisition
system does not require extensive human intervention or "knowlege engineering,"
but builds the knowledge base from standard text input, such as conventional
dictionaries (many of which are becoming available in machine-readable form.
Initial work will be with the Longman's Dictionary of Contemporary English.) The
significance of this research is that natural language processing systems, for
machine translation, user interfaces, and knowledge based systems, must
incorporate extensive knowledge about words and their meanings in the real
world. This work is an important exploration of the extent to which the
necessary knowledge may be found and built from existing text sources (e.g.
dictionaries, encyclopedias). The lexical/semantic knowledge bases generated are
intended for widespread utilization, both for applications and for further
scientific investigation by the natural language processing research community.
