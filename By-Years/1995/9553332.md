9553332 Patterson The Morehouse College Research Scholars program is designed to
increase the number of students who attend graduate school and earn doctorates
in the sciences. The objectives of the program are: 1)to motivate students to
pursue careers in science research through a coordinated mentoring program; 2)
to provide participants in the program with early research experiences,
beginning with a prefreshman summer program; 3) to enhance the academic
preparation of students through enrichment courses, counseling, mentoring
colloquia, and seminars; and 4) to provide students with information on graduate
schools, fellowships and research careers. The program consists of four
components to accomplish the stated objectives: 1) an academic year research and
enrichment program for undergraduates; 2) a prefreshman summer research and
enrichment program; 3) summer research activities for upperclassmen; and 4) a
coordinated mentoring/counseling program. The project will serve a target group
of up to fifteen scholastically talented undergraduates at the College who are
science majors. These students will be assigned to faculty mentors who will
direct their research projects and serve as academic advisors. The participants
will enroll in enrichment courses, and participate in student colloquia and
departmental seminars. Emphasis will be placed on a coordinated
mentoring/counseling program to ensure the students' academic and research
progress. In order to enhance student preparation for graduate school, specific
strategies will be implemented through a "Bridge to Graduate School Mentoring
Program." Formal relationships will be established with ten or more graduate
schools where participants in the program may consider matriculation. it is
expected that the Research Scholars Program will significantly increase the
number of Morehouse graduates who obtain doctorates in the sciences over the
next five to ten years.
