0439389 Chu The proposed research develops and examines the efficiency of a
novel molecular technique for identification and quantification of waterborne
pathogens. A novel view of virulence genes as biomarkers for pathogenic species
is proposed and could enable effective molecular quantification of pathogens in
water samples. If successful, this study could develop an approach for applying
molecular techniques as routine drinking water monitoring tools, and enabling
the generation of quantitative data, that is necessary for assessing potential
health threats. It is also expected that a new form of dose-response
relationship, expressed as copies of virulence genes vs. health risk, will be
developed.
