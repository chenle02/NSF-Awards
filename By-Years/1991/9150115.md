Leading geographers from the Association of American Geographers together with
secondary school teachers will produce a curriculum materials package for use in
existing and emerging social science classes in the secondary schools. The
materials will focus on population, patterns, economic regionalization and
political geography as factors that shape the pattern of human-environment
interaction throughout the nation. The aim is a broad contextual understanding
of environmental issues with particular emphasis on the kinds of global problems
that require coordinated action at the global, regional and local levels. The
materials will consist of a concise geography text, a set of classroom and
individual student activities, related readings, and a detailed teachers'
manual. Student assessment instruments will also be developed. The materials
will incorporate features that reflect trends in several aspects of the
secondary curriculum as recommended by "Guidelines for Geographic Education,"
the NCTM Standards, the report, "Charting a Course: Social Studies Curriculum
for the 21st Century" published by the National Commission on Social Studies in
Schools. Formative evaluation will be conducted by an outside expert and the
network of Geographic Alliances will play a central role in materials
dissemination and teacher enhancement.
