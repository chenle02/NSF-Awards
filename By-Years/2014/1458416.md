This National Science Foundation (NSF) Scholarships in Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project at the University of South
Carolina (USC) will increase the number of students with demonstrated financial
need who complete undergraduate geoscience degrees within the School of the
Earth, Ocean, and Environment (SEOE). The program will encourage applications
from individuals belonging to groups currently underrepresented in the
geosciences and from first generation college students. In addition to
conducting outreach activities and providing scholarships, the project will
employ evidenced-based program practices that are built upon existing successful
programs at USC. These practices include a summer orientation, mathematics
skills improvement, and a common course program. The program will help students
to persist in geosciences majors and graduate in a timely manner. Providing
scholarships to academically strong STEM students, who may not otherwise be able
to afford college, will increase the number of STEM graduates prepared to fill
the needs of national, regional, and local industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
GEO-Scholar program at the University of South Carolina will increase student
exposure to the geosciences by developing an outreach program that results in
increased interest, knowledge, and performance from targeted students. Each year
scholarships will be awarded to 6 to 8 academically talented students majoring
in the geosciences who demonstrate financial need. The project will increase
recruitment and retention of students majoring in the geosciences by adding new
programs and institutionalizing geoscience modifications to programs that
currently exist at USC. The student support services will include an emphasis on
improving mathematics skills, participation in a common course during the first
year, and a summer orientation program. GEO-Scholars at USC will increase the
number of well-prepared and skilled employees in the geosciences by working with
faculty and public and private sectors to provide research, internship, and work
opportunities that further familiarize participants with career opportunities in
the geosciences. Assessment and evaluation will provide insight into the
retention benefits of student scholarships, career development activities, and
faculty mentoring and advising. Lessons learned and effective practices that
emerge from the program evaluation data will be disseminated widely to the STEM
education community and help increase widespread understanding of the attributes
and practices of successful student scholarship and support programs.
