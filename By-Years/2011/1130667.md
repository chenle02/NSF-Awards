The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop a rigorous framework for the
optimization of multibody dynamical systems with joint constraints, contact, and
friction. This will be accomplished by developing new tools for the optimization
of dynamical systems described by differential algebraic equations or by
differential equations with inequality constraints. This will be accomplished
by: (a) optimizing multibody systems with joints under constraints on the
admissible parameter set; (b) optimizing multibody systems with joints under
constraints on the admissible trajectory. Such constraints occur in trajectory
planning where static obstacles are avoided, and when physical considerations
limit the motion; (c) optimizing multibody systems with joints, contacts, and
friction. This is the most challenging scenario since the contact forces are
discontinuous. (d) identifying and developing efficient numerical solution
techniques for the new algorithms developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of
this project will provide tools for optimizing a large class of dynamical
systems which were not otherwise possible to implement. Areas that will benefit
from the results of this project include robotics, vehicle dynamics, aerospace
engineering, biomedical device engineering, and military applications. The
proposed work will have a significant educational component at post-doctoral,
graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 levels. The results of the project will be
incorporated in a graduate level course. Lectures will be given at the Women in
Computer Day events. The project will support the organization of an annual
Merit Badge College Workshop to promote interest in science and engineering
among K-12 students. The research findings will be disseminated through journal
papers and conference proceedings.
