*** 9615279 Martinson The proposed work is an extended analysis of a data set
generated as part of an integrated research program ("Anzflux") into the
oceanographic structure of upper mixed layer of the eastern Weddell Sea. It was
carried out from the RVIB Nathaniel B. Palmer in the austral winter of 1994. The
work proposed here concerns the integration of hydrographic and geochemical
tracer data to determine the three-dimensional oceanic structure on various
spatial scales for the validation of oceanic models, and specifically to
determine the magnitude of the heat flux from the ocean to the atmosphere. The
eastern Weddell Sea is a region where a warm regime, defined by the intrusion of
warm circumpolar deep water with temperatures near +1 deg C, and a cold regime
exist side by side. The cold regime occurs to the west, where deep water is
overlain by a thick near-freezing mixed layer. In both regions however enough
heat is seasonally carried to the sea ice to melt it completely. The specific
objective of the proposed work is to improve our understanding of how the
intense mixing events associated with frequent storms affect the structure and
seasonal evolution of the upper layers of the ocean and the sea ice cover. The
structure of the upper layers in turn affects the stability of the deeper ocean,
and determines the depth of convection and the longer term variability in
temperature and salinity of the deep ocean. *** ??
