This project will upgrade the existing undergraduate mechanical engineering
laboratories. Modern computer-controlled flow measurement, dynamometer, and
pressure and temperature sensors will be integrated into new experiments. These
will cover the performance of heat pumps, internal combustion engines and
metallurgical and structural components. Automation of a solar collector to
determine absorption, heat losses, and collector efficiency is planned.
