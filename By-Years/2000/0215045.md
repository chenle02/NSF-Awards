This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
pulse measurement device intended to fully characterize optical pulses used in
fiber optic telecommunication systems. Next generation optical networks will use
40 Gbit/s rates requiring pulse widths of less than ~25 picoseconds. At this
pulse width, dispersion compensation is required to obtain transmission
distances of greater than 25 km. In addition, nonlinear optical effects will
complicate system development by adding intensity-dependent dispersion. Optical
network designers are anticipating these problems by developing active
dispersion compensation. However, a requirement of active dispersion
compensation is accurate measurements of pulse intensity and phase within an
optical network. Then, corrections to the dispersion compensation can be
determined exactly. A pulse characterization device is proposed that will be
self-contained, have only one fiberized input, be rugged and easy to
use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This technology has commercial potential as a
diagnostic for telecommunications research and as a diagnostic for optical
network design. As optical networks move beyond the OC-192 standard, active
dispersion compensation will be required. This technology can used in research
applications and can be part of a feedback mechanism to actively control
dispersion in functioning optical networks.
