This 4-year Leadership project will target five geographically distributed
districts in Wisconsin, and is designed to (1) increase participant knowledge of
Wisconsin geology and ecology; (2) increase the amount of field-based science
used in the classroom; (3) develop participant understanding of the research
base of teaching and learning as well as the application of that knowledge; (4)
develop participant leadership skills and apply those skills in community and
professional activities; and (5) develop a professional support network. The
project will also select teams of two teachers per school; provide sessions for
principals that engage them in field-based activities; actively work with the
teachers in their schools to implement a field-based program; utilize a
Materials Resource Center developed through a present NSF project for earth
science teachers; and use the experience of the Wisconsin Elementary Science
Teachers (WEST) to work with participants in the development of quality
workshops for other elementary teachers in the district as well as across the
state. Twenty-seven days of scheduled activities, most of which are in the
field, will be held. A resource Center will provide an overview of available
field-based materials as well as a source of activities. This proposal is
appropriate for teacher enhancement because it plans a strong Leadership project
designed to increase the amount of field-based science used in the classroom,
and to develop participant understanding of the research base of teaching and
learning as well as the application of that knowledge. Non-NSF cost-sharing is
approximately 38% of the amount requested from NSF.
