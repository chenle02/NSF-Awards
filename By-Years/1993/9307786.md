9307786 Makowski X ray and neutron diffraction from partially ordered, partially
oriented specimens have the potential to provide detailed structural information
about biological structures that cannot be obtained by any other method.
Macromolecules that form fibrous, one dimensional assemblies or membranous two
dimensional assemblies are often difficult to crystallize, and when they do form
crystals, may do so in conformations different from that in the assembly.
Structural characterization of these assemblies is essential to understanding
their functions. The goal of this project is to expand the range of
macromolecular assemblies amenable to detailed structural analysis, and to
define the limits to which structural analysis can determine their structures.
Towards that end, a number of methods will be developed and will be tested using
data from the filamentous bacteriophage M13, its isomorphous derivatives,
mutants and variants. The extensive base of biophysical data available on this
phage particle provides a unique opportunity for the testing of new methods on
an important biological assembly. %%% New methods for the study of
macromolecular assemblies using x ray and neutron diffraction will be developed
and tested using the filamentous bacteriophage M13 as a test system. M13 is
extensively used as a cloning vector, and as a vehicle for the display of
foreign peptides. Insertion mutants of M13 now being developed will be used in
the future for a diverse set of biotechnological applications ranging from
bioremediation to vaccines. Understanding the structure of M13 will provide a
basis for the design of new strains of M13 for use in this phage display
technology. This project will result in basic structural information about M13
that will aid in the development of new viral particles with great potential for
use in technological applications. ***
