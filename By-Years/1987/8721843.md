This project funds, in collaboration with DOE, an annual major international
conference on neutrino physics. The conference will cover a broad range of
topics, experimental and theoretical, including neutrino properties and
interactions and neutrino astrophysics. It is expected that as a result of this
conference progress in the field will be facilitated; in particular, it will
help ensure maximum effectiveness for funds devoted in the future to new
experiments.
