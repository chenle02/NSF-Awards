College&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RUI: Modules and Parallel Specialization of Object
Types &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to improve
the design of statically-typed object-oriented programming languages, especially
with regard to issues of programming in the medium to large scale. Research will
focus on: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Module systems for object-oriented languages:
Modules provide support for organizing code, abstraction barriers to hide
information, and support for separate compilation. However, current module
systems lack the flexibility to capture a number of common ways in which to
design programs in object-oriented languages. &lt;br/&gt;2. Simultaneous
modification of mutually recursive types and classes: This research will develop
ways to support incremental modification of mutually recursive types while
preserving type safety and important &lt;br/&gt;relations between types and
classes. &lt;br/&gt;3. Typed intermediate languages and virtual machines for
object-oriented languages: Run-time systems like the target virtual machines for
Java and C# lack support for advanced object-oriented languages and module
systems. Exploring compilation techniques and virtual machines to support these
features is necessary to ensure their eventual adoption. This research will
continue using LOOM as a test bed for further investigations into the best way
to support features of object-oriented languages, while also investigating how
to use the best of these ideas to enhance real languages like Java and its
successors.&lt;br/&gt;
