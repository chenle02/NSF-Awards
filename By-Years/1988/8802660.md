This project is mathematical research in Banach space theory, which treats such
matters as the convergence of series and integrals in an infinite-dimensional
setting. It has historical connections to more concrete applied subjects
because, for instance, solutions to differential equations are often
conveniently thought of as inhabiting an appropriate Banach space of functions.
More specifically, Professor Lin will study ultraproducts of certain function
spaces, asymptotic properties of Banach spaces, and issues of type and cotype,
particularly weak Hilbert spaces.
