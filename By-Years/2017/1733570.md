The Association for Computing Machinery proposes to provide scholarships to
enable greater participation in the 2017 Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity
in Computing Conference. That annual conference celebrates diversity in
computing, bringing together students, faculty, and professionals in computer
science and computer engineering who represent diversity across backgrounds,
gender, ethnicity, and disability status. The conference enables attendees to
connect with each other, receive mentoring from more senior community members,
and be inspired by leaders in computer science and computer engineering, and
their research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tapia conference has grown from 161
participants in 2001 to almost 1,000 participants in 2016, with a diversity
reflecting that of our country. In 2016, 93% of the student attendees found that
the conference was inspiring, and 97% said that it provided them with an
opportunity to make new connections. The scholarships funded under this proposal
will be available to undergraduate and graduate students, faculty from Minority
Serving Institutions, and doctoral students participating in the conference?s
Doctoral Consortium.
