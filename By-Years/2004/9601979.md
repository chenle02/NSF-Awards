96-01979 Houston The PIs propose an interdisciplinary study of the nature of
deep earthquakes. This research will test the validity of the proposed mechanism
of transformation-induced faulting that accompanies the metastable phase change
from olivine to spinel in subducting lithospheric slabs. Laboratory
microstructural and rheological experiments and seismological studies will be
continued and will be enhanced by geodynamic modeling studies at both laboratory
(micromechanical modeling of the transformation-induced instability) and earth
scales (large-scale thermal and mechanical modeling). Understanding the failure
mechanism of deep earthquakes is important for determining the internal
mineralogical structure of subducting slabs and identifying the driving forces
for convection in the earth's mantle. ***
