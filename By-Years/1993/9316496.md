Buchanan 9316496 This proposal is based on recent evidence that the
NADP/thioredoxin system (consisting of thioredoxin h, NADP-thioredoxin reductase
and NADPH) functions in seed germination. Thioredoxin specifically reduces major
storage proteins of cereals (gliadins and glutenins in wheat), thereby enhancing
their solubility and susceptibility to proteinases, and reductively inactivates
a disulfide protein that inhibits alpha-amylase, an enzyme of starch degradation
(barley alpha-amylase/subtilisin inhibitor). An extension of this research has
shown that the thioredoxin system strengthens the gluten protein network,
thereby enhancing bread quality, and inactivates trypsin inhibitor proteins,
thereby potentially improving the nutritional quality of soybean. A patent
application covering these findings has been filed, and precommercial
development of thioredoxin technology has commenced. The proposed research
addresses fundamental new questions: (1) Does thioredoxin have additional
regulatory functions in the germination of cereals such as wheat? (2) What
changes in redox state and abundance does thioredoxin undergo during
germination? (3) Does the activity of enzymes necessary for the reduction of
thioredoxin change during germination? (4) Does thioredoxin function in the
germination of other types of seeds such as soybean?. The research will add to
our understanding of thioredoxin function, enzyme regulation and seed
germination. %%% This proposal stems from research in which we have presented
evidence for an enzyme system (the "thioredoxin system") that functions as the
earliest known signal triggering the germination of cereals such as wheat. The
thioredoxin system functions by (1) activating storage proteins of the grain,
thereby enabling their use as a source of nitrogen and energy by the seedling,
and (2) activating enzymes required for the degradation of starch, thereby
enhancing energy production in the early phase of germination. An extension of
this research indicates that the thioredoxin system is of technological value.
Application of the system to flour strengthens gluten and enhances bread
quality. The thioredoxin system also neutralizes plant protein inhibitors of
animal digestive enzymes. Application of the thioredoxin system to foods like
soybean may enhance their nutritional quality. A patent application covering
these uses has been filed, and precommercial development of thioredoxin
technology has commenced. The current project represents an extension of the
fundamental aspects of this research. The experiments planned will show whether
the thioredoxin system has additional functions in wheat and whether the system
is important in the germination of other seed types. ***
