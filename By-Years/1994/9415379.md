This project will formulate a comprehensive and self-consistent theory of
electron and ion acceleration in impulsive solar flares, and specifically to
account for the near simultaneous acceleration of electrons and ions as
manifested by the approximately coincident observed time profiles of X-ray and
nucleation de-excitation line emission. The PIs will investigate in detail the
evolution of an initially Maxwellian electron distribution in response to an
applied DC electric field, taking into account wave generation and the resulting
feedback of the waves on the electrons. They will also investigate the
parametric decay of these waves into lower hybrid sidebands and low-frequency
electrostatic waves. Theoretical results will be compared with observations of
solar flares whenever possible to guide subsequent work and progressively
constrain model parameters. This research aims to explain near simultaneous
acceleration of electrons and ions, as well as the high electron/proton ratio in
impulsive solar flares.
