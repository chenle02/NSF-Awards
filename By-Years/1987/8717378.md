The Sixth Southwestern Developmental Biology Conference will be held February
25-28, 1988, at the Marine Science Institute, Port Aransas, Texas. The
conference is organized by a committee of six faculty members at the Center for
Developmental Biology, The University of Texas at Austin. The conference is
sponsored by the Society for Developmental Biology and the American Society of
Zoologists. The general topic of the conference is "Gene Expression, Cell
Determination, and Pattern Formation in Development." The scientific program
will comprise a keynote address, six plenary sessions, two poster sessions,
major presentations from nationally leading scientists will be complemented by
shorter presentations from regional participants. Participation of postdoctoral
fellows and graduate students will be encouraged. They will be eligible for
prizes awarded for best posters and oral presentations. Junior participants who
show posters or make oral presentations will be reimbursred for travel and other
expenses as much as possible. Funds are requested to support junior participants
and to defray the expenses of invited speakers. These regional meetings are of
value as they allow graduate students and post-doctoral researchers the
opportunity to present their research and interact with experts in the field.
