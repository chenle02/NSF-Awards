Research will be conducted in several areas of statistics: (1) Marden will work
on nonnull models for rank statistics and the development of new rank
procedures; (2) Martinsek will work on sequential models for determining the
estimator as well as the sample size in location and regression models;
comparison of slope estimates in adaptive stochastic approximation; and
asymptotically optimal procedures in multistage estimation; (3) Stout's research
will be on probabilistic modeling and statistical analysis for interesting data
structures, including those found in multiple item response tests and where
there are latent variables; (4) Wijsman's research will include the study of
sequential confidence sets and develop a method of using cross sections to
deriving distributions in models that admit invariance transformations. This
research in the general area of statistics aims to come to grips with a broad
variety of mathematical and methodological problems that have been encountered
in current efforts to extend statistics to a broader variety of applications.
Included are major thrusts to develop sequential methods for analyzing data,
with the potential for saving resources in scientific experimentation.
