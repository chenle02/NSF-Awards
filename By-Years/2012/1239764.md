The Luquillo Long-Term Ecological Research Program (LUQ) integrates research and
educational activities through a focus on two great challenges confronting
society in the 21st Century: climate change and land use change. The goal is to
understand: 1) how the environment of northeast Puerto Rico is changing; 2) the
consequences of such change for biodiversity, biogeochemistry, and ecosystem
services; and 3) how society can manage or adapt to these changes. Research will
involve continuing long-term studies along climate and land use gradients,
modeling and synthesis, and long-term field experiments and a new landscape-
level project that are designed to provide a mechanistic understanding of the
effects of key drivers of long-term change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using
integrated theoretical, experimental, and observational approaches, LUQ 5 will
provide a comprehensive scientific framework for evaluating the management of
tropical ecosystems and their services. The program will continue to train
numerous graduate and undergraduate students, especially members of
underrepresented groups, producing a cadre of collaborative, multidisciplinary
scientists who can link population, community, and ecosystem approaches to
provide a predictive understanding of environmental change. Schoolyard LTER in
LUQ 5 will reach teachers and hundreds of middle and high school students
through field research and via a web-based middle school curriculum for teaching
ecology.&lt;br/&gt;
