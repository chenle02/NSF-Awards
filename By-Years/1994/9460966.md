Nanocrystalline materials are stronger, tougher, denser, and more easily
fabricated than conventional large grain materials. They also offer increased
strength/corrosion resistance/ electrical conductivity besides significantly
improved ductility and hardness. They can be sintered and hot pressed to
theoretical density at lower temperatures and are hence desired in numerous
structural applications. In this Phase I effort, MMI will use the pulsed
reactive electrode (PRE) technique that has been developed by MMI to form
nanocrystalline powders (5 - 100 nm). The powders can be separated using
standard centrifuge methods and washed to remove any organic ingredients. The
technique has the possibility to produce unique compositions of nanocomposites
in large quantities (1-5 kg/hr) that cannot be produced by any of the other
currently available methods such as sputtering, laser ablation or evaporation.
The nanopowders will be rapidly compacted using a novel technique that produces
near theoretical density and retains the original grain size. We will
demonstrate greatly improved mechanical properties for eventual use in elevated
temperature applications.
