Beginning with the works of Anthony Downs (1957) and Duncan Black (1958), a
large literature on voting in mass elections and voting in committees has
developed that uses the mathematical tools of game theory to enhance our
understanding of politics. As these political events are often conducted by
secret ballot, it is not surprising that this work on spatial models of voting
has taken as given that voters cast their ballots simultaneously. With a secret
ballot, the order in which votes are cast is irrelevant because the last voter
has no more information about the other ballots than the first voter. However,
several important types of elections are sequential in nature; later voters can
observe the votes or election results of earlier voters. This proposal
investigates the effect that these informational differences have on the
behavior of voters who are late in the voting sequence. This research develops a
formal model in which voters start with private information about the quality of
the candidates. Voters can supplement this information with inferences drawn
from earlier votes in the sequence. Several extensions of this model are
developed that capture some of the unique features of the presidential
nominating process.
