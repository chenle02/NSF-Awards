Presently two required laboratory courses are offered to undergraduate astronomy
majors - a junior level astronomical techniques course and a senior levels
projects course. Both courses need The project is updating two required
laboratory courses to include material beyond photoelectric techniques for
performing stellar photometry by expanding them to include a variety of topics
in imaging, with a special emphasis on noise analysis. The generation,
manipulation, detection, and computer processing of images is covered. An
imaging lab has been set up to include a uniform light source with a pattern
projector, a simple dispersive spectrograph on an optical bench, a high quality
optical CCD imaging camera with a programmable readout and control circuit,
noise analysis instrumentation, and an image acquisition and processing
computer. A variety of experiments are done, including spectroscopy of atomic
lines and continuum sources, image acquisition and calibration, noise and
signal-to-noise analysis, the statistics of photon detection and Poisson
distributions, the concept of a digital image and its processing, image quality
and its effect on point source detectability, the effect of electronic noise on
image quality, and the theory and practice of computer interfaces to modern
instrumentation. These are incorporated into the junior level lab as structured
exercises performed in groups of two students alternating with existing projects
and classroom lectures. Seniors undertake special projects with one-on-one
supervision to develop new experiments for incorporation into the junior level
course. The laboratory gives students a comprehensive exposure to imaging theory
and techniques in a practical and involved environment.
