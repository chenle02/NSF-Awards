The broad objective of this research is to characterize utilization of early
successional habitats by a non-human primate community in West Africa.
Specifically, the proposed research will examine the relationship between
primate utilization of early successional plots and potentially influential
components of the habitat such as vegetation phenology patterns, availability
and quality of fruit resources in young vs. older secondary forest; distribution
of large residual trees within clearings; and distance categories from forest
edge. Data collection will be accomplished by systematic surveys of primate
utilization patterns along with vegetation phenology surveys, collection of
fruits from fruit traps, and analysis of the constituents (nutrient content and
digestibility reducers) and morphology (color and size) of available fruits.
Particular attention will be directed toward the identification of keystone
resources occurring within early successional habitats. The field study will be
conducted at Tiwai, Sierra Leone. Tiwai, Sierra Leone. A site with a high
diversity (11 species) and density of primates, along with a high degree of
habitat heterogeneity. Fruit and data analysis will follow at Rutgers
University.
