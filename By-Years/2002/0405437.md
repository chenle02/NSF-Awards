A broadband seismograph network - the NARS-Baja network (Network of Autonomously
Recording Seismographs) - consisting of 14 three-component broadband
seismographs is being completed and operated in Baja and Sonora, Mexico, around
the Gulf of California. The instruments have been installed in cooperation with
the University of Utrecht and Centro de Investigacion Cientifica y de Educacion
Superior de Ensenada and will be in operation for at least for 3 years. The data
are retrieved from the stations approximately every three months and are
available through the IRIS-Data Management Center and the Southern California
Earthquake Data Center. With these data, the investigators are mapping the
crustal and upper mantle structure around the Gulf of California using receiver
functions, tomography, and surface wave analysis with the aim to investigate
the: 1) difference in mantle structure beneath the Gulf of California and the
North American plate boundary; 2) the possible relation of along-strike
structural complexity in the crust and mantle and the systematic change in
deformation style in the Gulf of California rift; and 3) the location of active
faults in the Gulf and their slip direction. This project has strong synergism
with other NSF-funded large-scale projects such as EarthScope and MARGINS).
