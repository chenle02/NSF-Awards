9761141 Kim This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
develop an optoelectronic face recognition system, in which problems associated
with traditional systems such as invariant recognition multi-stage operation,
system complexity, high cost and large data storage capacity requirements will
be overcome using a neural network-embedded optical joint transform correlator
(JTC). This unique combination of neural networks and JTC will be invariant to
facial expression, facial hair, head position, camera scale and lighting, and
can be used in a variety of security applications including access control
systems, personal identification systems and other bio-metric-signature based
security systems.
