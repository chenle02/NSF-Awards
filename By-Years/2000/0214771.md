This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves the
exploitation of nano-materials as optical based chemical sensors. This
innovative approach to chemical sensing will take advantage of the material's
quantum size effects, such as enhanced absorption and photoluminescence
properties (sensitivity), high surface areas for analyze sensing
(miniaturization), and ease of synthetic preparation (specificity). The use of
optical based sensors provides additional advantages, such as no electrical
noise, fast response, ease of miniaturization, safe near flammables, more
durable than electronics, and applications to remote sensing. The
characterization of the optical and electronic properties of the nanomaterials
is critical to their development into the proposed optical sensor
arrays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will also contribute to the
increasing information database of nanomaterials as they pertain to advanced
electronic materials. The research will lay the groundwork for fabricating
multi-analyze optical sensors. The technology, once successfully developed, will
be used the semiconductor manufacturing industry.
