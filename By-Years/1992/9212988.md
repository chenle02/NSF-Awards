High temperature Vacuum/Inert Atmosphere furnace and Tensile gripping fixtures
will be purchased and used to study mechanical behavior of advanced metallic,
intermetallic, ceramic and composite materials up to 2000oC. The research
encompasses fiber reinforced ceramic composites, damage processes in
glass/ceramic matrix composites, and effect of microstructure and solutes on
tensile and creep deformation of TiAl based alloys.
