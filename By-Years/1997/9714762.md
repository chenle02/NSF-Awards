Abstract ATM-9714762 Robinson, David A. Rutgers University Title: Eastern United
States Climate and Atlantic Sea Surface Temperature This proposal is for a
comprehensive investigation, for all four seasons, of linkages between the
western North Atlantic Sea Surface Temperature (SSTAs) and regional scale
climate anomalies in the eastern United States. The proposal aims at identifying
and diagnosing, by a combination of methods, anomalies of temperature,
precipitation, and snowfall associated with certain SSTA patterns. Results of
the proposed research will lead to better understanding and prediction of the
climate of the densely populated eastern seaboard.`
