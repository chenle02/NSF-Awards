With the support of a Capacity Building Grant, the University of Indianapolis is
developing the infrastructure to support a Noyce Scholarship Program. Building
on the success of its Woodrow Wilson Indiana Teaching Fellowship Program, which
attracts recent graduates and career changers into urban science and mathematics
teaching, the university seeks to increase the number of undergraduate chemistry
majors entering teaching by 300% and undergraduate biology majors entering
teaching by 100%. The project goals include graduating 8-10 Noyce Scholars per
year who are prepared to teach science in grades 7-12. Specifically, the
University of Indianapolis' College of Arts and Sciences and School of Education
are developing the Noyce Scholarship Program in collaboration with Christel
House Academy, Metropolitan School District of Decatur Township, Metropolitan
School District of Perry Township, and Metropolitan School District of Wayne
Township, all of which are qualified as high-need, in the state of Indiana.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project planning team, comprised of a diverse group of
stakeholders, is creating a science teaching curriculum that is content-rich,
requires Noyce Scholars to spend substantial time in partner schools, and
includes mentoring support in the first three years of urban or rural high-need
teaching. The team is also creating strategies for recruiting high-ability
students into science teaching, particularly those from underrepresented groups;
working with University of Indianapolis advisors to recruit non-continuing pre-
health students into science teaching; developing new partnerships with
corporations and not-for-profit organizations to offer paid summer internships
to Noyce Scholars; and devising institutional processes for scholarship
selection, disbursement and compliance.
