This is a part of the coordinated research program in prestressed structural
systems. In order to study the behavior of the two broad types of connection
type, a flexible analytical platform will be developed. This platform will be an
extension of the computer analysis program DRAIN 2D-X to accommodate the
development of three-dimensional elements, to include slaving constraints and to
enhance presently available pre-and post-processing tools while refining current
procedures for the nonlinear static and dynamic analysis of structures. Special
purpose elements will also be developed. These will be based on physical fiber
models and will permit various levels of analysis sophistication. Significant
part of the total effort will be directed towards documenting the analytical
procedures which underlie the analytical platform in order to facilitate the
inclusion of special purpose elements by other program participants.
Documentation will also be provided to guide other participants and users in the
use of the program. This project will develop the basic analytical capability
necessary to carry out all the studies involved in the overall seismic precast
structure research program.
