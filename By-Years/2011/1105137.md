Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Nanocomposites in which semimetallic rare-earth-
monopnictide (RE-V) nanoparticles are epitaxially embedded within III-V
semiconductors are an exciting new class of electronic materials. The unique
properties of these nanocomposites have already led to improved performance in
prototype devices ranging from thermoelectrics to tunnel junctions. Despite this
progress, the fundamental nanoscale physical properties of these nanocomposites
remain poorly understood. For example, both the source of carriers and the
interfacial contributions to charge transport and energy relaxation remain
unknown. In this grant, well-characterized InAs quantum dots will be used as a
local probe of the properties of single RE-V nanoparticles. The single
nanoparticle spectroscopy will be complemented by ensemble ultrafast optical and
terahertz spectroscopy. The ultrafast measurements will quantify the dynamic
properties of the nanocomposites while the single nanoparticle spectroscopy will
enable development of a microscopic theory of material properties. In addition
to allowing measurements of single nanoparticles, the incorporation of quantum
dots will provide a new tool for unprecedented control over growth morphology
and the production of radically new nanocomposite structures.&lt;br/&gt;Non-
Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports efforts to fundamentally
understand a technologically-relevant nanocomposites system. The comprehensive
understanding of nanoscale physical properties developed through this grant will
lead directly to practical applications with far-reaching impacts, including
improved energy harvesting devices and significant advances in terahertz science
and technology. Two graduate students will be exposed to a highly
interdisciplinary environment, and K-12 students in local schools will benefit
from teacher training activities and also the creation of educational equipment
that will be loaned to local schools.
