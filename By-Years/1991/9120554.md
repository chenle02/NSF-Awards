Portfolio models and models of capital market equilibrium play an important
role in financial economics. Past work by the investigator developed and tested
these models and extended the reasoning of financial economics to issues in
macroeconomics. The project continues this line of research by studying
systematically the variables that explain the cross-section of expected stock
returns. The existing literature identifies many variables (firm size, leverage,
market to book value of equity, earnings-to-price ratios, measures of risk) that
are related to the cross-section of expected returns. Preliminary suggest that
the cross-section variation in expected returns can be explained by just two
factors, the size of the firm and the market to book equity value. The
robustness of this empirical finding will be checked. The ultimate goal is a
comprehensive empirical description and an explanation of the interaction
between business conditions, the cross-section of expected returns, and the
variation through time in expected returns. The project also continues a study
of the permanent and temporary variation in output and its components,
especially investment. This work is important in its own right and it will
eventually lead to a more detailed explanation of the links between expected
returns the real activity. The detailed study by this project of the relations
between the variation of expected returns through time and the structure of
expected returns across financial markets contributes to our understanding of
the efficiency of capital markets, i.e., the general notion that in pricing
securities the market correctly uses all relevant available information. Recent
work has shown there is much variation in the expected returns on common stocks,
Government bonds, and corporate bonds. Some scholars claim that "excessive"
variation in the capital markets is evidence of irrational fads. This project
demonstrates that there are stable empirical relationships between the variation
and dividend yields and term-structure variables that are common to a wide range
of securities and related to business conditions.
