INT 9602022 Langdon This U.S.-Czech materials research project between Dr.
Terence Langdon of the University of Southern California (USC) and Dr. Vaclav
Sklenicka of the Czech Institute of Physics and Materials, Brno, will focus on
magnesium metal matrix composites. Drs. Langdon and Sklenicka, together with
another Czech colleague, Dr. Pavel Lukac of Charles University, Prague, will
examine mechanical properties, specifically the creep behavior, of these
composites. The creep experiments will be conducted at USC using two advanced
magnesium composites produced in Germany by squeeze casting. Subsequently, these
creep test results will be integrated with data obtained from tensile testing in
Prague and damage assessment experiments in Brno using quantitative
metallography. Overall, the researchers expect to broaden fundamental
understanding of the deformation of magnesium-based composites. Their results
may have implications for new processing techniques used in metal forming
industries. This project in advanced materials and processing fulfills the
program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts
in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and
pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. ??
