9361263 Bowen Several methods are currently being developed for the production
of surface-relief diffractive optics including photolithography, single-point
diamond turning, and single-point laserwriting. All of these methods are limited
in either the achievable geometries or minimum feature size. In order to realize
the full commercial potential of diffractive optics and subwavelength structured
surfaces, it is necessary to create structures that consist of smaller features.
We propose to investigate the use of near-field scanning optical lithography
(NSOL) for the fabrication of diffractive structures that can be used at high
numerical aperture and short wavelengths. Near-field scanning can create
structures well below that produced by conventional projection lithography. In
order to fabricate useful macroscopic optical devices, it is necessary to
increase throughput and extend the manufacturable dimensions of NSOL. This
capability will serve to advance optical technology in the areas of UV optical
systems, optical data storage and subwavelength structured optics. The ability
to fabricate nanometer-sized structures will also be useful for applications in
X-ray instruments and micromachining. We have identified commercial applications
in document security and polarization components. ***
