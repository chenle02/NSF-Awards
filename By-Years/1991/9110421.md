ABSTRACT This project seeks to gain access to the cognitive structure
underlying linguistic expression. New technology in the domain of multi-media
presentation may allow contemporary theories in semantics and discourse analysis
to be tested empirically. The hypothesis to be investigated is that a subject
employs a process of reduction in perceiving and interpreting a complex
narrative event, organizing the event into a hierarchy of more and less
important subevents. The investigator will develop and employ a novel
methodology based on recording a complex stimulus event on a video laser disc,
and then manipulating the presentation of the event to subjects in a variety of
ways which will permit analysis of the subjects' responses. If the investigation
is successful, it will become possible to analyze nonlinguistic narrative event
structure with a new degree of precision and insight, and to arrive at a more
detailed and comprehensive understanding of the relationship between a perceived
nonlinguistic event and the linguistic expression of that event.
