0327363 Diebold This 3-year award to Columbia University in the City of New
York's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) provides support for technical
services during NSF-funded programs on research vessel Maurice Ewing, which is
operated by LDEO as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory
System (UNOLS) research fleet. LDEO will provide shipboard technicians on each
cruise of R/V Ewing to support seagoing research projects and to maintain,
calibrate and provide for qualified users items from their pool of shared-use
research instrumentation. In addition, the award supports some specialized
services on both the Ewing and other UNOLS vessels on which LDEO technical staff
will provide support. Such services include multibeam sonar operations,
multichannel seismic reflection profiling, seismic source support for refraction
and calibration operations, and mitigation of acoustic impacts on marine mammals
by seismic sources. The services supported here are expected to significantly
enhance the operation of the research vessel via cost-effective and expert
support of shared-use oceanographic instrumentation. ***
