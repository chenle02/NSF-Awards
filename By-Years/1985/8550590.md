Minnesota Mathematics Mobilization is a statewide effort to broaden
communication among mathematics teachers, leaders in research and industry, and
governmental officials about issues concerning precollege mathematics education.
It is intended to increase support for mathematics education in the state, to
provide a statewide forum for discussion of mathematics education, and to
provide a link between Minnesota mathematics education efforts and related
national projects. The Mobilization will integrate resources into an effective
human system of experts, making existing knowledge available to anyone who has
need of it. Specifically, the Mobilization will undertake the following
activities: 1.Establish a statewide newsletter containing information on math
education in Minnesota. 2.Hold several statewide meetings each year. 3.Establish
a centralized statewide information resource (e.g., an "800" telephone number)
to put teachers in touch with persons who could help with mathematical concerns.
4.Identify and support resource individuals in mathematics and mathematics
education who are willing to provide help to others. 5.Provide public
information, position papers, and expert testimony to inform diverse audiences
about mathematics education. 6.Promote the growth of speaker bureaus, monitored
by regional contact persons in various sectors of the state.
