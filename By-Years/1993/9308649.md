Visual programming languages (VPLs) offer the hope of higher reliability at
lower labor costs, but only if they can be scaled up for realistically-sized
programming projects. This research addresses a critical factor in scaling up
declarative VPLs, by developing an interactive and visual yet powerful approach
to data abstraction. The visual approach adds expressive power to VPLs through
simplicity, rather than the traditional approach of providing them at the
expense of simplicity. The concepts developed are being implemented in a
research declarative VPL and made available to interested researchers. This work
builds upon recent work in data abstraction, event- handling, and the scaling-up
problem. Visual design issues are addressed, and the current implementation is
being prepared to serve as a base research system. The research seeks the
incorporation of a visual and flexible approach to code reuse. At the same time,
a simple approach to exception handling based on the earlier work on events is
being developed. Additional work regarding visual impact and visual support for
the approach to data abstraction is expected to enhance the simplicity and
effectiveness of the results.
