*** 9505494 Pilkey This award supports a two year cooperative research project
on optimum dynamic studies for rotors and mechanisms between Walter Pilkey,
University of Virginia, and Jin Dewen, Department of Precision Instruments,
Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. The project combines analytical and
computational expertise from the US and state-of-the-art experimental facilities
from China. It applies optimum system design techniques to a variety of
mechanical engineering mechanisms. This project continues work initiated under
an earlier two year award, through which methodology of limiting performance
analysis for rotors and mechanisms was developed. Limiting performance
technology has had extensive development in the US, but is in need of
verification of the theories with practical applications. During this study, the
University of Virginia will provide the design process and analysis, Tsinghua
University will design and manufacture the test protocol, and carry out the
tests. Research results will be used eventually in improved design of mechanical
systems involving the protection of the human body in impact situations (helmet
design, for example). ***
