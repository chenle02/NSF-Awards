Assumption College and the College of the Holy Cross propose to establish a
Research and Education network in conjunction with the Goddard Gigapop at
Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Currently, collaborative projects with other
institutions require travel and thus limit researcher communications and access
to information. Both schools would use this connection to increase the research,
educational and collaborative opportunities that are currently available to
their faculty and students. Research programs to be aided by the connection
include animal observation, data mining and visualization. Current
collaborations with MERCURY, GCAT, Wood Hole Oceanographic Institute, Biosphere
II and FIRST will all be increased and improved due to the high performance
networking connection.
