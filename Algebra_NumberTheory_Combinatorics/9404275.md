The investigator develops generalized fast Fourier transforms (FFT's). Of
principal importance is the further development of techniques for constructing
FFT's for finite groups, as well as the extension of algorithmic tools for the
efficient and numerically stable computation of Fourier transforms for band-
limited functions on nonabelian compact groups and their quotients. This
interdisciplinary research draws from the areas of computational group theory,
representation theory, and complexity theory, as well as those areas of science
in which applications are explored. Historically, by speeding certain
fundamental scientific computations, the ``classical'' FFT has had a tremendous
impact on society. It is one of the most important algorithmic tools in digital
signal processing and as such plays a key role in such areas as medical imaging,
defense, telecommunications, and high performance computing. The utility of the
classical FFT is an indicator that perhaps similar success may be obtained from
applying these newly developed generalized FFT's. Applications towards more
efficient use of high performance computing networks (the information
superhighway) are under investigation. The investigator and his colleagues
continue to apply generalized FFT's in statistics and data analysis. Specific
applications in climate modelling and structural chemistry have also been
identified and are being pursued.
