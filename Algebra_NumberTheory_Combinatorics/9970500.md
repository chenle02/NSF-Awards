This research project focuses on algebraic varieties, the geometric objects
defined by the solution sets of systems of polynomial equations. Varieties will
be studied through their Chow groups. The Chow group of a variety is the free
abelian group on subvarieties modulo the subgroup of elements which are
rationally equivalent to zero. Although the Chow group is known to have good
abstract, functorial properties little is known about its structure for most
varieties. The goal of the project is to make progress towards a better
understanding of various aspects of this structure. The torsion in the Chow
group will be studied as will the relationship between the Chow group and
various cohomology groups. Furthermore, the quotient of the Chow group by the
relation of algebraic equivalence will be investigated. Special properties which
occur when the variety is defined over a finite field will also be studied.

The line of investigation pursued in this project continues historical
investigations with roots in the 19-th century. The research should contribute
to a better understanding of the geometric figures defined by the solution sets
to systems of polynomial equations. It is also motivated by a large body of
conjectures, some recent and some quite old, which predict a beautiful and
subtle relationship between geometry and the theory of numbers.
