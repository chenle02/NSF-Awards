This grant supports the development and use of new balloon-borne instruments to
determine the electrical forces from charge carried by lightning channels inside
thunderclouds. One of the instruments, an electric-field-change meter, detects
the presence of ionizing waves that are not otherwise observable. Another, an
electric field meter, measures the vertical profile of the electric field, which
provides the energy to support the propagation of lightning. The measurements
are analyzed in relation to high-resolution maps of lightning flashes obtained
from a ground-based network of VHF receivers linked together by Global
Positioning System (GPS) timing, called a lightning mapping array. Using the
combination of balloon-borne observations, maps from the lightning array, and
radar observations of storm structure, the immediate goals are to learn how
lightning is initiated, how much electrical charge is required for the
propagation of lightning channels inside clouds, and how lightning is related to
the air motions and precipitation of thunderclouds. The long-term goal is to be
able to deduce some of the properties of thunderstorms, including beneficial and
damaging effects, from the characteristics of the lightning they produce.
