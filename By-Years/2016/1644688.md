This project establishes an I-Corps Site at Cornell University. NSF Innovation
Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose
purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their
technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice,
resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable
groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps
Team applicants. The Cornell I-Corps Site represents a signature project of the
institution's new Center for Technology Translation (CTT). The CTT serves as a
central hub for entrepreneurship, innovation, product design, and prototyping
education, all based on the Lean Launch Pad method. The Cornell Site integrates
activities from the College of Business, College of Engineering, and Center for
Technology Licensing, ultimately leading to synergistic benefits to an already
thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several
strengths that characterize Cornell's I-Corps Site: it connects to the upper New
York state business incubator ecosystem, and adds new components; they seek to
include women, the disabled and under-represented groups in their teams and have
a solid plan to do so; existing connections to regional businesses are strong;
Cornell's Site has substantial campus financial support and experienced
leadership; innovation and entrepreneurship programs are well organized and
integrated with each other; and, the existence of an I-Corps Site at Cornell is
likely to impact the regional commercialization ecosystem.
