Investigators will continue a project of extracting dust samples from the
Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 ice core. The origin of the dust will be
determined by comparing the geochemistry of the dust from the ice core to that
of samples taken from potential continental sources worldwide. Changes in the
source area for the dust in the ice cores will reveal how continental weathering
and atmospheric transport have changed in response to changing climate during
the past 100,000 years. Changes in atmospheric transport patterns will provide
data for testing climate models that predict changes in atmospheric conditions
during climate events during both glacial and interglacial climate extremes. .
