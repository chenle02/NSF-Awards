Theoretical research at the interface of elementary particle and nuclear physics
will investigate a new set of calculational techniques, called charge overlap,
on computers at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA).
Charge overlap techniques have the potential to allow us to do precise,
controlled and complete calculations of the internal structure of particles
composed of quarks and antiquarks. Using these methods, the internal structure
of pions and other mesons will be investigated from first principles. In
addition, using more traditional computer simulation techniques, an improved
calculation of the neutron's electric charge distribution will be made. This
calculation is particularly significant because of it's relevance to the
experimental program at the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility
(CEBAF). CEBAF will eventually make the world's most precise measurements of
this distribution; theory and experiment can then be compared in a meaningful,
fundamental way.
