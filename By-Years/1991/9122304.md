Incorporation of fluorine in organic molecules modifies their chemical and
biological properties. Many of the available fluorinating agents are non-
specific and/or too difficult to handle. One solution to this problem is the use
of fluorine-containing smaller molecules that can act as building blocks in the
synthesis of more complex organic molecules. Specifically new syntheses of vinyl
fluorides from a common precursor, alpha-fluoro-gamma-substituted
allylphosphonate, will be developed. This precursor will permit the introduction
of fluorine on the olefinic carbon in alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl
compounds, and in conjugated dienals. The initial introduction of fluorine on
the allylphosphonate will be done using a well-known reagent, diethylaminosulfur
trifluoride (DAST). The methodology employed will utilize an electrophilic
phosphorus reagent as a way to incorporate the phosphonate moiety in the vinyl
fluoride precursor. This will result in different substituents around the
phosphorus, which in turn will make it possible to obtain greater stereochemical
control on the fluoroolefin formed by the Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons (HWE)
condensation. %%% With this award, the Organic Synthesis Program will support
the research of Dr. Gerald B. Hammond at the University of Massachusetts,
Dartmouth. The research will explore the development of new ways to introduce a
fluorine into complex molecules under non-corrosive conditions. This should
benefit research in biochemistry and medicine as well as in the chemical
industry.
