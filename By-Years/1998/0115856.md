Rogers&lt;br/&gt;AST-0115856&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digital receiver technology to
design, build, test and apply a 327 MHz array radio receiver optimized for the
detection and characterization of hyperfine deuterium line in the spectra of
radio sources across the sky will be completed. Measurement of the Deuterium
line feature may enable the determination of the D/H ratio at different parts of
the sky. The D/H ratio and its distribution probe fundamental physical
parameters that reveal important factors in our understanding of the evolution
of the Universe. The instrument development, in particular the digital
receivers, RFI mitigation, beam forming, beam steering will serve as a
pathfinder for the next generation ground-based radio telescopes. There is
significant student participation. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
