This research, funded under NSF's Urban Systemic Infrastructure solicitation,
evaluates the influence of urban-infrastructure management structures on
infrastructure quality and performance. Management structure serves as a
description of the overall decision-making framework for infrastructure
investment and maintenance. The research design consists of 10-12 case studies
in transportation and water-resources infrastructure, complemented by
statistical analyses of the key quantifiable relationships identified. The major
products of the research are: (1) a framework for decision-making to improve
infrastructure performance; (2) an empirically based understanding of decision-
making and management attributes that tend to enhance infrastructure
performance; and (3) a design for training and technology-transfer programs for
infrastructure management. In addition, the project outputs include the design
of curriculum materials and the design of a workshop and training session for
infrastructure managers. The work will be performed by an multi-disciplinary
team of engineers, social scientists, management scientists, and urban and
environmental planners from (a) New York University's Robert F. Wagner Graduate
School of Public Service and (b) Polytechnic University's Civil and
Environmental Engineering Department, in conjunction with a number of
participating infrastructure organizations.
