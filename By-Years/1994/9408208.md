9408208 Jones Within the last few years, development has emerged as a major
theme in evolutionary biology. Recent insights gainsed from interdisciplinary
studies of development in animals are laying the foundation for a new synthesis
in comparative biology. There have been very few comparable studies in plants,
however. The PI will initiate a study of the developmental basis of
differentiation in whole plant growth form in the genus Pelargonium. This is an
ideal group for this study because 1) species exhibit a tremendous range of
whole plant morphology; 2) preliminary analyses of gene sequences suggest that
historical relationships can be resolved in this group; and 3) the group is well
studied in other respects but basic studies of developmental morphology are
lacking. the PI will compare morphological and histological development of
seedlings in three species from each major lineage in the subgenus Pelargonium.
The proposed investigation focusses on seedlings because this stage of the life
cycle represents the earliest expression of the body plan. Structural
comparisons of ecologically important structures of seedlings, together with
deduction of rules of construction expressed at later stages, will provide the
framework for deduction of the whole plant body plan as well as assessment of
the importance of the onset and timing of formation of water-storing and
carbohydrate-storing tissues.
