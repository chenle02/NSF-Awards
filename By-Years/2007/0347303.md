Today it is feasible to attempt very realistic rendering of complex natural
scenes: for example, in the film effects industry a particular focus is
rendering realistic humans. The difficulty of doing this illuminates the
shortcomings in current knowledge about skin, hair, and cloth and how their
physical properties produce the distinctive visual appearance of these
materials. Across the board, the increasing quality of computer-generated images
is limited by a fundamental unsolved problem: the efficient and accurate
modeling of the properties of materials. This research addresses this problem by
looking at materials in several ways: how they interact with light, how they
change their shape and appearance as they move, and how human observers perceive
them.

In a departure from much previous work on materials in graphics, this research
program expands the definition of material properties from optical properties
alone to include mechanical properties and their effects. Additionally, material
appearance is considered in the context of human visual perception. These goals
lead to three related paths of research:

1. Optics of materials. Light reflection is central to rendering materials and
forms the core of this research: developing the fundamentals using a scientific
approach progressing from measurements of real materials through analysis to
models that are practical for rendering.

2. Mechanics of materials. Recognizing that optics and static geometry alone
suffice only to represent rigid materials, this project broadens the definition
of material properties to include the mechanical properties that create the
distinctive shape and motion that are so important to the appearance of
deformable materials.

3. Perception of materials. Rendering is about making images that will be viewed
by human observers, and to achieve efficiency and quality it is critical to have
a better understanding of how the human visual system interprets, classifies,
and infers properties of materials
