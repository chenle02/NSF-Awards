The University of Puerto Rico will establish a Research Careers Program for
Minority Scholars to provide opportunities for undergraduate research training
in the fields of physical science, mathematics, and engineering in which
Hispanics are notably underrepresented. The program will have a significant
impact in increasing the number of minority students who choose to pursue
graduate studies and careers in these fields. The UPR-RCMS Program will create
an academically enriched environment by providing: intensive research
experiences for students with researchers from EPSCoR and MRCE Programs, who
will work closely with them as mentors and role models; special seminars and
colloquia to expose trainees to invited minority minority scientists with whom
they will discuss their research projects; participation in local and national
scientific research meetings in which they will be encouraged to make
presentations; a language skills tutorial for improving the oral and written
presentation of their research; and an orientation program to assist them in
identifying and entering graduate programs, obtaining financial support for
graduate studies, and selecting careers in science, mathematics, and
engineering. Twenty-four talented students will participate each year during a
five-year period. As part of their research training, the eight most outstanding
students will travel to national research laboratories for further training each
year. Students will be required, as a result of their participation in the RCMS
Program, to prepare a thesis or co-author a publication in a scientific journal.
Participants will be tracked through graduate studies to determine the success
of the program in preparing competent minority scientists.
