This Presidential Young Investigator Award will support Dr. Kreutz-Delgado's
development of a real-time testbed for sensor- based control of a dual-arm
robotic manipulation system. His goal is exploration of robotic assembly and
servicing principles for flexible manufacturing and for autonomous robotic
systems. His current research, begun at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, involves
application of a spatial operator algebra to real-time task-level planning and
use of neural-network approaches for manipulator and camera coordination.
