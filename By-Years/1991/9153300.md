The materials developed at the University of Illinois by Davis, Porta, and Uhl
are being adapted and some new materials are being developed to implement a
laboratory calculus course. The materials emphasize extensive use of Mathematica
programming, especially graphics routines, and conceptual questions that require
written responses in paragraph form. The curricular changes emphasize a
systematic treatment of the approximation of functions throughout the calculus
sequence.
