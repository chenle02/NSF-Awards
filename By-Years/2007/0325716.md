Today's embedded computers are increasingly mobile and ubiquitous, are capable
of interacting with the environment, and can communicate with one another over
possibly vast and pervasive networks. While most of the wireless networks are
not expected to be capable of controlling their own motion, new technological
possibilities are emerging to provide small embedded devices with the means to
propel themselves, with an energy expenditure that is comparable to the energy
budget of communication and computation.

A Controlled-Mobility Wireless Network (CMWN) is defined as a network of
embedded devices endowed with computation, communication and motion
capabilities. The purpose of this project is the development of a new conceptual
framework for the design, development and operation of efficient and reliable
networks with such characteristics.

The overall objectives of the basic research proposed in this project are:

1. The development of a conceptually sound, consistent and complete framework
for the analysis of the interactions between competing computation,
communication, and motion control requirements, arising in the design of CMWNs.

2. The design, analysis, and performance characterization of distributed
algorithms and communication protocols for provably efficient and adaptive
CMWNs.

3. The specification, implementation and verification of software, middleware
and networking services for the deployment of representative CMWNs.
