9352889 Moore The authors are developing interactive laboratory and classroom
materials to support follow-on courses for students completing reformed calculus
course: linear algebra, differential equations, and applied mathematical
analysis. A seven-member development team, working at five different
institutions over a two-year period, will develop approximately 70 interactive
text modules. Each module will be developed in one of the systems Mathcad 3.1,
Maple V, or Mathematica, and translated by student assistants to each of the
other two system. This project will build on and reinforce the acquired concepts
and shared experiences of students moving on from reformed calculus courses.
These students know how to work in a lab, how to work with partners, and how to
work on their own. Moreover, they have had introductions to many of the
important ideas that will be developed further in the follow-on courses. Such
students will find conventional courses less than satisfactory as preparation
for their scientific or engineering careers in the 21st century. The modules to
be developed by this project will enable students to work with significant and
realistic problems in a modern computer environment that allows the to
experiment to vary examples endlessly, and to control the order and pace of
their learning.
