9730433 Moum This oceanographic instrumentation development project is to build
and test a low-cost and low power sensor for in situ ocean measurements of
velocity on small space scales that are critical in microstructure and
turbulence studies. The proposed approach is to adapt a three-component pitot
tube probe, presently used for atmospheric measurements on aircraft, for use on
different oceanographic instrumentation packages. The recent commercial
availability of low-cost and low-power differential pressure strain gauges
suggests that newly designed velocity sensors can replace certain existing
oceanographic sensors that are relatively expensive and that have high power
requirements. The new sensor should be capable of resolving velocities with
mms-1 resolution on scales of a few centimeters. The sensors will be adapted for
dropped, towed, and moored instrument packages and will be useful for planned
and envisioned long-term deployments of observational platforms for physical
oceanographic investigations.
