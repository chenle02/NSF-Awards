It has become increasingly obvious that bacteria play a major role in the
microbial food loop of the world's oceans. Considerable confusion has existed in
the past as to whether microbes or protozoa play the major role in regenerating
nitrogenous nutrients to fuel phytoplankton growth. This confusion stems from
the lack of basic information on the nitrogen uptake characteristics of bacteria
and the relationship between the supply and physiological requirements of
organic and inorganic sources of nitrogen. Dr. Goldman will continue his work
towards addressing these fundamental questions. He will complete studies on
nitrogen dynamics at very low growth rates: complete studies at very low
substrate concentrations under carbon and nitrogen limiting conditions: examine
the kinetics and energetics of multiple carbon and nitrogen substrate
utilization: and determine the conditions under which nitrogen limitation and
growth rate influence the formation of cell attachment by bacteria.
