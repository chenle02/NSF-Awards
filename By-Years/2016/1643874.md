The "Emerging STEM Scholars" program at Temple University will address STEM
retention and success by providing direct academic support for four years to 48
- 60 academically talented and economically disadvantaged students majoring in
biology, biochemistry, or chemistry. Students will be enrolled in the program
during their freshman year, when they are most likely to encounter academic
difficulties and change majors. The program will utilize existing academic
support structures and will connect students with specific program content in
Temple's first science learning community. A three tiered mentoring program
(undergraduate peers, graduate students, and faculty) will provide support to
scholars over their academic career from entry into the institution to
graduation. Scholars will be given access to industry scientists and science
career information that will complement academic support and research
opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will be based on Tinto's theory
of student retention emphasizing both structural supports and content-based and
pedagogical supports. Data will be collected to determine what "works" the best,
with what type of student, and when. Research conducted by this project will be
both cross-sectional and longitudinal, and will be designed to test the
individual and cumulative contributions of the program elements. The study will
also analyze any effect size decay that occurs over time. Four data sources will
provide an academic "map" that will be used to identify patterns that are needed
to maintain successful progress to an on-time four-year degree. The resulting
knowledge will be used as the basis for institutional transformation at Temple
and other universities.
