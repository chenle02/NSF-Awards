This grant proposes to use E-infinity differential graded algebras to study the
homotopy theory of spaces and proposes to study the homotopy theory of
E-infinity differential graded algebras and E-infinity ring spectra. The concept
of E-infinity differential graded algebra is a generalization of the concept of
commutative differential graded algebra; commutativity holds only up to
homotopy, and E-infinity differential graded algebras admit Steenrod operations
on their cohomology, which measure to some extent the deviation from actual
commutativity. E-infinity ring spectra are a stable homotopy theory
generalization of E-infinity differential graded algebras. Most commonly studied
generalized cohomology theories that have commutative ring structures are
represented by E-infinity ring spectra. This extra structure yields important
calculational information about the theory and is useful for various
constructions of related theories.

Algebraic topology tries to reduce topological or geometric classification
problems into algebra. Because the algebra is usually discrete, it is typically
invariant under changes by continuous deformations, or ``homotopies.'' Because
of this, fundamental problems in algebraic topology are often phrased in terms
of understanding the homotopy equivalence classes of spaces or in terms of
computing the number (or more often the ``group'' or ``module'') of homotopy
classes of maps between spaces. Quite generally this kind of question can be
reformulated as an equivalent question in algebra. The purpose of this proposal
is to develop tools to study the sort of algebra that arises in this context.
