This is an award to support research on identification and quantification of
chemical reaction products when chlorine is used to disinfect wastewater
treatment plant effluents. This project is a renewal of research conducted under
NSF Grant No. 90- 02442. Special emphasis in this research is on reactions
between nitrogenous organic compounds such as the amino acids and peptides that
are found in treatment plant effluents. The investigator plans on using
radiotracer techniques to determine the stability and breakdown products of the
chlorinated organic compounds. Chlorination of wastewater treatment plant
effluents is a process relied on for disinfection of the effluents prior to
their placement into environmental waters despite the known formation of
chlorinated organic compounds that subject the environment and subsequent users
of those waters to potential health risk. Results of this project are expected
to provide the basis for any changes that may be necessary in use of and in the
engineering design of chlorination processes to avoid or eliminate negative
effects associated with this practice.
