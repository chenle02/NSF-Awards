This electron microscope will support microscopic studies of inorganic
materials--metal, ceramics, semiconductors and minerals. A number of projects on
industrial materials such as high temperature ceramics (zirconium oxide),
ceramic microelectronic packages and pyrolytic coatings will be supported by
this project. In the high resolution mode the machine will provide 1.8A
resolutions and a reduction of radiation damage.
