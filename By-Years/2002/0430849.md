Binary search trees are arguably the most fundamental nontrivial class of data
structures in computer science. Despite their origins at the dawn of computing,
a complete understanding has remained elusive to this day. A surprising aspect
of binary search trees is that their online and offline amortized performance
are conjectured to be identical. This project seeks to completely characterize
the binary search tree model of computation. This work will allow future
researchers in data structures either to use a binary search tree that has been
shown to be dynamically optimal or to know that their problem requires stepping
outside the realm of binary search trees.
