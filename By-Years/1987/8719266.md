This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of separation science. The thrust of this experimental program is
to measure the dynamics of sorption-desorption at liquid-solid interfaces in
order to assess the role of such dynamics in the behavior and performance of
liquid chromatographic separation media and related chemical systems.
Measurement of these dynamic processes by relaxation kinetic techniques will
provide information concerning the mechanisms of sorption and separation, the
viscosity of the interfacial domain, and a quantitative measure of the degree of
heterogeneity of surfaces with respect to the energetics of sorption. Chemically
modified silicas and related model systems will be synthesized for use in these
studies. These materials will be fully characterized by Fourier transform
infrared spectrometry, solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry, and
elemental analysis. The role of the solvent in determining the interfacial
polarity and viscosity will be determined using fluorescence probe techniques.
Results of these studies will be correlated with the performance of these
chemically modified silicas as liquid chromatographic stationary phases. This
research is expected to yield an improved understanding of the chemistry of
separation processes and the general nature of solid-liquid interfacial sorptive
systems. This work should lead to the development of improved chromatographic
systems for both analytical and preparative scale applications that have broad
impact in science and technology.
