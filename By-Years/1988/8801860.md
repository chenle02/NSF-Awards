It is proposed that calcium acts as a messenger in the response of plant tissues
to signals such as hormones (auxin and cytokinin) and light. The overall
objective of Dr. Poovaiah's research is to understand this role of calcium ions
in plants. Recent studies have demonstrated the presence of calcium- dependent
and calmodulin-dependent protein phosphorylation in a number of plant systems.
The focus of the next experiments in this study will be calcium- and calmodulin-
promoted protein kinases and their substrates, with a view toward understanding
their physiological roles. Two goals will be pursued: 1. Calcium-regulated
protein kinases and their substrates will be isolated, characterized, and
localized by immunocytochemistry. 2. The substrates for calcium- and calmodulin-
dependent protein kinases will be identified and characterized in order to
obtain more insight into the physiological significance of calcium and
calmodulin-dependent protein phosphorylation. Hormones, light, and gravity
control diverse physiological processes throughout the life cycle of plants. How
the cell senses these signals and converts them into a response is poorly
understood and is a subject of great interest. Recent investigations support the
concept that some hormone and light dependent changes in plants involve calcium
as a messenger. The proposed research is directed toward understanding this
function of calcium. The results of these studies will advance our knowledge of
both the cellular functions of calcium and the molecular mechanisms involved in
the transduction of hormone and light signals in plants.
