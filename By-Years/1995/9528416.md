John Z. H. Zhang at the Department of Chemistry, New York University, is
supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to
obtain a high performance workstation. This workstation will be used to perform
numerically intensive computations related to Prof. Zhang's research program on
the study of the dynamic properties of molecular processes. Time dependent
quantum dynamics calculations will be performed to study the reaction of small
molecules on metal surfaces. The workstation will also be used to perform high-
dimensional calculations of the vibrational spectrum and the dissociation
dynamics of hydrogen bonded clusters like the HF and HCl dimers.
