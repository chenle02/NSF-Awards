This research deals with the application of electrochemistry to purification
processes. The specific purification to be studied is the removal of low
concentrations of hetercyclic pollutants from hydrocarbon fuels. A fundamental
study will be performed on the reversible complexation reactions between
organosulfur and organonitrogen compounds with Fe(II) complex ions. These
complexation reactions will be reversed via electrochemical oxidation to
Fe(III). The purification processes will be investigated by attempting to remove
representative compounds from iso-octane solutions. Iron (bivalent) porphyrins
will be used as the complexing agents in the electrolytic processes. The
research will advance knowledge on porphyrin chemistry and electrochemistry, and
would also result in applications of electrochemistry to purification processes.
