In understanding both the physical world and the mathematics that lies beyond
its boundaries, geometry and symmetry are everywhere. This project seeks to
advance our knowledge of abstract shapes that share two properties: positive
curvature and global symmetry. The first of these is a requirement that the
shape is curved in a manner similar to how the surface of a ball curves, the
same way in all directions. The second means that the object looks the same when
spinning, similar to how a football appears when thrown in a perfect spiral. The
principal investigator studies shapes likes these through collaborations with
other researchers, working with PhD students, and the organization of seminars
and conferences.  In addition, through his outreach to high schools in Oklahoma
and his involvement with undergraduates, the PI is committed to growing and
diversifying the body of students and researchers in STEM fields.

The first aspect of this project is a continuation of the PI's work on the Grove
symmetry program, which, in recent years, has exposed numerous instances of how
positive curvature and symmetry can come together to force periodicity in the
cohomology of the underlying manifold. The second aspect is a systematic study
of topological realization problems involving the condition of periodic
cohomology, especially in the presence of symmetry. There are already instances
of results along these lines, and the proposal seeks to formalize this research
program and find new paths toward advancing understanding in this area.
