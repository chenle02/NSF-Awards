This project will attempt to measure the isotropy of the cosmic microwave
background radiation (CMBR) from South Pole Station. The telescope will measure
the isotropy at an angular scale of between 15 minutes and one degree at a
wavelength of three millimeters using a state of the art bolometer for
detection. The instrument has the sensitivity to set new upper limits on the
anisotropy of the CMBR, and if it does so it will be necessary to reformulate
the current cosmological theories. A detection of anisotropy would be an
important confirmation of the current theories. This is probably the most
important cosmological measurement that can be made, and the South Pole is the
best place on earth to make it. The institution and the proposer are
outstandingly qualified to perform the experiment. The experiment has been
developed at the expense of Bell Laboratories and the cost of the research will
be borne by Bell Labs. This grant is for expendable and logistical support only.
