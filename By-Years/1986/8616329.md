Ultrasonic devices designed to perform high-resolution imaging and determination
of material characteristics in inhomogeneous materials are severely limited due
to wavefront phase distortion and coherent scattering. This work will
demonstrate techniques for significantly improving the sensitivity
characteristics of ultrasonic transducers and thereby impacting on their
performance in such media.
