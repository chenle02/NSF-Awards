Most research addressing the role of soils in the global carbon (C) cycle has
focused on organic C. In arid ecosystems, however, soil C is predominantly
present as inorganic carbonate minerals. The two main factors driving
transformation of carbonates are moisture and carbon dioxide (CO2)
concentrations, both of which depend on plant activity. This study addresses
linkages between belowground plant activity and carbonate transformations using
field studies, greenhouse experiments, and computer modeling. The field study
will be conducted in the Mojave Desert where natural ecosystems will be exposed
to increased nitrogen deposition, precipitation, and atmospheric CO2
concentrations. The greenhouse studies will allow for experimentation under more
controlled conditions while the modeling will integrate knowledge obtained from
the field and greenhouse to predict long-term changes in carbonate pools under
future climate change. Results of this study will allow for better assessment of
the role of arid ecosystems in the global C cycle.
