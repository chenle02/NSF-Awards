This award support one element of the second Greenland Ice Sheet Project
(GISP2). The objective of GISP2 is the retrieval and analysis of a deep ice core
from central Greenland. Insoluble particulates in selected samples will be
analyzed for mass concentration, size distribution, chemical composition and
morphology. Sampling will be coordinated with investigators working on other
analytical techniques (specifically ECM/Laser Particles and Ice Chemistry) in
order to identify the most important sections of the core for detailed study.
The insoluble particulate concentration of ice samples from the GISP2 core will
provide important information about not only the particulate loading of the
atmosphere in the past but also temperature, radiation balance, global aridity,
wind strength and circulation patterns. Superimposed upon the "background"
concentrations of continental dust associated with changes in climate will be
elevated particle concentrations from sporadic events such as volcanic
eruptions. In addition to providing information about the temporal variations in
the concentration and type of particulates deposited on the Greenland ice sheet,
in conjunction with others, should also provide insight to the relationship
between volcanism and climate.
