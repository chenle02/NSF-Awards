The project will demonstrate molecular scale computation, initially with a
molecular switch and then via the construction and operation of molecular scale
logic gates. In accord with the high risk nature of the NER program the approach
is based on an entirely new concept -reduction/ oxidation switchable magnetic
ordering. The idea is to use an electroactive bridge between metal ions to gate
magnetic communication between two or more metal ions ON or
OFF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key challenges and (proposed solutions)
are:&lt;br/&gt;(i) Measuring the strength of metal-radical-metal magnetic
communication in switch ON and OFF states. (ii) Maximizing the strength of
magnetic coupling and ease of switching through metal ion and ligand
modification. (iii) Utilizing molecular magnetic switches to construct molecular
scale logic gates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Single electron and
single molecule processes play a fundamental role in all branches of chemistry.
Therefore, the creation, study and dissemination of results in this area has a
strong educational component for students directly or indirectly involved in the
research, for other researchers in the field, and for anyone whose imagination
is captured by the possibility of performing computation at the single molecule
level. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research and Education Themes: The project is
focused at the intersection of (a) Nanoscale Structures, Novel Phenomena, and
Quantum Control (b) Nanoscale Devices and System Architecture (c) Manufacturing
Processes at the Nanoscal&lt;br/&gt;
