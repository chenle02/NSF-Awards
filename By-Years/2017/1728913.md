Placing relevant information about the ocean in the hands of those that require
it, when they require it, involves active dialogue and collaboration between
communities that traditionally work within more limited bounds. A concerted and
continuing effort is needed to evaluate whether the right data is being
collected or not to ensure that observing systems are effective for science and
for decision-making. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's request funding to continue
the Research Coordination Networks (RCN):Sustained Multidisciplinary Ocean
Observations with the goal of addressing these issues by fostering a broad,
multi-disciplinary dialogue spanning the natural and social sciences, and
including end users of observations. These may be policy and decision makers
without strong backgrounds in the ocean sciences. The RCN will also identify the
needs, opportunities and barriers to improved/expanded industry involvement in
ocean observations. This will enable wider and more effective long-term use of
ocean observatories and observing systems consistent with and supporting the
goals of the existing ocean observing frameworks developed by several high-
level, national and international groups.
