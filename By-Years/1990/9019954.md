The objective of the proposed research is to utilize expert systems technology
to interact between the last amount of data available from Geographic
Information Systems and hydrological and/or environmental watershed models.
Watershed programs such as HEC1 and HEC2 require a large number of variables
which are available or could be extracted from Geographic Information Systems.
Another objective of the proposal is to relate economics to land use and
development. This will result in an environmental accounting system which could
lead to a true value of proposed development of a given watershed. %%% It is the
goal of this project to develop the required methods, procedures, and software
under an expert system shell to establish the connection between the Geographic
Information System, HEC1 and HEC2.
