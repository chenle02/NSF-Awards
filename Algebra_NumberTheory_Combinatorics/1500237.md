This project involves research in the area of analytic number theory. An
important class of problems in this area concerns L-functions, which encode
arithmetic information. One example of an L-function is the Riemann zeta
function, which controls the distribution of prime numbers. One of the
investigator's main goals is to make progress on the value distribution and
zeros of L-functions. Concurrently, one hopes to use such information to extract
applications to problems in arithmetic. While these topics are of intrinsic
interest in mathematics, progress in number theory has had important
applications in cryptography and theoretical computer science.

More specifically, the investigator will continue his investigations on moments
and value distribution of L-functions, extending in particular his recent work
with Radziwill. The investigator will also continue work on multiplicative
functions, in collaboration with Granville, Harper, and Koukoulopoulos. Besides
these two main projects, the investigator will work with coauthors on various
problems at the interface of analysis, number theory, and combinatorics, and
continue his work in training graduate students in this area.
