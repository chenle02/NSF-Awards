The objective of this project is the development of a student-accessible
sounding rocket program for the study of the Earth's ionosphere. The goal of
ADVANCE is to increase representation of women in science and engineering, and
this award would greatly advance such efforts to develop an externally-funded
independent research program. The goal of this project is development of
sounding rocket projects to explore various ionospheric phenomena, including
plasma-neutral coupling, dusty plasmas, chemical-induced artificial aurora and
ionospheric heating experiments.
