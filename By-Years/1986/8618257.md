A broad set of research projects concerning galaxies, quasars, gravitational
lenses, clusters of galaxies, and globular star clusters will be carried out.
Although substantial theoretical research will be done, the primary thrust is
observational. The theoretical programs are attempts to understand, model, or
predictbasic observational results. Some instrumental enhancements uniting all
of these programs have improved our understanding of the nature, origin, and
evolution of the fundamental classes of extragalactic objects above. It is hoped
and believed that such an improved understanding will provide critical insights
into the properties of the Universe as a whole, that is the cosmology of the
Universe. The specific projects are intended to provide 1) a detailed model for
infall dominated galaxy formation, 2) a direct determination of the nature of
galaxy evolution in faint clusters, 3) a statistically useful sample of
gravitational lenses, 4) detailed observational studies of known lens systems,
5) a detailed study of the properties of distant clusters of galaxies, 6) a
determination of the quasar luminosity-redshift distribution near the cutoff, 7)
a clear determination of the nature of the remarkable quasar pair 1146+111B, C
8) detailed dynamical and population models for several well studied globular
clusters, 9) a sample of faint variable objects located by an automated survey,
10) an elucidation of several detailed aspects of the internal dynamics and
interactions of galaxies, and 11) a model of the effects of Malmquist biases on
the extragalactic distance scale and determinations of peculiar velocity fields.
