9514926 Wilson This grant provides renewed funding for three years for the
travel expenses of participants in the annual Summer Workshops on Economic
Theory conducted by the Stanford Institute of Theoretical Economics (SITE). Each
summer, these six-week workshops bring prominent researchers and younger
scholars together for a series of seminar presentations and sustained
collaborative research. Now in its 26th year, this series of workshops is the
principal forum worldwide for innovative studies of important topics on the
forefront of economic analysis. The topics selected for each workshop depend on
the current research areas and the anticipated availability of outstanding
researchers with important papers to present. Each autumn, the SITE faculty
convene in open meetings to develop possible topics. The Director oversees
preparation of surveys of the possibilities, followed by a meeting of the SITE
Executive Committee to make selections. The topics selected for the 1996 Summer
Workshop are: (1) Effects of heterogeneity on aggregate economic fluctuations;
(2) Reconsideration of the Foundations of Uncertainty in Economic Equilibrium;
(3) Economics of Transition to Market Economies; (4) Financial Contracting and
Corporate Control; (5) Endogenous Credit Restrictions; (6) Market Design; (7)
Decision Theory for Non-Cooperative Games; and (8) Empirical Estimation and
Testing of Theoretical Models.
