Completion of GIS Analyses to Assess Biotic Effects of Environmental
Perturbations on Neogene Mammals (EAR-0310221)

Anthony Barnosky University of California, Berkeley

ABSTRACT

The Miocene Mammal Mapping Project (Miomap) began in 2000 with the goals of (a)
constructing a relational database of Miocene and late Oligocene mammal
occurrences and associated relevant information; (b) using the data to test
questions about the relationship between environmental change and faunal
response; (c) distributing the data through web interfaces; and (d) educating
students. The project is being continued in order to finish building and serving
the database, test ideas about how environmental change affects evolution and
geographic distribution of mammals, and continue training postdoctoral,
graduate, and undergraduate students. The research questions are relevant to
forecasting the effects of current human activities on ecological systems and
clarifying the scales at which environmental changes become important to
evolutionary and extinction patterns. New scientific infrastructure is provided
in the form of a web-accessible database.
