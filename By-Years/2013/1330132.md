The goal of this project is to develop new methods for unsupervised learning
from multivariate data based on counting and comparing frequencies of data
patterns. A recursive testing approach will be used to infer the multivariate
distribution. The investigator will use hardware-algorithm co-design to achieve
qualitative improvement over existing methods in computational time as well as
in the maximum data dimension and sample size that can be handled. The economic
feasibility of making this methodology widely available will also be
investigated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is motivated by the challenge
of "Big Data" analysis where the high dimensionality and extremely large sample
size had made it infeasible to apply traditional statistical methods. The new
methods developed in this project will be applied to several "big data"
applications such as the analysis of videos, next generation sequencing data and
microblogs. By developing the statistical methods for such analyses as well as
customized computing resources to make these methods scalable to extremely large
data sets, this research will enable more effective use of the rich information
embedded in these data. Finally, the multidisciplinary approach integrating
statistical, computational and hardware expertise is well suited for the
training of next generation data scientists.
