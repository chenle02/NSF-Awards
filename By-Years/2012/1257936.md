Insects employ an open circulatory system for the transport of nutrients,
wastes, and signaling molecules throughout the body. The insect circulatory
system also functions in thermoregulation, promoting respiration, and the
circulation of immune factors that survey tissues for foreign invaders. The
insect circulatory system consists of hemolymph (blood), an open body cavity
called the hemocoel, and a series of pumps, with the primary pump being a
muscular dorsal vessel that is divided into a thoracic aorta and an abdominal
heart. While some recent work has focused on the physiology of the insect heart,
little is known about hemolymph flow. Thus, the goal of this research is to
characterize the mechanics of hemolymph circulation throughout the mosquito
hemocoel. Objective 1 will employ novel fluorescence-based intravital imaging
methods to qualitatively and quantitatively map hemolymph circulation in all
regions of this insect. Objective 2 will assess the role accessory pulsatile
organs play in hemolymph propulsion. Objective 3 will determine how heart
rhythms and hemolymph currents change under various physiological conditions.
Finally, objective 4 will test how mosquito infection affects circulatory
physiology. The research will make critical contributions to the field of insect
circulatory physiology and will create the first quantitative map of hemolymph
circulation in any insect. Furthermore, this research will be carried out in
mosquitoes, a socially and ecologically important insect group because of their
role as pests and pathogen transmitters. Because hemolymph circulation affects
the dissemination of insecticides throughout the mosquito body, as well as the
obligate migration of pathogens prior to their transmission, a better
understanding of hemolymph circulation could contribute to the development of
novel pest and disease control strategies. In addition to its scientific merit,
this project will result in the training of graduate and undergraduate students
in biological research.
