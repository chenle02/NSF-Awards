9453745 Warlick The University of Texas at Austin intends to organize a national
workshop to bring together the representatives of all state departments of
education and their network stakeholders, representatives from pertinent Federal
Agencies concerned with K-12 educational network initiatives as well as
representives from various national professional education associations. These
representatives will meet to develop a means for collaboration and long-range
planning for the integration of an information infrastructure to support the
needs of the K-12 educational community. The state representatives and their
colleagues will articulate the issues and provide feedback to clarify the
current status of state educational networking. The workshop will provide a
forum to establish a clear understanding of needs and provide insight to explore
how federal and state regulations, policies, and private sector partnerships can
leverage current educational reform initiatives to support the development of a
National Information Infrastructure for Education. In addition, the electronic
forum will provide continual support for the cadre of individuals as they work
to develop and strengthen educational networking initiatives in their own
communities. ***
