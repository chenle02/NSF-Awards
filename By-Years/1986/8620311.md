The goal of this research is to determine the mechanisms of hot corrosion in
metals. Electrochemical measurements will be employed to provide needed data on
the corrosion reactions taking place. The role of chromium in retarding
sulfidation will be analyzed in fused sodium sulfate at 1200 degrees Kelvin.
Effects of vanadate solutes, which accelerate hot corrosion will be determined.
Shifts in melt chemistry which affect sulfidation kinetics will be determined.
Improved theoretical understanding of the mechanisms of hot corrosion should
result from the research.
