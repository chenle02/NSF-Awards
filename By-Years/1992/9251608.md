This project equips the physics electronics laboratory with electrical measuring
and test equipment at each of 8 lab stations. The goal is to enhance the
experimental component of the two sequential electronics and instrumentation
courses directed at physics and chemistry majors by improving the efficiency
with which circuits can be analyzed, by creating instructional units on
electromagnetic interference and susceptibility, and by adding a significant
project component to the second course. A total of 18 weeks of laboratory
exercises are being redeveloped for the new equipment, emphasizing hypothesis
testing and quantitative analysis of circuit performance. The project relies on
the students' increased sophistication in data collection and analysis as gained
in the prerequisite introductory and advanced modern physics laboratory courses,
all of which make extensive use of scientific equipment interfaced with personal
computers.The equipment purchased included in each station a dual-trace
analog/digital storage oscilloscope with attached digital plotter, a dual-
display digital multimeter, a function generator with adjustable sweep, and an
adjustable, regulated DC power supply. Six oscilloscope multiplexers and two
digital LC meters have been acquired to supplement existing and compatible
equipment. The digital multimeters are supplied with IEEE-488 interfaces to
permit their use with the department standard hardware and software for student
projects.
