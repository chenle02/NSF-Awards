The project team is examining the needs of the NSF Alliance for Graduate
Education and the Professoriateâ€™s (AGEP) Transformation Alliances for a national
resource center that would include awardee data, tools, materials, and products.
As institutions of higher education (IHEs) across our nation aim to reproduce
the strategies and interventions that were developed, implemented, and studied
by more than two dozen AGEP Transformation Alliances and over 100 awarded IHEs,
it is necessary to make these resources available for broad dissemination.
Determining the needs for a national resource center of publicly available AGEP
Transformation Alliance materials, offers to stimulate future community
initiatives to create an information hub that will advance knowledge about
broadening the participation of STEM graduate students, postdoctoral research
scholars, and faculty who are members of racial and ethnic groups
underrepresented in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team is conducting a
series of surveys and interviews with the AGEP Transformation Alliance teams to
assess the information materials from awards that were issued in response to the
NSF AGEP Program Solicitations NSF 14-505 and NSF 16-552. It is urgent to
conduct this assessment as some of the awards have already ended and others will
soon expire. The investigators are examining the scope of materials, issues of
licensing and privacy, use agreements, and the preservation needs for the
material transfers. In addition to the initial surveys, interviews, and
assessments, the project team will also gather input from a broader community of
stakeholders, including but not limited to current and former awardees in the
NSF INCLUDES and the NSF ADVANCE networks. Results from the project work will be
shared with AGEP Transformation Alliances, other NSF AGEP awardees, and a broad
group of interested people and organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is
funded by NSF's Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP)
program, which supports STEM education research to increase the number of
faculty who are members of racial and ethnic groups underrepresented in
STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
