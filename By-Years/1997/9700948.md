9700948 Warner The objective of this research is to describe the evolution of
the diversity of reproductive patterns that are seen in animals today. This
research will allow a field test of the predictions of mathematical models that
include considerations of within- and between-gender conflict interactions and
their resolution. The resolutions do not necessarily maximize the fitness of any
of the participants, but the compromises achieved are the mating systems seen.
Predictions using this approach differ significantly from those made by precious
theory, and explain the existence of patterns of mating behavior that appear to
confer lower individual mating success. The predictions will be tested in a
well-known group of temperate fishes. Using simple, non-harmful techniques, the
distribution of mating success in certain areas will be altered and the
redistribution of males and females will be monitored. The model makes several
non-intuitive predictions about male and female reactions to altered mating
distributions. All models, especially those proposing a new way of thinking
about the evolution of particular characteristics, need to be tested so that
they may be evaluated in nature.
