Satellites regularly observe Ultra-Low Frequency (ULF) waves in the
magnetosphere. The observations strongly suggest that the observed waves
correspond to nonlinear states of the magnetospheric plasma. This project will
concentrate on the theoretical analysis of these waves. An existing linear
gyrokinetic-magnetohydrodynamic code will be extended to the nonlinear states.
The nonlinear code will then be used to study the excitation and evolution of
Alfven waves in a realistic dipole magnetic field. The code will include finite
magnetic compression in order to investigate magnetic compressional modes in
high-beta plasmas. The linear code will also be further developed to allow it to
be used to study kinetic electrostatic instabilities. The code will be used to
study the stability properties of ion-temperature-gradient and trapped particle
modes in dipole plasmas. Finally, extensive test-particle simulations will be
used to study the process of stochastic heating of the particles via wave-
particle interactions. The project involves a postdoctoral researcher, a
graduate student and an Honor Senior physics major. The results will have direct
bearing on satellite observations.
