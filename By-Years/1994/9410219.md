The project is aimed at developing a run-to-run process control system for
quality enhancement of semiconductor manufacturing process. Based on post-
process and in-situ measurements on product wafers, low order polynomial process
models are suggested as a way of adjusting recipes that can increase the process
qualities with minimal disruption to the production process. The proposer has
demonstrated some of his methodology in industrial applications.
