An electron-polarized photon coincidence apparatus will be used to study spin-
dependent effects in the electron impact excitation of heavy noble gases.
Relevance will be investigated for exchange, spin orbit coupling in the target,
and spin-orbit interaction involving the continuum electron in the various
regimes of electron scattering angle and impact energy. A case study will be
made of the excitation of the spin-orbit coupled P states of neon, argon,
krypton and xenon, probing both the general physical assumptions of the
theoretical models and their specific predictions. Existing discrepancies
between theory and the experiment will be examined.
