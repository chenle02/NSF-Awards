The objective of this research is to gain a better understanding of the brain
mechanisms underlying sensory-motor adaptation. Humans display a remarkable
ability to adapt to a new situation, especially when available sensory
information conflicts. Behaviorally, this adaptive ability has been well
described. One way researchers have investigated this adaptation is by having
subjects attempt to manually point at a visual target while wearing prism
goggles. Initial reaching attempts are inaccurate because the prism
systematically bends the light before it enters the eyes such that the target
appears to shift left or right of its actual location. However, with repeated
trials, the subject is able to adapt to the altered visual input and generate
accurate responses. When the goggles are removed there is an aftereffect in
which the reaching responses are inaccurate in the opposite direction to that
observed during the prism exposure period. Based on these behavioral
characteristics of prism adaptation, recent neurophysiological, clinical and
human brain imaging studies have begun to identify the network of brain sites
that contribute to this simple form of learning, but a more complete
understanding of the potentially different contributions of the network's
components is required. This goal will be accomplished by examining the degree
to which adaptation is disrupted in normal, healthy human subjects when
transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is applied over the cerebellum,
posterior parietal cortex, or premotor cortex during the training period. It is
predicted that TMS delivered over each of these sites will have different
effects on the degree of adaptation that occurs depending upon when the
stimulation is given and the availability of visual feedback from the hand. In
addition to expanding our basic understanding of the nature of sensorimotor
adaptation and its underlying mechanisms, the proposed research may also be
useful in contributing to the design of motor rehabilitation therapies.
