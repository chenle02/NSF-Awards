CUNY Queensboro Community College is implementing a Connectivity Laboratory --
a cornerstone for future engineering technology development and a model for
other technology curricula. The laboratory is designed to support experiments in
connectivity, data communications, network technology, and multimedia networks.
Six resource areas constitute the laboratory -- Student Stations, Instruction
Resources, Connection Resources, Network Services, Multimedia Resources, and
Display Resources. Four engineering technology courses are being scheduled to
use the Connectivity Laboratory -- Connectivity Fundamentals, Network
Fundamentals, Network Technology, and Multimedia Networks.Each laboratory bench
has EISA and MCA bus computers which may be configured as workstations and
fileservers, using Ethernet, Tokenring, or peer-to-peer Ethernet protocols.
These may be interconnected into various network topologies using a lObaseT
concentrator, multimedia access center, Ethernet bridge, fiber optic/Token- ring
MAU, and a Token-ring bridge.
