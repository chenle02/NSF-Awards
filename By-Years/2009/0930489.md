This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project, a collaborative
effort between HYRPES and the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering of
the University at Albany, NY, proposes to revolutionize the field of
microcalorimetry with a micromachined biocalorimeter that is faster than
conventional devices, more sensitive and inexpensive enough to be disposable.
The device will feature one or more sample spaces etched into a silicon chip.
Unlike earlier micromachined calorimeters, the high sensitivity is obtained in
air, and without the need of a surrounding vacuum, making the new device ideal
for studies of cellular metabolism. The overall research objectives are to
introduce innovations that optimize and refine our ?PicoCalorimeter? designs to
obtain <100 pico-Watt sensitivities in combination with other biological
measurements.

The broader impacts of this research are the measurement of cell metabolism, the
identification of drug effects on specific cell types, and the study of protein
folding, structural transitions and other biological phenomena. The proposed
effort introduces a totally new type of microcalorimeter with a set of
innovative features enabling measurements that are now impossible. The high
sensitivity will enable the detection of much smaller sample volumes than ever
before, thereby accelerating the time to prepare and investigate many biological
reactions. Besides basic research in cellular metabolism, enzyme function,
functional genomics, and others, the proposed disposable "PicoCalorimeters" will
have a major commercial application to drug development and evaluation, and the
detection of a wide range of toxins in liquid samples.
