9705353 Zieve This experimental planning grant involves research related to the
motion of vortices in Type II superconductors. The PI will exploit recent
advances in nanofabrication technology to study the motion of vortices in
periodic pinning potentials (arrays of holes) whose characteristic dimensions
(hole spacing and hole diameters) can extend to ranges previously inaccessible.
One of the objectives is to reach conditions where quantum tunneling of vortices
is appreciable. Thus, the plan is to perform quantitative study of both quantum
and classical tunneling rates of vortices, and their dependence on details of
the vortex pinning potential. %%% This grant supports planning for a study of
the motion of magnetic flux (vortex lines) in a thin film of superconductor.
This topic is important in connection with the current carrying capacity of
superconductors of Type II, which allow a zero resistance state to persist
(allowing loss free transmission of electrical energy) even in the presence of a
magnetic field. High temperature cuprate superconductors are of this class, and
the research being planned under this grant may contribute to the development of
an improved technology for the electrical power transmission, and also for
improved electrical motors and generators. ***
