This is a 1992 RIA Award. It is proposed to develop a new concept for
fabricating hetero- interface systems using van der Waals surfaces of layered
metal chalcogenide materials. This will be studied experimentally by growing
different kinds of layered metal chalcogenides on top of each other by means of
molecular beam epitaxy, a process that has been referred to as "van der Waals
epitaxy". Of particular interest of this method is the ability to fabricate
atomically and electronically abrupt hetero-interfaces without regard to their
lattice matching requirement. The epitaxial conditions will be investigated in
detail for improving the quality of the thin films, and the fundamental
nucleation and growth of the epitaxial layers will be investigated. Due to the
sensitivity of the layer stacking sequence to the properties of transition metal
dichalcogenides, we will develop a technique to determine the "polytpism" of the
growing thin film using Reflection High Energy Electron Diffraction
oscillations. The unique nature of the hetero-interfaces fabricated by this
method will allow the investigation of the fundamental aspects related to the
electron transfer between metals and semiconductors, from which rational design
of Schottky device structure will be explored. Finally the growth of selected
semiconducting layered metal chalcogenide on GaAs will be investigated in a view
toward the development of newer material systems. The potential flexibility for
constructing complex layered heterostructures containing different materials
selected for their specific material properties will constitute a substantial
breakthrough in heteroepitaxy technology.
