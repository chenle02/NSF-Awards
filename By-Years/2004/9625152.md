This research proposes to develop techniques for concurrent optimization of both
the circuit cell libraries and the fabrication process. A key advantage of the
proposed approach is that it allows both the circuit designer and fabrication
process engineer to work towards the common goal of maximizing yield, which will
in turn reduce product cost. A second advantage is that through concurrent
engineering, this approach can significantly reduce product development time.
Provisions have been made for validating proposed techniques in an industrial
setting. The research component of this proposal is also complemented by an
extensive education plan for integrating studies in concurrent design into the
undergraduate curriculum.
