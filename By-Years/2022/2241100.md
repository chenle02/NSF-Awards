Federated learning with local differential privacy -- where raw data stays on
device, and only sanitized updates are sent to a central server -- has enabled a
number of AI applications on sensitive data while still preserving user privacy.
The goal of this project is to advance the theory and practice of federated
learning beyond "a single user contributing a record" to a broader networked
setting where multiple users are connected into a social network.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main challenge in deploying federated analytics in
this setting is that there are multiple criteria that need to balanced together
with the privacy-accuracy tradeoff. These are communication efficiency -- as the
client nodes are typically low-bandwidth, robustness -- as the distributed and
networked setting leaves the door open to adversaries, and more complex privacy
leaks, which could arise as a result of the networked setting. The goal of the
project is to address these challenges by combining ideas from statistics,
privacy-preserving algorithms as well as graph algorithms and ultimately
developing a broad and general suite of algorithms for private and robust
federated analytics in networked settings. The project team will also engage in
community-building activities by organizing privacy workshops, as well as
outreach activities in high schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
