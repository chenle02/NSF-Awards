The Eocene Clarno flora of Oregon with its large assemblanges of exquisitely
preserved fruits and seeds, leaves and other plant organs, provides an important
link in correlating tropical to subtropical Eocene floras across the Northern
Hemisphere. The fruit and seed flora is unparalleled in the Tertiary of North
America for diversity and quality of preservation, and provides an excellent
basis for comparison with the early and mid-Tertiary of England and Europe,
where fruit and seed deposits are more abundant and more thoroughly studied than
in North America. The similarly diverse Clarno leaf assemblages facilitate
comparison with other American and Asian early Tertiary floras. Funding will
support continued field work and analyses of Clarno lacustrine assemblages.
Recently acquired radiometeric dates for many of the Clarno floral localities
increase the value of this work for biostratigraphic correlation of other
regions of the Northern Hemisphere, and for fine-tuning the chronology of floral
evolution and paleoclimatic change in the Pacific Northwest.
