9309369 Glickman This project is the design phase of a comprehensive database
for disasters worldwide, including the development of the requisite protocols
for data collection and data processing. Such a systematic and comprehensive
database is necessary for research, policy analysis, and decision making related
to the societal concerns about major natural and technological hazards. The
information incorporated into the database is drawn primarily from current news
reports, including both immediate and longer- term accounts of the disaster
events. The design phase of the project establishes critical definitions and
selection criteria, analyzes data sources and electronic data collection
options, and develops collection and coding protocols. All steps will be
reviewed by an expert panel before expanding the project into later phases. ***
