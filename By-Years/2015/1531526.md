With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemistry
Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) programs, Texas A&amp;M
University at Corpus Christi will acquire a capillary electrophoresis instrument
for teaching and research. Capillary electrophoresis is an ion separation
technique which can analyze a solution of two or more components. It uses small
chromatography columns (so called capillary tubes) and a voltage difference
(electrophoresis) to effect the separation. It is effective at analyzing very
small charged samples. This instrument will be used by undergraduate students in
their research. It will be used in laboratory courses to train students in a
technique often used in DNA, forensic and environmental analysis laboratories.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is aimed at enhancing research especially in
areas such as (a) gaining insight into factors responsible for chiral
recognition with media specifically designed for use in chiral separations; (b)
developing charged bipyridinium and extended bipyridinium based detergents to be
evaluated as pseudostationary phases in micellar electrokinetic chromatography
(MEKC); and (c) examining major ion and metal transport in ground and surface
water interactions.
