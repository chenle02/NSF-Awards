The primary objective is to update and expand the Global Historical Climate
Network (GHCN) database, focused on the high-mountain areas of Central Asia. The
data set will be compiled from meteorological measurements conducted by the
National Hydrometeorological Services (NHMS) of the Central Asian states in the
Former Soviet Union. The goal is to extend the time series of 40 climate
stations from Central Asia that are currently in the GHCN database, and add 200
stations to that data set. Most of the new stations are located above the 1000m
elevation. Monthly mean data for air temperature and cumulative monthly
precipitation values collected by NHMS, along with a subset of maximum/minimum
monthly temperature data will be constructed. The database will include three
different data sets: (i) the original data; (ii) a homogeneity-adjusted data set
that has undergone rigorous quality assessment and control; and (iii) station
metadata. The data set will be archived at the National Snow and Ice Data Center
(NSIDC), National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and National Climatic
Data Center (NCDC). The work is important because it will result in a climate
database useful to assess long-term climate in a region known to be a sensitive
indicator of climate change.&lt;br/&gt;
