A major assumption of classical economic theory is that production is governed
by constant returns to scale. This assumption forces us to ignore one of the
central features of economic life in the last two centuries: the large
industrial firm whose size is based on the economic advantages of large-scale
production. Economists have long held the opinion that efficiencies of large-
scale production were caused by indivisibilities, i.e., large, lumpy aggregates
of capital -- assembly lines, railroad and telephone networks, oil pipelines,
bridges -- whose economic advantages could not be realized at low levels of
production. Indivisibilities can be introduced into a linear programming problem
by requiring that some or all of the variables of choice be restricted to
integer values; the resulting programming problems are extraordinarily difficult
to solve. One of the major projects of the present proposal is the development
of a new algorithm for the solution of the general integer programming problem,
which seems, from preliminary experience, to perform exceptionally well on
classes of problems which cannot be solved by earlier methods. The investigator
will also attempt to provide an economic interpretation of this algorithm in
terms of the internal organization of the large-scale firm.
