This award is for the partial support of the conference in the field of theory
of Banach spaces and Operator Theory. The list of topics is very broad and
includes many important new directions in the field, such as Banach lattices,
noncommutative function spaces and also classical topics such as spaces of
analytic functions, interpolation in Banach spaces, geometry of convex bodies.
