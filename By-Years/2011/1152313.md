RECOMB (http://recomb2012.crg.cat/) is an international scientific conference
bridging the computational, mathematical, and biological sciences. The
conference features keynote talks by preeminent scientists, together with
presentations of refereed research papers in computational biology, special
sessions and poster sessions. This proposal requests travel support for US
conference participants, with priority going to graduate students who will be
presenting paper or posters.
