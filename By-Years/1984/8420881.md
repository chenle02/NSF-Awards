The objective of this proposal is to organize a workshop to examine
theopportunities for the use of available and potential microbial processes in
the solution mining of metals, metal extraction from ores, and from solid and
liquid metal-containing wastes, and the desulfurization of fossil fuels. The
workshop will provide an opportunity for industrial representatives to present
problems not previously considered by basic and applied researchers for possible
biotechnological solutions. Attendance will be open to scientists andgovernment
and industrial researchers who have interests in microbial processes.
