This project concerns analytical studies and the development of computational
approaches to two problems arising in optics. The first problem arises in the
design of progressive lenses which must have desired corrective powers and
minimal aberrations. The optical phenomenon in this case is well described by
geometrical optics. The second problem arises in the design of optical devices
that exploit photonic bandgap phenomena. In this problem, the wavelength of
light is about the same size as the structure, and calls for modeling of the
light's propagation using Maxwell's equation. In both cases, the design problem
may be posed as an inverse problem where the desired performance can be viewed
as data and the design parameters as unknowns. The aim of this research is to
use analytical tools to guide in the development of effective computational
methods to solve these inverse problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many people over
45 years old suffer a condition called presbyopia, which is the loss of the
ability of the eye to focus on near objects. Progressive lenses, which correct
for seeing both far and near objects, are often prescribed to presbyopia
patients. The design of such lenses, taking into account the patient's need and
the comfort, is a mathematical problem that involves optics, differential
geometry, and optimization. The dream of creating optical computers that have
the capability of high processing speeds requires the development of optical
devices that are counterparts of electronic devices. The design of optical
devices requires modeling of light propagation in complex nanostructures, which
can be described by partial differential equations. In order to create devices
that perform certain functions, it is necessary to solve a mathematical problem
of optimal design. The unifying theme in the design of these two optical devices
is the mathematics of inverse problems. The research to be carried out will help
create lenses of unprecedented performance and optical computing subsystems for
future optical computers.&lt;br/&gt;
