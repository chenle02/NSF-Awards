The Logistics Technicians: Goods to Go project has three goals: 1) to improve
the educational experience of pre-technology students by providing a complete
fast-track career pathway in supply chain/logistics technology; 2) to recruit
regional high school students, at-risk youth and foster care youth to the
automated systems and logistics technology program; and 3) to prepare community
college faculty to teach the automated systems and logistics technology program
by developing their expertise in specialized curricula areas with the support of
university faculty. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project partners regional high
schools serving diverse low-income communities that have student bodies with low
college-going rates with the community college logistics program. The innovative
program links a community college, university, high schools, and industry to
create a streamlined pathway to a baccalaureate degree in Technology and
Operations Management. Both college faculties are committed to a seamless
transition from high school to community college to a four-year institution. An
experienced evaluator is committed to the project. The institutions include a
Minority Serving Institution (MSI with 52% minority enrollment) and a Hispanic
Serving Institution (H.S.I. with 32% Hispanic enrollment) with over 30,000
students. The project recruits from regional high schools, at-risk youth
programs, foster-care programs, and a Summer Automation Institute for middle and
high school students.
