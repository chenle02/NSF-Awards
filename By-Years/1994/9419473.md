This is a renewal project for the continuation of research on the terrestrial
exosphere. A new Monte Carlo exosphere simulator has been developed, capable of
converting the best available thermosphere, ionosphere, and plasmasphere
information into a realistic, time dependent exosphere model. The present
version of the UTD exosphere simulator (with slight refinements) will be used in
the continued study of specific exosphere problems. ***
