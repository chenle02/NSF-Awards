Much of plant nitrogen supply, particularly for trees, is supplied through
symbiotic (mycorrhizal) fungi that obtain sugars from their host trees and in
return transfer nitrogen. However, methodological difficulties have limited
quantification of the role that mycorrhizal fungi play in meeting plant nitrogen
demands. In this project, ratios of carbon and nitrogen isotopes from two field
experiments at Duke University and at Rhinelander, Wisconsin will be used to
assess organic nitrogen uptake by different mycorrhizal fungi and plants. This
information will be combined with laboratory studies on mycorrhizal plants to
provide the first realistic and quantitative estimates of organic nitrogen use.
New methodologies being developed for this project will determine whether
patterns of organic nitrogen use differ across ecosystems and across species of
mycorrhizal fungi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will develop and perfect new
methods to quantify organic nitrogen use by plants and mycorrhizal fungi which
will transform how researchers think about nitrogen cycling in the soil and its
connections to soil carbon. This has implications for forest management.
Educational work will involve collaboration with several local high school
teachers to expand their use of outdoor classrooms and use of fungi as a tool to
teach biology. Outreach to the public will also include educating Appalachian
Mountain Club (AMC) naturalists on fungal roles in forests as well as leading
AMC nature walks. The project will involve training for a Ph.D. student and
several undergraduates, including recruitment of students from Elizabeth City
State University, a historically black institution with strong academic ties to
UNH.
