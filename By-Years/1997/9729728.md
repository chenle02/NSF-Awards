Abstract SGER Award- Paul Quay / UW The PI proposes a novel method to
reconstruct the time history of the 14C and 13C/12C record of the dissolved
inorganic carbon (DIC) in the surface waters of the subpolar North Pacific since
1900. The reconstruction is based upon C isotopic analysis of archived salmon
scales. The overall goal of this work is to compare this reconstructed record to
changes predicted by ocean general circulation models (GCM's) in order to better
constrain the GCM fluxes and predicted rates of oceanic CO2 uptake. The proposal
fits the category of high-risk interdisciplinary science, and as such is
appropriate for SGER award. The most important first step is for the PI to
demonstrate the reliability of this technique and thus recreate at least a
partial historical C isotopic record. With such data in hand the PI will extend
considerably our understanding of circulation and C inputs to the N. Pacific. In
addition, the PI will be in a position to demonstrate the potential for applying
this novel approach to future studies in ocean sciences.
