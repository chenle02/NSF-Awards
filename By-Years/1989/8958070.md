Dr. Atwater has been selected as Presidential Young Investigator. He is active
in fundamental research on the use of ion beam techniques to study
semiconducting materials. In the research program for the National Science
Foundation he will pursue studies to include the following: (1) study of the
interaction of a ion beam collision cascade with interfaces, (2) study of motion
of interfaces in semiconductor, metal, and alloy thin films as a function of ion
beam cascade density, (3) measurement and computer simulation (using molecular
dynamics techniques) of grain growth during cascade events, (4) study of
stability and crystal/amorphous phase transformations as a function of critical
ion flux and temperature for silicon, (5) study of critical conditions for
homogeneous nucleation of the amorphous phase for silicon/vapor interfaces. The
research in this grant will have an impact on electronics and opto-electronic
technology. The interactions with industry which are inherent with Presidential
Young investigator grants will have implications for national competitiveness in
this critical technology.
