A scanning tip microscopy laboratory has been established at the Optical
Sciences Center, University of Arizona, which aims to characterize isolated
semiconductor clusters used for nonlinear optics interactions. The
characterization facility is a crucial link between fabrication and application
groups working in the field of lightwave technology, because it makes possible
tailoring the fabricated media to the applications requirements. The laboratory
capabilities include scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), scanning force
microscopy (SFM), and near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM). Acquisition
of several pieces of equipment would enhance these capabilities. 1. General
purpose: a spectrum analyzer is needed to monitor the acoustical and mechanical
noise that exists during the interaction of the tip and sample. A single
spectrum analyzer will serve six different ongoing experimental efforts. 2. UHV-
STM: a Knudsen source is needed for semiconductor fabrication, a magnetic rotary
drive to transport samples, and a LEED and Auger for surface analysis. 3.
Sputtering gun and power supply. 4. Molecular Modeling Computer.
