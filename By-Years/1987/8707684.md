Solution rectification procedures are developed for synthesizing complex planar
linkages. The procedures enable rapid location of the best solutions among the
many alternative solutions to a synthesis problem. The research extends existing
methods for four-bar linkage solution rectification to more complex mechanisms,
such as six-bar linkages. The results will enable a designer to move directly
from a high-level problem specification, consisting of the description of the
motion required from a mechanism, to a highly-optimized solution, consisting of
the topology and dimensions of the linkage that will produce the desired motion.
