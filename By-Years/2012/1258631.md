This project builds on fundamental research about an innovative pedagogical
tool, moving that tool toward being an attractive, reliable, commercially-viable
product available to educators worldwide. This project determines the optimal
path for transitioning the tool to a greater market. The tool has been shown to
have a positive effect on improving learning in undergraduate STEM courses and
elsewhere. With broad theoretical foundations, technology-enabled tool provides
revealing glimpses into how students think as they struggle to master new
material. These insights into how students learn STEM concepts and processes
could have far-reaching implications in educational research and classroom
practices.

This discipline-independent pedagogical tool allows inclusive classroom
communication, blind to student gender, ethnicity, disability, age or skill
level, and encourages otherwise reluctant participants to be more actively
engaged in the classroom, even with larger (>60) enrollments. By implementing
classroom practices that embody what is known about how students learn, actively
engaging students in higher-level thinking skills, and informing instruction,
use of the product will help create a workforce better prepared to meet the
challenges of the 21st century.
