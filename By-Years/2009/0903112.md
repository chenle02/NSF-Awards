With rapid changes and new developments in nanotechnology, corrosion,
composites, biomaterials and green technologies, as well as the traditional
areas of metals, ceramics and plastics, industry needs qualified technicians
educated in materials and advanced manufacturing. The Resource Center for
Materials Technology Education (MatEd) builds on its previous efforts to broaden
access to resources for faculty educating materials and manufacturing
technicians and other materials professionals through an innovative, easily
accessible website with linkages to curriculum materials, workshops, conferences
journals and professional organizations. The collection of peer-reviewed, high
quality instructional modules aligned with industry-based core competencies for
technicians in both traditional and new advanced materials technologies is
increased and disseminated broadly to help faculty enhance current courses and
develop new ones. Partnerships created with other ATE centers in welding, rapid
prototyping, and aerospace and with professional societies ensure a
comprehensive collection of use to technician education. Strategies to ensure
the sustainability of the web site are developed. The evaluation measures the
usefulness of the materials and the core competencies to faculty and other
users.
