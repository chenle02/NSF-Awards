9453807 Schatz The Pacific Science Center is requesting $800,000 over three and
one-half years to develop a national model which would enable community agencies
to incorporate science education into their programs. Through thirteen-week
training programs, and developing Community Center Workshops, individuals from
community organizations will acquire the skills necessary to become advocates
and providers for science enrichment. A number of community-based organizations
which serve primarily minority clients have agreed to collaborate with the
Museum.
