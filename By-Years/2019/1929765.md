Many U.S. cities are simultaneously confronting two interrelated, but tragically
siloed issues: environmental impact and access to affordable housing. Central to
both is sound land use policy. Where people live, what people build, and what
people keep or make green matters not just to a neighborhood, but to the nation.
Cities have a responsibility to their local constituencies to deliver services
and establish sustainability pathways for long-term community prosperity. The
question of how to encourage affordability, equity, and sustainability in urban
development is a grand challenge facing cities across the U.S. and around the
world. The conference will bring together a community of scholars, policymakers,
and community groups to define a research agenda that explores integrated
sustainability pathways and outcomes from a tradeoffs and co-benefits
perspective. Though the focus of the conference will be regional in the Boston
metropolitan area, it will also actively engage other cities to build city-to-
city learning networks.

This conference will lay the groundwork for developing the new science, data,
and methods needed to inform integrated urban sustainability outcomes across
local-to-regional-to-national scales. The objective of the conference is to
build a shared scientific and community vision for investigating, experimenting
with, and developing multiple pathways towards urban sustainability, including
transformative practices and technologies targeted at mitigating and adapting to
environmental changes while simultaneously meeting the demands for affordable
housing. Organized as a highly interactive working summit, this conference will
bring together approximately 75 scholars, community groups, and public officials
to examine these multiple objectives holistically. Core themes will emerge from
a blend of brief keynote presentations and panel discussions. The participants,
organized into groups with diverse representation, will identify and build
consensus about the critical priority knowledge and resources needed to promote
the development of convergent sustainable pathways for socio-economic,
demographic, and infrastructure transitions.
