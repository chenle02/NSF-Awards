Sequences of actions are fundamental to many animal and human behaviors,
including locomotion, playing piano, language, and logical reasoning. Sequential
behaviors often follow some action syntax, which defines how elementary actions
can be strung together to form complex sequences, similar to following
grammatical rules in the construction of sentences. How action syntax is
generated and controlled in the nervous system is poorly understood. The
Bengalese finch is an ideal animal model for studying this problem, because the
songs of the Bengalese finch consist of several syllables arranged into
sequences with complex syntactical structures. This project will test the
hypothesis that the premotor brain area HVC encodes the syntactic structure of
the Bengalese finch's song. It is hypothesized that the propagation of spiking
neural activity along a chain-like network structure in the HVC is driving the
song of the bird and generating the song syntax. The approach combines
computational modeling and single unit recordings of neural activity in the song
control system of Bengalese finches. Neural recordings will be combined with
altering acoustic feedback and transient electrical stimulations of the song
control system to elucidate the role of the HVC in song syntax. The results of
this research will have a significant impact on understanding the neural
mechanisms underlying the generation of sequences of motor actions, and may also
shed light on the neural mechanisms of human speech synthesis. The research
brings together interdisciplinary expertise drawn from physics, computational
neuroscience, and electrophysiology, and involves a wide range of modern
experimental and computational techniques. Consequently, it will provide ample
opportunity for postdoctoral researchers, graduate and undergraduate students,
and summer high school interns to gain expertise in electrophysiology, neural
data analysis and modern methods in computational neuroscience.
