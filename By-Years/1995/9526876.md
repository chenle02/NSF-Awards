9526876 Meinert The Dal'negorsk skarn project presents an opportunity to apply
American Academic expertise in the are of skarn deposits towards the study of an
apparently unique geological setting containing both boron and lead-zinc skarn
deposits. This research will investigate the genesis of the Dal'negorsk deposit
and demonstrate the relationship between borosilicate and lead-zinc skarn
mineralization in the district. Geological mapping, petrologic, mineralogic and
fluid inclusion studies will test the working hypothesis that datolite and lead-
zinc mineralization are genetically related to the same intrusive-hydrothermal
events. A 1994 filed visit allowed for the collection of a significant skarn
sample suite, but two tasks remain that can only be accomplished by a second
field visit. The first is a minimum of two to three weeks of deposit and inter-
deposit scale geological mapping. The second task is to examine in greater
detail the relationship between igneous rocks and the two skarn types. Funding
to cover transportation to the field site in the CIS.
