This award supports a three-year renewal project to complete measurement of
cosmogenic nuclides in the Siple Dome ice core as part of the West Antarctic ice
core program. The investigators will continue to measure profiles of
Beryllium-10 (half-life = 1.5x10 6 years) and Chlorine-36 (half-life = 3.0x10 5
years) in the entire ice core which spans the time period from the present to
about 100 kyr. It will be particularly instructive to compare the Antarctic
record with the detailed Arctic record that was measured by these investigators
as part of the GISP2 project. This comparison will help separate global from
local effects at the different drill sites. Cosmogenic radionuclides in polar
ice cores have been used to study the long-term variations in several important
geophysical variables, including solar activity, geomagnetic field strength,
atmospheric circulation, snow accumulation rates, and others. The time series of
nuclide concentrations resulting from this work will be applied to several
problem areas: perfecting the ice core chronology, deducing the history of solar
activity, deducing the history of variations in the geomagnetic field, and
studying the possible role of solar variations on climate. Comparison of
Beryllium-10 and Chlorine-36 profiles in different cores will allow us to
improve the ice core chronology and directly compare ice cores from different
regions of the globe. Additional comparison with the Carbon-14 record will allow
correlation of the ice core paleoenvironment record to other, Carbon-14 dated,
paleoclimate records.
