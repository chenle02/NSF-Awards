Gamma-rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation.
Observations of astrophysical gamma-rays serve as probes of physical conditions
and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe and can
be used to test fundamental physics. The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging
Telescope Array System (VERITAS), located in southern Arizona, is designed to
perform high-sensitivity pointed observations of both galactic and extragalactic
sources. This award supports scientists at California State University East Bay
(CSUEB) in their work on VERITAS. Dr. Furniss and her group will analyze VERITAS
data to study high-energy gamma-ray emitting galaxies and probe the
extragalactic magnetic fields that permeate the Universe. This project will
directly engage undergraduates in particle astrophysics research. Students
involved in the project will visit the VERITAS observatory and contribute to on-
site operations and data collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CSUEB group will
collect and utilize VERITAS observations of very high-energy emitting active
galaxies to study extragalactic gamma-ray photon propagation. The group will
contribute to the first VERITAS extragalactic catalog of these sources. The
isotropy of gamma-ray galaxies will be tested, and the location of the sources
with respect to the integrated mass density along the source lines-of-sight will
be characterized using publicly available catalogs. A theoretical connection
between the extragalactic magnetic fields along the lines of sight to detected
sources will be investigated through the use of simulations of extragalactic
gamma-ray initiated cascades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
