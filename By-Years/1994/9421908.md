The U.S. Congress created the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) in 1972.
Over the past two decades, European parliaments have adopted and adapted this
idea. This collaborative project will examine this transfer. It will compare the
instituitonal structures and practices of parliamentary technology assessment
(PTA) in five European nations (France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the
Netherlands, and Denmark) and the European Parliament in order better to
understand: (a) how differences in political, cultural and institutional values
influence variations in PTA goals, methods, and processes, (b) the impacts of
these differences on the definition of problems, involvement of actors, and
formulation of policy options, (c) the consequences of growing European
cooperation in technology policy for the future conduct of technology
assessment, and (d) the relative success of different PTA processes in Europe
and their potential relevance to future evolution of technology assessment in
the U.S. and other nations. The anticipated outcome of the project is a
collaborative book, written by researchers, analysts and practitioners in Europe
and the United States. For the first time in English, a single resource will
analyze the development, practices and results of technology assessment in a
wide range of political cultures.
