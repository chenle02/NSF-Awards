This is a Presidential Faculty Fellows award. The research involves theoretical
analyses and experimentation in three interrelated areas of acoustics and
nonlinear dynamics. These are: (a) the interaction of sound and structures; (b)
acoustic transducer development; (c) and high-tensity acoustics. A Nonlinear
Dynamics Laboratory will be established at the university for educational and
research activities.
