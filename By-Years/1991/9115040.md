Thermal acoustic oscillations in tubes inserted into cryogenic systems can often
introduce large quantities of heat into these systems. Such unwanted heat leaks
can seriously degrade long term storage of cryogenic fluids. Very little has
been done to develop a theoretical analysis of the heat transfer process during
these oscillations. The objective of the proposed research is to numerically
analyze and stimulate thermal acoustic oscillations in cryogenic systems,
particularly in liquid helium and hydrogen systems, predict the oscillation
pressure amplitude, velocity and temperature profiles and finally,
experimentally correlate the heat transfer associated with these oscillations.
