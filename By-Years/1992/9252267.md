The Department of Geography, Geology and Planning at Southwest Missouri State
University is acquiring of two types of electromagnetic geophysical surveying
equipment (very low frequency and dipole/dipole inductive). The instruments are
allowing students to perform data collection, processing and interpretation in a
variety of geological environments including groundwater location and
contamination studies. Their results are being integrated with other types of
geophysical (gravity, magnetics, resistivity) data and geological data to obtain
a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the techniques. Along
with the department's electrical resistivity and gravity meter, the
electromagnetic surveying equipment is providing students with the opportunity
to experiment with the major geophyiscal methods used in groundwater and
environmental studies.
