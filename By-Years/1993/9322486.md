Proposal #: 93-22486 This award provides funding to purchase shipboard
instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research. The instruments will be used
aboard the R/V WECOMA, a 177 foot vessel, which is owned by NSF and operated by
Oregon State University. Instrumentation requested includes upgrades for the
computer network aboard the ship, a towing sheave for the SeaSoar, a dissolved
oxygen titration system, and upgrades to the rosette package. The
instrumentation is requested for support of NSF-funded cruises aboard the WECOMA
during 1994 and will enhance the scientific capability of the vessel in the
future.
