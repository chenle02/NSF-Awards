Sensor networks enable real-time gathering of large amounts of data that can be
mined and analyzed for taking critical actions. As such, sensor networks are a
key component of decision-making infrastructures. A critical issue in this
context is the trustworthiness of the data being collected. Data integrity and
quality decide the trustworthiness of data. Data integrity can be undermined not
only because of errors by users, measurement devices and applications, but also
because of malicious subjects who may inject inaccurate data with the goal of
deceiving the data users. A fundamental tradeoff exists between data quality and
the cost to gather and protect this data, e.g., in terms of sensor node energy.
This project focuses on a multi-faceted solution to the problem of assessing
integrity of data streams in sensor networks, taking into account cost and
energy constraints. Key elements of the solution are: (a) a cyclic framework
supporting the assessment of sensor data trustworthiness based on provenance,
and sensor trustworthiness based on data that sensors provide; (b) strategies
for continuously updating trust scores of sensor data and nodes; (c) a game-
theoretic model to analyze and mitigate the risks due to active adversaries that
try to undermine data integrity; (d) protocols for sensor network sleep/wake
scheduling and routing that balance the data quality and energy efficiency
tradeoff. The project also includes the development of tools for assessing data
trustworthiness, and experimental evaluation of the system performance. The
research has impact on healthcare, homeland security, and applications in
several other domains.
