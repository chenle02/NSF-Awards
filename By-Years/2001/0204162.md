Systems where components share information and resources indiscriminately are
often fragile. Conversely, the control of sharing contributes to modularity,
reliability, and security. Java, C#, and other modern programming languages rely
on sophisticated concepts and methods for controlling sharing. These are
embodied in constructs such as locks, abstract data types, and unforgeable
object references, and in type systems and static analyses.

This project aims to study and develop techniques for controlled sharing in
programming languages. For this purpose, it relies on the development of
foundational calculi (e.g., calculi of objects or processes). It focuses on
capabilities (such as unforgeable references), on related "packaging" constructs
(such as objects and abstract data types), and on disciplines for the safe use
of run-time mechanisms for controlled sharing.
