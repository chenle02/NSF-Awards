This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial
potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project is
to aid the development of new and better respiratory therapeutics. Over 1
billion individuals suffer from chronic respiratory diseases including
conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic
cough, and bronchiectasis. COPD is the third deadliest disease in the U.S. and
globally. Due to the prevalence and impact of these diseases, $8.6 billion is
invested in respiratory clinical trials annually. Currently, in respiratory
therapy research and pharma clinical trials, participantsâ€™ coughing and wheezing
can be a primary or secondary endpoint for measuring drug efficacy. Current
solutions for capturing daily fluctuations in cough or respiration are
burdensome to use and often produce unreliable data that is less helpful for
drawing reproducible conclusions. Additionally, these current solutions add
significantly to the cost of respiratory therapy clinical trials. This SBIR
Project seeks to address these challenges by producing a wearable device that
passively captures accurate, remote data that is essential to unlocking
scientific discoveries in respiratory care. This project serves an urgent, unmet
need for a reliable, low-effort, low-cost way to measure daily fluctuations in
clinical trial participant respiratory signs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project employs advanced edge
computing to address challenges in objectively monitoring respiratory signs. The
proposed activity may make advances in the field of ultra-low power biomedical
wearable devices. In particular, new nonlinear analog processing techniques will
be developed to make it feasible for long-term monitoring of respiratory signs,
including coughing and wheezing. The resulting analog techniques may also be
used to implement other types of state-of-the-art medical wearable
devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
