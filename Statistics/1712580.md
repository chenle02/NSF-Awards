A multimodal paradigm has become increasingly important given today's explosive
growth of information, which often arises from, for instance, automatic image
categorization and personalized prediction. Multimodal data has a wide spectrum
of applications in medical diagnostics, social networking, multimedia,
information filtering, personalized advertising, consumers' recommendations,
virtually in any electronic commerce and entertainment platform. This research
aims to develop statistical theory, methods, and computational tools to
integrate multimodal data for prediction and description. The development will
lead to the higher accuracy of learning, which will ultimately enhance
information storage, sorting and filtering. Moreover, the research project has
an education component to train graduate students in emerging areas. The
research products will be disseminated through publications and presentations.

The proposed research aims to develop statistical techniques to utilize
conditional dependence structures for integrating multimodal data. It will
proceed in the areas of collaborative learning and personalized prediction. In
each area, regression, classification, and ranking will be performed
collaboratively based on pairwise conditional dependencies between the response
components, modeled by a directed graph or an undirected graph. Special efforts
will be devoted to the joint learning of data of multiple modalities and
extraction of latent structures with an adjustment for covariates. Target
applications include image categorization and recommender systems, where the
proposed techniques will be applied to understand the content of an image and to
predict personalized preference over a large number of items. Furthermore, The
research will develop computational tools and design methods that have desirable
statistical properties.
