This research project examines the influence of buoyancy forces on the rate of
turbulent kinetic energy dissipation. Two problems in which buoyancy forces play
a significant role in determining the motion are investigated: turbulent plume
generated by a source of buoyant fluid and vertical mixing across adensity-
interface within a fluid. The experiments are performed using alaser-Doppler
anemometer for velocity measurement and laser induced fluorescence in dye
molecules for tracer concentration. The research results will be of practical
importance to environmental engineers concerned with particle coagulation
mechanics, and the mixing of dissolved materials withindensity-stratified
fluids. Applications include the optimal design of waste water treatment and
disposal systems, description of processes such as aeration of water bodies,
dissolution of atmospheric gases such as carbon dioxide, and flocculation of
suspended particles in river estuaries.
