Professor Spitkovsky will conduct research on certain topics in operator and
matrix theory in which he has been involved for the past several years. He will
investigate problems in the following areas: (1) factorization of sectorial
matrices on non-smooth contours, (2) local behavior of factorization
multipliers, (3) connections between left and right partial indices, (4)
factorizability of piecewise-quasi-continuous matrices, (5) factorization of
almost periodic matrices and positive extensions of almost-periodic functions,
(6) generalizations of the spectrum assignment theorem, and (7) generalizations
of the power inequality for numerical range. Factorization of matrix valued
functions (into other matrices with specific properties) is an important tool in
many areas of mathematics and its applications such as systems theory,
probability theory, and differential and integral equations. Professor
Spitkovsky's research is basic to these areas.
