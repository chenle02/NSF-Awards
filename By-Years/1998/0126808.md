Interdisciplinary (99)&lt;br/&gt;Training undergraduate students to examine the
complex interrelationships within our natural earth system requires improved
collaboration across academic disciplines. In this project, Allegheny College
faculty from the Departments of Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Science, and
Geology are developing the French Creek Watershed (FCW) Research Program to
provide an interdisciplinary approach to undergraduate natural science
coursework and research. The instrumentation acquired is enabling solid and
solution-phase analysis of critical biotic and abiotic watershed components. The
FCW Research Program: 1) is using new analytical equipment to strengthen field
investigations in undergraduate science classes at all instructional levels; 2)
enhancing the caliber of student/faculty research within the College by markedly
improving analytical capability and accuracy; 3) creating a program website,
linked to a geographic information system (GIS), to serve as a centralized,
institutional database for watershed information collected in courses and from
student/faculty research efforts at Allegheny. The effort is an adaptation of a
similar program at Shippensberg University. This program is enhancing the
intellectual vigor of both undergraduate students and faculty by: 1) improving
analytical capability for coursework and research; 2) developing critical
thinking and scientific skills within a regional watershed setting; and 3)
fostering an interdisciplinary perspective in coursework and research via
collaboration among disciplines. Dissemination of program design and results via
the website, conference presentations, and publications will facilitate similar
cooperative, interdisciplinary approaches at other institutions.
