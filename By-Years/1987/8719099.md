This equipment request is to instrument and place into operation a capacitance
measuring device constructed at the National Bureau of Standards which will
allow the dielectric constant of liquid helium to be measured with unprecedented
resolution and lead to information on the specific heat of liquid helium near
the lambda transition in a confined geometry.
