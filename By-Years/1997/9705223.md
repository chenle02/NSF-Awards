9705223 Noonan The Massachusetts SSI (Project PALMS) will conduct this project
in partnership with MITS (the Museum Institute for Teaching Science, Inc.) and
will develop, demonstrate the effectiveness of, and disseminate a locally-driven
model for parental involvement in mathematics, science, and technology
education. The model builds on the SSI structure by starting with parents who
are active in PALMS District Leadership Teams for Systemic Change (approximately
2900 parents). These parents will have opportunities for additional training
with materials such as Project PRISM, EQUALS, AAAS, etc. These support the new
State frameworks and assessments developed through he SSI, and are also in
support of the high quality curriculum materials recommended for implementation
in schools. Parents will then develop local plans for engaging other parents in
their communities. Materials will be developed, including a manual on How to
Build Coalitions to Engage Community Members in Mathematics, Science, and
Technology Reform. In addition, materials will be developed and outreach
activities will be conducted to include activities for parents and children
(estimated to reach an additional 21,000 parents) held in nontraditional
environments such as subways, laundromats, health clinics, and malls. Products
will include a manual on building coalitions to engage communities in supporting
mathematics and science reform, and a collection of field-tested prototype
outreach activities. Findings will be disseminated through the Eisenhower
Consortia, National PTA, Urban League, and National Council of La Raza.
