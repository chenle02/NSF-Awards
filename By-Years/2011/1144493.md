The purpose of the study is to determine the optimum placement of seafloor
geodetic monuments along the Cascadia Subduction Zone and the frequency and
duration of horizontal and vertical seafloor geodetic measurements required to
resolve the character of slip along the offshore portion of the thrust fault.
Presently, onshore geodesy has determined that the locked region lies almost
entirely offshore, however these data lack proximity and poorly resolve details
of the stick-slip behavior near the deformation front and the location of the
boundary from full stick slip to some component of stable sliding. This one-year
project to assimilate existing models of fault geometry, locking behavior along
the fault, onshore GPS data, and field-proven precisions of horizontal and
vertical seafloor geodesy into an elastic/visco-elastic model. Using this model
construction, various placements of seafloor geodetic monuments will be
simulated and the resolving power estimated to determine the minimum required
array configuration along Cascadia to constrain regional-scale slip behavior on
the thrust fault. The project contributes directly to the first two science
goals in the GeoPRISMS Science plan on Subduction Cycles and Deformation: What
governs the size, location and frequency of great subduction zone earthquakes
and how is this related to the spatial and temporal variation of slip behaviors
observed along subduction faults? And how does deformation across the subduction
plate boundary evolve in space and time, through the seismic cycle and beyond?
&lt;br/&gt;The broadest impact of this study will be to provide a guide towards
using seafloor geodesy to better quantify the earthquake and tsunami risk
associated with a large rupture of the thrust fault within the Cascadia
subduction zone. Seafloor geodetic measurements could be collected all along the
CSZ as a needed constraint to models of megathrust slip that are mostly
constrained by the sub-aerial GPS vectors from the Plate Boundary Observatory, a
part of Earthscope. Results of this study will help guide this data collection.
