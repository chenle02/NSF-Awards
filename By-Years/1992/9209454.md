Memories often require the pulling together of different elements of
information. "Associative learning" is the process by which humans and other
animals learn to connect, or associate, different elements, events, or concepts.
A fundamental form of this process is classical conditioning. Rats will learn
that one stimulus, such as a tone or a light, is associated with the occurrence
of another stimulus, such as a food pellet or a mild footshock; the tone or
light will come to evoke behavior, such as a mild fear, provided the subject has
learned to associate that stimulus with footshock and then remembers the
stimulus-footshock association. This project will investigate memory and
behavior when stimuli are associated with conflicting events or stimuli (e.g.,
shock and food, or food and no food). Previous research has shown that memory
and behavior in this situation is strongly determined by the current "context,"
stimuli that are present in the background, which can select between competing
associations. Behavior evoked by stimuli associated with multiple events can
also change as the memories age over time. The project will investigate how time
and context influence memory and performance, and also how the effects of time
and context might interact. By studying the effects of time and context on
behavior over a range of related situations, the research will provide insight
into how ambiguous information is stored, retrieved, and then expressed in
behavior and emotional performance. The research will have its primary impact on
theories of learning, memory, and acquired motivation. It will also be relevant
to research on the neurobiology of learning and memory, which has recently begun
to identify biological processes in cells of the brain that may correspond to
the learning and memory processes investigated here. The results will also have
implications for cognitive-behavioral therapies of human behavior disorders
(e.g., drug dependence and anxiety), which often introduce new learning designed
to conflict with cognition and behavior based on previous learning.
