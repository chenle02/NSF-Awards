This project improves the Electronics Engineering Technology Department's
ability to provide course work consistent with industry demands placed upon
program graduates. The ever increasing amount of automated test equipment in the
production environment requires an appropriate education of those charged with
the test responsibilities. This requires the integration of basic principles
with laboratory reinforcement. The area of focus is a three term sequence of
courses with both classroom and laboratory experience. This sequence is an
alternative to an independent study senior project where the student the student
develops his own project and implements the design. This option is directed at
areas recommended by industry and involves equipment utilizing both GPIB and VIX
automated test equipment having all the functions necessary to teach the
principles and practice of Test Engineering. The award is being matched by an
equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
