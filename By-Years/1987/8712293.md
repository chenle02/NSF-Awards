The International Laser Science (ILS) Conference, which previously met in
Dallas in 1985 and in Seattle in 1986, was established to survey the core laser
science areas including lasers and their properties, spectroscopy, laser-induced
processes and a selection of laser applications. This conference is co-sponsored
by the American Physical Society (APS) and the Optical Society of America (OSA),
and is the annual meeting of the APS Topical Group on Laser Science. It is
unique in bringing together scientists in a broad range of atomic physics and
quantum optics, involved in basic studies, applications and techniques.
