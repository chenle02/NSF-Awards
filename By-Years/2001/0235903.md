Neuropeptide Modulation of a Vocal Motor Pathway Sunny K. Boyd, Principal
Investigator Proposal Number: 0235903

The long-term objective of this research program is to identify the
interactions among chemical messengers that control behaviors. Peptide and
steroid hormones regulate social behaviors in representative species from all
vertebrate classes. The mechanisms of action of these compounds and the site in
the brain where they act on specific behaviors are poorly understood. The
interaction of testicular steroids and the neuropeptide arginine vasotocin will
be investigated in the vertebrate brainstem. Three experimental approaches will
be used to assess the importance of these interactions in generation of
vocalizations, which are a critical component of social behavior in many
species. First, neuropeptide effects on the brainstem will be tested by
analyzing vocalizations prior to, and following, neuropeptide administration.
Second, whether the necessary anatomical conditions are met at a cellular level
will be determined with tract-tracing and peptide or receptor double-labeling.
Third, this project will determine whether peptide receptors in the brainstem
are functional with receptor binding and electrophysiological recording
techniques. Neuropeptides alter a variety of vertebrate behaviors, including
parental, aggressive, and reproductive behaviors. However, little is known about
the effects of these peptides at the motor output level. Findings from this
research program will thus offer insight into conserved mechanisms for peptide
control of behavior. These studies will provide excellent training for
undergraduate and graduate students who will acquire skills at the organismal,
tissue, cellular, and molecular levels. These projects will also train high
school science teachers and minority undergraduates via two institutional
programs.
