This three year project will provide updating for high school teachers on
recent content and laboratory developments in chemistry, physics, biology and
mathematics through establishment of a partnership which will bring high school
teachers, college faculty, and industry scientists, engineers, and
mathematicians into a strong working relationship. The mechanism for providing
the update is through intensive two-day workshops in each discipline area with
follow-up activities between Inver Hills faculty, industry scientists and high
school teachers to insure effective application in the high school classroom and
to offer specialized classes at the college. Updates will be planned, presented,
and evaluated by the partnership of technical industry, a regional planning and
service agency, a community college, and local school districts. Commitments
have been received to foster dissemination and application of this model
partnership in community colleges throughout Minnesota and at the national
level. Cost sharing by the partners will total 64% of the National Science
Foundation funding.
