The Computing Research Association (CRA) has been awarded funds to support
travel to a workshop of 25 female graduate students in computer science. The
workshop, and other activities following the workshop, are already supported by
a grant from Microsoft Corporation. This proposal would increase the number of
attendees at the initial workshop from 45 to 70. The purpose of the workshop,
and of the follow-on activities, is to provide mentoring and other support
activities for female graduate students in CS&amp;E.&lt;br/&gt;
