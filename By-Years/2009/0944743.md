The research will investigate a novel mechanism by which cold-adapted fishes of
the Southern Ocean sense and respond to elevated temperatures. It is
hypothesized that sub-lethal heat stress may induce cell cycle arrest and/or
programmed cell death through apoptosis. The study will use genome-enabled
technologies to examine the environmental control over gene expression in
Antarctic species and will build direct mechanistic links between the expression
of a specific signaling pathway gene and heat-induced changes in cells. Prior
results support the hypothesis that heat stress results in cell cycle arrest
and, in some cases, programmed cell death in Antarctic fishes. If so, this
represents a novel, modified version of the well-conserved cellular stress
response found in essentially all other species and suggests that warming ocean
temperatures may have profound cellular and physiological impacts on these
extremely stenothermal species. The P.I. conducts outreach activities with the
Oregon Museum of Science and Industry, will be involved in developing a science
curriculum for the Native American Youth and Family Center (NAYA) Early College
Academy in Portland, and supports the educational and professional development
of both undergraduate and graduate students at Portland State University.
