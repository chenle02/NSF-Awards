MagnetoEncephaloGraphy (MEG) is concerned with mapping electrical activity in
the brain by measuring the induced external magnetic field. This mapping is
applied for diagnosis of diseases such as epilepsy. MEG has been a very active
area lately due to the steady improvement of weak magnetic field measurements
and its relative robustness to inhomogeneities in electrical conductivity within
the skull. This research is developing several performance measures and
optimization schemes for magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography
(EEG) systems, from a signal processing point of view. The measures include: (1)
accuracy of source parameter estimates, (2) detectability of a source, based on
the probability of detection, and (3) resolution of sources, or the probability
of detecting more than one source. These measures are being applied to develop
techniques for the optimum design of MEG/EEG system parameters, including sensor
placement, type and orientation.
