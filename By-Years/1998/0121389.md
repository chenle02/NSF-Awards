The explosive growth in demand for broadband wireless data services has
underscored the importance of low-complexity, bandwidth-efficient communication
techniques for multipath radio channels. Recent information theoretic results
have demonstrated that deploying multiple antennas at both the transmitter and
receiver can dramatically increase the capacity of wireless channels. In order
to realize the full potential of this approach, it is important to develop new
antenna designs and low-complexity signal processing techniques that more fully
exploit the space-time structure of multi-input/multi-output radio channels.

The aim of this project is to improve the performance of wireless communication
systems by jointly optimizing the antenna array geometry, coding and modulation,
and receiver processing. Four general issues are addressed: (1) design of new
antenna arrays inspired by information theory; (2) design of space-time
constellations that achieve full diversity and preserve channel capacity; (3)
low-complexity space-time coding methods based on multilevel serial
concatenation; and (4) new scalable receiver architectures for joint iterative
space-time decoding and array processing. The proposed research is an
interdisciplinary effort in communications, signal processing, and RF antenna
design. The ultimate goal of this work is to increase spectral efficiency and
reduce the power requirements of wireless communication systems.
