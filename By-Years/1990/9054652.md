This project is to develop and test 20-24 videotape scenarios based on
realistic problem-solving situations. The tapes are to be used in two ways: (1)
as assessment tools to measure students' problem-solving skills and beliefs, and
(2) as instructional devices to promote problem solving. The focus of the
materials will be on students' beliefs about problems and ways to solve them.
The videotape scenarios will show children involved in a cooperative effort to
solve real-life problems. The tapes will be used to develop the abilities of
children in grades 4-6 to recognize problem situations, to develop problems from
these situations, and then solve the problems. Simultaneously, there will be
instruments developed to assess the students' understanding and dispositions
about problem solving. All material, including a user's guide, will be indexed
to the NCTM standards.
