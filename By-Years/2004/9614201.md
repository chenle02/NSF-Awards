9614201 Costa Sea ice forms an extensive habitat in the Southern Ocean. Reports
dating from the earliest explorations of Antarctica have described high
concentrations of algae associated with sea-ice, suggesting that the ice must be
an important site of production and biological activity. The magnitude and
importance of ice-based production is difficult to estimate largely because the
spatial and temporal distributions of ice communities have been examined in only
a few regions, and the processes controlling production and community
development in ice are still superficially understood. This study will examine
sea ice communities in the Ross Sea region of Antarctica in conjunction with a
studies of ice physics and remote sensing. The specific objectives of the study
are: 1) to relate the overall distribution of ice communities in the Ross Sea to
specific habitats that are formed as the result of ice formation and growth
processes; 2) to study the initial formation of sea ice to document the
incorporation and survival of organisms, in particular to examine winter
populations within "snow-ice" layers to determine if there is a seed population
established at the time of surface flooding; 3) to sample summer communities to
determine the extent that highly productive "snow-ice" and "freeboard"
communities develop in the deep water regions of the Ross Sea; 4) and to collect
basic data on the biota, activity, and general physical and chemical
characteristics of the ice assemblages, so that this study contributes to the
general understanding of the ecology of the ice biota in pack ice regions.
