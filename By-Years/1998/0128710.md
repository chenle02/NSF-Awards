This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
the feasibility of a distance coaching system for foreign language learners
using the tandem method through electronic media (eTandem). The objectives of
the proposed research are to establish a fundamental understanding of issues and
parameters affecting eTandem distance coaching and to demonstrate feasibility of
an eTandem distance coaching system. Language learners lacking access to foreign
language learning opportunities will be targeted. Rural and disadvantaged
learners are key target groups. Tandem is an autonomous form of language
learning where two native speakers of different languages form a reciprocal
learning partnership. Tandem coaching was conceived, researched and demonstrated
to improve the effectiveness of the tandem learning process. Since 1994, Tandem
has been practiced using electronic media (eTandem) with great success. The
concept of distance coaching for eTandem learners, not previously researched,
offers high potential to advance language learning and intercultural exchange
for an international audience. Parvis proffers a system, eTandem coaching, with
potential for a dramatic impact on distance foreign language learning worldwide,
serving a wide range of possible customers from K-12 to adult education.
