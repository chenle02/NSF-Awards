Knowledge of the nitrogen cycle, which includes determination of reservoirs of
nitrogen in the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere, is hindered by limited
data on nitrogen abundance in rocks. Recent investigations of coal-rich shale,
illite/smectite clays, and hot spring deposits suggests that ammonium (NH4)
bearing minerals may be much more abundant than previously recognized. This
research will investigate the geochemistry of NH4 in coal-rich shale and
glauconite-bearing strata. Specific goals include a better understanding of
fluid/mineral reactions associated with coal-bearing, low grade metamorphic
shales and with the environment of glauconite formation. To achieve these goals,
it will be necessary to characterize the mineralogy and chemistry of these
strata using various laboratory techniques (NH4 analysis, SEM, BSEM, TEM, XRD,
XRF, and petrography) and to conduct hydrothermal experiments and geochemical
calculations that measure equilibrium constants of NH4 fixation reactions. The
results may show that NH4 - illite in coal-rich shale can be used as thermal
indicator. Presence of NH4-illite should seriously affect measurements of the
illite crystallinity index, long used to measure the thermal maturity of shales.
Additional results may include possible explanations for low radiometric ages of
glauconite and for differences in alkali contents between Fe-rich
illite/smectite (glauconite) and Al- rich illite/smectite.
