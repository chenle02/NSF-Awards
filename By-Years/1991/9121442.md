This grant will partially support a minisymposium entitled "Biotechnology for
Biomedical Engineers: A Look to the Future", to be held in conjunction with the
13th Annual Conference of the IEEE/EMBS (Engineering in Medicine and Biology
Society). The Conference will be in Orlando, Florida on October 31 to November
3, 1991. The purpose of the minisymposium is to identify important research
areas in biotechnology where biomedical engineers can contribute with their
expertise. Prominent scientists/engineers will be invited to give tutorial
lectures about the frontiers of biotechnology. It is expected that the
minisymposium will continue the creation of an environment where
biotechnologists and biomedical engineers can work together toward common
research goals.
