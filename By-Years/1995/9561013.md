9561013 Fernandez One of the most pervasive and important current technological
trends is the use of light (photonics) to perform functions that previously were
accomplished with electronics, or which simply were not feasible with older
technologies; it is an important area within which to provide laboratory
experiences. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project will
develop a novel instrument to measure fluorescence lifetimes and associated
courseware targeted to undergraduate university level laboratory teaching and
learning in the physical, chemical, biological and engineering sciences. The
instrument is based on an inexpensive, rugged phase fluorometer recently
developed at Ciencia. In the Phase I, courseware modules will be developed for
specific experiments suitable for the laboratory component of general
undergraduate physics courses (for science students), as well as for sophomore
level optics courses and senior level student research. Ciencia will collaborate
with the University of Connecticut Physics Department in the development of the
teaching modules and for testing the system in the classroom. This instrument
will make it possible to bring, for the first time, to undergraduate
laboratories a capability that until now has only been available at highly
specialized research centers. Potential applications span physics, chemistry,
biology and engineering laboratory courses. Potential commercial applications
include undergraduate laboratory research as well as classroom teaching in the
laboratory component of undergraduate science and engineering courses. Potential
markets include the physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering departments at
colleges and universities.
