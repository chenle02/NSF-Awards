CHE-9408997 Peterson Fdn for Advancement of Ed in Sci This grant, which is
jointly funded by the Americas Program in the Division of International Programs
and by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of
Chemistry, provides support for Mr. Eden Netto of the Federal Center for
Technological Education of Parana, Curitiba, Brazil, to compete the development
and testing of a broad range fiber optic based pH sensor. This project is being
conducted collaboratively with Dr. John D. Peterson of the Biomedical
Engineering and Instrumentation Program, National Center for Research Resources,
National Institutes of Health. This three month award complements initial
funding for Mr. Netto which was provided through a two-year fellowship awarded
by Brazil's CNPQ. Fiber optic pH sensors that respond to a broad range of
acidities are technologically innovative, non-invasive devices that are broadly
applicable in biomedical diagnosis, environmental analysis, and process
biotechnology. It is expected that the successful completion of this project
will not only give rise to a particularly useful pH sensor but will also serve
as a focal point for further U.S. - Brazil scientific interactions.
