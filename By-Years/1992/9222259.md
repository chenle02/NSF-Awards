This Small Grant for Exploratory Research undertakes a survey of candidates
running for the US House of Representatives in the 1992 elections, as part of an
international, comparative study including Britain, Australia, New Zealand,
Canada and the United States. The survey will permit a comparative study of
American, Canadian, Australian, British national legislative elections. Surveys
in Britain and Australia have been fielded, while the Canadian study has been
funded in anticipation of the 1993 elections. The funding will allow the
investigators to field the survey and accomplish the following objectives:
compare the social background, motives, and political experience of legislative
candidates; analyze similarities and differences in the recruitment process to
national legislatures; compare factors affecting female and minority
representation; analyze the relationship between the attitudes, values and
opinions of representatives and the general public; and, determine the relation
between the recruitment process and the nature of representation. This study
allows a comparative investigation and promises to make substantial
contributions to our understanding of candidate motives, values and attitudes.
