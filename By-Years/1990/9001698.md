This research consists of an experimental and theoretical investigation of
grain growth in polycrystalline films on single crystal substrates. Reflected
high energy and transmission electron diffraction, transmission electron
microscopy, and thin film X-ray texture analysis are employed to characterize
the film grain size and orientation. Metal-on-metal, metal-on-mica, and metal-
on-alkali halide model systems are the principal materials under study.
Experimental results on grain growth are compared to predictions from computer
simulations and analytical theories. A primary goal is to determine the
film/substrate interface energy as a function of relative film/substrate
orientation by experimental methods and compare these results with atomistic
computer simulations.
