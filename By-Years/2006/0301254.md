This award supports, in part, a workshop jointly sponsored by the Mathematical
and Physical Sciences Directorate of the National Science Foundation and the
U.S. Intelligence Community that is designed to identify basic scientific
opportunities that will significantly impact key technologies required for the
U.S. to deal effectively with future terrorist threats. This workshop will
involve mathematical and physical scientists from academia, industry, and
government laboratories, and will be held over a two and one-half day period.
Participants are being identified according to expertise in the five research
focus areas of (1) energy sources, (2) sensors and detectors, (3) image
reconstruction and analysis, (4) optical spectroscopies, and (5) mathematical
techniques. The outcome of this workshop is expected to be a report detailing
the opportunities for scientific research that can positively impact on
intelligence technology capabilities necessary for the detection and deterrence
of future threats to national security both at home and abroad, along with a
suggested timeline for their development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
impacts of the proposed activity are twofold. Firstly, a list of key
opportunities for scientific research and technology development to enhance the
capabilities of the U.S. Intelligence Community will result, and secondly, a
cadre of mathematical and physical scientists well informed in the current
challenges and needs of the U.S Intelligence Community will be developed. Both
impacts are critical for the U.S. Intelligence Community to maintain the
technological capability required for ensuring the nation's security.
