This proposal requests support for the third annual German-American Frontiers of
Science Symposium (GAFOS) to be held in Munich, Germany, June 19-22, 1997.
Sponsored by the German-American Academic Council (GAAC) (founded March 26, 1993
by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Bill Clinton), the GAFOS is
designed to bring together the best young researchers from Germany and the
United States to hear lectures and engage in discussions on cutting edge issues
in science and engineering, and possible future development. The Symposia bring
not only bring together researchers from the two countries, but also researchers
form different disciplines in the expectation of being able to apply techniques
of problem solving from one field to other fields.
