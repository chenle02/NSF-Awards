The Grand Challenge Application Groups competition provides one mechanism for
the support of multidisciplinary teams of scientists and engineers to meet the
goals of the High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC) Initiative in
Fiscal Year 1992. The ideal proposal provided not only excellence in science:
focussed problem with potential for substantial impact in a critical area of
science and engineering but also significant interactions between scientific and
comptational activities, usually involving mathematical, computer or
computational scientists, that would have impact in high-performance
computational activity beyond the specific scientific or engineering problem
area(s) or discipline being studied. This proposal is for the direct
implementation of three computing recommendations of the Astronomy and
Astrophyusics Survey Committee. It will implement a prototype of the next
generation of astronomical telescope systems - remotely located telescopes
connected by high speed networks to very high performance, scalable architecture
computers and on-line data archives. The very computationally intensive
algorithms for calibration and imaging of radio syntheseis array observations
will be optimized and new algorithms which utilize the massively parallel CM-5
will be developed.
