9406618 McNulty The Department of Mathematics and the University of South
Carolina will purcahse a Sun SPARC Center 1000 with 2 cpu's, 128 MB of RAM, and
more than 6 GB of disk which will be dedicated to the support of research in the
mathematical sciences. This equipment will be used in several research projects,
including in particular: and investigation into irreducibility of some classical
polynomials conducted by Dr. Michael Filaseta, research in combinatorics
conducted by Dr. Jerrold Griggs, research on free resolutions in commutative
algebra by Dr. Andrew Kustin, and an investigation of unavoidable patterns in
strings of symbols by Dr. George McNulty. A common element in all these
investigations is their dependence on the use of algebraic and symbolic
computations as tools for discrete mathematical experiments, on which to base
the formulation of conjectures, and as the means to carry out crucial
calculations as parts of mathematical proofs. All four mathematicians have made
substantial use of computational approaches in their prior research which have
pressed the limits of computational resources currently available to them.
