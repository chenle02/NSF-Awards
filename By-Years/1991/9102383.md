The project has the goal of finding a site in the vicinity of Sondre
Stromfjord, Greenland, for a partial reflections drifts radar. The specific
costs of the site preparation required before installation of the radar will be
determined, and estimates of the month-to-month operating costs will also be
obtained. In addition, the various instrumentation options will be
assessed.***//
