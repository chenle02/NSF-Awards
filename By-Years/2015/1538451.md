Cooperation among manufacturers has the potential to create a robust network of
financially successful manufacturing firms that is essential for the resurgence
of manufacturing in the US. These firms stay nimble by maintaining independent
ownerships and keeping their sizes small. But they can also benefit from economy
of scale enjoyed by large enterprises by joining forces with other members of
their supply chain. Quantity discount in procurement, risk pooling in inventory
control, and cost efficiency in environment regulation compliance are just a few
examples of advantages that can be achieved by cooperation. Because firms are
motivated to pursue their own interests, value sharing and/or cost allocation
schemes are of vital importance for the formation of stable cooperative
relationships. Cooperative game theory lays out a general framework for
identifying and analyzing these schemes. Nevertheless, combining the general
theory with supply chain specifics to develop implementable solutions and
algorithms is a major challenge, which will be tackled in this project. This
research will provide analytical tools to determine whether a mutually
profitable cooperation is possible for a given set of manufacturers, and if so,
identify allocation schemes to sustain the relationship.

This research will analyze cooperative games in supply chain systems, such as
the Newsvendor model and the Economic Lot Sizing model. The analysis will be
also extended to more general versions of these systems that feature multi-
period decision-making, price-demand relationships, concave inventory costs, and
finite demand windows. The aim is to develop general conditions under which non-
empty cores exist and identifying possible monotone allocation schemes. The
underlying optimization problems that characterize individual participants'
behavior and determine the outcome of the games, are difficult and will be
addressed by new optimization techniques developed during this research.
Moreover, the project will consider not only the effect of allocation schemes on
incentive to cooperate, which is a verifiable action, but also participants'
effort levels, which are not directly observable. Therefore, in addition to
willingness to participate, the design of the value sharing/cost allocation
scheme also needs to take into account incentive to contribute, and the
development of such schemes in this project will add a new dimension to the
existing models in the supply chain literature.
