ABSTRACT NSF contract OPP 96-164000 Weber This funding jacket will provide for
the first award of the helicopter services contract to Petroleum Helicopters,
Inc. (PHI), Lafayette, Louisiana, as a result of NSF solicitation OPP 95-029,
"Acquisition of Helicopter services for the United States Antarctic Program and
the New Zealand Antarctic Program". This two year contract (plus 3 one year
option periods) is being awarded by the NSF to PHI, with Office of Aircraft
Services (OAS) under the Department of Interior (DOI) providing administrative
oversight per amended MOA of 25 Sept., 1995. As administrator for the Helicopter
Services contract, OAS will provide periodic disbursement of funds to PHI for
services rendered, in accordance with the amended MOA, via NSF/OAS contract OPP
96- 43291. This jacket, in the amount of $1.00 U.S., will serve to identify the
Helo Services contract (i.e., give it a NSF contract number) and track it in the
NSF awards system, and will be managed by the Deputy Research Support Section,
Office of Polar Programs. This $1.00 funding action is necessary to allow for
the process of transferring $4,910,837.00 from NSF to OAS, who will make
payments to PHI at billing intervals per the RFP OPP 95029. It's anticipated
first payments to the contractor will be required on/about 15 October, 1996. The
Program Manager has reviewed this request and recommends it for funding. Dwight
D. Fisher Acting Section Head
