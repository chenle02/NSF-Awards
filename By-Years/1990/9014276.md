9014276 Ketterson We propose a Research Training Group in the inter disciplinary
study of Animal Behavior. We are a collaborative group of Biologists,
Psychologists, and Neuroscientists concerned that the study of behavior is being
hampered by overspecialization. By training students in multidisciplinary
approaches to common research problems, we can show the benefits of combining
evolutionary thinking and the analysis of mechanism in the study of behavior.
The primary component of our training will be the opportunity to address
research problems from several perspectives and under the direction of more than
one mentor. Our theme, "Choice, Transitions, and Constraints," reflects the
importance we attach to (1) proximate assessment of the immediate environment,
(2) learning and development, and (3) evolution, in understanding behavior. We
request support for eight graduate students and two postdoctoral students. These
trainees will rotate through at least two laboratories. Our research programs
will include (1) the Study of Communication, (2) Sexual Behavior and Mate
Choice, (3) Orientation and Migration, (4) Learning Mechanisms, Ecology, and
Behavioral Plasticity, and (5) Parental Behavior and Ontogenetic Transitions. We
will establish a Center for Animal Behavior at Indiana University that will
provide a setting to promote our objective: the focussed, interdisciplinarv
investigation of animal behavior. ***
