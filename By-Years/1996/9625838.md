This award provides support for the Five Colleges Number Theory Seminar. This is
a regular seminar supported by five colleges in the New England area. The
seminar provides a center for the research efforts of faculty in the five
colleges who are specialists in number theory and arithmetic geometry. It also
serves the undergraduate and graduate students at the five colleges who are
interested in number theory and arithmetic geometry. This proposal is in the
general area of number theory. Number theory has its historical roots in the
study of the whole numbers, addressing such questions as those dealing with the
divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among the oldest branches of
mathematics and was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons.
However, within the last half century it has become an indispensable tool in
diverse applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and
communication systems.
