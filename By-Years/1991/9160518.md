Ultra-fine particles will be incorporated into pure magnesium by pressure
infiltration to form oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) magnesium. These alloys
will derive strength from the fine particles and resulting dislocation
substructures. By using particles which are thermally stable, the alloys will
retain their strength at temperature for long periods of time. Hot hardness
tests conducted on the alloys will be used to measure strength at temperature.
