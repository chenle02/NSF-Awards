This is a project to collect high-resolution multichannel seismic data in the
Sandino forearc basin offshore Nicaragua. The data will be used to determine if
a eustatic sea level signal can be discerned near a plate boundary. The data
will be used to test the hypothesis that tectonic effects can be identified and
distinguished by acquiring multichannel seismic data that define unconformities
and sequences that can be correlated with coeval sequences from other margins
and with the deep-sea oxygen isotope record proxy for sea-level change. This
project will tackle the important problem of separating the records of tectonic
effects and eustasy on an active margin. If successful, it may be possible to
extract eustatic records from other active margins, thereby improving our
understanding of global sea level change.
