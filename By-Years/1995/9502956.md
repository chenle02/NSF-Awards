9502956 Schnabel This award provides support for high-speed networking
equipment, high-performance multiprocessor workstation servers. a high-speed
disk array, and multimedia devices for collaboration, exposition and
visualization. The University of Colorado department of Computer Science will be
addressing issues of data movement in Grand Challenge and National Information
Infrastructure (NII) applications. This in conjunction with the floating point
needs of Grand Challenge computations, leads to their request for high-speed
computation and communication infrastructure. The research associated with the
infrastructure falls into four inter-related projects in the area of scientific
computing, distributed systems, and resource discovery. These four projects are
data movement in Grand Challenge computing, global optimization algorithms for
molecular configuration problems, compiler-assisted network runtime systems, and
resource discovery and information sharing.
