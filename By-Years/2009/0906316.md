Plane continua X (and maps on them) are often studied by considering their
complements in the sphere.The standard approach is to use a Riemann map from the
unit disk to a complementary component U of X in the sphere. One of the reasons
this approach is useful is that the conformal map encodes the geometry of the
boundary of U. We propose to use an alternative to this analytic approach which
makes it easier to apply such techniques in the topological setting and certain
limit cases where the analytic techniques do not work. It can be shown that
conformal external rays can be replaced by metrically defined external rays
which leads to the same prime end theory as in the conformal case. Moreover, the
conformal map can be replaced by a metrically defined partition of U into
disjoint convex sets, which also captures the geometry of the boundary of U.
This approach has already been used to obtain additional information about a
possible minimal counter example to the plane fixed point problem and to show
that all positively oriented maps of the plane, which include all holomorphic
maps, must have a fixed point in any non-separating invariant sub-continuum.
This approach was also critical in showing that every isotopy of a plane
continuum,starting at the identity, can be extended to an isotopy of the entire
plane. (Standard Caratheodory kernel convergence is insufficient to establish
this result.) We plan to use these results to attack the following problems:
does every map of the plane fix a point in any non-separating invariant sub-
continuum and is every homogeneous tree-like plane continuum a pseudo arc? Our
approach makes extensive use of the notion of a geometric lamination of the unit
disk.

Complicated dynamical systems are often studied by analyzing the behavior of a
system near periodic points. The study of the existence of such points naturally
leads to the notion of a fixed point. The study of the existence of fixed points
is an old and well established branch of mathematics. In this project we propose
to study the existence of fixed points under maps of the plane onto itself.
