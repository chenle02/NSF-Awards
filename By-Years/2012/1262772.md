The main thrust of this 3-year project is to develop theoretical models of radio
emission from solar flares and electron transport in coronal magnetic
structures. This project will also develop tools for direct and forward fitting
of radio observations of solar flares. The forward fitting combined with high-
resolution imaging spectropolarimetry from the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array
(EOVSA) will enable members of the solar-heliospheric community to derive
physical parameters of flares on dynamic time scales with unprecedented spatial
resolution. This will advance present understanding of fundamental physical
processes, such as magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration, in the
context of solar and stellar physics as well as
astrophysics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project activities will advance
scientific discovery and learning while promoting teaching and training at the
New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT)'s Center for Solar-Terrestrial
Research (CSTR). In particular, the tools to be developed as part of this
project will be widely used in graduate-level courses at the CSTR, such as Radio
Astronomy, Solar Physics, and Plasma Physics. The research and EPO agenda of
this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery,
learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.
