0236489&lt;br/&gt;Wilf&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI is beginning a tenure-track
appointment in the Department of Geosciences at Pennsylvania State University
and is setting up a paleobotany lab for research and teaching. This award
supports the acquisition of fundamental laboratory equipment such as specimen
cases, microscopes, computers, photographic supplies, and fossil preparation
equipment. The PI's research program is quantitative in nature and relies on
large sample sizes, and the award will help to support the collection and active
curation of several thousand specimens of fossil plants at a time in a modern
facility. Housing of specimens at Penn State allows them to be used on a daily
basis by the PI and students. The award provides the material infrastructure for
several research initiatives involving the improved understanding of changes in
past terrestrial ecosystems and climates, such as (1) methods for using fossil
plants to quantify paleoclimates; (2) terrestrial climates and vegetation across
the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, a time of mass extinctions; (3) terrestrial
climates and vegetation during the late Paleocene-early Eocene interval of
global warming; and (4) the response of insect herbivory, seen on fossil leaves,
to climate changes and other perturbations from the Cretaceous to the Eocene.
The laboratory infrastructure expedited by the award will support the training
of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs, support their research
projects, and make possible the housing and maintenance of paleobotanical
teaching collections at Penn State.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
