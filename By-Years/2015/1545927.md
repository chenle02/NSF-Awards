Mountains form natural barriers to wind flow. As winds in general, and storms in
particular, approach mountain ranges, mountain waves develop above and
downstream of the barrier. At the same time, low-level flow may become blocked
and diverted around the periphery of the mountains. These flows are often too
small in scale to be accurately captured by global weather and climate models,
but produce drag on the large-scale flow that must be parameterized. This
research includes the training and professional development of two graduate
students, including one under-represented minority. Results will be shared
through journal articles and conference presentations, including webinars
organized by the Mountain Meteorology Committee of the American Meteorological
Society (AMS). The results of this research will also benefit water resource
managers, hydrologists and those studying the current state of our climate and
potential future shifts in mid-latitude storms.

This study attempts to place parameterization on a firmer theoretical
foundation. The large-scale responses to orographic drag will be studied through
the analysis of high-resolution numerical simulations. Heavy precipitation over
mountains is largely driven by the passage of large-scale weather systems.
Prototypical theoretical studies of the interactions of these weather systems
with idealized mountain ranges have not previously been undertaken due to the
complexity of modeling large- and small-scale flows. This research builds on
prior studies of multi-scale interactions in dry air flow by the inclusion of
moist flow as a result of the combination of mid-latitude cyclones and more
localized ascent forced by topography into vigorous updrafts and enhanced
precipitation.
