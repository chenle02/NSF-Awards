This developmental psychology project studies the perceptual, cognitive and
social behavior of infants and children using a variety of techniques. The
methods include naturalistic observation, correlation, and experimentation.
Behavior is recorded on video tape, observations are coded and entered into a
computer for analysis. The award upgrades the existing developmental psychology
laboratory with a video camcorder, a remote control video system, a personal
computer and printer and ancillary equipment. Students at the introductory and
advanced levels, the majority of whom are women, participate in research studies
where they receive hands on experience testing young children. The additional
equipment enables students to study a wide range of developmental questions and
learn a variety of data collection techniques as well as learning up to date
statistical and computer programming skills. The grantee institution is matching
the NSF award with an equal sum obtained from non-Federal sources.
