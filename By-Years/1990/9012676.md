The Ga-As source of polarized electrons has important applications in atomic
collision physics, surface physics and high energy physics. Significant
improvements of principal characteristics are found as temperature is lowered,
but crystal lifetimes are shortened intolerably due to condensation of impurity
gases. It is proposed to explore the use of in situ cesiation, which this group
has found to be effective at room temperatures, to extend Ga-As crystal lifetime
at low temperatures.
