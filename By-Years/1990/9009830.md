This research initiation award provides support to study the dynamic control
strategy for direct drive actuators used in precision machining systems. To
realize the full potential of direct actuation, advanced dynamic control
techniques will be investigated to address problems of dynamic interaction
between drives and machining processes and dynamic coupling between axes.
Current linear motor technology may provide the response, speed and force
required for machining and could have great potential to realize higher speed
and higher precision machining systems at a cost advantage. Since few
applications of linear motors for machining exist, advanced control theory has
seldom been applied to this problem. This research investigates the control
methods and techniques for linear motors from the perspective of the entire
machining systems, as opposed to exclusively considering the actuator,
independent of the machining process.
