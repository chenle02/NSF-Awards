Autism stakeholders, including parents, people with autism, and educators, agree
that community engagement is important for the ethical design of autism
research. This project will analyze how involving members of stakeholder groups
in autism research affects how researchers design their studies and present
their research. This proposed study will examine what values and concepts
related to research and disability are important to autism stakeholders and how
community engagement with these values will impact research output. Findings
from this project could lead to increased inclusion and participation of people
with disabilities in scientific research. It could contribute to improving
public understanding and reception of that research. This project will aim to
establish best practice guidelines for generating an ethical culture of autism
research. It will train graduate students in qualitative research methods and
research design ethics. The research outcomes will be of interest to patients,
families of patients, health care providers, researchers and
administrators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study investigates to what extent
autism researchers include autism stakeholder groups in the design phase of
their research, as well as inclusion's effects on research output. It will
contribute to the sociological and ethical literature on autism research, STS
studies of values and epistemological frameworks, and bioethics. The PIs will
employ a sequential mixed methods research design, including a survey of U.S.
autism researchers working on basic biomedical research, epidemiology, and
services research to identify researchers who utilize community involvement
approaches ranging from CBPR (Community Based Participatory Research) to
advisory boards, as well as those with no interest in community engagement.
Based on survey responses, researchers will be split into two groups, those who
report having used any community engagement approaches in their research and
those who did not. The survey will be followed by structured interviews to
assess attitudes and beliefs (e.g., a social versus a medical model of
disability or an orientation to autism across the lifespan rather than a
childhood focus) related to autism research. Lastly, a textual analysis will be
conducted of interviewed researchers' publications to assess whether
researchers' commitment to community engagement in the design phase of research
is associated with different research methods, frames of analysis, conclusions,
or products.
