With this award, the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Division of Chemistry is
supporting the research of Professor Michael P. Doyle of the University of Texas
at San Antonio. Professor Doyle is developing a class of reactions known as
"cycloadditions" that form rings of atoms. These rings are the building blocks
of many important compounds, including precursors to biologically active
molecules, pharmaceutical drugs, and materials. Professor Doyle has designed
chemical systems that are capable of controlling the 3-dimensional shape of the
products, a feature that is crucial to the synthesis of molecules of medicinal
importance. In addition, some of the these cycloaddition reactions use earth-
abundant metals to speed up the reaction. This project provides a training and
preparation for the next generation of diverse researchers in the chemical
sciences. Undergraduate and graduate students working on this project gain
expertise in modern synthetic methods and laboratory techniques while being
exposed to an intellectually stimulating and challenging environment that will
prepare them for future careers in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cost-
effective preparation of complex chiral molecules is directly dependent on the
availability of sustainable synthetic methodologies. In this project, Professor
Doyle is advancing the discovery and development of catalytic
(3+n)-cycloaddition reactions where n=1, 2, or 3, for the synthesis of
carbocyclic and heterocyclic compounds. He and his team are using a metal-
stabilized three-carbon vinylcarbene that is derived either from a vinyldiazo
compound, or a donor-acceptor cyclopropane, to selectively form products
containing 4 to 6-membered rings and up to two heteroatoms. Stereoselectivity in
these cycloaddition reactions is imparted via chiral ligands, which restrict the
approach of a reactant to one side of the vinylcarbene, providing enantiomeric
ratios as high as 99:1. The use of earth-abundant copper catalysts, and the use
of cyclopropenes as vinylcarbene sources are also actively pursued. There is
also a strong commitment to engaging a diverse group of students to carry out
this research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
