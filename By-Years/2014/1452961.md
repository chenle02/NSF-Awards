In the past several years, there has been a great deal of exposure to the
opportunities and promise that lie in large-scale data. Although massive data
sets have been collected and analyzed in well over a decade, the excitement is
largely due to the relatively recent availability of social data: massive
digital records of human interactions. This provides a unique system-wide
perspective of collective human behavior which poses fundamental challenges and
opportunities. Despite the tremendous progress made in recent years, very few
algorithmic frameworks to-date have been purposefully developed for analyzing
social data sets.  The goal of this project is to develop frameworks that enable
analysis of large-scale social data.  This project seeks novel models that are
rich in problems, raise deep questions about computation, and can lead to long-
lasting impact on sociology and data science.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;From a
technical perspective, the goal of the project is to develop appropriate
algorithmic machinery with strong theoretical guarantees that translate to
results in practice.  The project consists of three main lines of research.  The
first line of research seeks to develop a theory to optimize events in the
future given a distribution on the consequences of actions we take in the
present.  The second line of research considers learnability and scalability of
social data, and its interpretation for optimization.  The third line of
research considers design of robust optimization algorithms for noisy data.  The
methodology includes experimentation on real data sets to develop appropriate
algorithmic machinery with strong theoretical guarantees that translate to
results in practice. Both undergraduate and graduate curriculum will benefit
from the development of courses in this interdisciplinary area.
