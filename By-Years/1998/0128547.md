This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
new surface modification technique for manufacturing copper indium diselenide
(CIS) thin films, an important emerging photovoltaic technology. It will
eliminate present toxic processing steps involving cadmium sulfide deposition,
cyanide etch, all of which have many unfavorable repercussions to the
manufacturer and the environment. The key step will be to devise a simple,
inexpensive process, using air and a non-toxic aqueous solution, to alter the
surface properties of CIS films. This step will eliminate the need for the
cadmium component, the cyanide etch and the disposal of hazardous chemicals. It
will also improve the efficiency of solar cells made with inexpensive coating
methods. Performance evaluation of the modified CIS solar cells will validate
the new concept. This innovation is anticipated to simplify manufacturing, lower
costs and improve the efficiency of photovoltaic modules.

Applications for the CIS photovoltaic technology range from powering small
appliances to electric utility. Non-utility applications include solar cars,
building integration, mobile systems and space systems. Lower costs, fewer
components and easier manufacturing could translate into a wider spectrum of
commercial markets for CIS solar cells. Eliminating the toxicity issues will
enhance the public perception of CIS photovoltaic technology. Its implementation
will promote the market success of CIS solar cells to provide a timely solution
to the nation's escalating energy and environmental problems.
