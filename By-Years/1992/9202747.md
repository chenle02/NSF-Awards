This award from the U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science Program supports
collaborative research in chemistry to be conducted by Dr. Emile A. Schweikert
of Texas A &amp; M University and a group led by Dr. Carlos V. Barros Leite of
Pontifica Universidade Catolica (PUC) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The objective
of the research is to investigate the secondary emission of ions from surfaces
bombarded by MeV energy C60+ ions acting as projectiles. The secondary emissions
will be evaluated for potential in surface characterization. Experiments to
produce the C60+ beam will be carried out in the laboratory of the Brazilian
team using its Van de Graaf apparatus, with input on experimental design, time-
of-flight and coincidence counting technology provided by the U.S. group. Data
work-up and analysis would be primarily carried out at Texas A &amp; M. The
experiments will be run on four target materials: metallic (Au), ionic (CsI),
organic (phenylalanine and bimolecular (gramacidine). For comparison, the same
emissions with smaller equal velocity projectiles (C+, C6+, C10+) will be
studied. This project continues previous collaborative efforts between the two
groups that have resulted in 23 joint publications since 1984.
