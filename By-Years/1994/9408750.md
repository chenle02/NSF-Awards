Users of mobile computers, such as palmtops, notebook computers and personal
communications systems, will soon have online access to a large number of
databases via wireless networks. The potential market for this activity is
estimated to be billion of dollars annually, in access and communication charge.
For example, while on the road, passengers will access airline and other
carriers schedules, and weather information. Investors will access prices of
financial instruments, salespeople will access inventory data, callers will
access traffic information, and wearable ubiquitous computers will access a wide
variety of databases. Wireless communication is more expensive and less reliable
that wire communication. We demonstrate that the way online data is
allocated/replicated at mobile computers affect both, cost and data
availability, and therefore data allocations has to change according to changing
conditions, such as access patterns, users' location, etc. Presently, the
allocation scheme of a distributed database is established in a static fashion,
when the database is designed. The allocation scheme remains fixed until the
designer manually intervenes to change the number of replicas or their location.
We show that this is an unsatisfactory solution, particularly in mobile
computing.
