The Texas Learning Technology Group (TLTG) is attempting to develop, pilot and
implement a physical science curriculum, entitled the Interactive Videodisc
Physical Science Project. The outcome of this project, which incorporates the
latest developments in the use of advanced technology, will be a comprehensive
160-hour, two-semester science curriculum, applicable to schools nationwide. The
course will be targeted primarily for use with middle school students in the
eight and ninth grades where physical science is traditionally taught. However
it will be equally appropriate at the tenth grade level. The objective of this
effort is to develop a comprehensive physical science curriculum, which has a
technology-based delivery system using integrated computer, video, and audio
components, and improves learning by increasing the students's in-depth
understanding of physical science concepts and skills, by increasing student
interest in science, and by improving the ability of teachers to teach science.
The TLTG effort is the first national project to develop a complete curriculum
(including courseware, teacher resource guides, student manual, classroom
management system, and testing system) delivered primarily via interactive
videodisc. By utilizing interactive videodisc technology in a comprehensive
manner not previously explored to this extent, this project integrates a myriad
of sound instructional, technological approaches with proven effective
traditional modes of instruction. This project has attracted a significant
amount of contributions from private sources both in terms of cash and
equipment. It appears that the private sector is becoming more and more aware of
the need both to improve science instructional and to use new technologies to
better realize the improvements. If the project continues to be as effective as
the prototypes suggest, it will stand as a high quality model for adaptation by
schools across the country.
