Researchers have developed sophisticated reliability-based bridge rating
procedures to combat the severity of infrastructure condition. the objective of
this study is to develop a computer tool to transfer this bridge rating
technology to practicing engineers and to provide guidance on how to use this
technology. the computer-sided evaluation package would (1) aid the engineer in
making sound judgement for bridge modeling, (2) perform the various rating
analyses, (3) provide guidance through the rating process, and (4) interpret the
results of standard in microcomputer application user-interfaces. The analysis
routines will range from the simple standard AASHTO procedures to a full-system
inelastic limit state analysis. A contest-sensitive hypertext system will be
used to train and guide the engineer throughout the rating process. The impact
of the system could be enormous given the limited computational facilities of
most highway departments. It would be an efficient and rational tool to use to
evaluate the safety of the nation's bridges.
