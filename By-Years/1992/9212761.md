Support is requested for a two-year study of seed dispersal and seedling
establishment in abandoned pastures in the Chacocente Dry Forest Preserve in
southwest Nicaragua. The abundance, richness, diversity, species composition,
and other ecological traits of the seed rain, soil seed bank, seed germination,
and seedling and sapling assemblages in abandoned pastures will be evaluated
against the distribution of those characteristics in nearby intact forest.
Rarefaction and simulation techniques will be used to generate the appropriate
null distributions for the comparisons. Results of the proposed research will
(1) enhance our understanding of the natural constraints to dispersal and
establishment of forest species in abandoned pastures; (2) contribute to our
ability to predict patterns of regeneration based on source assemblages; and (3)
provide critical information required for efforts to accelerate or enrich the
restoration of tropical forest vegetation.
