Michael Bennett&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support is being provided for a
3-day national symposium "Cosmos in the Classroom 2004" held at Tufts University
in July 2004. The goals of the symposium are to synthesize research results on
effective science teaching, to illustrate how to use these results in developing
practical teaching strategies, and to disseminate resources for introductory
astronomy courses. The meeting is being organized to reach instructors of
astronomy at teaching-oriented institutions, especially community colleges,
historically black colleges and universities, urban liberal arts and state
colleges. The conference materials will be published and disseminated in a
handout collection and a special issue of Astronomy Education
Review.&lt;br/&gt;***
