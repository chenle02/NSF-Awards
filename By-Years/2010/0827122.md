The oxygen isotope composition of dissolved phosphate has the utility of tracing
sources of this nutrient in continental shelf and upper slope environments,
yield insights into remineralization mechanisms in the open ocean, and reveal
biological turnover rates of phosphate. However, currently only a few published
measurements are available. Inclusion of this parameter into the GEOTRACES
Program would significantly enhance the data set but requires that his component
be intercalibrated. For this reason, a scientist from the University of Chicago
plans to collect and analyze water samples for the oxygen isotope composition of
dissolved phosphate during the GEOTRACES intercalibration cruises to the
Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. Once the analyses are completed, a set of
recommendations on the best practices to obtain reliable measurements would be
made accessible to the ocean sciences community. In addition, the researcher
proposes to distribute samples and standards for the analysis of oxygen isotope
composition of dissolved phosphate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As regards broader
impacts, this intercalibration effort could represent a first step towards the
development of a new tracer for the ocean sciences community aimed at furthering
our understanding of the phosphorus cycle. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
