The project examine the use of vapor permeation for dehydration of organic
compounds or for separations of mixtures of organic compounds. An apparatus will
be built for studying vapor permeation mechanisms determine the effects of
several operating variables (feed composition, permeate and retentate pressures,
and temperature), and compare the method to pervaporation under comparable
conditions. Membrane materials include poly (vinyl alcohol) - poly
(acrylonitrile) composites. Separation of mixtures of isobutylene/water and
acetic acid water will be studied, because they are of scientific and
substantial industrial interest. The results should lead to development of
economic and energy saving separation technologies.
