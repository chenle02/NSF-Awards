the following areas: 1. Synthesis and DNA Binding Properties of
Polyintercalators. 2. Synthesis and Structural Studies of Fluorocarbon-Ligand
Complexes With Transition Metals. 3. Synthesis and Properties of Fluorocarbons.
4. Steriod Biosynthesis and Biochemistry 5. Synthesis of Marine Natural Products
and Reaction Development. 6. Chromium (VI) Interactions With DNA and Thoils. %%%
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to th chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interations between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies are useful in areas such as polymers and catlysis, and in biology.
