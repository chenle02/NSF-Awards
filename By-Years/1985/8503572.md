Little has been done in the area of three-dimensional analysis of slope
stability. This work will develop a general-purpose computer code for 3-D
analysis of, and stability charts for, slope stability cases. This method will
also be applicable to the design of confined dams, trenches, embankments, etc.
and to the assessment of their stability.
