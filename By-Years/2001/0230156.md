North Carolina State University (NCSU) and North Carolina Agricultural and
Technical&lt;br/&gt;State University (NC A&amp;T) are collaborating in
developing a program designed to&lt;br/&gt;increase the number of graduates in
science, technology, engineering and mathematics&lt;br/&gt;(STEM). Specific
program elements include a summer camp at NCSU for graduating&lt;br/&gt;high
school students who have not selected their majors, summer bridge programs at
both&lt;br/&gt;NCSU and NC A&amp;T designed to prepare new STEM students for
introductory college&lt;br/&gt;science and math courses, undergraduate research
programs at both schools, tutoring and&lt;br/&gt;mentoring of STEM majors and a
faculty exchange program between the two campuses.&lt;br/&gt;A comprehensive
monitoring program is included to track all students in the program
and&lt;br/&gt;to provide the data required to evaluate each program element.
Success in the program&lt;br/&gt;will result in an increase in the number of
STEM graduates, through both an increase in&lt;br/&gt;the number of entering
majors and an increase in retention.&lt;br/&gt;
