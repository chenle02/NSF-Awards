Mathematicians at the University of Illinois will investigate methods by which
the teaching of calculus can me made more effective in conveying to students and
understanding of calculus as a powerful problem solving tool. Course material
planning will focus on the development of the problem sets that will lead
students through the central ideas and methods of calculus and enhance their
ability to read and write mathematics. The project will consult with user
departments in science, engineering and other areas; develop and class test
course material for Calculus I based on an approach of Artin; focus on
computational and problem solving; and develop student's capacity to read and
write mathematics correctly and coherently. A weekly Calculus Seminar will train
teaching assistants and discuss content among faculty within and outside the
mathematics department. In the Summer of 1989, a Calculus Workshop for UI
faculty and high school teachers will be held. The integration of computer
technology with use of Mathematica software in the calculus curriculum will be
supported by outside funds.
