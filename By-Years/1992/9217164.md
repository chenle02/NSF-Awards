The satellite altimeters aboard the Geosat and ERS-1 spacecraft have mapped the
marine gravity field over nearly all of the world's oceans to a high accuracy.
The Geosat data south of 30 degrees south has recently been declassified. In the
wavelength band 15 to 150 km, variations in gravity anomaly are highly
correlated with seafloor topography. Since many southern ocean areas are
sparsely surveyed, these new Geosat data reveal many previously unsurveyed
features. The objectives of this project are to: (1) merge the Scripps satellite
altimeter processing system with the shipboard data processing system so these
data sets can be compared and correlated, (2) investigate three methods for
constructing inverse transfer functions for mapping dense satellite gravity onto
the sparse ship topography profiles, (3) extract regional variations in the
topography/gravity transfer function and relate them to tectonic provinces, (4)
use topography/transfer functions to interpolate seafloor topography between
sparse ship sounding, and (5) examine variations in topography/gravity transfer
function at spreading ridges with emphasis on the variation with spreading rate
and distance to ridge/transform intersection.
