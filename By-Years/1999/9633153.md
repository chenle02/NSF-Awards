9633153 Jackman Each year increasing numbers of young fathers spend time in
prison. This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement study will examine the meaning
and practice of fatherhood for these young men and explore how incarceration and
parole affect their understanding of fatherhood and their ability to fulfill
fatherhood responsibilities. Particular focus will be placed on the areas of
paternity establishment, child support, visitation, and in-kind support. The
study is also intended to explore variations in fathering patterns for different
groups of young parolees. It is expected that a number of factors, including
race and education, are important in explaining differences in fathering
attitudes and behaviors among parolees. The research questions will be
approached by examining attitudes and experiences of white, black and Latino
parolee fathers in the California Youth Authority System. To collect data from
the young men a multi-stage design will be employed. The stages will include
observations in parenting classes, a probability survey, and in-depth
interviews. The data generated by this multi-method design will be conducive to
both quantitative and qualitative analytic techniques. The information obtained
from this study will provide a broad understanding of fathering in a young
parolee population. **** ??
