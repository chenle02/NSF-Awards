The concept described herein is an advanced holographic diffractive structure
(HDS) for the control of light at the wavelength level. A stack of electrically
controllable, liquid- crystal filled diffraction gratings would present a
lightweight, clear panel, that, when placed in contact with an aperture shall be
able to concentrate sunlight very efficiently into a stable area in the center
of a light guide or fiber optic device. It shall be possible to selectively
bring into play only the grating appropriate for a particular sun angle and none
other, by applying an electric field (creating a "smart grating"). A series of
such concentrators will thus display active solar tracking without the
disadvantages associated with moving mechanical parts. An example of a highly
promising application of such a device is described within--holographic
collection and transport of sunlight to a multi-story building's "core" area.
Substituting sunlight for electric light will conserve a significant quantity of
energy, particularly during peak load conditions, while at the same time
delivering high quality illumination to the building's occupants. It is
anticipated that the control device described herein, could provide formidable
energy savings in the U.S. building sector by the year 2000.
