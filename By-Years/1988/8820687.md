This is a three-year continuing grant in the Research Opportunities for Women
Program, for support for the research of Professor Usha Mallik, University of
Iowa, Iowa City. Professor Mallik will perform studies of weak decays of charm
mesons using data from the Mark III detector at SLAC, and work on software
development for the ZEUS detector at the HERA collider in Hamburg, Germany. The
research done by Professor Mallik will provide new information on the
fundamental forces among elementary particles. The SLAC data studies will focus
on the weak forces between charm and other quarks, and the ZEUS experiment on
the electromagnetic and weak forces contributing to the structure of the proton.
