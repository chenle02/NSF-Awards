This proposal is directed at providing teachers with a direct "hands-on"
experience with field science. The program is designed to involve 180 teachers
in grades 5-8 in summer and academic year workshops on marine biology and
provide them with opportunities to engage in research emphasizing the use of
mathematics for problem solving in science. During the summer the teachers will
be involved in field experiences in biology and marine mammal science that will
expose them to data gathering and research methodology. Teachers will develop
knowledge and skills in hypothesis formation, data collection, and analysis. The
teachers will build on the summer experience during the academic year by being
involved in curriculum development and the development of computer simulations,
analysis programs and approaches and models which they adapt to classroom
situations to make science interesting and exciting for their students. The
approach is interdisciplinary emphasizing the use of mathematics in science.
