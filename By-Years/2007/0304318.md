Project Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The proposed research aims to
develop novel approaches for realizing polymer-based nanofluidic networks, and
apply these nanofabrication techniques to ultra-sensitive bioanalytical
instrumentation for single-molecule protein separations. Complex biological
samples such as tissues, tumors, serum, or cells can contain thousands of
proteins ranging from highly abundant proteins which perform common housekeeping
tasks, to extremely low abundance proteins which may be present in quantities as
small as a single molecule per cell. This NIRT project addresses the need for
high-resolution, high-sensitivity separation techniques which can sort ultra-low
molarities, down to the individual protein or peptide level, for identification.
successful completion of the project will result in new ultra-high-sensitivity
screening strategies for applications ranging from fundamental biological
studies to disease research and drug discovery. The proposed technology
platform, coupling nanochannel-based single molecule detection with integrated
sample manipulation, opens the potential for extraordinary reductions in sample
consumption for broad-scale protein analysis where the quantity of protein is
extremely limited, impacting industry-critical areas such as genomics,
proteomics, and drug discovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
