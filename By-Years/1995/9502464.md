The need to design, assemble, and manipulate synthetic models of the physical
world is common to many task domains in science, engineering, education, and
medicine. In robotics, attention has focused recently on modular robots and
modular robot tasks. A modular robot is one which is assembled from a predefined
set of parts. Typically, the set of parts is a small set; however, the space of
robots that can be built from the parts set is large. This research focuses on
creating powerful interactive virtual environments that will enable users to
modify, study, and experiment and interact with modular robots and modular robot
tasks. This research explores the creation of a software environment in which
one can take things apart and reassemble them (perhaps incorrectly!); design,
build and experiment with simulated physical mechanisms and objects; and in
general explore and manipulate the environment without being limited to some
small set of anticipated actions. A fundamental requirement for such an
environment is that it possess physical solidity -that is, objects in the
environment must be treated as impenetrable objects. Modeling physical solidity
in simulated environments is extremely difficult and as yet has only been dealt
with on a special-case basis. The research work in this project centers on
constructing and demonstrating virtual environments that model contact,
collision and friction in a general manner. Topics of concern are fast compute-
times, an extremely high level of reliability, and the ability to handle a
diversity of models and environments.
