Theoretical models and data analysis are to be used to study intragenic
recombination in bacteria, as well as other aspects of population dynamics that
can be inferred from statistical analysis of DNA sequences. A typical question
is (i) attempt to estimate the relative strength of classical genetic drift and
gene conversion as conservative forces in equilibrium allele distributions in
prokaryotes. Recently developed statistical techniques for analysing DNA
sequences have shown strong evidence for common between-strain gene conversion
involving segments of 300 base pairs or less in the bacterium Escherichia coli.
Other topics proposed are to (ii) study the statistical power and consistency of
these tests, (iii) develop statistical techniques for estimating the frequency
of this type of intragenic recombination with strains external to a sample.
