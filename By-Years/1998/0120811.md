The Semantic Web is a vision: the idea of having data on the Web defined and
linked in a way that it can be used by computers not just for display purposes,
but for automation, integration and reuse of data across various applications.
The goal of the International Semantic Web Working Symposium (SWWS) (July
30-August 1, Stanford, California) is to bring together researchers and
practitioners (1) to present the state-of-the-art in the development of the
Semantic Web; (2) to examine the research issues that relate to the different
components of what constitutes the Semantic Web technology; (3) to cross-
fertilize ideas on the development of Semantic Web information systems among
different domains. SWWS is both the first workshop on this topic in North
America and the first one sponsored or in corporation with three major funding
agencies from the U.S. and from Europe, namely NSF, DARPA, and the European
Commission. It also has strong ties with the W3C Semantic Web Activity. The
expected outcome of the workshop is a better common knowledge and synergy for
those wishing to develop new exciting basic technology and applications for the
Semantic Web. It should guide the future cooperation for enabling future
standards to be adopted worldwide. A written report will be produced following
the workshop, summarizing the main conclusions and research directions to
follow, which will be published at http://www.semanticweb.org/SWWS/. We expect
that this workshop and the follow-up report can serve as guidance for future
international collaboration in research projects on the Semantic Web topic.
