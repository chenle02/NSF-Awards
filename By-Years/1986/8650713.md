This project will introduce high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) into
the chemistry curriculum of Allegheny College. A significant instrument
acquisition program is near completion, and this project will bring the
institution one major step closer to that goal. This computer-controlled HPLC
system is suitable for both accurate analytical work and mixture separation.
Included are detectors that indicate the presence and quantities of virtually
all common chemical substances. The entire operation will be run from a data
system that can simultaneously direct the instrument through the specified
analysis routine and collect the data that result. It also has the capability to
retrieve and interpret data from previous experiments during the entire process.
As a primary objective, the HPLC will become an integral part of the
instrumental analysis course. In addition, student research will be aimed at the
development of better procedures for optimizing analytical conditions. Since
there was previously no HPLC equipment at the college, the project will, for the
first time, provide the opportunity for students in chemistry and other
departments of the natural sciences to use this very practical and versatile
technique.
