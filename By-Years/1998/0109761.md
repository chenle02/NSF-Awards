Linda Peteanu of the Carnegie Mellon University is supported by the Theoretical
and Computational Chemistry Program to study complex condensed molecular systems
using Stark spectroscopy. The ability to engineer complex molecular systems such
as polymers, dye-polymer complexes and aggregates to specific applications
depends on a thorough understanding of how their electronic properties are
impacted by their structure and the surrounding media. Stark spectroscopy can
address the magnitude of electronic changes in these systems. The PI will
continue investigations into these issues by studying cyanine dyes complexed
with DNA as well as conducting polymers. Moreover, she will add single molecule
techniques to overcome problems of heterogeneity in the Stark
measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optical responses of complex media such as
dye aggregates and conducting polymers are important to understand for advances
in sensors and nanotechnology.
