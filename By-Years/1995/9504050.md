9504050 Taylor The proposal training and research plan is intended to provide
the research associate with a through grounding in parallel computational
techniques. It is expected to yield innovative methods and software for applying
high performance, scalable architectures to large-scale problems in plasma
dynamics, fluid dynamics, rarefied gas dynamics, and electromagnetics. In the
proposed research, we are specifically interested in computing the plasma
backflow from multiple electric propulsion thruster configurations around
realistic spacecraft geometries. The primary goal is to develop a portable
computational tool that will enable spacecraft designers to accurately estimate
the backflow contamination from electric propulsion thrusters onto spacecraft.
Another goal of this research is to develop scalable implementation techniques
for existing numerical methods, and to validate these with experimental data.
