The central Sierra Nevada batholith, an Andean-type magmatic arc, was emplaced
in an overriding continental plate during the Cretaceous. Modern Andean studies
imply the plate should be under compressional stress produced by subduction,
however in the batholith only magmatic foliation is present and there is a
virtual absence of regionally developed solid-state foliation. Given the
compressional field thought to be active, these observations raise questions
concerning the dynamic field attending emplacement of the batholith. This
project will examine the geometry, kinematics and strain features of ductile
shear zones in the batholith and wall rocks to establish their role in the
dynamic and deformational history of batholith emplacement. Results are expected
to shed light on upper crustal stress fields accompanying plutonism and in the
fabrics developed in collisional tectonic environments.
