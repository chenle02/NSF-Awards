Network data and text data are frequently found in many different areas of
science and business (for example, social networks, genetic networks, news,
tweets, and blogs). A problem of great interest in statistics and machine
learning is how to extract information from network data and text data. The
research in this project will have several components: (a) collecting and
cleaning large-scale network data sets and text data sets, (b) developing new
models, methods, and theory for analyzing network data and text data, and (c)
analyzing a large data set, which the PI and collaborators have collected and
cleaned (the data set is on the publication data of statisticians). The research
will have an impact in social science, business, and especially in understanding
the publication patterns and trends of statisticians. The project also provides
training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.

Network data and text data are widely available and contain valuable information
for answering many scientific problems. This project will focus on network
analysis and text learning and will make contributions in the following topics:
(a) development of models for network and text data, (b) development of
computationally feasible approaches to network global testing, pairwise
comparison, dynamic network analysis, and text learning, and (c) development of
new approaches for studying the research patterns and trends of the statistical
community. The research will lead to new data sets and new methods and theory in
the application areas of social networks, genetic networks, and text mining, and
will have an impact in social science, business, and biology.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
