Abstract CTS-0109433 D. G. Cory, MIT

This proposal, based on Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), is at the forefront of
analysis of the structure and flow in porous material, with emphasis to
geophysical exploration. The method will significantly improve the effectiveness
of NMR to explore and characterize the structure and the dynamics of fluid
transport through the porous material by coherent averaging. The NMR signature
is separated in to an isotropic spectrum, a frequency modulation, and an
amplitude modulation. These components can report on the chemistry of the mobile
phase, the basic field variations, and the time/length scale correlation of the
solid phase and the mobility of the mobile phase.

The proposed work for next year is focused on the design philosophy for the NMR
coherent averaging scheme that suppress frequency modulations, extracting the
model independent metrics from the amplitude modulation term, and finally to
consider the inverse problem in these complex systems. This would be a
significant development at the forefront of this technology.

This work is in collaboration between university/industry (MIT and Schlumberger)
with a co-PI from each organization. The industrial partner is making
substantial contribution to the project including the time of the co-PI from the
industry.

BROADER IMPACT

The proposed project being at the forefront of NMR technology has broader impact
in two fronts. First, the program involves training graduate students with a
unique set of expertise. On a more general front, the method is applicable to
many industrial and biological processes including exploration of material with
insight that currently is not possible.

Since the proposed project is truly at the forefront of a major technology, and
the scope is limited to the major innovative aspects of the overall research
program, and the effective collaboration between the university and the
industrial partner, the revised project is recommended for funding as a GOALI
project.
