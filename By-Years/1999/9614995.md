Early Prehistoric Occupation of Southwestern Alaska This project analyzes
archeological data recovered from the late Pleistocene to early Holocene sires
in southwestern Alaska. The materials cover about 5000 years and four discrete
cultural traditions including Paleoindian, Paleoarctic, an intermediate
tradition, and Northern Archaic. The project focuses on the delineation of the
cultural traditions and their adaptive strategies reflected in the site
locations, types, and associated cultural assemblages. This work will provide
further insights into the movement of Asian peoples and cultures into North
America and illuminate the prehistory of Beringia.
