This research program emphasizes two different aspects of precision
measurements. In the first the approach of atom interferometry will be used to
determine atomic and molecular properties such as polarizabilities and to study
fundamental quantum phenomena such as Aharonov-Casher and Berry's phases.
Simultaneously, the potential use of atom interferometry in inertial sensing
will be explored, where there exists the possibility, because of its enhanced
sensitivity, that it could replace the laser gyroscope. In the second a new
approach to ultra-precision mass measurements will be further developed. This
technique will exploit the simultaneous determination of the cyclotron frequency
of two ions in a trap in order to remove errors in the mass measurements
associated with magnetic field determinations. Results of the research in both
areas have implications beyond the narrow area of AMO physics. Extremely precise
polarizability measurements for cesium will check atomic structure calculations
required for analyzing measurements of parity violation in the atom; extremely
precise measurements of the mass difference between 3H and 3He could help place
bounds on the mass of the neutrino.
