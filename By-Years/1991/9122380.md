This project continues to develop and apply Bayesian statistical methods to
important economic problems. Past work by the investigator yielded many powerful
analytical tools that are now widely used in almost every area of theoretical
and empirical research in economics. The current project emphasizes finding
explicit, reproducible procedures for producing models for observations,
information-processing rules for combining models and other information, and
procedures for evaluating alternative models using data. One contribution of
this new research comes from formalizing current practice in constructing
economic models and evaluating them in a way that is reproducible and
scientifically rigorous. Preliminary work with these methods shows that the
Bayesian approach can provide dramatically improved macroeconomic forecasts from
U.S. quarterly macroeconomic data and from European data. Improving the
scientific rigor and the empirical accuracy of economic forecasts is a goal of
the economics of global change initiative. For example, the methods being
developed by this project are being used to combine and evaluate the very
different forecasts from the four primary models of climate change. The main
objective of this project is to provide a unified Bayes- Maxent approach to
econometric inference and modeling problems and examine its performance in two
areas of application, macro- econometric modeling and forecasting and production
function analysis. In the Bayes-Maxent approach, models for observations and
their associated prior densities are derived as solutions to explicit,
constrained, optimization problems using entropy concepts. Further, information-
processing rules which combine prior densities and likelihood functions, for
example Bayes's Theorem, are also derived as solutions to constrained maxent
problems. Research to characterize further and extend the applicability of the
Bayes-Maxent approach are pursued.
