DMS-0314311 Paul Goerss

This award defrays travel costs for younger US-based participants to attend the
Applied Homotopy Theory Program at the University of Western Ontario in
September 2003. The program will consist of a one-week workshop for a large
range of paricipants and, for the remainder of the month, a series of mini-
courses to be given by five senior algebraic topologists from the US and Europe.
The support in this award will be used excusively to support the participation
of US based advanced graduate students, mathematicians in post-doctoral
positions, and a few selected tenure-track mathematicians. Further information
about the conference may be found at http://www.math.uwo.ca/homotopy/.
