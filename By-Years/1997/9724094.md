Smith 9724094 The development of a complex organism, such as a vertebrate, from
a fertilized egg is a multi-step process involving the coordinated actions of
thousands of genes. In elaboration of the adult form from the egg, mechanisms
involving both the segregation of cell fate determinants to specific regions of
the developing embryo, and inductive interactions, in which cells communicate to
determine the developmental fates of neighboring cells, are found. In this
project Dr. Smith will seek to isolate genes that act early in chordate
development and which are involved in determining the fates of specific tissues.
As a model chordate in these studies, he will use the ascidian Ciona
intestinalis. Ciona, which is one of the most primitive of the chordates, has
many advantages for study of early chordate development. While ascidians retain
the basic body plan common to chordates, they have a fixed lineage in early
development, they have very few cells at the larvae stage ((2,300), and they
have a genome that is only about 5% the size of a vertebrate. To identify genes
which are important for early development in Ciona, an expression cloning
strategy will be used. Plasmid cDNA libraries will be made from Ciona gastrula
stage embryos. In vitro transcripts from the libraries will be microinjected as
pools into 4-cell stage Xenopus embryos. Pools with activity will be identified
as those that bring about developmental changes to the Xenopus embryos. Single
cDNAs with activity will be isolated by sub-dividing the libraries into
progressively smaller pools. The identity of genes isolated by this method will
be determined by nucleotide sequencing, and the expression patterns will be
determined by in situ hybridization to staged Ciona embryos.
