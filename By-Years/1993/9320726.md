9320726 Cannell Technical abstract: This Condensed Matter Physics project used
light scattering and thermodynamic measurements to study the effectd of quenched
impurities on critical phenomena and phase separations in fluids containing two
components. The quenched impurities are gel structures of dilute rigid silica
networks. The large surface area of these networks influence the equilibrium and
non-equilibrium properties of fluids that are entrained in these gel structures.
The behavior of binary fluids in these gels are studied by static and dynamic
light scattering, as well as calorimetry. The combination of thermodynamic and
scattering measurements on controlled samples should add considerable to our
understanding of the effects of porous materials on liquid systems, as well as
to the broader issue of their effects on phase in other systems. Non-technical
abstract: This Condensed Matter Physics employs light scattering and
thermodynamic measurements to study the effects of quenched impurities on
critical phenomena and phase separations in fluids containing two components.
The quenched impurities are gel structures of dilute rigid silica networks. When
fluids fill the interstitices between the gel strands, their equilibrium and
non-equilibrium properties are modified by the large surface area of the gel
network. The behavior of binary fluids in these gels are studied by static and
dynamic light scattering, as well as calorimetry. The combination of
thermodynamic and scattering measurements on controlled samples should add
considerable to our understanding of the effects of porous materials on liquid
systems, as well as to the broader issue of their effects on phase in other
systems. For example, there are many instances in nature where fluids, such as
oil, are entrained in high surface are solids, such as shale. This fundamental
study may provide information relevant to these technologically important
systems. ***
