The main research objectives of this proposal are related to the field of high-
dimensional statistics such as sparse regression or low rank matrix estimation
problems which have recently attracted a lot of attention. The investigator
intends to develop new methodologies and novel applications and extend the scope
of applications for penalized empirical risk minimization, empirical processes
and exponential weights estimators. The investigator studies in particular the
minimax rates in the noisy matrix completion problem and intends to adapt
successful techniques from matrix completion problem to the covariance
estimation problem and determine the minimax rate for this problem under the low
rank assumption.

The theoretical results developed in this research project are expected to have
broader applications as well. The new research results can be applied in many
fields: econometrics, marketing, data mining, quantum physics, cosmology,
genomic, tomography, climatology and many other fields that require efficient
tools for exploring high-dimensional data sets. In particular, a question of
crucial interest in all these applications is to determine the set of active
variables among a huge set of potential candidates. In genomic, micro-array chip
contain the expression of thousands of genes and the goal is to find the few
genes responsible for the synthesis of a particular molecule among the entire
pool of tested genes. This difficult problem can be tackled efficiently through
the techniques studied in this research project.
