Oregon State University undergraduate students are using high performance liquid
chromatography in advanced analytical and organic chemistry courses. Students
are developing a series of HPLC separation schemes for the determination of
relevant substances, such as drugs and vitamins, in daily life samples, such as
food products and blood. These experiments illustrate the use of the technique
for the separation of organic compounds in realistic situations and provides
perspective about variations of the technique. The grantee is matching this
award from non-Federal sources.
