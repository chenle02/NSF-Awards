This project will measure the rotation curves of a large sample of disk galaxies
at relatively nearby redshifts, with the goal of characterizing the mass
distribution function and its evolution. Recent technical developments,
specifically Volume-Phase Holographic (VPH) spectrographs, make such kinematic
surveys feasible on telescopes such as the Wyoming 2.3-meter. This project is
based at the University of Wyoming and involves the team responsible for the new
spectrograph, and can therefore obtain the necessary large amounts of telescope
time required for this survey. The research will take three approaches:
comparison of the Tully-Fisher relation (an empirical correlation between
luminosity and rotation curve amplitude) for intermediate (S0) and late-type
galaxies, detailed velocity curves to constrain mass as a function of radius,
and use of the circular velocity distribution function to characterize the mass
function.

In addition, the development of VPH spectrographs presents new educational
opportunities for small telescope users. This study will evaluate this
educational potential by designing and building a suitable example instrument,
with the secondary goals of enhancing teaching and hands-on undergraduate
experience, and of introducing amateur astronomers to the possibilities of
astronomical spectroscopy. This may lead to significant contributions to several
fields of research.
