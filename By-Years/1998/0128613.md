This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
the commercial feasibility of conducting polymer muscle-like actuators as active
elements in prosthetics, pumps and automatic valves. Rigorous characterization
has been performed, demonstrating the active stress, strain, power to mass and
efficiency of actuators in which the active element is a thin film of the
conducting polymer polypyrrole. Studies show that polypyrrole actuators generate
up to 100 times the force per cross-sectional area of mammalian skeletal muscle,
and up to 10 times the work per stroke. Conducting polymers convert electrical
energy to mechanical work at low applied voltages (typically 1 V), and increase
in speed as the film thickness is reduced, making them ideal for micro and
nanoscale applications such as micro-pumping and fluid switching.

The commercial potential will be for polymer driven artificial urinary
sphincters and low cost automatic irrigation valves. Later applications include
incorporation into micro and nano-devices.
