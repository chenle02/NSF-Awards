An alternative method of coping with situations in which conventional explosives
cannot be used for rock blastings, is the use of highly expansive cements and
mortars. This study will identify the appropriate method or methods of testing
for the physical properties of expansive cements. The testings procedure
selected will be used to measure the expansive stresses generated by some
typical expansive cements.
