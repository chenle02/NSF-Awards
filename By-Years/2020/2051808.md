The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase II project will be to
empower and educate caregivers to make scientifically guided decisions that
enable safer and optimally nurturing sleep environments for infants. Every year
more than 130 million babies are born and over 4 million of those are born in
the U.S. Due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), 300 babies every month may
not live to see their first birthday. SIDS remains the leading cause of death
for babies aged one month to one year. Infant mortality rates in the U.S. are
higher than in the 20 wealthiest nations. Innogized Technologies has developed a
transformative Internet of Things technology (IoT) that combines hardware and
analytics to enable caregivers to make better sleep-time decisions, avoiding
overheating, a known stressor for SIDS. The technology guides caregivers to
deliver optimal conditions for safe, regenerative and developmental growth for
their infants anywhere and anytime, while at the same time relieving anxiety.
This technology is poised to immediately capture a sizable portion of the
rapidly growing $1 billion US baby monitoring solutions
market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase II project will support the development of a novel consumer product that
works with caregivers to proactively mitigate the risk of under/overheating
events in newborns. Sleep-time clothing choices are thermodynamically matched
with environmental conditions to create baby-specific safe sleep environments.
The temperatures are maintained by leveraging the inherent connectivity of the
IoT platform. The technology integrates thermal resistance measurements, thermal
models and maps, advanced algorithms, and predictive monitoring. The research
objectives of the project tackle the most important remaining technical
challenges driving towards successful commercialization and adoption of a
product that is essentially an intelligent system, capable of understanding
context and tracking and managing complex interactions while anticipating
requirements. The technical product of this research will advance caregiver
knowledge and increase understanding of the applied thermodynamics leading to
the advantageous state of thermoneutrality as well as increase infant
wellbeing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
