This work aims to control quantum mechanical waves of electrons in space and
time. Quantum mechanics is one the major discoveries of the last century and is
now in the process of being developed into many areas of industry. Applications
range from lasers and the global positioning system to nanotechnology. The
technology the group is developing is aimed at constructing the largest electron
interferometer in the world and the fastest electron switches ever made, which
will give control of electron quantum mechanical waves. This control deepens our
understanding of Quantum mechanics, and allows for the development of new
applications.

A training ground for graduate and undergraduate students will continue to be
provided in an area of national need. High school students are reached by the
distribution of a Â½ hour movie on quantum waves (distribution exceeds 10,000
copies). Electromagnetic field sensing (with the interferometer) and ultrafast
time resolved electron microscopy (with fast electron switches) are explored and
have potential for industrial application.
