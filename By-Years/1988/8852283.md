The students' basic understanding of molecular emission phenomena and the
measurement applications which contribute to knowledge of excited states and
energy transitions is being improved. Through the use of a computer-controlled
luminescence spectrophotometer and a stopped-flow accessory, new experiments are
being incorporated in organic, biochemistry, and physical/analytical
laboratories for both majors and non-majors. Students in lower and upper
division courses are having an enhanced experience with fundamental principles
of excitation- emission, chemiluminescence, intermolecular energy transfer,
excited- state lifetimes, and analytical applications of luminescence in
elucidating biochemical reactions. The undergraduate research program is also
being facilitated, as well as a secondary school chemistry teacher's Staff
Development Program under the auspices of a grant from the Georgia States
Department of Education. The entire project is promoting a significant advance
in unifying concepts related to structure and energy transitions. The grantee is
matching the award from non-Federal sources.
