The interaction of theory and practice is of critical importance for
understanding the relationship of science to society. Ms. Sarah Lowengard, under
the direction of Dr. Garber, is undertaking doctoral dissertation research that
examines the relationship between color production techniques and ideas about
the nature of color in chemistry and physics. Their relationship becomes obvious
when color-making practices (dyestuff- pigment- and glaze-making) are examined
together with theoretical explanations for color. Transfer of information about
practices and about theories was constant and multi-directional, reflecting
typical styles of social and intellectual exchange. To understand these
connections, Ms. Lowengard is uniting the disparate groups of theorists,
practitioners and entrepreneurs in, what she calls for her research purposes,
the "color industry." She is especially examining the search for new colors and
new techniques to produce colors. This dissertation aims to show the way
information transfer in the color industry enhanced its crafts and altered its
theories. It will provide a model to understand these and similar intellectual
and practical interactions.
