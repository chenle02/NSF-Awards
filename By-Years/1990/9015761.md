Dr. Reiter plans to study the mechanisms involved in the regulation of pineal
melatonin production during the long nights (short days) in the rat and the
hamster. The relative contribution of the different neurotransmitter systems as
well as different components of the same system may vary from species to species
and also from long day to short day conditions. Investigation of mechanisms
underlying sustained synthesis and secretion of melatonin will significantly
enhance the understanding of melatonin's role in mammalian physiology.//
