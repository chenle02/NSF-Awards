This is an international travel grant to cover travel expenses for 20 speakers
and organizers for the 5th Jerusalem Conference on Information Technology. This
Conference in cooperation with the Associations for Computing Machinery (ACM),
will be held in Jerusalem, Israel from October 22 to 25, 1990. The JCIT, held
periodically since 1971, is a major international conference. It attracts a
broad audience of computer scientist, engineers, practitioners, users and
managers. The Conference is sponsored by the Information Processing Association
of Israel and the IEEE Computer Society Brenabin Israel. Like its four
predecessors in 1971, 1974, 1978 and 1984, the 5th JCIT will cover a broad range
of topics with emphasis on the technologies of the 90's. The goals of the JCIT
are to provide a broad-based forum for the presentation of achievements and
innovative ideas in the various areas of information technology. The conference
provides an interdisciplinary environment for computer scientists, engineers,
practitioners, users and managers to exchange views and ideas, and to discuss
their likely impact on information systems of the next decade. Participants also
have the opportunity to become acquainted with the achievements of Israel as a
fast developing country in the computer and related fields and to meet
colleagues in Israel. To this end, JCIT-5 will be held in conjunction with the
25th National Conference of the Israeli Systems Analyst Association. The
Conference will also display new trends in information technology by means of an
extensive exhibit of computer hardware and software products. More than 40
countries have been represented at the previous conferences and an even larger
participation is expected at JCIT-5. An attendance of over 3,000 from Israel and
600 from abroad is anticipated.
