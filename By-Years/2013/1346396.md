This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project seeks to
develop a novel, intelligent device for automation of gait training in the
neurological patient population undergoing physical therapy and rehabilitation.
The objective of this project is the creation of a physically simple robotic
system, which uses a sophisticated control system to intelligently cooperate
with the physical therapist administering gait training, to partially automate
the process. The development of this system may lead to the creation of a new
paradigm in gait training and physical therapy. This device will have the
potential to greatly enhance the abilities of physical therapists to administer
intensive gait retraining, and this in turn may lead to improved mobility in
hundreds of thousands of patients every year. The existing technological
solutions to automation of gait training are overly complex and costly, with
very low market penetration, and as a result few patients benefit from them.
During this project, the feasibility of creating an inexpensive device which
will cooperate with the physical therapists in gait training will be
demonstrated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of
this project stems from the possibility of enhancing both the economics and the
outcomes of gait training. Current gait rehabilitation methods rely on manual
labor. Therapy is often administered by 2 or 3 PTs at the same time, which is
very costly. Our proposed product will make it more cost-effective to treat
patients with a variety of neurological disorders, including some 350,000 stroke
patients who could benefit from gait therapy every year. We estimate the size of
the addressable market for the proposed product to be about $36 million, but
this device may also lead do the development of simple robotic consumer products
in the future.
