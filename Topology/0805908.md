Abstract

Award: DMS-0805908 Principal Investigator: Genevieve S. Walsh

Two n-manifolds are commensurable if they have homeomorphic finite-sheeted
covers. This notion is particularly useful for 3-manifolds. For 3-manifolds
which admit a geometry, commensurability respects this geometry. In light of the
recent proof of geometrization for 3-manifolds, classification into
commensurability classes is a refinement of the classification of 3-manifolds by
which geometry they admit. This applies to 3-manifolds which have been
decomposed along 2-spheres and 2-tori. Questions concerning virtual properties
of $3$-manifolds, such as if a 3-manifold is virtually Haken or virtually
fibered, are also questions about its commensurability class. Commensurability
also respects certain number-theoretic properties of 3-manifolds. A
classification of hyperbolic 3-manifolds up to commensurability would be very
useful for the field. A first step towards understanding commensurability
classes of hyperbolic 3-manifolds is understanding commensurability classes of
hyperbolic knot complements. The PI proposes to work on the conjecture that
there are at most 3 hyperbolic knot complements in a given commensurability
class, and to understand how these commensurabilities can occur.
Commensurability is also a useful equivalence relation on hyperbolic surfaces,
with the definition that two hyperbolic 2-manifolds are commensurable if they
have isometric finite-sheeted covers. The PI proposes to further develop this
theory, in particular to understand commensurability classes of surfaces with
large symmetry groups.

3-manifolds are spaces which locally look like a 3-dimensional ball. In
particular, our universe is a 3-manifold and we do not know which one it is. A
deeper understanding of commensurabilities amongst 3-manifolds would
significantly refine geometrization for 3-manifolds. Knot complements are a
naturally occurring class of 3-manifolds, and thus good candidates for study.
2-manifolds, or surfaces, are spaces which locally look like a 2-dimensional
disc. Hyperbolic surfaces are the most common type of surface and are used in an
extremely wide variety of scientific contexts. The study of symmetry and
commensurability is very useful for these surfaces. The PI regularly speaks on
her work to diverse audiences. Any results from this research will be described
in research seminars, posted on the arXiv, and broadly distributed.
