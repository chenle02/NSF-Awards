One of the most valuable underutilized resources in strengthening school
science programs is the pool of physics knowledge, laboratory equipment and
technical expertise resident at neighboring colleges. This project aims to
increase the numbers of students studying physics and the quality of the
instruction they receive by increasing the physics knowledge and teaching
resources shared between school and college instructors. This sharing will be
supported by the formation of local alliances among secondary school
physics/physical science teachers and college physics instructors. The American
Physical Society will sponsor regional workshops for school and college
instructors who wish to form such alliances. The project will then provide
experienced advice and support to newly forming alliances, and will link
collaboratives together through an alliance newsletter and other publications.
