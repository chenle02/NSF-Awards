Igor Vasiliev of New Mexico State University is supported by an award from the
Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program for research
focusing on theoretical characterization of functionalized carbon
nanostructures. Prof. Vasiliev and his students will develop and apply state-of-
the-art density functional and time-dependent density functional computational
methodologies to study the mechanism of chemical functionalization of graphene
and carbon nanotubes. The main objective of the proposed research is to
investigate the relationship between the structural and electronic
characteristics of carbon nanostructures and their reactivity toward organic and
inorganic molecules and functional groups. This research will lead to a better
understanding of the process of self-assembly of molecules and functional groups
on the surface of graphene and carbon nanotubes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research will be beneficial for the development of experimental techniques that
could be used for selective chemical functionalization of carbon nanostructures.
The unique properties of carbon nanostructures such as graphene nanoribbons and
carbon nanotubes make them promising candidates for a wide range of
technological applications, including chemical sensors, fuel cells, photovoltaic
cells, light emitting devices, nanoelectronics, and spintronics. The majority of
these applications require the use of carbon nanostructures with very specific
electronic and optical characteristics. The proposed theoretical study will
analyze the possibility of using chemical functionalization as a method for
separating different types of carbon nanostructures by selectively removing
unwanted structures after synthesis.
