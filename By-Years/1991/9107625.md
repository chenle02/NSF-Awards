The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary research project under the Hungary
Joint Fund between Dr. Donald Elston, U.S. Geological Survey and Dr. Miklos
Lantos, Hungarian Geological Institute is to investigate short events of the
geomagnetic field based on magnetostratigraphic sections from the Pannonian
Basin. The work will involve the analysis, systematization, correlation and
documentation of all fine-scale characteristics of the sections which would
result in an improved, high-resolution polarity zonation for the late- Miocene
and a better understanding of polarity reversals. These studies will improve our
understanding of geomagnetic field behavior. This project in rock magnetic
analysis fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by
enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine
complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence.
