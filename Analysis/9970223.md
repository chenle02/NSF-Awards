Abstract Dadarlat

The investigator aims at developing techniques of K-theory and local
approximation suitable for the classification theory of nuclear C*-algebras. In
particular, the investigator will explore new models for the KK-groups of
Kasparov. On the analytical side he would focus on local approximation
properties such as quasidiagonality and its refinements. The basic idea beyond
the classification program is that that the simplicity and other nonstable
K-theory conditions for a nuclear C*-algebra translate to certain internal
dynamical properties of the algebra. In their turn, these properties lead to
surprising rigidity phenomena where an algebra is completely determined by its
homotopy type or even by its K-theory groups.

C*-algebras can be thought as collections of infinite matrices of numbers
displaying a rich algebraic and topological structure. The C*-algebra theory is
the standard framework for quantum mechanics. It offers functional analytic ways
of expressing and analysing fundamental noncommutative aspects of the symmetries
of the physical world. The proposed research will attempt to uncover and explain
rigidity properties of nuclear C*-algebras. This theory has deep ramifications
in dynamical systems and geometric theory of groups.
