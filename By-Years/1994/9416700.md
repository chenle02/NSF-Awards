The investigators propose to analyze a data set obtained in 1993 from the ALOHA
portion of the ALOHA/ANLC (Airborne Noctilucent Cloud Campaign). This data was
taken by the Michelson Interferometer (MI) aboard the NCAR aircraft. The goals
of this analysis are: (1) to identify large-scale structures present in the OH
radiance and temperature, and correlate them with the presence/absence of the
Quasi-Monochromatic Events (QME) seen in the on-board airglow imager; (2) to
perform a power spectral density analysis of the OH radiance and temperature in
both the presence and absence of the QME seen in the on-board imager; and (3) to
correlate these results with the vertical structures seen in the sodium lidar.
