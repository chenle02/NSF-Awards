RUI: Forest Canopy Databases and Database Tools -- Branching Out to Ecological
Synthesis Evergreen State College has been awarded a grant to continue
development and greatly expand a suite of tools for integration, visualization
and manipulation of forest canopy data facilitating structure-function research
and synthesis. The informatics component is integrated with field studies in a
relationship that will facilitate studies that would not have been possible
without the advanced informatics and hat will provide testing and validation as
the informatics evolve. A basic concept of the informatics development is to
generate tools for sophisticated end-user modular programming with a minimal
learning curve. The educational part of the project is integrated with well
developed educational efforts at all levels from K12 through graduate programs.
Community involvement and distribution is facilitated by collaboration with the
LTER information management network and NCEAS.
