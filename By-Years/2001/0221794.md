This rural sociology Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant examines the beef
livestock sector, which has remained small scale and decentralized relative to
that of the poultry and hog industries. The research seeks to increase our
understanding of adaptations that allow family-owned businesses to compete in a
restructuring industry. More generally, the co-PI will address the question of
whether the persistence of small-scale beef production derive from capacity to
remain competitive or reflect "resistance" to dominant trends in society. The
project combines quantitative and qualitative research. Government statistics
from the US Department of Agriculture, Census of Agriculture and American Meat
Institute will be integrated to determine direction and forces of structural
change in beef production. Approximately thirty in-depth structured interviews
will be conducted with farmers in three regions of the US, and other key
informants (typically persons at other stages of the beef commodity chain,
including input and service suppliers, processors, and retailers). These will
provide information on the dynamics of structural change and household decision-
making.
