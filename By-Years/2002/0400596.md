This proposal has been approved for (1) building and equipping a low-
radioactivity 10 kg (fiducial) volume prototype liquid xenon detector and (2)
testing this aforementioned detector in an underground laboratory to ascertain
the energy threshold sensitivity, beta and nuclear collision separation
capability, long-term stability, and ultimately the dark matter flux.
