This proposal is to fund travel to a workshop in San Francisco, March 12-13,
2001, on the subject of digital preservation and digital archiving. The workshop
will identify and stimulate pilot projects in the collectin and use of born-
digital information, build agreement on guidelines for servicing and use of
born-digital material, and write a white paper on the role of born-digital
resources in research libraries, including an outline of next steps and
identification of the individuals and organizations that could take them. It
will improve our understanding of how to use digital information for long-term
societal benefit.
