A major effort in fisheries ecology has been to develop biochemical tools for
quantifying instantaneous growth rate and the nutritional dynamics of recruiting
fish larvae juveniles. Recent studies have lead to a succession of innovative
techniques. Due to problems of interpretation with these methods, current trend
in recruitment studies is to use combination of biochemical, histological, and
morphometric techniques. Thus, what is needed is a truly specific biochemical
indicator of the actual rate of cell growth at any point in time. Recent
advances in the biochemical regulation of the cell cycle indicate that a protein
kinase, Mitosis Promoting Factor (MPF), acts as the "master oscillator" of the
cell cycle. Measurement of MPF activity suggest that MPF has tremendous
potential as a highly specific measure of cellular proliferation and growth. To
test this idea, DiMichele will develop analytical techniques, verify the
proportion of cells committed to mitosis in asynchronous cell populations, and
fit the theoretical model to known whole animal growth rates in the red drum,
Sciaenops ocellatus. If the model is verified, the biochemical measurement of
MPF will have a tremendous potential as a specific measure of instantaneous
growth and cellular proliferation in heterogeneous populations.
