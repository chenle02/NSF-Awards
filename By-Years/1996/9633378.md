A new type of water and geochemical flux meter will be developed and tested to
measure the chemical parameters and flow rates of fluids that seep from the
seafloor into the water column. These measurements address a key component of
geochemical and hydro-tectonic studies in both convergent and divergent margins
on the seafloor. Accurate determination of the magnitudes and spatial
distribution of flux rates of fluid/geochemical components in the system are
critical to these geophysical process studies. Instrumentation will be designed
to quantify output fluxes (i.e., diffusive and focused) by collecting fluid
samples and measuring Darcy fluid velocities through the sediment surface on the
order of 0.1 to 100 mm y-1, allowing direct measurements to be attempted for the
first time at low flux-rate vents and regions of slow diffuse flow. Funds are
also provided to replace several NSF-sponsored instruments that were recently
lost at sea during an NSF-funded expedition. Scripps Institution of Oceanography
is providing $165,000 in cost sharing, which represents 30% of the total
project's cost.
