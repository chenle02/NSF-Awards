This research involves theoretical and applied research on learning and
representation of high-&lt;br/&gt;dimensional data. The term high dimensionality
refers to the property that the number of variables&lt;br/&gt;or ?unknowns? is
typically much larger than the number of observations available at hand. A
key&lt;br/&gt;challenge is being able to represent and learn such phenomena with
sample and computational&lt;br/&gt;requirements scaling favorably in the number
of dimensions. This project addresses these challenges&lt;br/&gt;through a
graphical approach by exploiting the inherent graphical structure present in
many large&lt;br/&gt;data-sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research considers
modeling high-dimensional data through probabilistic graphical
models,&lt;br/&gt;also known as Markov random fields. An important research
thrust of this proposal is to develop&lt;br/&gt;novel algorithms for learning
and inference under the framework of graphical models.
Another&lt;br/&gt;important thrust of this proposal is to develop efficient
scalable models for representing high-&lt;br/&gt;dimensional data beyond the
traditional framework of graphical models. This research
establishes&lt;br/&gt;strong theoretical guarantees for the developed methods,
as well as applies them to real data in&lt;br/&gt;various domains, including
genetic and financial data, and data from large online social
networks&lt;br/&gt;such as Facebook and Twitter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
