The PI requests support to provide a summer research experience for 15 minority
and women scientists at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. These NSF-
funded students will be in addition to ten other students funded by SIO that are
part of the summer research program. Summer students will work for 10 weeks with
a faculty mentor from SIO on research projects in one of the marine science
disciplines. Students will also attend various workshops and seminars during the
course of the summer, both on scientific issues and professional development.
