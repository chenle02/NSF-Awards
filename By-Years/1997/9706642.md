9706642 Lee The First IEEE/ASME Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics Conference
will be held at Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan, in June 16-20, 1997. It is
jointly organized by the Industrial Electronics Society and the Robotics and
Automation Society of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and
the Dynamic Systems and Control Division of the American Society of Mechanical
Engineers. The conference is aimed to provide a forum for researchers to meet
and discuss the latest developments in mechatronics, a synergistic integration
of mechanical engineering with electronics and intelligent computer control in
the design and manufacture of products and processes. The theme of this first
conference is Imformatics and Communication in Advanced Intelligent
Mechatronics. This conference is the first of its kind and is important to the
future advances in the knowledge creation in mechatronics with many practical
applications. ***
