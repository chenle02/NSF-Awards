The PIs will determine whether the observed quasi-decadal oscillation (QDO) in
ozone is a result of interannual changes in dynamical transport of ozone
resulting from the observed QDO in stratospheric circulation. This would help
develop a self-consistent theoretical model of the QDO. Using a series of
updated data records, they will first determine the QDO in stratospheric ozone,
temperature, geopotential height, and zonal wind. They will apply
observationally derived regression coefficients for vertical/meridional
temperature gradients and geopotential heights to construct zonal wind and
temperature gradient anomalies for each phase of the quasi-biennial oscillation
(QBO) and QDO. Then, they will modify the NCAR two-dimensional chemical
transport model for zonal mean circulation and temperature gradient field
specification for each month and phase of the QBO and QDO. Resulting mean
meridional circulation and ozone distributions will be calculated as a function
of month, latitude and pressure level. Finally, the differences between
calculated ozone distributions will produce an effective model-predicted ozone
QDO's construction for comparison to observed ozone QDO.
