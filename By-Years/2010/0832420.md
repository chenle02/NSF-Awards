The University of Louisiana at Lafayette (UL Lafayette) seeks to partner with
Oregon State University and form a new NSF Industry/University Cooperative
Research Center (I/UCRC) for Visual Decision Informatics. The focus of this
consortium will be to develop new visual and analytic methods that leverage
modern computer hardware and software, and develop analysis and discovery tools
that can be applied to this complex data-based decision-making process. The
potential robustness of the approach utilizing highly immersive environments
with flexible and real-time manipulation of large amounts of data has the
potential to make breakthroughs in a variety of fields.

The proposed I/UCRC will provide a series of services complementary to other
education, research and technology transfer units. It will provide students and
faculty a platform to conduct industry-relevant research and gain valuable
practical experience that otherwise cannot be gained from textbooks and research
publications. The proposed center will recruit women and minorities through its
ongoing outreach programs and through promotions with historically black
colleges and universities in the region. The proposed center will also promote,
catalyze and accelerate the commercialization of technology innovations.
