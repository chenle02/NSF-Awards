The New Mexico Museum of Natural History is developing a large format film on
the Pantanal in Brazil, the world's largest wetland. The film will focus on the
Hyacinth Macaw, an indicator species whose health reflects the health of the
entire ecosystem, and will explore the relationship between the climate,
geology, hydrology and ecology of the region. It also will examine three threats
to the region: a large scale river channeling project which would drain 50% of
the marsh, gold mining activities that dump millions of tons of sediment into
streams, and large-scale corporate farming which pollutes the region with
pesticide and fertilizer run-off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Science content for the
series will be under the direction of Dr. Richard Smartt, former Director of the
New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science. The series will be co-produced
by Timothy Aydelott, from the museum, and Constance Bennecke, an independent
producer in Brazil. Barrie Howells will be executive producer and Rodney Taylor
will be director of photography. Both Mr. Howells and Mr. Taylor have extensive
large format film experience. Ralph Adler of RMC Research will conduct audience
research during the planning phase&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major activities
during the planning stage include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conducting audience
research to determine the familiarity of the public with the ecosystem and with
the concepts to be presented in the film. In addition to topic testing, the
research will assess the audience's current knowledge or misconceptions about
wetland ecosystems and the Pantanal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Convening the project
advisors to develop the science content, finalize content goals, and to suggest
ideas and strategies for presenting the science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attending
a regional planning conference in the Pantanal to establish working
relationships with scientists in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developing a
script treatment for the film.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
