The long lifetime of Xe polarization and its strong solubility in blood combine
to allow the use of polarized Xe for diagnostic imaging of parts of the human
body. In conventional biological MRI, magnetic resonance signals are produced by
weakly polarized proton spins found in biological tissues. Proton spins are
weakly polarized by large magnetic fields. What is needed for higher contrast
and better specificity in biological MRI and spectroscopy is a benign substance
that can quickly enter tissues of interest, provide magnetic resonance signals
that are sensitive to the local physical and chemical environment, and then
leave the body. This proposals is for work on investigations of MRI enhanced by
the use of optically polarized 129Xe or 3He to follow on promising suggestions
that laser polarized Xe will provide just such a substance. The proposal is an
SGER request for the production of polarized atoms followed by the study of
invitro tissue samples and small mammal models. The study will be extended to
humans after the SGER grant is ended.
