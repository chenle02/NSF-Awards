This proposal concerns extending forms of the negation as failure feature of
pure Prolog to broader contexts, particularly, but not exclusively, what is
often called generalized logic programming, or, simply, logic programming. The
proposed project has two goals: The first goal is to extend common and
wellfounded, semantics. The goal for logic programming is to find a semantics
which also handles other common patterns of inference. The first goal for
extensions is to find analogous negation-as-failure semantics. The second goal
is (for finite databases) to compute the data complexity and (for infinite
models) to determine the degree of non- recursiveness of the semantics, and to
find (1) good polynomial-time or recursive approximations to the semantics and
(2) general circumstance when the semantics are polynomial- time or recursive.
