This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;his effort seeks to develop a better
understanding of how the nonlinearly coupled thermosphere and ionosphere are
driven asymmetrically in polar storm events, and how coupling between these
domains affects overall system-level response. Goals of the project are to a)
specify electrodynamic drivers in the northern and southern hemispheres during
specific storms with newly available Antarctic data, b) investigate how the
hemispherically asymmetric magnetic field configuration controls system-level
response to strong driving, c) examine the hemispheric asymmetric energy and
momentum transfer between the ionosphere and thermosphere and how these
processes affect the global response to different driving conditions, and d)
understand how the polar thermospheric background and disturbance neutral winds
asymmetrically develop under different driving conditions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along with furtherance of space-weather objectives, the
training of graduate students provides the broader impact to this proposed
research grounding this effort in an educational mission.
