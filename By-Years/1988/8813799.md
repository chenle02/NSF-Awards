The interactions between simple charged particles and atoms will be examined
within the framework of a perturbation series approach. A first and fundamental
question concerns the rate of convergence of perturbation series and whether it
is in practice possible to calculate accurate theoretical cross sections. The
second aspect of the work will involve the application of these techniques to
specific problems of current interest, including electron excitation of sodium,
elastic positron scattering, electron impact ionization, and simultaneous
electron-photon excitation. Second order amplitudes are evaluated with the
method of Dalgarno and Lewis; the question is whether a particular choice for
the distorted Green's function can be found which will optimize the rate of
convergence of perturbation series.
