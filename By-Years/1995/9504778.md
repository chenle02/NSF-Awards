DMS-9504778 PI: McGovern McGovern will study double cells of Harish-Chandra
modules for real classical groups, seeking to understand them simultaneously as
sets and modules for the complex Weyl group. The main tool to be used is
Garfinkle's standard domino tableaux. The main objective is show that every real
cell is isomorphic as a based module to a complex cell. This implies that any
graded Jacquet functor can be realized as a composition of wall-crossing
operators which are easy to compute/ The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of
the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in
twentieth century mathematics. As the mathematical vehicle for exploiting the
symmetries inherent in a system, the representation theory of Lie groups has had
a profound impact upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number
theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum mechanics and
elementary particle physics.
