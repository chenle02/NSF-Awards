This project will enhance knowledge of landscape response in coastal floodplains
to extreme rainfall events, which could aid coastal communities to better
prepare for flood hazards. This project will also provide: an opportunity to
further advance the career of a Native American scientist; research experience
for a Hispanic female technician; and quality educational opportunities for
undergraduate students. Reporting of the project results at the Society for
Advancing Chicanos/Hispanics & Native Americans in Science (SACNAS)
undergraduate research conferences will attract underrepresented groups to
pursue careers in geoscience.

This project will examine the landscape and hydrological response of the Santee
River Floodplain to an extreme rainfall event that occurred between October 3-5,
2015, in South Carolina (two-day rainfall totals up to 400 mm on the coastal
plain, 300 mm in the piedmont, and 250 mm in the upstate). The team will collect
perishable data from coastal floodplains, develop scientific criteria for
locating sampling sites, and enhance hydrodynamic modeling capabilities with
potential broad applications in coastal floodplain landscapes.
