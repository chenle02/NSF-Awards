The Geometry of Multivariable Calculus strengthens the multidimensional
geometric intuition that students need, but usually lack, to understand
multivariable calculus. To this end, community college and university
instructors participating in week-long workshops are designing geometric
worksheets ready for use in existing courses ranging from elementary to advanced
multivariable calculus to linear algebra. Workshops are taking place in Seattle
and Spokane, with subsequent follow-up activities during the academic year.
Introduced at the level of undergraduate courses, topics include splines in 1993
and differentials in 1994, with applications to aircraft design, computers,
geographic maps, industrial engineering, orbital mechanics, and typography.
Applications come from advance mailings, guest lecturers, and demonstrations of
computational geometry from the Applied Geometry Corporation and the Boeing
Company.
