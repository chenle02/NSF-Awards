This proposal research is accommodation of a dual-beam focused ion beam (FIB)
system for "milling" nanostructures is part of that initiative. Our broad goal
is to develop a research competence and workforce trained in combining
fabricated nanostructures with designer molecules. Examples of proposed
molecule-based nanostructures are nanoscale electrode gaps for molecular
electronics, nanofluidic enclosures for single molecule optics, probes for
single-molecule electrochemistry, molecule-based sensor devices, nanoscale
dielectrophoretic traps and sorters for nucleic acids and proteins, and
nanostructured intelligent molecular coatings. Other applications of the FIB
include prototyping novel device architectures, including molecule-based
sensors, preparing materials for electron microscopy analysis, FIB tomography
and other physical probes, and manufacture and characterization
of&lt;br/&gt;nanostructured materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The
FIB will have a synergistic impact on major new programs at Arizona State
University that integrate solid-state and molecular nanosciences. Through the
IGERT it will serve to train a new breed of nanoscientist, spanning the
chemistry-physics-engineering- biology spectrum. Training and outreach will
utilize mechanisms put in place by INVSEE (Interactive Nano-Visualization for
Science and Engineering Education (http://INVSEE.ASU.EDU). It will also be used
in science teacher preparation programs (ACEPT and its successor AM-STEP). An
on-line display at the Arizona Science Center will help to bring the concepts of
nanoscience to the general public.&lt;br/&gt;
