A major challenge facing society is understanding the ecological processes
contributing to atmospheric CO2 concentrations and how human land use practices
influence atmospheric CO2 levels. Herbivores are known to strongly affect plant
and soil carbon dynamics; but how grazers may determine the rate that carbon
flows into and out of the soil remains unclear. In this study, the effects of
grazing by elk and bison on carbon processes in Yellowstone National Park will
be examined at three ecologically important time scales: (1) instantaneous rates
of ecosystem CO2 exchange, (2) the rate that carbon flows through the plant -
soil system during yrs 1-3 after carbon is assimilated by plants, and (3) 40-50
yr soil carbon storage. Yellowstone Park is one of the few remaining vestiges of
a once widespread and stable grassland ecosystem that supported abundant
migratory ungulates in prehistory, and thus can serve as a natural benchmark
against which to compare grassland managed for livestock. With half of the
earth's terrestrial surface area used as rangeland for large herbivores, the
impact of ungulates on the global carbon cycle may be substantial. This research
will contribute significantly to our understanding of factors that regulate
carbon dynamics in grazed grassland.
