The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and
engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research abroad. The
program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique
or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad. This
award will support a twelve month research fellowship by Dr. Holly H. Ganz to
work with Dr. Dieter Ebert at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland.

This research proposes to address the importance of host heterogeneity on the
ecology and evolution of parasite populations. Daphnia are an excellent model
system with which to address general questions regarding the evolutionary
ecology of infectious disease. This project consists of a set of experiments
that will test how genetic diversity influences not only the transmission of one
particular parasite, but also how interspecific interactions among parasites
will influence the dynamics of each parasite population.
