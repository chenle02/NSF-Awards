ABSTRACT

This award is for the partial support of the Southeastern-Atlantic Regional
Conference on Differential Equations (SEARCDE) that has met annually since 1981.
This year conference will cover broad range of topics in the areas of ordinary
and partial differential equations, numerical methods, inverse problems. The
internationally recognized mathematicians: Jerry Bona (Texas A&M), Eric Carlen
(Georgia Tech) and James Glimm (SUNY Stony Brook) are invited as plenary
speakers. SEARCDE are traditionally providing support to young investigators and
women.
