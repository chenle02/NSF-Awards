EAR-0207812 Aster The Rio Grande Rift Seismic Transect (RISTRA) project is
designed to study the crust and mantle beneath the southwestern U.S. utilizing
an exceptional data set consisting of 18 months of broadband teleseismic IRIS
PASSCAL data from 57 sites along a 1000-km transect in TX, NM, AZ, and UT
recorded during 1999-2001. Under initial NSF funding extensive fieldwork was
completed, data were processed and archived at the IRIS data management center,
and preliminary analysis was performed and disseminated to the earth science and
broader communities. This project continues the analysis of RISTRA to illuminate
and interpret structure and processes associated with the Rio Grande Rift (RGR),
Colorado Plateau (CP), and Great Plains (GP) at unprecedented resolution.
Principal goals are to determine the: (1) nature the support of the present high
elevation of the CP; (2) depth extent of mantle processes associated with
surface morphology and tectonics; (3) connection between mantle and crustal
strain beneath the RGR region; (4) location in the mantle of remnants of the
Farallon plate and any possible detached continental lithosphere. Imaging of
discontinuities using receiver function methods is being coupled with studies of
shear wave splitting, 3-D seismic tomography, xenolith, and other
geological/geophysical constraints to reveal the structure of the region to
depths of approximately 800 km. Seismic migration processing techniques that
take full advantage of the quality, length, and dense (~18 km) station spacing
of the RISTRA experiment are being applied. Elastic 2- and 3-D modeling efforts
are being incorporated into the DOE/SEG Next Generation Modeling (NGM) Project
in association with Los Alamos National Laboratory and the University of
Houston.
