9628209 Cameron The PI's propose a combined SHRIMP and IDTIMS U/Pb zircon study
of granulites from Kilborne Hole in order to get the complete and precise
geochronological information required to unravel the evolution of the deep crust
beneath the Rio Grande rift. The PI's will refine applications of the Lu/Hf
system to dating processes such as melting and metamorphism in rocks affected by
these processes. Granulite xenoliths from Kilborne Hole are ideal for these U/Pb
zircon and Lu/Hf geochronology studies because (1) they are abundant and
relatively large, (2) a previous Sm/Nd study by Cameron suggests that crust
formation and modification can be documented over a long time interval (1700 Ma
to Cenozoic), and (3) the PI's previous Lu/Hf study has demonstrated that some
of the garnet-bearing granulites were affected by Cenozoic events. The quality
of the data will probably be needed in general for further advances in the
understanding of deep crustal processes through the study of granulite
xenoliths.
