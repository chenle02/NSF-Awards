Most of the traditional HEC applications and current petascale applications are
written using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) programming model. The MPI-1
standard provides communication semantics for two-sided operations. The MPI-2
standard added new one-sided communication semantics. However, most of the
current candidate petascale applications continue to use the MPI-1 semantics.
These applications find the available MPI one-sided communication semantics and
their implementations in existing MPI-2 libraries very restrictive to exploit
performance, scalability and fault-tolerance. The investigators, involving
computer scientists from Ohio State University (OSU) and computational
scientists from Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) and San Diego
Supercomputer Center (SDSC), will study and analyze the current restrictions in
the MPI one-sided communication semantics, their implementations and usages.
Novel solutions will be proposed to alleviate these restrictions so that the
next generation ultra-scale systems and applications can be scaled to hundreds
of thousands of cores.

The investigators will specifically address the following challenges: 1) What
are the limitations of using MPI one-sided operations in petascale applications?
2) What extensions are possible to the current MPI one-sided operations to
alleviate such limitations? 3) How to design and implement these extensions in
an MPI library for emerging ultra-scale HEC systems? 4) How to redesign
petascale applications to take advantage of proposed one-sided extensions and
their implementations? and 5) What kind of benefits (performance, scalability
and fault tolerance) can be achieved by the proposed extensions for petascale
applications on the next generation ultra-scale systems? The research will be
driven by a set of petascale applications (ENZO, AWM-Olsen, PSDNS and MPCUGLES)
from established NSF computational science researchers running large scale
simulations on the TACC Ranger and other NSF HEC systems.
