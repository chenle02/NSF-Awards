This is a request for $140,753 towards the purchase of an electrospray
ionization ion trap mass spectrometer (total cost: $201,076). This instrument
will play a pivotal role in the research projects of many investigators at the
Salk Institute and researchers at other academic institutions (see letters of
support). These projects currently include (A) characterizing the primary
structure of conotoxins;(B) identifying the role of phosphorylation in cell
activation and cell growth and (C) characterizing the site protein ligand
interactions.
