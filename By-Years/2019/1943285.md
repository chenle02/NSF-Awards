The Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) program is a National Science
Foundation-wide activity that offers awards in support of junior faculty who
exemplify the role of teacher-scholars through outstanding research, excellent
education, and the integration of education and research within the context of
the mission of their organizations. This project awarded to a CAREER scholar has
the goal to explore the ways in which Black girls develop positive science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) identities as they matriculate
through secondary education at a single-gender middle/high school. This project
integrates research and education by creating and disseminating culturally
relevant resources for teachers, parents, and students through free platforms.
This award is supported by the EHR Core Research program which supports
fundamental STEM Education research initiatives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project is a research-practice partnership study between Georgia State
University and the Coretta Scott King Young Women’s Leadership Academy – a STEM
certified single gender school in Atlanta, GA predominantly serving girls of
color. Using the Multidimensionality of Black Girls’ STEM Learning conceptual
framework (King &amp; Pringle, 2019), the study will explore how Black girls
exude brilliance in STEM learning spaces, and their intent to enroll in college
and pursue a STEM trajectory. This longitudinal study employs a mixed methods
approach utilizing multilevel modeling to investigate changes in STEM identity
constructs over time, and logistic regression to reveal which variables predict
whether or not a student declares a STEM major. Individual interviews,
reflection journals, and blog posts inform the construction of counter-stories
that challenge essentialist views of Black girls’ STEM learning experiences. The
intellectual distinction of this work unearths identity development in science,
technology, engineering and mathematics for a collective understanding of Black
girls’ STEM identity development across the intersections of four distinct
disciplinary content areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
