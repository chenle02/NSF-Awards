The investigator explores and develops new principles for the design of
statistical software to take advantage of modern computing power. Particular
emphasis is placed on exploring the effective use of compilation, code analysis,
and exception handling for statistical languages, and on developing effective
tools and frameworks for parallel computing in statistics. Pilot implementations
are incorporated in open source statistical software systems.

Effective statistical methodology made available through statistical software is
critical to the ability of researchers to make maximal use of experimental and
observational data, and for the ability of instructors to teach good research
practices. The design principles developed by this research lead to software
that improves the ability of researchers, instructors, and other users of
statistical methodology to apply this methodology more effectively in scientific
research and teaching and to take full advantage of modern high-performance
computational resources. These principles also lead to software frameworks that
can be used to more rapidly deliver new statistical methodology to end users.
Applications in brain imaging analysis serve as a testbed for methods and
principles developed in this research.
