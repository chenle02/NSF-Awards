This project supports the dissertation research of a graduate student in
anthropology, studying the process of national identity formation among
Bulgarian Turkish citizens who have recently emigrated from Bulgaria to Turkey
and are being assimilated as national Turks. The student will reside in a medium
sized city where many Bulgarian Turks have settled. Using ethnographic methods
of participant observation and structured interviews as well as archival
research, the student will study how the national state has attempted to define
the "official" Turkish national identity, and how Bulgarian Turks have
responded. The main question is how peoples of different, but historically
related ethnicities interact to establish relations of dominance or equality.
This research is timely and important as the world sees the intensity rising of
ethnic conflict in Eastern Europe. Understanding general processes of ethnic
relations through careful case studies can help us comprehend how states attempt
to establish ethnic dominance, and how subject peoples maintain their own
precious ethnic independence.
