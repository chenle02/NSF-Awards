This award provides funds for the purchase of equipment to enhance the
undergraduate curriculum at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in the areas of cell
culture, fermentation, product purification and large-scale production
technologies. Monitors and controls for pH and dissolved oxygen, air lift
fermenters, glucose/sucrose analyzer, and culture incubators will augment the
already existing Fermentation course. Chromatography monitor and control units,
additional alternative filtration units, and a centrifuge will augment the
already existing Protein Purification and Downstream Processing course. Mixing
tanks, a Gaulin Mill, a CEPA centrifuge and large volume liquid chromatography
columns will complement the large scale filtration and fermentation equipment
already on hand for a new course in Scale-Up. All of the requested equipment
will also benefit the research projects required of every senior undergraduate.
The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources.
