This is a Phase II SBIR proposal to develop the GaAs readout and preprocessing
electronics chip of the linear one-dimensional (1-D) and Z-dimensional (Z-D)
infrared focal plane array (IR-FPA). Top-Vu Technology will design, layout,
fabricate and test a prototype chip using commercial GaAs MESFET technology. The
expected results will include a Nx1 array readout and multiplexing GaAs chip.
The preprocessing electronics will be designed, fabricated and tested.
