Carnivores (bears, wolves, lions, seals and relatives) are key predators in
modern ecosystems. Understanding their evolutionary relationships is fundamental
to interpreting other knowledge (biological, medical, ecological) derived from
carnivore research. By developing the most comprehensive framework for
interrelationships of living and fossil carnivores (>100 species) using 400
anatomical and over 30,000 genetic characteristics, and integrating novel 3-D
imaging, mathematical, and engineering-derived computer modeling tools, this
research will reconstruct carnivore evolutionary relationships and decipher
their adaptations for critical ecosystem roles over time.

Analyzing how feeding function of skulls changed over time, and how species
developed locomotion and cognitive specializations during major habitat
transitions (land-to-water, tree-to-ground), this research will rigorously test
previous hypotheses that these changes represent responses to significant
environmental changes over the past 65 million years. This project will use
cutting-edge research on these charismatic mammals to enrich museum exhibitions
and create online multimedia (serving 5 million visitors [500,000
schoolchildren] and 12 million online learners annually). This project will also
implement high school and college education and research training programs,
including workshops, development of new graduate courses, training for three
postdoctoral scientists, and instructional programs for dozens of high school
students and undergraduate students.
