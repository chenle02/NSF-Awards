CTS - 9632079 Peter Pintauro Tulane University ABSTRACT The project involves the
fabrication of crosslinked and sulfonated cation-exchange membranes from
alkylphenoxy- and alkylphenoxy/phenoxy-substituted polyphospazenes. Phosphazene
polymers are promising base-materials for new membranes due to their chemical
and thermal stability and the ease of modifying the polymer by adding different
side-chains onto the -P=N- Backbone. The chemical and mechanical properties of
the resulting membranes will be characterized. The membranes will differ in
chemical composition, ion-exchange capacity, and degree of crosslinking.
Potential applications of the membranes include electrodialysis and
ultrafiltration, as well as solid polymer electrolyte fuel cells.
