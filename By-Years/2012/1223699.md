Progress in computer vision makes biometric authentication and recognition
become more reliable and readily available than before, with a potential for
ubiquitous use of such data well beyond traditional authentication. The need to
protect highly sensitive biometrics is apparent, which, unlike other types of
data used for authentication purposes, cannot be revoked and replaced with a new
value. This means that any breach in security of biometric data has far reaching
consequences to the individual than loss of other sensitive
data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previously, only limited mechanisms for protecting
privacy of biometry were available. To address the paucity of adequate
protection mechanisms, this project develops novel techniques for enhancing
privacy protection of biometric data when it is being processed and used in
environments which are not fully trusted or secured in a broad set of contexts
and applications that go well beyond comparing two biometric codes. The
project's scope covers (i) secure interactive computation on biometric data,
(ii) secure outsourcing of biometric computation to untrusted servers, and (iii)
efficient verification of the correctness of the result of outsourced
computation. A distinct benefit of this work is that it combines cryptographic
design with practical evaluation on real biometric data, as well as includes
integration of developed tools into a biometric computing grid environment. The
outcomes of this research are expected to enable and promote safer practices in
handing sensitive biometric data, including utilizing untrusted computing power,
and a wider degree of collaboration between entities who are otherwise not
permitted to share their data.
