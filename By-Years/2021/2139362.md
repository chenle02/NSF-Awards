This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multigenerational household
arrangements, defined as having a grandparent, parent, and child co-residing in
one householdâ€”has long been practiced for its economic and cultural benefits to
families. However, the coronavirus pandemic has turned these economic survival
strategies into high risk living conditions as household transmission remains a
primary source of COVID-19 infections. Despite recommendations to physically
distance, vaccinate, wear masks if unvaccinated, sanitize, and get tested,
little is known about how readily multigenerational household members can apply
these recommendations given real world contingencies related to work, kin, and
cultural obligations. This is especially true for households with essential
workers as vaccination rates slow down and businesses reopen. The results of
this study will contribute to recommendations for how to strengthen public
health responses to accommodate not just individuals but families (broadly
conceived), particularly those living in multigenerational households. The study
is implemented as part of a Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience
(CURE) with students at a Primarily Undergraduate, Hispanic-Serving Institution,
to broaden participation of students in STEM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
investigates how multigenerational households provide care while negotiating
coronavirus safety during the pandemic. The study will be conducted in a context
in which variation in household composition and employment outside the home
create specific vulnerabilities to COVID-19 given multigenerational household
arrangements. The investigators use ethnographic and ranking methods to compare
risk perceptions, harm reduction practices, and social relational issues
associated with culturally specific care roles in a context of limited resources
and close living quarters. The project provides the foundations for building a
research design model for researchers who evaluate risk assessment for disease
transmission within multigenerational households where disease exposure is
higher, and frequently less able to adhere to public health
guidelines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
