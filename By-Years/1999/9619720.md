This award provides continued support of an REU Site in Minority Group
Demography at the University of Texas at Austin. The program exposes
undergraduates to both the technical tools and the professional culture of
social science through coursework in demographic techniques, with an emphasis on
minority group demography, professionalization seminars, and hands-on research
experiences working with faculty. Students produce stand-alone research papers
and present them at professional meetings. Since ethical issues confront social
demographers in all aspects of their work, an ethics component is incorporated
into the Site activities. This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing
efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active
undergraduate research experiences.
