ABSTRACT DAYTE EEC-9726831 This award is to support collaboration between the
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) on Micro-engineered
Ceramics at the University of New Mexico and the New Mexico Highlands
University. The focus of the research is the synthesis and characterization of
spinel type material. These materials are used in industry in applications such
as magnetic memory, transformers, television tubes, and components for microwave
communications. The objective is to improve the performance of low loss
electrical power transformers, microwave integrated circuits, thin film magnetic
recording materials. The research centers on aerosol decomposition and solution
precipitation are to produce materials to study the crystal structure of these
materials. The magnetic properties of these materials are being measured and
analyzed. There is an impact on the education of minorities, as the students
involved are either Hispanic or Native Americans, and hopefully will encourage
these students to pursue careers in science and engineering in an area of
significance to the US economy.
