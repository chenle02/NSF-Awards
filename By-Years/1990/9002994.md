This MRG provides a three-year integrated program devoted to a micro-mechanics
approach to the design and processing of composites with optimal failure
resistance in technical applications. The research will focus on metal-matrix
and ceramic-matrix composites. Intermetallics will also be included because of
their potential for providing both toughness and strength at high temperatures.
The participants will develop a quantitative understanding of the mechanics of
failure (i) through determination of the microstructure of the materials, (ii)
by development of constitutive models for the components and their interfaces,
(iii) by numerical simulation of the fracture process, and (iv) by integration
of simulated responses to experimental measurements of materials properties. The
research will be carried out by faculty, post-doctoral associates, graduate
students and undergraduate students.
