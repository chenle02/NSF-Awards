9353044 Metts This project intends to develop, implement and disseminate
interdisciplinary curricula and materials based on an Engineered Environment
Laboratory. These materials would provide instruction and guidance to students
for recreating a local habitat. A habitat is to be developed in Delaware which
would interface a temperate hardwood forest to an old field agricultural system
and a freshwater marsh. This habitat would serve as an experimental laboratory
for the development of hands-on activities and experiences that would enable
students to become aware of the role of wetlands. The proposed activities would
be also provide the necessary background for them to make informed decisions
regarding the future of this critical habitat. Materials produced from this
project would include a generic curriculum development framework and
instructions for the development of an Engineered Environment Laboratory
appropriate equally to other environments such as deserts and grasslands.
Materials would be designed by teachers in cooperation with the University of
Delaware Instructional Technology Center and others and would be available on a
variety of delivery formats. ***
