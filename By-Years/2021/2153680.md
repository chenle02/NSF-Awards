Modern computer science has seen a dramatic blowup in the size of its most
important networks. Graphs representing the internet now have around 10 billion
nodes, the most popular social networks have a few billion active users, and
these come alongside the rise of big-data genomics, massive neural networks,
etc. Classical algorithms for graph analysis, which may have worked on networks
from previous decades, are often far too slow or costly to be used on modern
graphs. There is need for cheaper, faster, and more accessible methods for graph
analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A popular way forward is by the method of graph
sketching, which carefully replaces large graphs with much smaller ``sketches''
that can be efficiently analyzed in place of the original, with only minor
losses in accuracy. This project addresses a series of unanswered mathematical
and algorithmic challenges at the heart of sketching distance-based properties
of graphs, such as shortest paths or reachability. Three primary goals are: (i)
to determine the efficacy of graph spanners, which are sketches of shortest path
distances and which have enjoyed successful applications in areas like robotics,
distributed computing, and circuit design; (ii) to classify the sketching
problems for which more involved constructions of data structures can or cannot
outperform simpler sketching methods like taking subgraphs; and (iii) to find
the most relevant structural parameters of graphs, like expansion, highway
dimension, etc. that control the difficulty of building a sketch of that graph.
On the technical side, this project draws on methods from graph algorithms,
extremal and structural graph theory, information theory, and discrete
geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
