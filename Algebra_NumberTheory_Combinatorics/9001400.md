This project is concerned with research on the valuation theory of division
algebras finite-dimensional over their centers. A particular focus is the
further study of Dubrovin valuation rings. A ring is an algebraic object having
an addition and a multiplication defined on it. Rings occur naturally in many
different settings in mathematics. This project is concerned with an important
class of rings called division algebras.
