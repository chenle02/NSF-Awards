The faculty have determined that the primary curricular improvements needed for
the biology majors program are to provide computer experience in the
laboratories, develop additional labs that require critical thinking in
investigations using the scientific method, and provide students with
biotechnology lab experience. Laboratory exercises in which the students
formulate hypotheses concerning the effects of several variables, design the
experiments, and collect and analyze the data were developed for the biology
majors courses in zoology, cellular processes, and botany. The equipment funded
through this project includes (1) 10 Macintosh PowerPc's, software for student
use in collecting, analyzing, and manipulating data, and three printers for
student use in the labs; (2) the MacLab system, an integrated data recording and
analysis system that allows for the acquisition, display, analysis, and
manipulation of physiological data; (3) computer-linked spectrophotometers and
probeware for data collection of variables that change rapidly over time; and
(4) biotechnmlogy-related equipment, including pipetters, centrifuge, ultracold
freezer, gel boxes, transluminator, and vacuum pump.
