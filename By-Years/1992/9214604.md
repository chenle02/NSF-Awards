The University of Minnesota Institute of Technology is renovating about 7,357
square feet of research space which is used in condensed matter and low
temperature research. Contemporary experimental condensed matter and low
temperature physics spans a wide range of topics from understanding the
mechanism underlying high temperature superconductivity to investigating
macroscopic quantum tunneling. Despite this breadth of physics questions,
experimental investigations often share common structure. Most experiments
involve preparation of materials, processing of these materials to achieve a set
of desired properties, and characterization of the prepared and processed
materials to seek understanding of the physical phenomena. The facility
renovation project being undertaken will modernize the research space available
in order to integrate the processes involved in condensed matter research.
Finally, this renovation project will encourage researchers in and attract
students into a strategic research area for the Nation, materials science.
