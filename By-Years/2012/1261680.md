New efforts to assimilate satellite borne, high-resolution infrared (IR)
sounding data from IASI and AIRS satellite radiances are providing much denser
information on upper air temperature and humidity. Such efforts have the
potential to greatly improve the skill of numerical weather prediction (NWP)
model forecast and reanalysis products for the undersampled atmosphere of the
southern hemisphere. This is one of the key aims of the CONCORDIASI campaign, a
USAP supported IPY project. However, significant biases remain in the IR
profiles due to cloud contamination and surface emissivity uncertainties that
are specific to the Antarctic environment. This study seeks to improve the
quality of global and regional reanalyses using GPS radio occultation profiling
techniques made from stratospheric balloon platforms encircling Antarctica in
the spring polar vortex. The study is intended to reduce biases in the satellite
sounding observations, and to develop the capability for assimilating the
balloon GPS RO profiles directly into NWP models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Improved
satellite soundings, or balloon borne GPS radio occultation profiling, will help
our characterization of southern hemisphere temperature, moisture and
circulation features needed for better understanding of phenomena such as ozone
depletion, and the workings of the polarity of the Southern Hemisphere annular
mode (SAM). Uncertainty as to the future evolution of the climate systems in the
polar regions limits our ability to project global climate variability and
change.
