The performance of heat exchange devices is negatively affected when the fluid
flow entering the device is distributed nonuniformly. The thrust of this
proposal is a numerically implemented scheme for predicting the shapes of the
inlet manifold of heat exchangers which alleviate the flow nonuniformities. The
basis of the scheme is the boundary- integral-equation method of solving the
governing equations for inviscid flow. The predictions of the numerical scheme
will be subjected to experimental verification. For this purpose, measurements
of the fluid velocity will be made using a laser Dopler velocimeter.
