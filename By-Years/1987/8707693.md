A novel approach is being used for the study of interfaces between small metal
crystallites and oxides. The metal crystallites are supported on submicron oxide
particles of simple geometric shape. Using nonporous oxides limits the location
of the metal to the exterior of the oxide; therefore, profile and projected
views of the metal crystallites can be readily obtained in a transmission
electron microscope. These views permit determination of technologically
important parameters, such as contact angles, wetting and spreading of the
metal, and forces of attraction between the metal and oxide. Registry of the
atomic planes at the interface and nucleation site identification can also be
observed. The relatively high surface area permits reactivity studies to be
performed on these catalysts at standard reaction pressures. Thus, the
information obtained has considerable impact on the study of metal-support
interactions in heterogeneous catalysis and in the study of metal-oxide bonding
in ceramic science. This fundamental information has great value in a number of
important technologies including protective coatings, brazing fluxes, composite
materials, metal-semiconductor contacts in integrated circuits, corrosion of
metals, sintering of composites and catalysts, and support effects on
heterogeneous catalysts.
