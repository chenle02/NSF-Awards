This is a two.year collaborative research project between Dr. Warren Burggren,
University of Massachusetts, Dr. Daniel Townsend, University of Scranton and
Professor Lin Yao.Sung, National Taiwan University supported by the AIT.CCNAA
Cooperative Science Program. This proposal plans to study the potential role of
physiology in >reproductive isolation between closely related species. They plan
to use brown frogs, >Rana> >sauteri>, collected from three distinct altitudes in
Taiwan to examine the potential role of physiology in reproductive isolation to
elucidate the relationship between speciation and reproductive isolating
mechanisms. This proposal addresses an important problem in ecology and
evolutionary biology. The findings can have significant implications in
evolutionary theory and can advance our understanding of general mechanisms of
speciation. The >experimental design is simple and the species identified is
uniquely appropriate to serve as an animal model for this study. Taiwan is an
excellent site for this study, since this is one of the few places where brown
frogs are found distributed over such a large area and at different altitudes.
