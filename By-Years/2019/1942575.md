Secure computation allows multiple parties, each holding private data, to
perform arbitrary computations on the joint data without revealing anything
other than the desired output. In the last fifteen years, secure computation has
moved from being a purely theoretical area of research, to one that is being
actively deployed in a variety of settings. However, technical barriers to
adoption still exist: the communication and computational costs are quite high.
At the same time, improvements in the last fifteen years have brought us quite
near to the limit of what is feasible under standard definitions of security.
This project investigates new techniques for improving the efficiency of secure
computation beyond the known theoretical limits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project explores new security relaxations, and new methods of utilizing existing
security relaxations, in order to help scale secure computation to larger
volumes of data, and a larger number of participating parties. The investigators
envision a fully decentralized data plane in which user data is accessible by
service providers only at the discretion of the data owner. Computations
performed on this data would be subject to appropriate user-specified controls,
and the results of the computations would reveal only what is minimally
necessary to meet the goals of the data owner. Service providers could still
monetize the data, but without ever seeing it, and only with the explicit
agreement of the owner. The project has outreach activities that introduce
secure computation, privacy and cryptography to various communities in the DC
area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
