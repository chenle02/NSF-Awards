9601516 Rodgers Bowling Green University This award from the Academic Research
Infrastructure (ARI) Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at Bowling
Green University acquire a laser system. This equipment will enhance research in
a number of areas including the following: (1) excited state dynamics of
metalloporphyrins and related macrocycles (2) photoinduced charge transfer
between chromophores and colloidal semiconductors (3) ultrafast intramolecular
electron transfer reactions in ion-pair systems containing (alkyl)n(phenyl)4-n
borate anions (4) adaptation of photosynthetic prokaryote to changes in
environmental light conditions, and (5) solvational control of negative
activation energies for emission decay. A laser can provide important
information about chemical reactivity. Its use may enable breakthroughs in our
understanding of the properties of reactivity and nonreactivity of molecules.
