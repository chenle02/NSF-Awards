This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) will monitor hydroclimate
aspects of the ongoing extreme drought in the U.S. southwest. Project resources
will be used to continue field observations related to surface energy and water
exchanges in the core drought region, well past the duration of the field-phase
of the International H2O Project (IHOP). The collected data will be invaluable
for both monitoring and understanding the causes and impact of severe droughts.
Drs. Blanken (Univ. of Colorado) and Grossman (Colorado Research Associates)
will produce a quantified description of surface conditions by making soil
moisture and temperature, and evaporation measurements, and place the collected
data in context of other flux measurements in the region. Upon completion of the
project, detailed measurements will have been made at IHOP's "Site 10" from May
19 - November 1, 2002. The obtained land-surface condition data set will be
invaluable in capturing the hydroclimate evolution into drought conditions, and
should facilitate improvements in modeling of land-surface processes that are
critical for drought development. This project is being supported by ATM's
Large-scale and Mesoscale Dynamic Meteorology Programs, and EAR's Hydrologic
Sciences Program.
