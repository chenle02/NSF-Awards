The main focus of this research is on mathematical theory and methods which have
a direct bearing on problems involving multiscale phenomena in multiplicative
structures that arise naturally in a wide variety of modern applications, such
as river basin hydrology, fluid turbulence, financial securities markets, spin
glasses etc. The essential mathematical ingredients are a space-time random
field defined by a multiplicative cascade random process and a random network
represented by a random tree graph, together with a system of equations
directing the evolution. Much of the data collected and reported on these
structures is in the form of log-log plots of some quantity versus a length
scale. This leads to the introduction and refinements of new classes of self-
similar spatial/temporal models whose scaling structure is inferred from
empirically observed sample realizations. Thus we seek to calculate certain
large-sample (fine scale) limits of statistical estimators of exponents and
limit laws governing fluctuations. In addition, self-similarities and scaling
exponents are sought for the cascade and network models. Then connections
between the scaling exponents of the flow processes and those of the cascade and
network exponents may be investigated. The prospect of a theory which computes
structure functions, (i.e., multiscaling exponents) for extreme flows from
corresponding structure function calculations on the inputs and network defines
the frontiers of this research.

A fundamental problem from environmental science is to determine the structure
of river flows (e.g. extremes) from a basin given data on the local climate
(e.g. rainfall) and topography (river network structure, soil moisture). In most
parts of the world the information available for the planning of dams, flood
insurance, military tactics etc. is in the form of remotely sensed local climate
and topography. The mathematical formulation is based on a stochastic system of
conservation equations (mass, momentum) which relate the flows to the
multiplicative stochastic rainfall inputs and complex network topography via
scaling and multiscaling exponents which are estimated from remotely sensed
data. One of the practical aspects of results of this type is to assist
hydrologists and engineers in extrapolating localized observations to larger
scales, and to regionalize predicted flows. However, the broad mathematical
framework contributes to our understanding of diverse natural stochastic
phenomena such as fluid turbulence, stochastic investment yields, renewable
natural resource distributions, spin glass magnets etc., which are intrinsically
multiplicative in space and/or time.
