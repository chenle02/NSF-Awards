The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) program of the Division of Chemistry
will support the research program of Prof. Mietek Jaroniec of Kent State
University. Prof. Jaroniec and his students will investigate ways to tailor the
surface properties of periodic mesoporous organosilicas (PMOs) by employing a
novel strategy, which involves the self assembly of reactive organosilicas and
block copolymers accompanied by chemical reactions that lead to the formation of
desired bridging and pendant organic groups. The study will result in new
mesoporous materials with tailored surface and framework properties. The study
will provide excellent training opportunities to graduate students who will be
involved in this largely interdisciplinary project in the area of nanoscience
and nanotechnology. Prof. Jaroniec and his students will also prepare and
deliver a series of lectures to promote nanoscience and nanotechnology to
students in area high schools.
