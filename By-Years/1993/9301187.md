Salinas will continue his research on Toeplitz C*-algebras over domains with
non-abelian symmetries, spectral and C*- algebraic properties of Toeplitz
operators on pseudoconvex domains, and weighted Wiener-Hopf operators on convex
cones. Upmeier will continue his study of quantization theories in several
complex variables with the main focus on new geometric situations. He will also
study new types of special functions arising in quantization theory, and deepen
the connections with microlocal analysis. Operator theory is that part of
mathematics that studies the infinite dimensional generalizations of matrices.
In particular, when restricted to finite dimensional subspaces, an operator has
the usual linear properties, and thus can be represented by a matrix. The
central problem in operator theory is to classify operators satisfying
additional conditions given in terms of associated operators (e.g. the adjoint)
or in terms of the underlying space. Operator theory underlies much of
mathematics, and many of the applications of mathematics to other sciences.
