This project seeks to bring together new techniques for filtering and planning
to improve reasoning and analysis steps employed during robot design.

By understanding those parts of the design process that are typically conducted
by hand and by asking which parts can be practically automated, the research has
the potential to assist practitioners by scaling up the problems tackled,
optimizing systems automatically, and ultimately freeing designers from low-
level detail and elevating their use of time.
