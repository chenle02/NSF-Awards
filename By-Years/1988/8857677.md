This research is focused on heat transfer in metal grinding. An analysis of the
convective heat transfer between the grinding zone and the fluid will be
initiated. This analysis is difficult because the geometry is complex and poorly
defined, the degree of fluid penetration into the grinding zone is uncertain,
and the amount of heat generated is partly dependent on the fluid type. The
grinding wheel is modeled as a porous medium containing the grinding fluid. The
fluid-filled wheel and the workpiece are in relative motion, and heat is
generated at their interface. The analysis shows very good agreement with
preliminary experimental measurements of the grinding zone temperatures. The
research planned can provide a relationship for the workpiece surface
temperature in terms of the operating parameters and the grinding power. Since
the grinding power can be monitored during the grinding process, the operating
parameters can automatically be adjusted to lower the temperature to avoid
thermal damage.
