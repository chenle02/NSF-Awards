Gottlieb This project is building and evaluating ULTRA, a MIMD multiprocessor,
using combining switches in the processor-memory interface. The supplement
allows completion of an enhancement begun in FY 1992. In the enhanced ULTRA,
first generation combining switches are being replaced by more modern switches
built by NCR.
