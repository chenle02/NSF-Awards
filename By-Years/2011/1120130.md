Changes to the environment including contamination are major threats to animal
diversity and human wellbeing. Cap 'n' collar transcription factors (CNCs) are
master regulators of genes that protect animals from environmental stress.
Understanding and predicting how animals and humans respond to environmental
stress will require a detailed understanding of CNC regulation and function. The
genetic model organism Caenorhabditis elegans has numerous experimental
advantages for studying these processes. C. elegans is also a model for
understanding the biology of nematodes, which as parasites damage $80 billion of
crops per year, burden animal husbandry, and infect as many as 1/3 of humans
world-wide.&lt;br/&gt;C. elegans has a single CNC named SKN-1. The objectives of
this project are to 1) define how SKN-1 is regulated during environmental stress
by combining protein biochemistry with transgenic experiments in live animals
and 2) use genetics and molecular biology to identify and characterize genes
that function with SKN-1. This new knowledge will facilitate a deeper
understanding of how animals acclimate and adapt to challenging environments and
will provide a foundation for understanding nematode defenses to anti-parasitic
drugs and host-immune responses.&lt;br/&gt;This project will educate and train
students, teachers, and scientists at the pre-collegiate, undergraduate,
graduate, and post-doctoral levels. New concepts and ideas will be translated to
~225 largely pre-medical, dental, veterinary, and doctoral students through a
stress biology module in an intensive upper level undergraduate course. Outreach
programs will introduce primary school students to nematodes and a training
module will introduce high-school teachers to C. elegans as a genetic and
molecular model system for education, animal biology, biotechnology, and
biomedical research.
