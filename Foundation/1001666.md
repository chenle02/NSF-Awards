The proposed research will apply methods from model theory to study the generic
interactions between families of finite combinatorial objects in models of
unstable theories. These questions naturally admit, and benefit from, ideas and
methods from graph theory and finite combinatorics. More precisely, Malliaris
will work to further develop the theory of characteristic sequences, which are
countable sequences of hypergraphs defined on the parameter space of a first-
order formula. Malliaris has shown that a deep collection of techniques from
graph theory and combinatorics, including Szemeredi regularity, can be brought
to bear on model-theoretic structure via the characteristic sequence. Malliaris
proposes to further explore these promising connections, which are relevant to
many structural questions in unstable theories, including the fine structure of
order and independence and the classification of theories with the independence
property, as well as to understanding the model-theoretic significance of graph-
theoretic phenomena such as edge density and hypergraph regularity in this
context. Moreover, these investigations shed light on the ways in which families
of types are realized and omitted in regular ultrapowers, and are therefore
relevant to the longstanding open problem of the structure of Keisler's order on
unstable theories (a preorder on countable theories which, roughly speaking,
measures the difficulty of producing saturated regular ultrapowers).

Model theory is a branch of mathematics which studies the fundamental structure
of certain classes of mathematical objects, the models of a given theory. The
structural variation which occurs within a given class (or between comparable
models of different classes) sheds light on the inherent simplicity, or
complexity, of the theory itself. The work in this proposal arises from new
indications that certain theories may have deep and previously undetected
structural similarities. These similarities have to do with possible limit
behavior, that is, with the complexity of infinite configurations which arise
from families of finite combinatorial objects within models of the theory. One
broad aim of this work is the development of finer tools to detect this behavior
in certain invariants of the theory (e.g. the persistence and distribution of
graphs in the characteristic sequence of certain formulas of T). These ideas
would give new leverage in the ongoing program of classifying unstable theories.
Model-theoretic classification theory has, over the last forty years, developed
a richly informative toolbox for analyzing the complexity of first-order
theories and isolated many useful indicators of complexity, but much remains to
be done. In particular, a second underlying goal of this work is to give a
language in which to precisely ask, and to explore, the largely open questions
of distribution and density of these indicators: how and where they cluster and
how they interact with other objects in the model, e.g. base sets for types.
