9622323 Kiremidjian This is an equipment grant for support of upgrading of the
seismic shaking table facility at the John A. Blume Earthquake Engineering
Center, Stanford University. The table which was built in 1972 has been in
continuous use for testing of variety of structures and components and
significant results have been obtained over that period of time. Many of the
important components of the shaking table facility have deteriorated while
others have become obsolete. This project to modernize and upgrade key
components of the shaking table facility. The replacement components to be
purchased and installed include: hydrostatic Bearings with Suction Pump, and PC-
Based Control System for Table Programming and Data Acquisition. The shaking
table facility upgrading is a part of the on- going University's program
seismically to seismicaly retrofit and expand the Center at a cost of $3.5
million. This modernization is a unique opportunity to renovate and update the
key laboratory equipment, its shaking table, consistent with CMS/ENG's concept
and long-term plans to upgrade and network the nation's earthquake experiment
research capability. ***
