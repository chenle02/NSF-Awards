This award supplies the funds to upgrade and replace a respiratory gas, mass
spectromter which is used by four faculty members at the University of Virginia.
The equipment will be used in experiments on small animals (rodents) and in
measurements of short-term variability in cardiocascular control. The process by
which changes in carbon dioxide levels are sensed by the repiratory control
system remains an unsolved problem It is hoped that the projects for which this
equipment is intended will help provide a rational explanation for the
homeostasis of brain hydrogen ion concentration and thereby to understand how
corbon dioxide levels control breathing.
