Abstract for Proposal of Su

DMS-0301129 "RUI: Combinatorial fixed point theorems, polytopes, and fair
division"

The investigator's prior work has introduced methods from combinatorial
topology and discrete geometry to the study of certain "fair division" questions
in mathematical economics. The current proposal will support the development of
the mathematics behind these methods and the solution of several combinatorial
questions that have been motivated from economic problems, including: (1) the
development of new combinatorial fixed point theorems, (2) associated simplicial
algorithms, and (3) the study of minimal triangulations and minimal simplicial
covers of polytopes. Broader impacts of the proposed work include its
interdisciplinary application to negotiation support for group decision making,
and the active participation and training of undergraduates in the proposed
research.

Informally speaking, a "fair division" problem is concerned with finding methods
for dividing a set of goods among players in such a way that everyone can be
satisfied according to some notion of fairness. This topic is of interest to
economists, political scientists, and game theorists, and it often motivates
interesting mathematical questions. The set of possible solutions in such
problems is often a polyhedron of high dimension (a polytope), and one can
usually find a solution by breaking the polytope into many pieces (tetrahedra),
and walking around the polytope in a way that is guided by player preferences.
Thus the mathematics of how polytopes can be built up from its tetrahedral
building blocks using ideas from three areas (combinatorics, topology, and
discrete geometry) will have direct application to important problems in the
social sciences involving human strategy and decision making.
