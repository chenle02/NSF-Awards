9452622 Treas This project supports an undergraduate computer laboratory that is
used in conjunction with specially-equipped classrooms. The facility focuses on
technology-enhanced undergraduate instruction in required lower-division
statistics courses. Computer workstations with supporting servers, linkages, and
printers are used, and the project implements three principal curricular
components. These include computer-assisted instructional drills on basic
statistical concepts, spreadsheet calculation exercises, and student statistical
analyses of data archives. These curricular developments are tested in several
sections of the required three-quarter statistics sequence. The project serves
over 1200 undergraduates each quarter, provides a first-course in quantitative
reasoning, and includes a significant number of students traditionally under
representative in science.
