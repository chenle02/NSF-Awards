The Laboratory for Elementary-Particle Physics (LEPP) at Cornell University will
provide 10 undergraduates with the excitement and challenge of frontier research
and with opportunities to acquire new skills and meet researchers at all stages
of their careers. The constellation of programs includes elementary particle
physics (part of the CLEO Collaboration, studying fundamental questions of the
weak and strong forces), accelerator physics (using the CESR electron-positron
storage ring), synchrotron radiation science (both using the the existing x-ray
facility - CHESS - and designing new facilities) and microwave
superconductivity. The selected students will work closely with LEPP physicists
and participate in seminars, lectures, tours of campus facilities, and
activities designed to promote interactions among the many undergraduate
researchers at Cornell. Travel and housing allowances are given in addition to a
summer stipend.
