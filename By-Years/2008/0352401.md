0086863 Smith This project investigates a new technique for in situ
quantification of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification products using
electrochemiluminescence (ECL). The technique implements the highly sensitive,
ECL detection and quantification of tris(2,2'bipyridyl) ruthenium (II) labeled
DNA. This method is expected to yield significant improvement in speed, cost and
performance over existing quantitative PCR methods, by reducing the number and
quantity of reagents, reducing the number of sample preparation steps,
increasing sensitivity, and shortening analysis time.
