Professor Helton has been a pioneer in the theory and application of functional
analysis to engineering problems. His research - be it in mathematical analysis
or operator theory, filtering, communication, control theory, scattering, or
circuit design - is always creative and fundamental. His work is mathematics and
mathematical engineering of the highest quality. This multidisciplinary
research, a cross-breeding of engineering and mathematics, is exemplary. Based
on the extraordinary depth and breadth of this research and its importance to
two scientific communities.
