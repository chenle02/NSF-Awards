This research, in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, is aimed at
understanding the energetics and dynamics of weakly bound molecules including
complexes and clusters. The research will obtain infrared and microwave spectra
of a variety of weakly bound molecules. The data will be analyzed to yield
molecular geometries, shifts in vibational frequencies and electronic properties
such as moments and field gradients. Much of the work will be directed at
families of clusters and complexes containing water and acetylene. Electronic
properties of stable molecules in excited vibrational and electronic states will
also be measured, in order to help describe long range interactions of loosely
bound species.
