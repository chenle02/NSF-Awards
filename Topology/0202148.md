The PI proposes to study computations and applications of spectral invariants,
in particular the eta-invariant of generalized Dirac operators, to problems in
geometric topology and geometry. The focus will be to use analytic and
differential geometric machinery to study spectral flow, the Atiyah-Patodi-
Singer rho-invariant, and the $SU(3)$-gauge theoretic Casson invariant. The main
goal is to develop usable cut-and-paste machinery for spectral invariants using
the theory of boundary-value problems for Dirac operators.

The PI's work in pure mathematics has as its goal the solution and
clarification of geometric problems in 3 dimensions. The setting of 3 dimensions
on the one hand is familiar to all of us since the universe we live in is
3-dimensional. But geometric problems in this area turn out to be very difficult
for the odd reason that in such low dimensions there is "not enough room to
move." The PI's approach to the area is to combine traditional 3 dimensional
techniques with methods from other mathematical disciplines such as differential
geometry and analysis.
