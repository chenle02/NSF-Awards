Abstract ATM-9530914 Saltzman, Barry Yale University Title: Dynamical Theory of
Long-Term Climatic Change This award supports studies of long-term (e.g. late
Cenozoic) climate change aimed at developing a predictive theory that can
account for the increasing geological proxy evidence for the co- evolution of
climatic variables. These variables can be subdivided into (a) fast-response
atmospheric and surface state quantities that equilibrate relatively rapidly,
and (b) slow-response, high- inertia quantities (e.g., ice sheet mass, deep
ocean temperature, carbon inventories) that carry the main long-term evolution
and comprise the "center manifold" of the climate system to which the fast
response variables are attracted. These studies involve statistical analyses of
the relevant time-series records, and theoretical studies based on both general
circulation models (governing the fast response equilibrium processes) and
dynamical- system models (governing the slow-response, non-equilibrium
processes). The aim is to enlarge upon present theory of Pliocene/Pleistocene
climatic evolution by: (a) extension to a three-dimensional geographical
coverage of ice sheet mass, (b) a more general treatment of ocean dynamics,
allowing the possibility for multiple equilibria and instability, and (c)
establishing closure relations between the fast and slow response variables by
systematic GCM studies.
