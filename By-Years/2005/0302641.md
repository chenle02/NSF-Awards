This project is developing a model curriculum based on existing programs at
Evergreen Valley College and Santa Rosa Junior College by integrating new
technologies such as Geographical Information System (GIS), Computer-Aided
Design and Drafting (CADD), Global Positioning System (GPS) and computer aided
problem solving into civil engineering technology. The curriculum is being
designed as a certificate program and can be later modified to become an
associate degree program. It is providing model course contents, examples,
assignments, lab activities and fieldwork.&lt;br/&gt;The impact of this project
includes the dissemination and adoption of the curriculum by any community
college or high school in the nation. To facilitate the information
dissemination, workshops are being organized to train teachers who want to use
this curriculum and the contents of the curriculum are being published through
both printed media and electronic media including booklets, website and CDs and
through conference presentations. The curriculum is being first evaluated by a
panel of experts from the industry, universities, ASCE and ACSM, and then
implemented at Evergreen Valley College and Santa Rosa Junior College and
eventually disseminated through the country. The project is a collaborative
effort among industry, education institutions and government agencies. The
project has so far secured support from Trimble (the main GPS vendor), ESRI (the
largest maker of GIS software), Bentley (the main civil engineering CAD vendor),
Autodesk (the main CAD vendor), Santa Clara Valley Water District, HMH
Engineering, Caltran, Santa Clara County, regional high schools, Santa Rosa
Junior College, California State University at Fresno and San Jose Sate
University.&lt;br/&gt;
