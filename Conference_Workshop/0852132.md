This award provides funding for Special Meetings: SIAM Interdisciplinary
Conferences in the Mathematical and Computational Sciences. This series has six
conferences/workshops per year, and provides support for student and
postdoctoral travel. The objectives of this special meetings series are to
provide an interdisciplinary forum that enhances the understanding of advances
in the mathematical and computational sciences within and beyond the
mathematical sciences community and to disseminate the results and findings of
the special meetings via the SIAM website, in SIAM News, proceedings, or
reports, as appropriate.

Over 3,000 researchers participate in SIAM conference each year. Because of
special efforts to attract graduate students and young researchers, we find that
more than 20% of attendees are students. One goal is to increase the
participation of students and early career professionals. Each conference
focuses on a strategic area within mathematical and computational sciences and
its key applications to other areas of science, engineering, and technology.
