9318878 McCay This project involves the research of a cultural anthropologist
from Rutgers University. The behavior of fishermen and managers in three fishery
management systems in North America will be studied: the Atlantic sea clam
fishery in the Mid-Atlantic region, the inshore groundfish fishery in Nova
Scotia, and the small inshore dragger fishery in Newfoundland. The project will
interview workers about the common-property management system known as
"individual transferable quotas" (ITQs). These are intended to restore some of
the positive effects of market regulation and improve incentives of fishers to
conserve. This project is important because it will advance our understanding of
the management and conservation of a vital natural resource system: our
fisheries. Better understanding of the attitudes, behavior, patterns of
incentives, effort, ownership and governance will help inform public and
professional debate about natural resource conservation. ***
