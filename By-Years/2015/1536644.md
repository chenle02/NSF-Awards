Since 1978, the Oceanic Flux Program (OFP) has continuously measured particle
movement, known as particle flux, from surface waters to the deep Sargasso Sea,
revealing important information about changing ocean chemistry. It is the
longest-running particle flux time series and is unique in its focus on the deep
ocean. This award will continue funding this fundamental oceanographic time-
series, lengthening the record of data and allowing for a better understanding
of how the observed flux patterns relate to the interplay between climate and
ocean functioning. Continued support of the time series will provide training
and educational opportunities for young scientists from high school students
through postdoctoral researchers, and results will tie into other time-series
efforts in the Bermuda region. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding of ocean
variability over interannual and decadal time-scales is of widespread interest
and increasing relevance given the concerns over anthropogenic perturbations of
global climate and ocean chemistry due to increases in greenhouse gases. Ocean
ecosystems are now well-recognized to be affected by global and regional climate
patterns such as ENSO and the North Atlantic Oscillation, and an imperative
exists to model the ocean?s response to future climate scenarios. This requires
a fundamental understanding of how the ocean and its biota naturally respond to
climate and environmental forcing variables, and how these responses, in turn,
affect ocean biogeochemical cycles. The OFP time-series has produced a unique
unsurpassed record of temporal variability in the "biological pump", a term
loosely applied to material transfer from the surface to the deep ocean. The
record has documented interannual and longer variations in deep fluxes and
shorter term fluctuations driven by the interactions between mesoscale physical
variability, meteorological forcing and ecosystem responses. The OFP sample
archives are an unparalleled resource for study of the biogeochemical
consequences of changing ocean chemistry.
