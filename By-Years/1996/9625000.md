A metasystem is an ensemble of workstations, parallel, and vector machines
connected by one or more networks. Metasystems offer the promise of high
performance both in reduced completion time and high job throughput. The goal of
this project is to develop a set of automated scheduling tools that will produce
reduced completion time and high job throughput in a wide-range of metasystem
environments. This investigation will also explore fundamental issues in the
relationship between completion time and job throughput. The approach taken will
be based on the Prophet scheduling system developed by the PI at the University
of Virginia. Prophet automatically schedules data parallel jobs across a network
of heterogeneous workstations to reduce completion time. In this project,
Prophet will be used to schedule data parallel, task parallel, and sequential
jobs in a general metasystem that may contain multicomputers, multiprocessors,
and ATM networks. Prophet will be applied to real workloads that include
scientific applications to test the efficacy of the scheduling tools. For
parallel jobs, the completion time obtained by Prophet will compared to the
completion time obtained by the Mentat scheduler. The system throughput obtained
by Prophet will be compared to the throughput obtained if resource sharing is
not considered in making scheduling decisions. It is also expected that insights
into scheduling policies will be gained by studying the interaction between
throughput and completion time.
