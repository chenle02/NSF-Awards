This work seeks to examine people's psychological and physiological reactions
to the extreme stress produced by a recent natural disaster, the Bay Area
earthquake of 17 October 1989. The PI has developed a theory of inhibition and
confrontation with stressors, which holds that when people attempt to suppress
reactions to stressful events, when they refuse to talk about the event,
consciously try to stop thinking about it, etc., they put themselves at risk for
later, stress related reactions, which can include the intrusion of debilitating
thoughts, autonomic nervous system activity and, over time, an increase in
health problems. In the first study, a sample of Bay Area residents will be
surveyed repeatedly over the course of a year (via telephone), and sequential
measures of their reaction to the earthquake will be taken. It is predicted that
people will differ in the ways they inhibit, or confront, the disaster, and
these reactions, in turn, will have implications for later physical health
status. In addition the researchers will interview a subsample of the telephone
survey respondents, and take a series of noninvasive physiological measures
(e.g., blood pressure), to determine potential relationships between reactions
to the earthquake (as evidenced on the survey questionnaire) and physiological
status. Also, approximately 700 Bay Area residents (and a comparison group of
350 Dallas, TX, residents) will be surveyed over the course of the coming year
to determine possible changes in people's reactions to, and perceptions of, the
disaster; comparison of these responses with those of the repeatedly measured
group will be made to determine the effects of multiple testing. In addition,
health status measures also will be taken. Finally, various college and non-
college groups who differ in terms of their plans to stay or quit the Bay Area
also will be interviewed, and various health status measures will be applied.
The research will attempt to show that the form of people's reaction to a
disaster, and possibly the reactions they exhibit over a period of time
following the disaster, will have implications for their psychological and
physical health. The PI's use of the Bay Area disaster as a natural manipulation
is a smart and opportunistic attempt to make a positive gain from a terrible
catastrophe. A rapid NSF response to this request would have been very difficult
without the SGER program. For this reason alone, the SGER initiative is to be
applauded.
