9529616 Farmer This proposal describes research and the need for specialized
equipment in the area of bonding ultra-thin silicon wafers (as thin as 2
micrometers) to virgin and oxidized silicon substrates. The integrity of the
bonded interface is of paramount importance in understanding the fundamental
issues of reliability and failure mechanisms. The quality of the interface will
be examined with an IR microscope to determine the effects of annealing
temperature and surface roughness. The fields of application for this technology
include Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS), Silicon on Insulator (SOI) and
Silicon (SOS). ***
