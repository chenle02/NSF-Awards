The goal of this project is to explore some applications and potential
applications of algebraic topology and algebraic K-theory. In algebraic
K-theory, the project explores ideas applicable to the conjecture of Waldhausen
on the K-theory chromatic tower, relating arithmetic and geometry. The project
explores a number of potential contributions to the theory and computation of
topological Hochschild homology and topological cyclic homology. The project
explores some new stable homotopy tools applicable to the study of the algebraic
K-theory of spaces (which is closely related to the differential topology of
high dimensional manifolds). In unstable homotopy theory, the project explores
the applications of homotopy algebras to computations related to fiber squares
and mapping spaces.

Homotopy theory studies those properties of mathematical objects that do not
change under small deformations. These mathematical objects are often of a
geometric nature but the methods of homotopy theory have been increasingly
applied to objects of an algebraic nature as well. Homotopy theoretic properties
tend to be accessible to computation by taking advantage of the invariance under
small changes. Since they also generally retain important information about the
original mathematical objects, homotopy theory is an effective tool for a wide
range of mathematical problems.
