EAR-0331712&lt;br/&gt;Segall&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will develop a research
agenda for understanding shallow magmatic systems, focusing on Long Valley
Caldera and the new observational capabilities provided by the EarthScope
facility. The workshop will create an interdisciplinary approach by bringing
together researchers from all relevant disciplines; including geologists,
geophysicists and geochemists. The agenda will include review presentations, a
field trip to Long Valley, and follow-up sessions to develop research plans,
including funding strategies and ways to leverage EarthScope data to answer key
scientific questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Invitees will include scientists from
both academia and government agencies that have been actively carrying out
research on the Long Valley Caldera volcanic system or who can contribute
perspectives on broader issues such as restless calderas and Basin Range/Sierra
Nevada tectonism. Practitioners of all branches of Earth science will be
encouraged to attend. A special effort will be made to include women,
underrepresented minorities and persons with disabilities. A small number of key
foreign speakers will be invited, and 10% of places will be reserved for
students. &lt;br/&gt;
