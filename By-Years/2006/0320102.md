This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
Molecular Modeling Kit that will be used by educators to introduce their
students to concepts of molecular structure and function. This Modeling Kit will
be based on the use of toobers, foam tubes with moldable wire that allows the
tubes to hold their shape. One technical objective of this project is to further
develop the foam fabrication technology to allow the production of a thin toober
that will be suitable for this modeling kit. In addition, a minimal set of
ancillary components of the modeling kit will be designed and prototyped. These
components include (i) both an alpha helix and a beta sheet bending jig, (ii) a
connector that will allow different colored toobers to be joined together, and
(iii) cross-linking elements that will allow the final model to be stabilized.
As the final objective of this project, curricular modules based on the use of
this modeling kit will be developed and field-tested with teachers and students
at the high school and undergraduate levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial
application of this project will be in the education market. The modeling kit
developed in this project will be marketed to educators at both the secondary
and post-secondary levels.
