9317403 Smith Dr. Smith will carry out charge-coupled-device (CCD) observations
of variable stars in a one degree square region of the Small Magellanic Cloud.
These observations follow on a photographic survey which showed this region to
be rich in variable stars. The data will be used to: (1) complete the discovery
of variable stars in this field; (2) determine periods and lightcurves for the
variables; and (3) produce a color-magnitude diagram for approximately 40,000
nonvariable stars within the field.
