This Small Business Innovation Research Program Phase II research project will
develop a technology for improving security checkpoint effectiveness and
increasing throughput while reducing labor costs for airports and other
sensitive installations by integrating information technology systems
incorporating new x-ray image inspection technology, new electronics
communications technology, materials handling automation, and database-centric
computerization. Current processing rates through a typical security checkpoint
are relatively slow and laborious and costs are high. Today's checkpoints take
little advantage of computerization thereby limiting their effectiveness. It is
planned that the prototype system will be integrated into a TSA approved test
site and tested and evaluated by an independent third
party&lt;br/&gt;Modernization of checkpoint security will improve protection of
many other segments of society. In today's world it is vital that our nation's
citizenry, transportation systems, institutions, sensitive installations, and
economy have the best protection possible. Security has become much more
restrictive and time consuming. If successful this project will develop a
product that will be able to increase the security at check bags handling
facilities while reducing the time to conduct the checks. The streamlining and
improving of security at federal buildings, government installations, maritime
ports, shippers, mailrooms, and other sensitive locations can increase
confidence in our day-to-day lives and help improve the nation's economic
security.&lt;br/&gt;
