This research project continues work on some specific aspects of the structure,
psycholinguistics, and neurolinguistics of sign language. It includes exploring
the interplay between linguistic structure and perceptual processes through
cross-sign language studies, comparing effects in American Sign Language and
Chinese Sign Language; the neurological control of language and movement through
detailed analysis of the breakdown of both in signers with neurological motor
disorders; and hemispheric specialization for language in the brains of normal
signers with respect to particularly distrinctive attributes of American Sign
Language.
