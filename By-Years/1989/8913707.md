Most objects perceived visually are partly occluded by other objects; yet human
observers accurately detect the unity and boundaries of objects under most
circumstances. There are other phenomena in which boundaries are perceived in
the the absence of local visual information, such as illusory contours and some
perceived transparency phenomena. In all of these cases, perceived object
boundaries are interpolated between physically- specified edges. This project
will address the various cases of boundary interpolation, testing and refining a
recently proposed unifying theory, and more generally attempting to specify the
conditions under which interpolation occurs. Specific aims include tests of edge
interpolation in both two and three- dimensional displays, development of
methods for generation of random displays, and development of a variety of
measures for assessing boundary perception, including both perceptual report and
non-verbal measures. This work will have implications both for understanding
human perception of objects and for object and boundary detection in computer
vision systems.
