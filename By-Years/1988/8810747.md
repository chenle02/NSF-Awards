Geometric modeling is a relatively new discipline that focuses on the problem
of constructing and manipulating representations of geometric objects. One of
the fundamental problems is choosing an appropriate representation for surfaces.
In one popular approach, surfaces are represented as zero sets of polynomials.
Such surfaces, referred to as algebraic surfaces, include almost all of the
surfaces currently used in geometric modeling (e.g., Bezier surfaces, B-spline
surfaces, quadric surfaces). A benefit of the use of these surfaces is the
existence of an extensive mathematical theory of algebraic surfaces known as
algebraic geometry. We propose to apply theory from algebraic geometry to three
current problems in geometric modeling: 1. Symbolic manipulation of systems of
polynomial equations: We propose to investigate symbolic manipulation methods
involving elimination theory (e.g., resultants). Specifically, we intend to
explore new methods for eliminating several variables from a system of
polynomials simultaneously. 2. Computing the intersection of algebraic surfaces:
we propose to apply the theory of birational maps to the problem of constructing
an algorithm for computing the intersection of algebraic surfaces. 3.
Construction of piecewise smooth algebraic surfaces: we propose to use the
theory of polynomial ideals to aid in the design and construction of a system of
piecewise continuous algebraic surfaces. In particular, we hope to develop
methods for constructing free-form algebraic surfaces.
