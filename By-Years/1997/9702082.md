This CAREER project develops an adaptive space-time finite element methodology
that allows for accurate and efficient prediction of the dynamic response of
complex structural acoustic systems over a broad range of scales and frequencies
- including the mid-frequency range. The methods employ finite element
discretization of the time domain as well as the usual discretization of the
spatial domain. This novel approach to the modeling of the temporal variables
allows for the consistent use of adaptive solution strategies for unstructured
grids in both time and space: a technique which significantly improves the
efficiency and reliability of the resulting computational algorithm over
standard methods. By orchestrating the distribution of mesh sizes and spectral
orders in space-time, a modeling technique is obtained which has significant
flexibility and scope. The educational plan enhances the learning process for
both undergraduate and graduate students through a comprehensive array of
innovative teaching activities and industrial exchanges. Educational activities
include development of a curriculum in finite element analysis, setting up
experimental, computational, and multimedia laboratories for graduate and
undergraduate teaching, use of symbolic computing systems for innovative
teaching and learning, involving undergraduate students in collaborative
research projects, educational collaborations with industry, and outreach
activities including delivering short courses and workshops over the Internet
via video conferencing and the World Wide Web.
