Abstract DMS 0238463

D Kleinbock(Brandeis): Career The research component of the project deals with
algebraic dynamical systems and their applications to number theory. A dynamical
system here stands for an abstract set of points together with an evolution law
which governs the way points move over time. It turns out that many problems
concerning simultaneous approximation of real numbers by rational numbers can be
cast in terms of the behavior of certain orbits, and various phenomena related
to the theory of integer equations or inequalities can be better understood once
they are phrased in dynamical systems language. Furthermore, systems that arise
in this context are of algebraic nature, which makes it possible to use a wide
variety of sophisticated tools for their investigation.

The educational component consists of several ingredients: developing new
`creative thinking' courses and supervising summer research projects for both
undergraduate and graduate students, and maintaining an introductory-style
interdisciplinary seminar. The goals are to engage students in challenging
research projects, encourage non-standard independent thinking, and to expose
them to a broad spectrum of current mathematical research.
