Critical to the development of the industrial might of the United States was
the development of an iron-making industry as good as or better than any in the
world. Development of the capacity to make wrought iron of adequate quality and
in sufficient quantitities to supply American industries that were making
boilers, steam engines, rails, edge tools, arms, structural iron for buildings
and ship hulls, was an essential step toward the attainment of industrial
maturity in the United States. Yet the capcity to make such wrought iron was not
easily acquired. The replacement of iron by steel was well underway before
American ironmakers achieved the technological maturity to compete with imports
in quality as well as in quantity. Professor Gordon is studying how this
technological maturity was achieved through one way of making wrought iron: the
bloomery process. He will use archaeometallurgical methods and historical
sources to investigate the evolution of American technology for the direct
reduction of ore to iron in the 19th century. The research will focus on the
American bloomery process practiced in the Adirondack region of New York State
because bloom smelting reached its highest level of technological development
there. He will utilize the results being obtained by several historians and
historical archaeologists now working on the records and physical remains of the
iron industry in northwestern New York. The results will be used to show how
American ironmasters brought the direct reduction process to a high level of
technological maturity through experience, the application of science, and the
development of skills by metallurgical artificers. They will also be used in a
comparative study of bloom smelting technology in other parts of the world aimed
at the resolution of technical questions about alternative ways fo carrying on
the direct reduction process now being debated by archaeometallurgists.
