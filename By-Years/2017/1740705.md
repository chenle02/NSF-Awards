The broader impact/commercial potential of the Southwest I-Corps Node (SWICORPS)
project will derive from its extensive reach and its carefully structured
programming and research. SWICORPS is the largest Node in the program, covering
five states from Oklahoma to the Texas-Mexico border (over 800 miles), and from
New Mexico to Louisiana (over 1,000 miles). SWICORPS includes four Research 1
level institutions and will leverage its access to almost 500 degree-granting
institutions to build entrepreneurship capacity in the region. SWICORPS will
introduce faculty and students throughout the region to the I-Corps
entrepreneurial curricula, ultimately increasing the economic impact of their
research. The activities of the node will build a cadre of STEM researchers and
students with an entrepreneurial mindset and appropriate training to exploit
their research discoveries in the marketplace. With nearly half a million
students enrolled in Minority Serving Institutions in Texas alone, SWICORPS will
focus efforts and outreach to the regions most underserved areas to grow the
entrepreneurial ecosystem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps Node project
provides training and infrastructure to share the Lean Launchpad I-Corps
curriculum with affiliates across a vast and diverse region. It will continue to
expand to reach new trainers and impact early-stage startups, including those
from Sites located in the region. These activities will help to build a regional
critical mass of technology-based companies. The I-Corps Node will raise
awareness of the value of entrepreneurship and business skills among science and
engineering faculty, researchers, and students through its customized regional
programs and outreach initiatives. This Node will build on best practices to
develop an effective mentor network and aid teams in identification of mentors
for national program training. The partner schools will contribute to the
National Innovation Network for the development of new curricula and advanced
tools. The node will exploit metrics and outcomes from its regional activities
to better understand the entrepreneurial mindset, and to determine which tools
best serve entrepreneurs during and after the customer discovery process.
Southwest I-Corps Node's recruitment of strong national teams will continue to
increase the impact of federally funded research, and will contribute to
innovation, job creation, and economic growth, both in the region and throughout
the country.
