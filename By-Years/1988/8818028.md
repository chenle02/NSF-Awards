Predator-prey theory suggests that key factors determining predator-prey
coexistence in a patchy environment include: 1) predation rates in patches with
predators; 2) prey fitness in patches without predators; and 3) patterns of
movement among patches. The proposed research will examine factors that
influence the coexistence of small-mouthed salamander larvae with predatory
sunfish at two spatial scales: in stream pools and in streams consisting of a
series of pools, some of which lack fish. The proposed work includes 3
components: A) field surveys to estimate larval survivorship in fish and
fishless pools, and larval movement among pools; B) field studies on the effects
of larval behaviors on survivorship and dispersal among fish and fishless pools;
and C) field experiments on the survivorship in fish pools. Surprisingly few
empirical studies have examined the effects of behavior on predator-prey
coexistence in a pathcy environment. This study will include: 1) detailed data
on the effects of behavior on the three factors affecting coexistence (listed
above); and 2) assessments of behavioral correlations that can produce important
indirect effects on coexistence patterns.
