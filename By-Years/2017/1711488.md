One dimensional manifolds are fundamental objects in mathematics, and their
structure and properties have attracted the attention of mathematicians for a
long time. The focus of the project is the structure of the group of continuous
symmetries of one-manifolds, including the local structure of the group of
symmetries and the effect of smoothness on algebraic properties. The project
will resolve several basic open questions about the structure of these groups
and investigate new algebraic phenomena. The ideas and methods in the project
will be broadly applicable to other fields, and will lie at the interface of
topology, geometric group theory, and dynamical
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The structure of the homeomorphism groups of one-
manifolds, especially compact one-manifolds, has received much attention over
the years. Recently, this field has experienced tremendous development. The
project will contribute to these advances by studying the local topology of the
space of representations of a closed surface group into homeomorphisms of the
circle, the local connectivity of which is a long standing open problem.
Moreover, the project addresses the effect of regularity on the algebraic
structure of finitely generated subgroups of homeomorphism groups on compact
manifolds, and will construct groups which can act with prescribed levels of
regularity but which are not smoothable to higher levels of regularity. The
regularity of actions of Thompson's group F will also be addressed, with the
goal of establishing the Brin-Sapir conjecture for smooth actions of F on
compact manifolds.
