This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, involves an experimental and theoretical study of the structure and
properties of single crystal noble metal electrodes and gold electrodes modified
by self-assembled monolayers. Professor Fawcett and his students at the
University of California at Davis will use a variety of voltammetric methods and
impedance spectroscopy to characterize these electrode surfaces immersed in
various nonaqueous solvents. The distribution of potential over the double layer
at these electrode/solution interfaces and the effect of solvent on this
property will be determined. In concert with this experimental thrust
theoretical work will be pursued to develop analytical expressions for these
double layer properties that can be easily used by experimentalists. The double
layer properties of single crystal noble metal electrodes and gold electrodes
modified by self-assembled monolayers in various nonaqueous solvents will be
studied experimentally and theoretically in this project. Professor Fawcett and
his students at the University of California at Davis will use a variety of
electrochemical methods and impedance spectroscopy in this work and analytical
expressions that describe the double layer at these electrode/solution
interfaces that can be easily used will be developed. The results from this work
will be contribute to understanding the effects of solvent on the distribution
of potential at these interfaces and this knowledge has relevance to a variety
of `green` technologies.
