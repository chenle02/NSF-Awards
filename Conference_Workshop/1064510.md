The Southern California Number Theory Day is a one-day conference of number
theory lectures, bringing together mathematicians from southern California and
beyond. The lectures are research talks at the cutting edge of the field, given
by international experts. The conferences will serve as a way to disseminate the
latest research, and encourage interactions and collaborations among number
theorists, leading to new ideas and interesting and useful research results in
this important field of mathematics. The conferences will give graduate students
and postdocs the opportunity to interact with senior mathematicians from other
institutions in academia, government, or industry.

Number theory is a central field of mathematics, that goes back to ancient
times. Modern day number theory builds on centuries of work in mathematics, to
solve not only modern day problems but also difficult problems that remained
unsolved for hundreds of years. Number theory underpins the security of
electronic commerce, and provides security for defense communications.
