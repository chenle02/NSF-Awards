There are important questions which refer to gravity on very tiny scales--scales
where quantum gravity reigns--and therefore they implicitly raise the prior
question whether spacetime is ultimately continuous or discrete. No matter what
the answer here, discrete models of spacetime are needed for practical reasons:
for the computer simulations which will tell us how to interpret the data coming
from gravitational wave telescopes like LIGO. This research would address the
following specific topics within this broad framework. The methods would be both
analytic (paper and pencil computations and derivations) and numerical (computer
simulations). properties of black holes: does the surface of the black hole (its
`horizon`) possess a `fractal` structure, as Newtonian analysis indicates?
discrete spacetime: further development of Regge Calculus as a practical tool
for solving the Einstein equations numerically; further development of causal
set theory, focusing on the issues of locality and the cosmological constant.
spacetime topology and topology-change: what are the properties of topological
geons and what happens when they are created and destroyed? quantum cosmology:
what are the observational effects of the time varying cosmological constant
indicated by causal set theory? sum-over-histories approach to quantum
mechanics: how can we continue to make predictions with quantum mechanics in the
presence of gravity?
