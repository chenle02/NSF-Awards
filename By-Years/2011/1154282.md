This project is focused on increasing enrollment and graduation rates in
industrial engineering, mechanical engineering and physics. The expectation is
to serve more than 15 students yearly through the articulation of a seamless
transfer from the community clleges. It is particularly noteworthy that the
program builds on proven 'in house' methods that have yielded excellent
retention results and that it continues to focus on underserved populations.
Enhancements to be included are adopting and enhancing a STEM Summer Research
Program and a Student Success Center, hiring tutors and research assistants,
faculty mentors to help with retention, utilizing good connections with
industry, and integrating two good recruitment tools (Girl's Night Out and The
Robotic Hand).
