The process by which voluntary groups form is basic to human collaborative
activity. The creation of new businesses, the emergence of political interest
groups, the development of collaborative research projects, and the formation of
less desirable groups such as youth gangs all involve decisions by individuals
who are not yet members (`Will I join with this person or that one?`) and
decisions by others who are already members (`Will we admit this person or that
one to our group?`). Individuals can make wise or foolish, profitable or
unprofitable decisions about the groups they form or join. This research project
uses a new laboratory paradigm, social poker, to study the sequence of
individual and collective choices that result in group formation. In regular
poker, individuals draw cards (resources), discard some and add others, and
compete against one another to build the strongest hand. In social poker, each
individual has too few cards to form a hand, so players must join with others
and pool their resources to create a poker hand. Poker hands earn group payoffs,
and members decide amongst themselves how to divide up the money. Thus,
individuals must assess how much alternative potential groups will earn and how
the earnings will be distributed. They must also weigh the risk of being left
out entirely if groups form without them. Nascent groups seeking additional
members must consider what resources potential members will bring to the group,
what they will demand in return, and the likelihood that a member will join
their group and not another. The planned series of experiments manipulates (1)
whether or not groups compete against one another (relative payoffs) or against
the environment (fixed payoffs); (2) the number of players in the game; (3) the
amount of information players have about one another's cards; (4) whether
agreements are binding or not; and (5) whether the game is played once or in an
iterated sequence. The data will be analyzed at three levels: individual, group,
and society. Questions to be addressed in the analyes include: What individual
strategies make the most effective use of resources to form or gain entry into
groups? What accounts for differences among groups in their ability to attract
members who have valuable resources? And given a particular distribution of
resources, what determines whether the stream of individual and collective
decisions results in an optimal configuration of groups, which generates maximum
wealth for the population?
