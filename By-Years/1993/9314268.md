This project will produce current information on the demographic and employment
characteristics of doctoral scientists, engineers, and humanists in the United
States. To accomplish this, the National Academy of Sciences will conduct the
1993 Survey of Doctorate Recipients, develop a longitudinal file of information
(the Doctorate Work History File), and prepare a variety of cross-tabulations
from the 1993 survey. The survey response rate will be greatly enhanced by
extensive use of computer assisted telephone interviews (CATI). The Foundation
is responsible for developing and maintaining a data base of demographic,
educational, and employment information on scientists and engineers. This data
base, the Scientific and Technical Personnel Data System, requires input from
three survey series: The National Survey of Natural and Social Scientists and
Engineers, The Survey of Natural and Social Scientist and Engineering Graduates,
and the Survey of Doctorate Recipients. Data from the Survey of Doctorate
Recipients are frequently used to determine the status of various aspects of U.
S. science and engineering, e.g., changes in research and development
activities, and are also used in conjunction with data from the other surveys
for analytical and policy purposes. Co-sponsoring agencies are the National
Endowment for the Humanities, National Institutes of Health, and the Department
of Energy.
