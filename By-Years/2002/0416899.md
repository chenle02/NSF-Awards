This project focuses on the implementation of novel methodology for rapid
collection of multidimensional NMR data by extending the repertoire of GFT NMR
experiments suitable for 13C/15N stable isotope labeled proteins and nucleic
acids and developing GFT NMR experiments that incorporate the single scan
acquisition scheme. To further reduce the sampling demand of GFT NMR, processing
of GFT NMR data will be optimized by using either Maximum Entropy Reconstruction
or Three-way Decomposition. User-friendly employment of the new NMR experiments
will be ensured by implementing software for efficient analysis of GFT NMR
spectra. The creation of a package of NMR parameter sets will enable efficient
dissemination of research results.

The broader impacts resulting from these activities are increased efficiency
with which NMR-based structural biology and genomics can be pursued and an
increase in the return of investment into costly high-end NMR hardware and
genome sequencing projects. The research program will offer opportunities to
students.
