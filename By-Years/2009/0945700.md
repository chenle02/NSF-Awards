This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a method of
patterning chemically sensitive organic electronic materials using
photolithography and other standard cleanroom processes. The technology is based
on the development of a fluorous based photoresist. The process to be developed
will not damage organic semiconductors, which are destroyed by most organic
solvents and water.

The technology will solve many of the problems that plague the organic
electronics industry, particularly related to OLED manufacturing. The technology
has the potential to enable large scale manufacturing of OLED displays using
existing LCD equipment, dramatically lower the cost and improving yields by
using proven techniques.
