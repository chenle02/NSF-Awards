The 10th International Spores Conference will be held at the Marine Biological
Laboratories, Woods Hole, Massachusetts, from March 23 through March 27, l988.
The Conference will bring scientists from all over the world, both from academic
and industrial laboratories, who are interested in prokaryotic development and
differentiation. The primary emphasis of the Conference will be on bacterial
sporulation, but at least one session will be devoted to problems of development
and global regulation in other mocroorganisms. The Conference will focus on the
regulation of gene expression during sporulation, including the initiation of
the process, the physiology of spores germination, structural and functional
studies of spores, including mechanisms of spore resistance, and one session
will deal with sporulation related products of industrial importance, including
insecticides and exoenzymes. The formal program of nine sessions will be
supplemented by poster sessions and informal round table discussions on specific
topics.
