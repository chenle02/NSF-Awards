Abstract Proposal: DMS-9805196 Principal Investigator: Shiferaw Berhanu This
award furnishes partial support for a conference to be held at Temple University
on April 5-7, 1998. The conference, organized as a tribute to the life and work
of Leon Ehrenpreis, focuses on those mathematical areas to which Professor
Ehrenpreis has made major contributions: PDE, Several Complex Variables,
Integral Geometry, and Number Theory. The conference is coordinated with and
complemented by three special sessions at the meeting of the American
Mathematical Society that Temple University will host the weekend of April 4,
1998. If the participants in those special sessions are included, the complete
list of speakers involved in this recognition of Professor Ehrenpreis is
impressively long and distinguished.
