This proposal will creat a learning center within the high school where a team
of four teachers supported by other persons from industry and universities will
guide students in self paced, individualized instruction through the use of
computers and other technology. Memorex- Telex and Apple Corporation have both
committed a significant number of computers and workstations, and will provide
personnel for various parts of the program. The teachers will develop courseware
and other materials. As the project develops various dissemination activities
will be planned and implemented, and a thorough evaluation design is proposed.
Cost sharing by the partners equals 336% of the National Science Foundation
grant.
