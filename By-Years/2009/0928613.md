The research objective of this award is to develop optimal design methodologies
that account for manufacturing defects and demand uncertainties in small-scale
structures. In engineering design, there is a natural tendency to push the
limits of capacity of existing materials or employ new high performance
materials. While this increases efficiency by using more sparse and slender
elements, the designs also become more susceptible to flaws that may impair
response. The research will address this issue by incorporating fabrication and
demand uncertainties into methods of topology optimization, which is an emerging
class of design tools for optimizing material distribution across a design
domain. The PIs will exploit the relationships between the model for the system
uncertainties and the mathematical forms used in the algorithms for topology
optimization. Furthermore, methods will be explored for identifying those
parameters whose uncertainties have a dominant influence on design. To ensure
that the methods can be practically applied, fabrication is included in the
scope of work. Tests results from fabricated specimens will be used to quantify
fabrication errors and provide feedback for updating the uncertainty models. If
successful, the results of this research will facilitate design of efficient
structures with optimized and/or tailored reliability. Potential applications
include high performance material microstructures, compliant mechanisms, and
tunable capacitors. The optimization under uncertainty theory will be
incorporated into a general (non-heuristic) topology optimization methodology to
ensure wide impact of the results. The educational plan of the project includes
curriculum development and research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate
education. It also includes engineering design outreach activities to Baltimore
Polytechnic High School. The investigators will leverage the visually appealing
aspects of topology optimization to attract undergraduates and high school
students to research opportunities provided by the project.
