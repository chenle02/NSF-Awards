0323024&lt;br/&gt;Hancock&lt;br/&gt;The specific aims of this proposal are
to:&lt;br/&gt;1) Design and construct microfabricated channels to which kinesin
molecular motors are attached for transporting and sorting
microtubules.&lt;br/&gt;2) Attach fluorescently labeled DNA oligonucleotides
(molecular beacons) to microtubules as bait, visualize binding and transport of
the nucleic acid cargo by fluorescence microscopy.&lt;br/&gt;3) Fabricate
monolithically encapsulated organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) with coupling
to the microtubule microchannels as local sources to excite the fluorescent
labels.&lt;br/&gt;4) Fabricate integrated photodetectors for local detection of
fluorescence signals. The photodetectors will be used in combination with the
OLEDs to detect fluorescent DNA bound to microtubules traveling in the
channels.&lt;br/&gt;5) Assemble a system consisting of a sample reservoir
connected to a transport channel, a detector, and bifurcation to sort cargo-
laden from empty microtubules, and a collection reservoir to deposit the
selected molecules of interest.&lt;br/&gt;
