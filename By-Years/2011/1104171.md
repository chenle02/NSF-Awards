In order to respond to the needs of south Florida's emerging bioscience industry
this project is designed to bring the Biotechnology Program at Palm Beach State
College (PBSC) to full capacity by fortifying key elements in the biotechnology
training pathway. Specific targets include increased rates of retention and
graduation, among biotechnology majors. Activities include: creating an active
learning community for students by offering student cohort activities such as
student internships and conference presentations; internal recruiting efforts by
creating activities to make current students in biology courses but not yet
committed to biotechnology aware of the potential of a career in biotechnology
and their potential for participating in such a program and by providing
professional development opportunities in biotechnology, as appropriate, for
both general biology faculty and community college advisors; creating a new
General Biology course as a general education course that emphasizes the
molecular biology basis of biotechnology, a course that may both attract the
general, not yet committed student and that may count towards their AA transfer
degree; establishing peer and alumni biotechnology tutoring and mentoring
programs to help students get maximum benefit from and progress at an
appropriate pace through their course and internship experiences; developing
rubrics in order to provide consistent feedback for students as they progress
through the program and to assess which students need additional tutoring
assistance. As part of creating learning communities the project is: hosting an
on campus Bi-Annual Student Poster Symposia and a Biotech Awareness Week;
encouraging students to present their work at meetings and conferences; and
creating a Student Ambassador Program. The intellectual merit of the program
lies in the rigor of the new courses being introduced. The lessons learned from
establishing the learning communities represent the broader impacts of the
project.
