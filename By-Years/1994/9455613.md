9455613 Maloney This project will develop a one semester physical science course
for non-science, especially elementary education, majors. This course represents
an important element in IUPF's teacher preparation sequence. The course will be
activity based with investigations and exercises designed to elicit students'
common-sense ideas about the systems and situations, challenge those ideas where
they disagree with the scientifically accepted ideas, and help the students
construct a new understanding of the concepts, relationships and principles that
apply. A limited set of investigative and reasoning processes, e.g., making
observations and inferences, proportional reasoning, and drawing, reading and
interpreting graphs, will be emphasized and used throughout the course. In order
to get the students to engage in the appropriate reasoning, and to give them
sufficient time to undergo conceptual change and construct a scientifically
acceptable understanding, only selected concepts, principles, relationships, and
topics will be explored. Several concepts and principles, e.g., area, volume,
density, and conservation of mass, will be examined because of their importance
in both chemistry and physics. In addition two fundamental topics, motion in a
straight line and the basics of compound formation, will be studied to
illustrate some of the contrasts between the two disciplines. The course
materials will emphasize pattern finding and analysis and will be designed so
that the students have to use qualitative means to work the tasks encountered.
