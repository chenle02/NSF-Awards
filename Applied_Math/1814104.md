Several inverse problems with applications to medical imaging, geophysical
imaging and non-destructive material testing are modeled as integral geometric
problems, which consist of reconstructing internal features of materials from
their cumulated integrals along a given family of trajectories. Examples include
the X-ray/Radon transform used in Computerized Tomography, the travel-time
tomography problem in seismology or geophysical prospection, and the Neutron
Spin Tomography problem, where a magnetic field inside a material must be
recovered from its "non-abelian" integrals. In this project, the investigator
and his collaborators focus on integral geometric problems where the complexity
lies in the type of object to be reconstructed, in the fact that the geometry of
propagation of information is curved, and in the nonlinear character of some of
these problems. For each of the problems considered, the task is to put in
mathematical terms the answer to the following questions: (i) Is the unknown
reconstructible from the given measurements and, if yes, how stable is the
inversion? (ii) How to reconstruct the unknown in practice? (iii) How to deal
with imperfections in the model and in the measurements (due to instrumental
noise for example) and how to quantify the uncertainty induced on the proposed
reconstructions?

This project focuses on some linear and nonlinear integral geometric problems
where unknowns are modeled as functions, tensors, connections over bundles or
sections of these bundles, and the measurements are integral functionals of the
unknowns. For various "solvable" settings, explicit reconstruction algorithms
will be derived and implemented whenever possible, assessing injectivity,
stability, implementation, and uncertainty quantification aspects of the inverse
problems at play. The proposed methods combine deep theoretical tools
(microlocal analysis, harmonic analysis, Clifford analysis and partial
differential equations on manifolds) with a concern for implementability, to
produce explicit answers, some of which already exist in non-explicit form.
Numerical validations will be provided to confirm the implementability of the
derivation and uncover the next challenges toward real-life applications.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
