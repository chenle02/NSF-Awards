The U.S.-Japan Workshop on Bridge Engineering is a meeting between American and
Japanese bridge engineers, which is conducted under the auspices of the
U.S.-Japan Panel of Wind and Seismic effects of the UJNR program. This meeting
includes a two-day workshop with technical presentations of the participants
related to recent advances of bridge engineering and a study tour of bridge
structures and organizations. Seven meetings have been conducted so far, and all
of them have been proven to be a very fruitful and productive experience for the
participants of both countries. The Workshop will be held in Illinois in May
1992.
