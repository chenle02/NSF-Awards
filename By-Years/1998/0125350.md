The researcher would conduct studies of the educational attainment of Asian
Americans of different generations from existing longitudinal data bases of high
school and college students. School performance includes the outcome of science,
mathematics, English, and social studies learning. The intent of the study is to
help understand whether and how Asian immigrants and their succeeding
generations achieve educational mobility in particular to help identify factors
that contribute to the differential outcomes of science and mathematics learning
among different generations. The study should help inform policies regarding the
role of public education institutions in providing education for new Americans.
This project will produce papers that will be published in academic literature
and distributed to government agencies. It will be of interest to the White
House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
