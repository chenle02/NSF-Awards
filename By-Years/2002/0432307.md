DaSilva&lt;br/&gt;0432307&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polyketides are a diverse group
of natural products with great significance as human therapeutics. Although they
are made in a variety of microorganisms, polyketides often are produced in their
natural hosts in minute quantities. To optimize production of these compounds
and for the generation of novel polyketides, heterologous hosts hold several
advantages. The specific attributes of yeast combined with success at the high-
level production of a fungal polyketide in Saccharomyces cerevisiae point to the
exceptional promise of this host for polyketide biosynthesis. The Principal
Investigator (PI) will develop and evaluate various strategies for introducing
and expressing active polyketide synthases in S. cerevisiae.&lt;br/&gt;
