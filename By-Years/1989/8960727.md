A high resolution, high performancecathode ray tube-charge coupled device
imaging system is planned.Phase I efforts will focus on demonstrating the
feasibility of fabricating a new high efficiency inorganic thin film phosphor on
a fiber optic faceplate, a necessary component in such an instrument.
Preparation of deposition targets, performing of physical vapor depositions of
the phosphors, and measurement of output performance and resolution will be the
principal tasks undertaken. If the work is successful, prototype development of
high performance CRT-CCD systems is expected in Phase II development.
