Detailed and precise pH profiles will be obtained in the equatorial Pacific
Ocean in conjunction with CO2 system measurements. The work entails measurements
of spectrophotometric pH on each seawater sample analyzed for total inorganic
carbon, CO2 partial pressure, and total alkalinity. Spectrophotometric
alkalinity measurements will permit assessments of the contribution of organic
protolytes to seawater total alkalinity. These measurements will be used to
assist in investigations of ocean-atmosphere carbon fluxes.
