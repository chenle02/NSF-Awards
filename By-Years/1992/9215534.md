This award supports a workshop on chemical effects on magnetization. Current
high-profile rock magnetic research in a variety of areas in the Earth Sciences
requires an in-depth understanding of the effects of chemical change on the
magnetization of inorganic and biogenic (or biologically mediated) magnetic
minerals. "Chemical change" we means a variety of processes: low- and high-
temperature alteration, diagenesis, and authigenesis. The compounds of interest
include hydroxides, oxides, and sulfides of iron. Similarly, "magnetization"
refers both to room temperature properties (controlled by crystal structure,
chemical composition, and grainsize) and to the natural remanent magnetization
produced by chemical and chemico-viscous processes. In order to have the
strongest impact on research in this interdisciplinary area, invites include (1)
basic rock magnetists, (2) applied rock magnetists (working in the areas of
magnetic anomalies, climate change, biomagnetism, sedimentary magnetic records,
etc.) and (3) the non-rock-magnetic specialists such as isotope geochemists,
biomagnetists, and soil chemists.
