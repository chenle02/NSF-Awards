9613111 Komanduri The use of cutting fluid in machining has been the standard
practice in metal working inudustry. Recent environmental constraints
necessitate innovations on dry machining or other techniques. The research
project is to develop novel nanocoating technologies on cutting tools for dry
machining. This research project will conduct the following investigations: (1)
synthesize the characterize multilayer nanocoating systems on cemented tungsten
carbide cutting tools by closed field unbalanced megnetron sputtering (CFUMS);
(2) optimize the nanocoating architecture, thickness of the carbide layer, metal
interlayer thickness and number of layers, and deposition conditions of CFUMS
for a given application; (3) evaluate multilayer nanocoating systems in dry
machining of selected work materials over a wide range of feeds, speeds, and
depths of cut; (4) evaluate the performance of the nanocoating systems in dry
machining and compare it with uncoated as well as candidate commercial coating
systems; (5) determine the micromechanisms of tool wear and relate to the
structure and composition of multilayer nanocoatings and (6) assess the payback
of dry machining with numerous nanocoatings and identify new applications for
nanocoatings as well as for dry machining of other materials. This project is a
collaboration between an industrial partner and the University. The outcome of
these studies could provide useful findings for the machining industry.
