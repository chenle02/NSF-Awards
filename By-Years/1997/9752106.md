Planning activities will enable Kings River Community College to develop plans
for preparing high-performance technicians within the mechanized agriculture
program. The College seeks to attract minorities and women as nontraditional
entrants into this skilled technology arena. Preparation for employment requires
adequate teaching/demonstration equipment and materials of a high technological
nature. Also required are students who have preparation in the various fields of
mathematics and physical science needed to understand the principals being
applied to this highly sophisticated application. Planning activities focus on
curriculum needs, project evaluation, setting up industrial partnerships,
strategies for encouraging participation by students underrepresented in
science, mathematics, and technology, and utilization of extant materials and
programs in mechanized agricultural technology.
