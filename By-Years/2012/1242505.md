This project develops new diagnostic and toxin detection products based on
biosensing mechanisms developed by extensive previous NSF support. The bio-
sensing mechanisms incorporated in the sensors are based on protein-laden
chemically woven hydrogels and are broadly applicable to aqueous borne toxins.
The project will focus on transforming fundamental science into practical
technologies that are driven and defined by the opportunities in multiple
markets including disease diagnostics, physician office laboratories, research
facilities, agriculture management, veterinary medicine, food processing and
quality control, allergen management, home health care, and nursing homes / long
term care facilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As conventional biosensors rely on
the associative binding between proteins (antigens and antibodies), this project
develops sensors based on the dissociation and displacement of protein binding
partners. This fundamental difference, and the new knowledge mentioned above,
will enhance science and technology at the conceptual level in addition to
improving the quality of current sensor technology, and thus likely change the
landscape of research in sensor development. The sensor technology has the
potential to benefit many segments of society, including rapid detection of
infectious diseases, accurate and fast assessment of drinking water quality, and
preparedness for emergency response and combating other threats. Nascent and
emerging market opportunities enabled by this technology for personal health
care will also be explored.
