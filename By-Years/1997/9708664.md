9708664 Miller In a series of meetings between 1987 and 1992, a consensus
developed in the academic community that the timing and magnitude of past
eustatic sea level changes and their relationships to stratigraphic sequences
should be determined by drilling borehole transects on passive margins. Three
crucial time intervals were identified: the Oligocene to Recent "Icehouse
World," when glacioeustatic changes were clearly operating; the Cretaceous
"Greenhouse World," which apparently lacked significant ice sheets: and the
Paleocene-Eocene "Doubthouse World," a time for which debate continues over the
existence of ice sheets. To address sequences and sea-level changes, the P.I.s
designed the "New Jersey Sea Level Transect" as a series of boreholes from the
onshore NJ Coastal Plain across the shelf to the slope and rise. The New Jersey
Sea Level Transect is the first step in a global campaign to evaluate
relationships between global sea level and passive continental margin sequences,
to determine the timing and amplitude of sea level variations, and to evaluate
mechanisms of sea level change. The onshore component, the NJ Coastal Plain
Drilling Project, has completed 4 boreholes at Island Beach, Atlantic City, Cape
May, and Bass River. This project is for the completion of the NJ Coastal Plain
Drilling Project by drilling a 2000 ft borehole at Corson's Inlet, NJ and a 1200
ft borehole at Parvin, NJ. ***
