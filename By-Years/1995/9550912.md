The university is creating a Data Engineering Laboratory to support database,
software engineering, knowledgebase, and other data-intensive computer science
courses that require substantial database system services. Using an existing,
dedicated database server (Sun Microsystems 690MP), PCs, and workstations, the
university is creating the instructional support software necessary to upgrade
five existing courses and to introduce two experimental courses to the computer
science curriculum. Existing courses benefit from a qualitatively superior
instructional environment and the experimental courses introduce new topics into
the computer science curricula. Course materials and instructional software are
available to the community on the Internet, via World Wide Web.
