This project determines an evolutionarily conserved mechanism by which a fat-
like substance (ceramide) in the cell membrane regulates motile cilia. Motile
cilia are protrusions of the cell membrane that work like whips and propel cells
or move fluids. They are important to clean the lung, move the early stage
embryo, and circulate growth factors in the brain. The investigator's laboratory
has discovered that ceramide is critical for the function of motile cilia in
green algae and mammalian cells. The investigator's research will now determine
the mechanism by which ceramide regulates motile cilia. An essential part of
this project is the inclusion of graduate and undergraduate students and their
education in evolutionarily conserved mechanisms. This education will be
extended to elementary, middle, and high school level students in innovative
workshops combining art and science ('Living clay' workshops and lectures at
local high schools).

It is critical for the function of motile cilia that their length and timing of
assembly/disassembly is tightly regulated. A critical barrier in understanding
this regulation is the lack of knowledge on dynamically activated factors for
cilium length regulation. Research so far has focused on the role of proteins in
the regulation of cilium length, and little is known about the role of lipids in
this process. The research goal is to provide knowledge on how lipids and
proteins interact in an evolutionarily conserved mechanism and how modulation of
lipid metabolism can be utilized to support the function of cilia. The research
focus is on the interaction of the sphingolipid ceramide with glycogen synthase
3 beta (GSK3) and other ciliogenic proteins in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (C.
reinhardtii) used as bona fide model organisms. The investigator's laboratory
will use state-of-the-art lipidomics and chemoproteomics approaches to determine
the function of ciliogenic lipid-protein complexes. The broader impact goal is
to educate students from the elementary school to the graduate school level on
evolutionarily conserved biological structures and mechanisms.
