John Light of the University of Chicago is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to develop theoretical methods for the accurate
description of quantum dynamics in molecular systems. These new methods will be
incorporated into general computer codes to treat classes of larger and
"difficult" molecules. The novel quantum methods to be developed are based on
two principles: localization (divide and solve-by-parts) and efficient phase
space representations. The former permits large problems to be broken into
smaller problems; the latter includes two new approaches to highly efficient
representations. Applications will be made to clusters such as water trimers,
and the quantum dynamics of high-energy, heavy, and/or floppy molecules. Since
this research involves the fundamentals of quantum descriptions at the molecular
level, the results are expected to be widely useful in reaction dynamics as well
as spectroscopy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theoretical chemistry attempts to
understand and predict the behavior of real systems, both microscopic and
macroscopic, based on knowledge of the fundamental interactions at the atomic
and molecular level. The fundamental processes of interest include reactions in
the gas phase, catalytic reactions at surfaces, absorption and emission of
radiation, photodissociation, solvation and reactions in condensed phase,
electron transfer, and diffusion. Theoretical and algorithmic advances are
required in order to assess quantum effects of these larger systems.
Quantitative understanding of such processes can lead, for example, to control
of combustion processes, synthesis of novel materials, and biological processes.
