biotechnology and related areas have access to the Department of Biology
Microscopy Center (DBMC), located in the Physics Building, which houses a
scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a fluorescent microscope. The addition of
a confocal laser microscope to the DBMC would provide a new state-of-the-art
