An Image Processing Instructional Laboratory to be used for a new senior course,
Image Processing &amp; Transmission, as well as for undergraduate compression,
analysis, segmentation, and applications established. A comprehensive
undergraduate course on image processing with a well integrated laboratory
component will benefit undergraduate students majoring in the electrical
engineering as well as in other engineering and scientific disciplines. Such a
course is not widely available. The requested equipment consists of four
diskless workstations, each with color monitor, and a file server, with
supporting peripheral equipment for hardcopy output and network interfacing.
Software packages for this equipment will be obtained from public domain sources
as well as from specific industrial laboratory sources. Black and white color
image data, both still and motion sequences, is already available, and more will
be acquired from outside sources.
