This research program is concerned with the properties and computation of the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Toeplitz matrices (whose element in the ith row
and jth column depends only on i-j). Such matrices arise naturally in the
discretization of differential equations as well as from series representation
of analytic functions. The main focus of this research program is to reduce the
computing cost for the eigenvalue problem to a point where it is essentially
independent of the size of the matrix. Eigenvalue problems for Toeplitz matrices
arise in all fields of applications. The results sought by this research program
will benefit all areas of science and engineering.
