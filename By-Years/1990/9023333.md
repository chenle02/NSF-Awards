The potential of computers is limited by how effectively users can access their
computing power via the user interface. This research attacks the problem of
usability by fundamental improvements to the interface development process. It
aims at a new generation of behaviorally-oriented techniques for representing
the details for the interaction between users and systems. Interactions are
represented by means of a User Interface Notation (UAN) which is being developed
for communication among persons with various professional backgrounds involved
in various phases of the development cycle of a specific interface. Experiments
will be performed to evaluate an existing UAN and to develop criteria for new
features and capabilities of the notation. A theoretical analyses will be done
based on cognitive theory and relating the approach to other work in human-
computer interactions. The results will be integrated into a set of coherent
requirements for the next generation of a UAN. The requirements will then form
the basis for the development of tools which use the revised UAN. The tools
include an editor and tools to generate code and skeletal user documentation
from a UAN description of task.
