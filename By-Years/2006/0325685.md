The project team combines expertise in high-performance scientific computing,
scientific visualization, and development of sophisticated software packages
(including Maple). Development of visualization tools will be performed in
collaboration with researchers at NCSA. Overall assessment and evaluation of the
project will be accomplished by a series of external reviews, conducted at key
points along the project timeline. Broader impacts of this research include
distribution of software to enhance scientific productivity, interdisciplinary
training of students, fostering collaboration among scientific disciplines, and
public outreach. The goal of this project is an open-source extensible software
package that will enhance productivity of researchers who can benefit from the
low-cost approach of parallel computing on commodity systems, particularly small
research groups and academic departments. This project will promote cross-
disciplinary training of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral
researchers in the critical area of high-performance scientific computing.
Development of visualization tools will result in demonstrations that enhance
the public outreach activities of team members to Philadelphia city schools and
the community.
