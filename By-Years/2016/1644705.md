This is a proposal from the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) to
establish an I-Corps Site that leverages this university's Institute for
Innovation and Entrepreneurship and other existing programs to immerse STEM
students into the world of commercialization. This initiative will connect the
Medical Center and other STEM areas with the business school and entrepreneurial
support programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are
NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and
support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the
marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking
opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their
work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Alabama at Birmingham is a large
institution, with 19,000 undergraduate students and 6000 graduate students,
providing a substantial pipeline for Site projects. Their graduate student
population is 2/3 female and 30% minority. Their activities surrounding
innovation and entrepreneurship were developed during the past three years,
including a partnership with Georgia Tech (an I-Corps Node). They plan to
include industry experts as part of the Site and, by including their medical
school, are likely to have a source of teams and technology for the I-Corps
program that transcends typical technology innovation expected from their
research community. The Site program that is being proposed is lean startup-
centric and the PI has taught the I-Corp curriculum nationally. Their Site
leadership is experienced and diversity is already strong in their existing
population.
