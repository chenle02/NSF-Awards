This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Fellowship in Plant Biology.
The applicant received her Ph.D. from the University of Massachusetts and her
Ph.D. research was in plant virology. She plans to carry out her postdoctoral
fellowship research in the laboratory of Dr. Martin Yanofsky at University of
California at San Diego. The proposed research entitled "Transcription factors
in flower development: the role of the AGAMOUS gene product" will broaden the
training of the Fellow into plant molecular genetics and developmental biology.
