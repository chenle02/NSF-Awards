This project is in the area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry and in the
subfield of analytical fluorescence spectroscopy. Professor Warner will study
interactions between cyclodextrans with a series of polyaromatic hydrocarbons
using a suite of spectroscopic methods. This research will use infrared
spectroscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy, x-ray crystallography and
fluorescence spectroscopy to elucidate the molecule details of complexation
between cyclodextrans and polyaromatic hydrocarbons together with the ternary
effects arising from addition of alcohols. The results from this research will
be useful in developing analytical measurements for naturally chiral compounds
and for compounds with induced chirality.
