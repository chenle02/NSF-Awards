The Principal Investigator will study aspects of the theory of Shimura
varieties. These are particular kinds of higher-dimensional surfaces whose rich
geometry and arithmetic puts them among the central objects of study in modern
mathematics. The goal is to find new relations between geometrically defined
quantities such as volumes and intersection multiplicities, and quantities that
come from other branches of mathematics, like representation theory, that have
no a priori geometric meaning. In addition to their importance in pure
mathematics, Shimura varieties play an essential role in the Langlands program,
which is of increasing interest in theoretical physics, and are important tools
for understanding elliptic curves and abelian varieties, which now play a major
role in cryptography. More broadly, the project concerns the theory of numbers
and arithmetic geometry. This is an area of research which has applications to
cyber security, through cryptography, and to some aspects of coding theory.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of the Principal Investigator's research
on Shimura varieties is to prove new relations between their geometric
invariants and L-functions. For example, the Principal Investigator will use
recent advances in the theory of Borcherds products and integral models to
express the arithmetic volumes of Shimura varieties of unitary and orthogonal
type as special values of L-functions. The Principal Investigator will also
prove new examples of generalized Gross-Zagier formulas, for example by
expressing the intersection multiplicities of Shimura curves embedded into the
Siegel threefold in terms of the central derivative of a Langlands L-function
attached to a cuspidal representation of GSp(4). Similar higher dimensional
formulas are also expected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
