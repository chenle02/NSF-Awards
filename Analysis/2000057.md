One key goal of pure mathematics is to classify highly abstract objects; in
doing so, invariants can serve to distinguish different types. The key
properties of a useful invariant are that it is computable and that it
distinguishes many different objects. It is challenging to determine such
invariants for dynamical systems, an important class of mathematical structure.
This project studies invariants of dynamical systems using the abstract concepts
of operator algebras, in particular C*-algebras. The project will involve
significant contributions from early-career researchers, graduate students, and
undergraduate students, who will benefit from training through research
involvement.

In more detail, given a dynamical system one can (often) construct a C*-algebra
using a groupoid construction. The K-theory of this C*- algebra is an invariant
of the original dynamical system. An important question is to determine the
distinguishing power and computability of this invariant at the dynamical system
level. The investigator will study the range of the Elliott invariant, which
consists of K-theory and tracial information, for C*-algebras constructed from
minimal and hyperbolic dynamical systems. The investigator and collaborators
will systematically construct minimal dynamical systems with prescribed K-theory
and will compute the K-theory of specific examples of C*-algebras associated to
hyperbolic dynamical systems called Smale spaces.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
