9503714 Strittmatter This Americas Program award will provide support for
establishing collaboration between astronomers at the University of Arizona and
the Carnegie Institution of Washington in the United States, and Mexican
astronomers from the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM). The
proposed work, headed by Prof. Peter Strittmatter of the University of Arizona
and Prof. Gloria Koenigsberger, Director of the Institute of Astronomy of UNAM,
has as long term goals the construction of a Magellan class 6.5m
optical/infrared telescope which will facilitate astronomical research by
Mexican and U.S. astronomers, the development of state-of-the-art
instrumentation for this and other such telescopes, and the advancement of
optical design and fabrication technology in both Mexico and the U.S.
Researchers will visit Mexican sites at UNAM, the Mexican National Observatory
at San Pedro Martir, the National Institute for Astrophysics, Optics, and
Electronics in Puebla, and the Institute for Optics in Leon in order to plan
collaborative work, develop a site testing program at San Pedro Martir, carry
out critical studies in engineering and optics, and develop active collaboration
in astronomical sciences based on existing observational facilities. ***
