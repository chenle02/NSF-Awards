In this project the P.I. will analyze existing samples from Legs 28 and 29 of
DSDP from the Indian ocean. The data will be used to (a) evaluate the extent of
variation of isotopic composition of the Indian ocean MOR mantle, and (b)
determine whether Pacific mantle has migrated westward through time and, if so,
at what rate.
