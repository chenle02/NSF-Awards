The PI will continue his work on the estimation of in situ stress magnitudes
from records of wellbore failure in ODP boreholes. The oceanic basins have a
notable lack of stress measurements. The approach will be to use the borehole
televiewer and formation microscanner logs and measure rock strength in the
laboratory. Numerical modelling of the lithospheric stress based on thermal
relaxation data will also be conducted. This work will provide useful data about
the stress regime of oceanic crust.
