The problem of communicating research results and other technical information to
the lay public is often overlooked, yet it represents a widespread and chronic
problem. This information transfer dilemma is even more pronounced in cross-
cultural situations where language compatibility and cultural relevancy are
added to the barriers of technical jargon and accessibility. Such is the case
with research in the Arctic. The objective of the proposed pilot project is to
test a means of communicating research activities to arctic Native resident
peoples in order to ascertain whether or not, and in what ways, their
understanding of the value of such activities may be enhanced. Experience leads
to the current conclusion that a combination of video programming and graphic
display posters would best accomplish this end, thus, a short VHS-format
videotape would be produced explaining, in lay terminology, the activities and
relevance of research at the Toolik Lake Field Station on Alaska's north slope.
The video, along with graphic poster displays, would be shown in four arctic
villages and the response of viewers evaluated. Positive results could lead to
the use of this approach for regular communication of research activities to
local residents throughout the Arctic. This proposal responds to the intent of
the Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984 to involve residents in all aspects
of research.
