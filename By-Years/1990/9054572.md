This proposal seeks funding to support improvement of mathematics education in
aviation technology programs. AATC's partner is Northwest Airlines which has
pledged $300,000 or more of in-kind aviation equipment and training aids and
$100,000 of in-kind personnel costs. There are three major goals: (1)
strengthening the mathematics component of the two aviation technology programs
offered by AATC by the design, development, pilot-testing and revision of three
new courses in collaboration with avionics engineers; (2) exposing students in
their aviation technology programs to "the real-world workplace of a major
employer of aviation technicians"; (3) increasing the opportunities for women
and minorities in aviation technical education. Each of these goals has two or
more objectives. Federal support will assist the college in creating a new
faculty position in mathematics to its staff as well as a new clerical position
to manage the logistics of the partnership after the end of the NSF-sponsored
project.
