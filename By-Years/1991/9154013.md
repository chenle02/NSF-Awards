This project involves the planning and conducting of a conference to render
technical assistance to States and Territories which are developing initiatives
for reforming mathematics, science, and technology education. One component
entails the analysis of proposals submitted under NSF's Statewide Systemic
Initiatives Program and the development of materials for the conference,
including a technical assistance document. Another component focuses on the
design and conducting of the conference itself.
