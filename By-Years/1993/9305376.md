9305376 Gerla This project involves the problem of supporting connectionless
service in an ATM network. The urgency of this problem stems from the need to
interconnect LANs and MANs (typically, operated in a connectionless mode) to the
connection oriented ATM. The problem is quite challenging because the ATM
network requires that users set up connections and declare in advance the
expected traffic on each connection. The network then uses this information to
allocate bandwidth to individual users. Connectionless sources, on the other
hand, are by their nature unpredictable, thus eluding the ATM bandwidth
allocation strategy, and potentially compromising network efficiency. In this
project, a scheme - the Connectionless Server (CLS) overlay network - is
investigated. This scheme permits efficient handling of connectionless traffic
in ATM. Various design options (topology connectivity, bandwidth allocation,
buffer management, etc.) are examined, and performance models and criteria for
their selection are developed. The CLS scheme will be compared with other
connectionless support schemes (Bandwidth Reservation and On-the-Fly
Transmission) and the respective pros and cons will be evaluated. Finally, a
hybrid scheme combining features of al of the schemes will be examined in an
attempt to combine their benefits while avoiding their pitfalls. ***
