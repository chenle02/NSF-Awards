The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable smaller chargers, power factor
convertors and switches in applications ranging from small applications such as
implanted pace-makers, mobile-phones, computer to large applications such as
automobile, machinery to very large applications such as ships, locomotives,
traditional and renewable energy power plants. While the impact of the power
switching product to be developed using this technology in this phase II project
is broad, the use of this thin crystalline technology can have even broader
impact across all modern semiconductor devices such as LED, PV, flexible CMOS
and passive devices. The project will potentially enable thin form-factor
packages in this broad range of power electronics
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) Phase I project addresses challenges to further scaling of power MOSFETs
which are one of the key building blocks of the electronic revolution we have
witnessed over the last few decades. While the feature size of transistors has
been constantly shrinking, the substrate thickness has been increasing. These
substrates are currently mechanically thinned to minimize the negative impact of
this increased thickness on performance and form-factor. There are significant
challenges to continue this trend and the thin crystalline technology and device
architecture proposed here can enable continued scaling of device metrics over
the next decade with favorable cost structures. This effort will focus on the
following specific technical challenges to bring it to market. (1) Develop power
MOSFETs with improved switching characteristics using the thin crystalline
technology (2) Develop the process technology on large area wafers used in
current production lines (3) Develop the low-form factor package using the
metallization features of thin-crystalline exfoliated technology (4)
Characterize the device for performance and insertion into high volume de-risk
(5) Develop a roadmap for a family of products that is sustainable over a decade
to justify significant manufacturing investment to bring this technology to
market.
