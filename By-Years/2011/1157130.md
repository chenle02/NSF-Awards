This US-Singapore project will catalyze a new international collaboration
between the PI's experimental group at SUNY-Buffalo and a theoretical group at
the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. During the PI's team visit to
Singapore, the PI's recent experimental results on mechanical stability of
atomic-sized conductors as small as a single-atom bridge will be analyzed
theoretically, focusing on the size dependence of the modulus enhancement and
deformation modes at the Fermi length scale. This will lay the foundation for
the longer term objective of understanding the role of crystal structure and
atomic coordination, temperature, and surface energy, on the stability of
atomic-sized samples. &lt;br/&gt;Involvement of students in this activity will
help to develop their capacities to be comfortable with both experimental and
theoretical approaches. The project will help establish a theoretical and
quantitative&lt;br/&gt;framework to explain the mechanics of quantum and semi-
classical conductors.
