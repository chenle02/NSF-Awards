This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop computer
software that automatically analyzes medical images to diagnose brain diseases
affecting the elderly (such as Alzheimer's disease) that cause difficulty with
memory, thinking, judgment, and other normal functions. Such diseases affecting
the elderly share similar symptoms, so they can be very difficult to diagnose
and it is even more difficult to predict whether the patient will worsen. The
software we will develop will use a patient's brain scan to determine which
disease the patient actually has, and if the disease is Alzheimer's, the
software will determine the stage of progression of the disease, and will aim to
predict future decline. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of
this research are numerous. This project will create new jobs by launching a new
business that will lead to the first product of its kind. The market for the
proposed product is very large, and the applicant company is well placed for
commercialization, as its parent companies are already in the business of
providing brain-image analysis for the pharmaceutical industry, and have already
been providing preliminary diagnostic reports on patients for select clinicians
on a research basis. During the project, input and feedback will be sought from
a major drug company, a major imaging manufacturer, and leading physicians, to
ensure that the product meets real-world needs of patient and health-care
providers, and carefully considers critical issues for commercialization.
