The proposed work is intended to help society move toward sustainable materials
usage by modeling recycling system performance and relating it to product
design. The model will account for disassembly, value capture, hazardous
materials disposal and materials reclamation. Performance will be evaluated in
terms of cost, energy and environmental impact. A central feature of this
modeling effort will be to capture the performance of unit processes and the
system in terms of output purity and wastes. Product information will be
obtained from a team of designers, public documentation, and product tear down
analysis to be conducted by students in courses on Environmentally Benign
Manufacturing. Data and recycling equipment parameters will be obtained from
existing operations and analytical models. Collaborators on this project are:
Hewlett-Packard, including their joint recycling venture with Noranda, the
National Electronics Manufacturing Initiative, RRT Design & Construction,
Concurrent Technologies Corporation, Ford, and Chaparral Steel. In addition, Dr.
Stanley Gershwin of M.I.T. will assist us in system modeling and design. This
work will focus initially on the reclamation steps for electronics products, and
will lead to design for recycling tools for designers. Specific attention will
be given to takeback legislation in Japan, Europe, and the United States.

The contributions of this work will be to challenge current design thinking,
educate the future engineers in design consequences, build recycling system
models, and to develop a methodology to evaluate product designs for recycling.
This work will also result in significant education impacts to society through:
1) direct involvement of both graduate and undergraduate student in the product
analysis part of this project, and 2) dissemination of our work through
conference and journal papers.
