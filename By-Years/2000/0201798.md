This project will use a number of indices to study the asymmetric ring current
in the Earth's inner magnetosphere. The indices to be used include Asym-H, Dst,
VBs, and AL. The analysis will use a combination of case histories, statistical
analysis, superposed epoch analysis, linear prediction filtering, LT-UT maps of
magnetic perturbations and inversion of line current models of storm time
currents. One hypothesis to be tested is that there is no systematic westward
propagation of ground perturbations following substorm expansions as the
standard substorm models suggests there should be. A database of events used in
this analysis will be made available to the scientific community.
