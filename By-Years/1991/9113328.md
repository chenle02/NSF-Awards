This award provides funds for the establishment of a Research Training Group in
Positive Political Economy. The faculty group is composed of 12 distinguished
Political Scientists and Economists from the Government and Economics
Departments and the Kennedy School at Harvard University and from the Political
Science and Economics Departments of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The funds will provide stipends for graduate students and postdoctoral trainees,
purchase computers needed for trainee research, aid with costs of trainee
recruitment and provide part-time secretarial assistance. Institutional
commitments will aid in purchase of equipment and in other aspects of the
group's efforts. Addressing issues and problems at the interface of political
science and of economics, research in positive political economics shows, in
general, how observed differences among institutions affect political and
economic outcomes in various social, economic, and political systems, and how
the institutions themselves change and develop in response to individual and
collective beliefs. More rigorous than traditional political science and more
concerned with nonmarket institutions than traditional economics, positive
political economics focuses on how political and economic institutions
constrain, direct and reflect individual behavior in attempting to explain
social outcomes such as production, resource allocation and public policy.
