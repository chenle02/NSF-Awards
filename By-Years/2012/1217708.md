This project develops a theory for characterizing the performance of parallel
data structures and parallel algorithms that use parallel structures. Standard
metrics for parallel algorithms, such as "work" (total amount of computation)
and "span" (critical-path length), do not naturally generalize in the presence
of contention on shared data. Moreover, standard approaches for analyzing
sequential data structures, such as amortization, do not seem to generalize when
data structures are parallel, in part because the performance depends on the
properties of the underlying parallel task schedulers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
specific research goals are as follows: &lt;br/&gt;(1) Investigate a methodology
for designing and analyzing parallel algorithms that use data structures,
especially amortized ones. &lt;br/&gt;(2) Design parallel schedulers that
ameliorate the contention on parallel data structures. &lt;br/&gt;(3) Design
parallel data structures that perform provably well with these
schedulers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today parallel computing is ubiquitous. Modern
computation platforms---smartphones to network routers, personal computers to
large clusters and clouds---each contain multiple processors. Writing parallel
code that provably scales well is challenging and techniques for analyzing
sequential algorithms and data structures generally do not apply to parallel
code. This project will develop a theoretical foundation for characterizing the
scalability of parallel programs that contend for access to shared data.
