The Indiana Higher Education Telecommunication System (IHETS) on behalf of its
member institutions, proposes to establish an IHETS Data Network. The proposal
requests partial funding for participation in NSFNET through a connection with
CICNET, the regional network attaching to NSFNET in the Indiana Area as well as
partial start-up funds for the necessary routers, circuits, and operating
support to facilitate the fullest possible participation. The educational
institutions that will participate include: Anderson University, Ball State
Univ., Butler Univ., DePauw Univ., Earlham College, Franklin College, Hanover
College, Manchester College, St. Joseph College, Taylor Univ., Univ. of
Evansville, Univ. of Indianapolis, Univ. of Southern Indiana, Valparaiso Univ.,
Vincennes Univ., Vincennes Univ., and Wabash College. The network will provide a
consistent statewide architecture for NSFNET access for a broad variety of
entities engaged in education and research. This cooperative network will
provide gateways to regional, national, and international networks and will be
consistent with their standards. It will further the institutions' work in
enhancing the state's economic development through a well-educated workforce,
accessible training opportunities, and research and development partnerships.
Another goal of the network is to facilitate collaborative projects and sharing
of resources between institutions, including those outside the state. The
universities need greater functionality and network speed to be able to access
supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being able to
implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty research will
benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the schools to
explore innovative educational resources.
