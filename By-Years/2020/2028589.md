The COVID-19 health crisis has resulted in a critical shortage of protective
facemasks, such as N95 respirators, required by many clinical workers. N95
respirators (often called N95 masks) are constructed of non-woven polypropylene
fiber layers that are bound together to create sufficient voids that retain
particles, but allow for relatively free airflow. While N95 respirators were
designed for single use, their short supply has become acute and potentially
life threatening especially for workers in clinical settings. As this shortage
leads some institutions to consider sterilization and re-use of N95 respirators,
it is critically important to determine whether N95 materials retain their
fundamental protective features (filtration efficiency, resiliency, etc) after
sterilization. In this project, funded by the Directorate of Mathematical and
Physical Sciences, Professor Richard Peltier and his students are evaluating the
airflow and particulate retention properties of N95 materials before and after
different sterilization processes. The sterilization processes include
ultraviolet light, vaporized hydrogen peroxide, and microwave radiation. The
data produced by the study are being made available to the public in real
time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to identify effects caused by
fundamental structural changes in N95 respirators that are subjected to
different re-sterilization protocols. The specific focus is on the sub-micron
range of particle size (6 â€“ 900 nanometers). The central question is whether re-
sterilization changes not only the total number of particles that can pass
through the material, but if the distribution of escaping particle sizes
changes. To address this question, Professor Peltier employs single particle
counting/electric mobility technology. The broader impact to society is
important information on the re-usability of N95 respirators that are designed
for single use, but are now in short supply because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
While the results of this project will ultimately be published in the
traditional literature, draft results are being released to a public website as
soon as they are produced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant is being awarded
using funds made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security
(CARES) Act supplemental funds allocated to MPS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
