In this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project in sociology
between Dusko Sekulic, Zagreb University, and Randy Hodson, Indiana University,
the investigators will study and compare structural changes in labor force and
mobility processes that stem from technological change. The researchers will
look at the structure of the Yugoslav labor force compared to other industrial
and industrializing nations. In particular, similarities and idfferences between
the U.S. and Yugoslav labor structure and mobility patterns will be examined.
Survey data has already been collected in the Yugoslav Republic of Croatia and
at least two other Yugoslav Republics will be surveyed in the coming year. The
U.S. side will assist in data analysis and provide comparable information on the
United States. This is an important international project. The International
Sociological Association for Social Stratification and Mobility has strongly
encouraged comparative research in this field to enable comparative analysis
across divergent societies. Inclusion of Yugoslavia in the data base will
provide information about a highly pluralistic and socialist country. This
project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on Scientific and
Technological Cooperation and is supported through a joint fund consisting of
matching contributions from the governments of the United States and Yugoslavia.
The U.S. contribution is provided annually by the Department of State. No NSF
funds are involved. Grants are made to the principal scientific institution in
Yugoslavia, but include dollar funds for U.S. scientist travel to Yugoslavia and
for Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in the U.S.
