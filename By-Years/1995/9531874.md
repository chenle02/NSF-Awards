9531874 Spall This project is a contribution to the modeling component to be
carried out as part of the Atlantic Circulation and Climate Experiment (ACCE)
under the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE). The focus will be on
upgrading existing isopycnal models, data assimilation, and integrating
different types of regional models. Comparisons will be made among different
modeling approaches in order to assess the strngths and weaknesses of each, and
to determine the best overall approach for including ocean variability in
climate modeling. Particular attention will be paid to assimilating, into the
models, data from the field phase of ACCE, as well as from historical data
bases. In this particular project, the PI will focus on the physics that control
the time dependent spreading of intermediate and deep waters away from their
source regions in the subpolar gyre, and the influences of these water masses on
the basin-scale upper ocean flow and Sea Surface Temperature. Specific
influences include baroclinicity, bottom topography, isopycnal and diapycnal
mixing, eddy fluxes, and time dependence in partitioning the waters into
boundary current transports and interior recirculation gyres.
