The objective of this research is to develop a high performance computationally
efficient method for real-time production control of complex manufacturing
systems. Attention will be focused on distributed production control methods
that are "guided" by the solution of a continuous flow (fluid) approximation of
the production system. The continuous flow model will incorporate important
production control decisions such as part release, routing, and machine
scheduling, and will provide part release and operation-specific production
targets for the system over a sufficiently long time. These targets will guide
the actual discrete production control decisions via simple distributed (local)
feedback policies implemented at each machine. The vast reduction in
computational complexity of the production control problem achieved by the
continuous flow approximation allows the computation (and updating) of the
continuous production targets in real time. The actual distributed control
decisions require very little computation. Thus the approach is expected to
provide a viable real-time production control method.
