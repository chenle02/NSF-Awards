9313541 Daigneau The University of Rochester will use this award from the NSF to
repair the environmental systems and renovate the interiors of constant
temperature boxes located in Hutchison Hall, their main biological research and
teaching facility. The efforts of the biology faculty at this institution
include research and teaching in modern molecular, cellular, developmental and
evolutionary biology and ecology, with particular emphasis on research and
training in modern molecular genetic techniques. Most of the constant
temperature boxes in this facility are 20 years old and are subject to frequent
mechanical failure. Their deteriorating interiors are poorly lit and unappealing
to prospective students and faculty. They are difficult to keep clean and free
of microorganismal contamination that is incompatible with their use for
biochemical experiments, for sterile culture of bacteria, yeast, protozoa and
tissue culture. The repair and renovations planned will result in invaluable
savings, not only in reduced energy costs and maintenance, but also in direct
costs to research and teaching programs that occur when experiments fail and
must be repeated. This project will affect the research and teaching efforts of
19 faculty, 23 postdoctoral level researchers, 50 graduate level students and
about 50 undergraduate students while enabling the university to more fully
support research involving biotechnology. ***
