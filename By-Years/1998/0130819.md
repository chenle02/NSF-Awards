The investigator and his colleagues consider new directions for the development
of default model uncertainty input specifications for Bayesian model selection
and model averaging. For the problem of model space prior specification,
distributions are developed that dilute probability within neighborhoods of
redundant models, thereby providing a more appropriate representation of
ignorance. For the problem of parameter space prior specification, the
predictive properties of model averaging are investigated for various prior
formulations. In particular, focusing on the frequentist consequences of prior
misspecification, new formulations are developed that maintain near-minimax
behavior with only a minor degradation of predictive potential. For Bayesian
modeling of large data sets, new adaptive formulations are developed that
accommodate local as well as global structure. This includes new adaptive
hierarchical modeling formulations as well as a new framework for simultaneous
model and data selection. The goals of theoretical optimality and practical
feasibility are considered throughout.

The ultimate objective of this research is to enhance the potential of Bayesian
statistical methods for discovering and modeling systematic relationships
between variables in large multi-variable data sets. The explosive growth of
information technologies has led to the proliferation of such data sets across
widely diverse fields in business and science. Such methods offer a general
approach towards improving explanations and predictions of many varied
phenomenon such as, for example, consumer behavior, disease incidence, financial
turbulence, industrial pollution and school efficiency. Bayesian statistical
methods, in particular, offer the promise of optimally distinguishing systematic
structure from random noise, which is of critical importance for effective
mining of large, detailed data sets. The main thrust of this research is on the
development of automatic implementations and richer formulations of these
methods that will more fully exploit their statistical potential.
