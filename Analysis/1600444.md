This project focuses on two areas of mathematics: namely, partial differential
equations and harmonic analysis. Both of them have close connections with the
physical world. Every partial differential equation models some physical
phenomenon, such as fluid and atmospheric dynamics, particle interactions,
behavior of spins in a ferro-magnet, etc. The differential equations that the
principal investigator will study in this project are no exception. Harmonic
analysis is another area of mathematics with deep implications, such as
compressed sensing with applications to signal processing, photography, computed
tomography, etc. Although of a varying flavor, all the problems under study in
this project have one common feature: trying to understand structure and
determining means to measure it.

Parts of this project focus on analyzing the long-time dynamics of dispersive
partial differential equations. The equations considered in the project have a
physical background: the Dirac-type equations and systems model most of the
elementary particles and their interactions, while the Schrodinger-maps equation
is the Heisenberg model in ferro-magnetism. From a mathematical point of view,
the principal investigator is pursuing open problems whose solutions are of
broad interest to the scientific community. The long-time dynamics of partial
differential equations is a very active field of research that has witnessed
some major breakthroughs over the past few years, but in which many fundamental
questions have yet to be addressed. Another part of the project focuses on
multilinear restriction estimates and their applications. This theory brings
together ideas and tools from a mix of fields (e.g., analysis, combinatorics,
incidence geometry, differential geometry, algebraic topology). In turn, the
multilinear theory has applications to fundamental problems in harmonic
analysis, partial differential equations, combinatorics, and number theory.
