The goal is to understand the virus-cell interactions that occur during
reovirus infection of mammalian cells, with emphasis on determining those virus
functions that are responsible for metabolic perturbations and eventual death of
the host cell. Attention will be focussed on the proteins encoded by the
reovirus S1 genome segment, o1, the virus cell attachment protein, and o1S(p14),
whose function is presently unknown. The specific objectives are to determine
the function(s) of sigms-1-5 in the replication cycle of reovirus and to
investigate the possible involvement of sigma-1-S in the alteration of host cell
metabolism. Antibodies have recently been prepared which react specifically to
subcellular fractionation studies designed to determine the intracellular
localization of sigma-1-s during reovirus multiplication. The interaction(s) of
sigma-1-S with other reovirus and cellular proteins, or nucleic acids will also
be determined. The proposed research will help determine the function of o1S and
the effect of both sigma-1-S and sigma-1 on the host cell. This information will
provide a more complete comprehension of the complex virus-host cell
interactions that occur during virus multiplication.
