This project will continue the development of phosphorus-carbon bond-forming
reactions. New catalytic reactions are proposed based on hypophosphorous acid
and its derivatives, and on H-phosphinates to provide atom-economical processes.
Specifically, these efforts involve a) P-H activation in alkyl phosphinates
under transition-metal catalysis, including further developments of the
palladium- and nickel-catalyzed hydrophosphinylations discovered in the
principal investigator's laboratory; b) P-H activation in H-phosphinates; and c)
phasing out phosphorus trichloride in the manufacturing of organophosphorus
compounds, thereby reducing the environmental impact and energy-demand
associated with chlorine usage through the catalytic preparation and use of
H-phosphinates. H-Phosphinate derivatives possess an oxidation state in the
middle of the range for phosphorus, and they can be derivatized into a plethora
of other important functional groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the
Chemical Synthesis program is supporting the research of Professor Jean-Luc
Montchamp of the Department of Chemistry at Texas Christian University.
Professor Montchamp's research efforts revolve around the development of
methodology for the formation of P-C and P-O bonds under catalytic conditions.
Such chemistry will contribute to environmentally benign methods for the
chemical synthesis of organophosphorus compounds, which are important in the
manufacturing of many products, such as therapeutic agents, agrochemicals, and
phosphine ligands for catalysis.
