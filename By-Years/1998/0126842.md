Engineering - Civil (54)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project implements a
sophisticated research technique, Planar Laser-Induced Florescence (PLIF), into
a safe, versatile, and robust instructional tool at the University of Colorado.
It adapts research and instructional implementations at Stanford University. The
PLIF system is being incorporated into a dedicated teaching flume that students
are using to visualize fluid flow and the effect of various interactions on the
flow pattern. Five faculty members are incorporating the facility into their
courses. Assessment tools include student surveys, open-ended interviews,
written test, and course evaluations. The group is preparing a web site, a
workshop, and engineering education publications describing the construction and
implementation details along with assessment results.
