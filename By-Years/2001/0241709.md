This dissertation research project constructs a hierarchical logistic regression
model for the mean of a binary response variable conditional on
poststratification cell. The object is to produce congressional district-level
opinions from national surveys.

This approach combines the modeling approach often used in small-area estimation
with the population information used in poststratification. The NSF dissertation
research grant will be used to purchase data from the US Census Bureau to obtain
reliable estimates of the joint population distributions of sex, ethnicity, age,
and education at the congressional district-level. In order to poststratify on
all the variables listed above, along with the congressional district, we need
the joint population distribution of the demographic variables within each
congressional district. Currently, the U.S. Census only provides without charge
the joint distributions of sex, ethnicity, and age. The model has produced
reliable measures that the state-level.
