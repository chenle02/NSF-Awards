Sampling equipment is being installed on the vessels SSV Corwith Cramer and SSV
Westward. These vessels are being used for undergraduate education in the Sea
Education Association (SEA) Semester program and for high school through adult
education in SEA Seminar programs. SEA is expanding its sampling capabilities
into two areas: subsurface water sampling and coastal environmental and
geological surveys. Intelligent rosette sampling systems are permitting accurate
deep water sampling and beach/landscape survey gear to be used in field trips in
Woods Hole and during the various stops made by each vessel during research
cruises. SEA's primary goal in equipping the vessels is to install a multi
component system of sampling and analytical gear that enables users with a wide
range of technical backgrounds to participate in modern oceanographic research.
