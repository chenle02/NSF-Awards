Merritt, David 96-17088 Dr. Merritt will conduct research with two goals. The
first is to understand the distribution of dark matter in disk and elliptical
galaxies through its observed effects on the luminous components. The second is
to determine the importance of massive black holes for the structure and
evolution of galaxies, both through theoretical studies and through a survey for
massive black holes in nearly galaxies using HST. Studies of the formation and
evolution of ealactic disks are planned in addition to the two main projects.
