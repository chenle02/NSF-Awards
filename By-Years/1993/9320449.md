9320449 Miller This award is for the continued development and scientific
application of a method whereby the component of the neutral wind along a
magnetic meridian can be derived from existing ground-based measurements of the
height of the F2 layer. The meridional wind is derived by a comparison of the
modeled layer height with the measured height. This method can produce results
comparable with other methods, such as Fabry-Perot interferometry and
incoherent- scatter radar, and has the advantage that measurements of the height
of the F2 layer are already being made routinely and systematically on a global
scale. The strength and variability of the meridional wind is of major
importance to the understanding of the energetics and composition of the
Thermosphere and Ionosphere. It is perhaps the most influential free parameter
in thermosopheric photochemical models. This study will increase our
understanding of the magnitude and variability of the meridional wind by
providing global wind values during measurement campaigns and by organizing the
results into a climatological description of thermospheric dynamics. ***
