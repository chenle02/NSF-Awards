The 53rd Annual Maize Genetics Conference will be held March 17 - 20, 2011 at
St. Charles (IL). At this conference, members of the maize community present and
discuss their most recent research results covering a wide range of topics
including classical genetics, molecular genetics, and genomics. The Maize
Genetics Conference provides an outstanding opportunity for undergraduate and
graduate students to meet and interact with scientists in the field, to discuss
their research ideas as talks or posters, and to begin to establish the
scientific networks that will prove invaluable throughout their careers. The
funding provided by NSF will broaden participation and help defray the costs of
participation of students from the U.S. scientific community.
