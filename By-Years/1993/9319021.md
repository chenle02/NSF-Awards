ABSTRACT P.I. Maryellen Ruvolo SBR-9319021 The molecular DNA sequence data
obtained in this study will make several important contributions to primate
systematics and to our understanding of molecular evolution. First, this study
will evaluate several alternative hypotheses about the relationships of two
major primate groups, the New World and Old World monkeys. Combining molecular
data from several unlinked gene loci, as this study will do, will increase
confidence in any emerging molecular consensus phylogeny - there are a number of
unresolved issues at this level. Second, this study will contribute to an
extensive molecular evolutionary survey of a mitochondrial gene throughout the
mammalian radiation. This will mean that we can analyze the molecular evolution
of a mitochondrial gene over a grat time depth in diverse organisms, uncovering
patterns which might not otherwise be ovservable. Third, this research will
study an example of molecular adaptation in detail - particularly the rate of
increase in the COII gene change in higher primates. Fourth, the research will
contribute to testing three general theories determining rates of molecular
evolution - a) "male driven molecular evolution," b) the "nucleotide generation
hypothesis" of mutation rates, and c) the "metabolic rate hypothesis." The
project also has a strong training component for young professionals in
molecular biology and anthropology. *** P\anthro\jfried\9319021.abs \ d f " $ 8
