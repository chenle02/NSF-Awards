MIT is conducting a second two-week summer workshop for 40 college and
university physics teachers to exchange ideas and designs for advanced
pedagogical experiments in modern physics and to study the experiments currently
in use in the MIT Junior Physics Laboratory for the purpose of evaluating them
for possible reproduction and use in similar courses at their home institutions.
The MIT Junior Lab experiments are designed for students who have completed an
introductory course in modern physics and are taking concurrently an
introductory course in quantum mechanics. The experiments provide hands-on
experience with the phenomena of particle, nuclear, atomic, condensed matter,
statistical, and astrophysics. This second summer workshop, like the first one
held in 1992, will assist the national effort to improve the quality of
undergraduate physics education.
