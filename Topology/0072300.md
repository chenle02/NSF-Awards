The aim of the present project is to study certain connections between
mathematics and mathematical physics. The area of mathematics concerned is
Algebraic topology, which employs methods of algebra to investigate properties
of topological spaces (shapes) which remain unchanged (invariant) under
continuous deformation. Among such properties or invariants, a distinguished
role is played by certain invariants of linear nature, known as generalized
cohomology theories. The main goal of this project is studying interpretations
and interactions of such cohomology theories with certain areas of physics,
geometry and algebraic geometry (spaces of solutions of algebraic equations).

Concretely, the investigator focuses on two areas. The first object is finding a
geometric (or physical) model of elliptic cohomology. It is conjectured that
elliptic cohomology can be recovered by infinite loop space theory from a
category of holomorphic conformal field theories. The other area concerns the
study of Morava K-theories in a homotopy category of algebraic varieties
introduced by Voevodsky.
