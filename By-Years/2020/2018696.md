Mobile money has been shown to reduce aggregate poverty and improve outcomes for
households and businesses. However, not everyone has equal access to this
important economic tool. In low income communities, women lag behind men in
participation in both mobile money and labor markets. This research project will
use experimental methods to study how discrimination against women in the mobile
money market affects their labor market participation, human capital formation,
and other social outcomes. It also studies whether employing women as mobile
money agents decreases labor market discrimination against women generally and
improves their social outcomes. The results of this research will provide
guidance on policies to decrease labor markets against women but could also
provide mechanisms to decrease poverty and reduce income inequality. Hiring
women as mobile money agents offers an opportunity to increase economic
opportunities for women, change social attitudes towards women's labor force
participation, and improve their access to mobile money.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research uses a randomized controlled
trial to measure the causal effects of employing women as mobile money agents on
the economic and other social outcomes in low income environments. It also
studies the effects of work on the incomes, skill accumulation, and autonomy of
women compared to men; and whether the availability of female mobile money
agents increases the use of mobile money by female customers. The research will
study how female labor supply responds to the number of women working as mobile
money agents by randomly assigning subsidies to 500 shops for hiring either male
or female employees. On the demand side, the researchers will randomize the
digitization of loan repayments at 90 BRAC branches, which increases the demand
for mobile money by female customers. The results of this research will not only
provide guidance on policies to decrease labor market discrimination against
women but could also decrease poverty as well as reduce income
inequality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
