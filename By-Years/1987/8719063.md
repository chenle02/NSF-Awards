The overall goal of this research is to understand the mechanisms by which
gonadal steroid hormones influence the development and adult function of neurons
that participate in behavior. The effects of steroids on behavior are believed
to be exerted by action on the central nervous system. There are marked
differences in the central nervous system of males and females. Among the most
striking of these are examples of differences in the number of motor neurons
that innervate effector muscles for behavioral expression. These differences
correlate with behavioral differences, but it is not clear how sexually
dimorphic morphology contributes to sexually dimorphic function. Of considerable
interest are the developmental processes that give rise to morphological
differences. We do not yet know how sex differences arise in the neuroeffector
systems that produce sexually differentiated behavior. This research contains
experimental approaches to determine when and how sex differences in the motor
neurons that produce sexually dimorphic behavior develop in the clawed frog,
Xenopus laevis.
