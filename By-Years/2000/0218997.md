This project explores new ways of searching, organizing, preserving, and
interacting with large information resources in the humanities and the social
sciences. It involves the creation and support of a digital library of materials
of significant international importance drawn from the Franklin D. Roosevelt
Library and Digital Archives (which includes image, sound, video and textual
data), and the encoding, annotation, and multi-modal linkage of a portion of the
collection to develop state-of-the-art methods for search and retrieval. The
goal is to establish methods and procedures that can be later applied to the
full FDR collection, and to consider the best means to enable flexible and
creative access to this important resource.

The project involves, on the one hand, computer scientists with significant
experience in the representation of and access to on-line data, together with
historians who require sophisticated and intelligent access to on-line
historical resources. Because we will apply techniques from several technical
fields to data that is typical of the humanities, the project represents an
important cross-disciplinary effort. Another benefit is the collaboration
between two undergraduate liberal arts institutions, Marist College and Vassar
College, and the potential to involve students from both institutions in cutting
edge research.
