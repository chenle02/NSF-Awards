Washington University and Hewlett-Packard will engage in a cooperative two year
program of experimental and theoretical studies involving applications of
micromagnetics to problem areas in magnetic and magneto-optic recording. The
study areas are defined by the recognition of needs and by the experimental and
computing resources of a major industrial laboratory, and by the awareness of
opportunities for progress on the part of an academic principal investigator,
one of the founders of the discipline. The proposed studies will deepen the
understanding of the magnetic and magneto-optic write and readout processes. One
study will provide a basis for improvements in the interpretation of the
frequency response of magnetic readout. Two major investigations are directed at
optimizing the design of longitudinal cobalt alloy thin film media, and at
improving the understanding and control of double-layer perpendicular high
density recording media. Another study is concerned with the realistic modeling
of Cr0 patriculate media, using a combination of analytical and numerical
micromagnetic calculations. One theoretical study will examine the details of
the thermal magneto-optic laser write process.
