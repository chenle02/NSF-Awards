Often the first attempt to grasp an object is not successful and the hand must
be adjusted based on information gathered with that initial contact. The
regrasping is easier once information is available on where on the hand contact
occurred. The purpose of this project is to build a robust grasping system for
humanoid robots in collaboration with one of the pre-eminent robotics labs in
the world, Dr. JunHo-Oh's Hubo Lab at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science
and Technology. The main area of research in this project is to build a Tactile
Experience Database enabling a robot with tactile sensors to leverage past
experience to better incorporate current tactile sensory information into grasp
planning. The database will enable the robot to use prior touch experience
alongside current tactile information to better manipulate an object. For the
purposes of this research, the tactile sensors will provide the sense of touch,
and the Tactile Experience Database will provide the past experience. This
tactile experience will allow for the creation of new robotic learning
algorithms that the humanoid can use to identify and recreate previously learned
grasps.

In addition, this tactile information will allow for novel regrasp algorithms.
This research will allow relating the current sensor readings to the expected
sensor readings and adjusting the hand based off of the difference between them.
These new sensors will provide accurate information at a critical time allowing
for more complicated grasping algorithms. The new sensors will also allow for
new manipulation strategies. For example, a robot could make a careful
exploratory contact, and then quickly shift its goal from a careful first
contact to a stable grasp of the object. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in
collaboration with the National Research Foundation of Korea.
