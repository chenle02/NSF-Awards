The proposed research investigates manifestations of the neutron-quadrupole
proton-quadrupole vibrational mode in the spherical nuclei 142Ce, 144Nd, and
120Te. Experiments will be performed at the University of Kentucky Nuclear
Structure Laboratory and examine y-ray emission following inelastic neutron
scattering on the nuclei of interest. A three-year research program involving
nuclear scientists from the U. S. Naval Academy, the University of Dallas and
the University of Kentucky is proposed. This proposal is designed to include
active participation by undergraduate students, in the research effort.
