The project addresses several problems of central importance in the areas of
designs, codes and association schemes. The emphasis will be on the use of
algebraic and number theoretic methods in the above areas. Topics of the
proposed research include Smith normal forms of subspace-inclusion matrices
(q-analogues of the subset-inclusion matrices); connections between difference
sets and maximal arcs in projective spaces; strongly regular graphs, two-weight
codes and association schemes. Number theoretic tools, such as Gauss and Jacobi
sums, have been used with success by the PI and others in all of the
afforementioned topics. It is expected that deeper p-adic number theory and
representation theory of the general linear group will be necessary in the
further investigations of these topics.

Combinatorial designs first arose in recreational mathematics problems, such as
Kirkman's 15 schoolgirls problem, and later in the design of statistical
experiments. They found many applications in coding theory, finite geometry,
cryptography, computer science, and electrical engineering. Designs and codes
are intimately related. Many efficient error-correcting codes are constructed
from designs. These codes are used nowadays in our daily life, for example, in
CD players, high-speed modems, and cellular phones. This proposal investigates
several problems in the interface of designs and codes, and gives summer support
for a graduate student who will study and work in the areas of design theory and
coding theory related to the above mentioned applications.
