A numerical simulation technique based on molecular dynamics is to be applied
to a variety of phenomena involving fluid- solid and fluid-fluid interfaces at
very small scale resolution. Earlier research by the investigators will be
extended and generalized. The study will apply the model to the dynamic contact
line between two immiscible fluids and a solid boundary, including roughness
effects and precursor films. Coalescence and splashes will be modeled, as will
the matching of calculations on these very small scales and the remainder of the
fluid on a much larger, bulk scale. Structured molecules will be added to the
model to account for complex rheological effects. The study will clarify
wetting, film rupture, phase separation and phase change phenomena, all of which
are of importance in a variety of processes in Chemical and Mechanical
Engineering.
