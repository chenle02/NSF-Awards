This award supports a Research Experience for Undergraduate site as an arctic
Quaternary studies. The program will consist of several phases designed to
maximize collaboration between undergraduate institutions with personnel who
specialize in Quaternary geology in the Polar regions. During the academic
years, relevant courses will be taught at the participating institutions which
will introduce students to various aspects of Quaternary geosciences. The
capstone of the program will be a field course, to be held in the southeastern
Baffin Island, Canada. The course will consist of introductory classroom
lectures and an intensive field component in which students will undertake
"hands on" studies in climatology, glaciology, glacially influenced sedimentary
processes, and Quaternary geology.
