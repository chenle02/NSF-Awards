9321961 Jose This U.S.-Chile award will fund travel expenses for eight U.S.
scientists to organize a workshop on commensurability in mesoscopic systems in
conjunction with the "Fourth Workshop in Condensed Matter Physics" that will
take place in Santiago, Chile, early January, 1994. The symposium will be
organized by Dr. Jorge Jose, Northeastern University, Boston, and Dr. Francisco
Claro, Catholic University, Chile. The workshop will focus mainly on
incommensurability problems arising in the physics of artificial mesoscopic
structures in the presence of magnetic fields, both in their classical (chaotic)
as well as quantum regimes. These problems have been the focus of recent
theoretical and experimental work. This will be the first meeting on this topic
in the region and the attendance of leading experimentalists and theorists in
the field will provide a unique opportunity for the exchange of ideas and
information about important contemporary research in condensed matter physics.
