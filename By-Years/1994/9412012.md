This proposal is for funds to purchase an intensified CCD Camera to replace
obsolete equipment. It will be used in the following research activities: 2-D
imaging of liquid and vapor phase fuel concentration measurements in IC engines,
using fluorescence techniques; 2-D imaging of Raman scattering for major species
concentration and temperature measurements; and the development of new
fluorescent dopant system for fuel imaging.
