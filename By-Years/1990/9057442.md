For this PYI award, research will be conducted in two related areas of
condensed matter theory: (1) the use of first-principles methods for the
theoretical prediction of the structural and electronic properties of solids,
particularly the innovative application of these techniques combined with
results from statistical mechanics, and (2) the investigation of the
interrelationships of chemistry, structure and properties of complex crystals
through models with a small number of parameters having microscopic
significance. Such models can then be used for the direct interpretation of
experimental results, as well as for analysis through first-principles
calculations.
