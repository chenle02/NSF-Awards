Models to Support Performance-Engineering of Global Computations

This Proposal focuses on modeling and scheduling methodologies that will enable
global computing, thus extending Computational Grids and high-performance
distributed computing to a global level. There are three objectives to the work
proposed: 1. develop novel models of complex emerging global and Grid computing
platforms for both resource availability and resource classi_cation, attempting
to unify the performance characteristics of both platform types. 2. Using these
models, develop scheduling strategies which enable robust, predictable
performance and deliver high availability for applications. 3. validate these
approaches with two \real-world" global computing applications, using both novel
simulation techniques and if possible a real global computing system. The
predictive models and simulation framework will advance the foundational
understanding of both Grid and global computing environments. These developments
particularly will be key to advancing the state-of-the-art of the global
computing infrastructure by addressing the computer science research questions
that are relevant to both communities.
