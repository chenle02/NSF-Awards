A new type of introductory chemistry course will be developed to serve both as a
general education course for non-science majors and also as a first college
course for science majors and minors. The philosophical basis for the course
would be quite different from that of traditional General Chemistry. The
emphasis of the new course would be on understanding synthetic processes whereby
molecular-level coherences have emerged from less-organized antecedents, rather
than on the analysis of substances and reactions into ever smaller components.
The approach is characteristic of scientists in the field of nonlinear dynamics,
evolutionary systems and self- organization in far-from-equilibrium
conditions.The first year (of three) would involve full-time course development
aided in part by a sabbatical leave. The second year would involve offering a
two semester course, with laboratory, for twenty- five students, and continued
course development. The third year would involve a similar course for a larger
group of students and also a conference to bring the philosophical basis of the
course to a large audience of potential users.
