Abstract IOS 1311393 DISSERTATION RESEARCH: Assessment of Signals in
Communication Networks

Communication is a cornerstone of animal behavior, mediating disparate
interactions such as among predators and prey, parents and offspring, siblings,
social groups, and prospective mates, to name a few. Sometimes multiple
receivers are able to detect the same set of communication signals, and in these
cases communication can be described as occurring within "networks." A major
open question in animal behavior is whether signals used in communication
networks are interpreted or assessed any differently than in single sender/
single receiver interactions. To address this question, the research team will
investigate how signal receivers make direct comparisons among multiple signals.
Research will be conducted on a songbird species, the Chipping Sparrow (Spizella
passerina), and will aim to answer two questions; (i) how do females assess
prospective mates when sampling multiple males that vary in preferred signal
properties? and (ii) how do networks of males respond to territorial intrusions
when threat levels as signalled in song varies? This project encompasses both
lab and field components, by testing female preferences in an operant paradigm
in the lab, and by using playback and a microphone array to test a network
response to territorial intrusion in the field. Results from this project will
address the hypothesis that relative signal strength can influence both mating
decisions and territorial interactions, and could therefore ultimately affect
the strength and/or direction of sexual selection. This project presents
opportunities to train undergraduate researchers and also generate data suitable
for senior theses. Furthermore, the Co-PI organizes a science outreach activity,
the "Science Café," (www.oebsciencecafe.org) and findings will be presented by
the co-PI to the community at a Café event in 2014.

All data created as a result of this project will be stored in replicate on hard
drives subject to regular back-ups, and will be accessible to other researchers
via request.
