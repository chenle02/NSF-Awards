Debra R Ohman University of Washington The doctoral dissertation research will
examine the origins and character of non-metropolitan economic and population
change in parts of the Pacific Northwest during the 1990s. The project will seek
to obtain a deeper understanding of major forces in the change process and
relies on theory regarding the restructuring process, consumption, ideology and
identity, and the social construction of nature and place. The methodology
consists of three phases: cross-sectional analysis, mail surveys and case
studies with interviews. The research will contribute to a better understanding
of the shape of restructuring and how social and economic restructuring are
connected to a change from productive to consumptive uses of the landscape and
different social constructions of nature and rural.
