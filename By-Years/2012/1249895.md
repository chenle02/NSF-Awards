Dr. Joseph Myre is awarded an NSF Earth Science Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry
out a research and education plan at the University of Arkansas - Fayetteville.
Dr. Myre will construct a computational fluid dynamics model to investigate the
relationship between surface roughness and the physicochemical mechanisms which
cause dissolution in soluble bedrock settings. This model will be used to
simulate the development of a common cave feature, scallops, in different flow,
chemical, and bedrock conditions. These simulations will incorporate measured
surfaces from natural settings: Copperhead Cave, Fitton Cave, and Parks Ranch
Cave. The model produced by this study will be widely applicable for studying
cave formation and feature creation and evolution, ultimately aiding in the
overall understanding of karst aquifers and their records of past landscape
evolution and paleoclimate.

Additionally, Dr. Myre will act as an educational mentor to undergraduate
students through classroom teaching and by directly involving them in discrete
portions of the project to gain research experience in data collection, data
management, computational experiments, and data analysis.
