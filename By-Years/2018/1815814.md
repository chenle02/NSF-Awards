Processing personal data in "the cloud" is an increasingly common computing
application. For example, health monitors collect heartbeat data and upload to
cloud for personal healthcare and wellbeing. This increases privacy and data
security risks. This project aims to achieve provable security in the cloud by
protecting data-access patterns in a security-oriented cloud architecture built
on the recently released Intel SGX (Software Guard eXtensions) processor.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach of the project is to combine hardware-level
protection for strong processor-memory isolation with algorithm-level protection
for data-oblivious computing. This new combination, termed external
obliviousness, is intended to enable strongly secure computation at a large data
scale. The project consists of two thrusts: 1) building externally oblivious
programming support for common computation primitives, 2) building externally
oblivious software systems for data-analytical queries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project will result in multiple broader impacts: The new system-building method
of external obliviousness will influence cyber-security and systems research
community. The new secure software will potentially expand the cloud industry
into supporting security-oriented applications in electronic healthcare. The
project will lead to hands-on lab modules integrated with residential curriculum
and a nation-wide education platform for both undergraduate students and under-
represented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will generate performance-
evaluation results from the developed codebase. They will be published to the
online repository and be maintained there for 3 years: https://exo-
sgx.github.io.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
