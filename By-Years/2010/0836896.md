This award gives travel, housing, and registration-cost support to selected
doctoral students from U.S. universities for their participation in the Doctoral
Consortium of the 18th International Conference on Automated Planning and
Scheduling (ICAPS-08) held September 14-18 in Sydney, Australia. ICAPS is the
premier conference for research in artificial intelligence planning and
scheduling, with relevance to a wide variety of applications such as software
engineering, manufacturing, transportation, and robotics. The ICAPS-08 Doctoral
Consortium includes a poster session, where students present their research, and
a mentoring program that pairs senior scientists with doctoral students.
