Although there is considerable indirect evidence that depolarization of nerve
cell terminals leads to the entry of Ca+2 and the consequent secretion of
neurohormones and neurotransmitters, the details of how ionic currents control
the release of neuro-active substances from nerve terminals remain undetermined.
This study by Dr. Lemos presents two preparations in which these questions can
be directly addressed. Much is already known about neurohormone release from
both the rat neural lobe and crab sinus gland, and the electrical activity of
individual terminals has been well characterized. The aim of this research is to
analyze, at the level of membrane and molecular mechanisms, how depolarization
of these nerve endings causes release of their peptide neurohormones. It is now
possible to prepare isolated nerve endings from both the neural lobe and sinus
gland, which respond to depolarization by releasing peptide neurohormones via
exocytosis. When permeabilized with detergents, thus permitting the entry of
specific probes into the nerve terminals, this preparation allows insight into
the cytoplasmic events leading to hormone release. These neurosecretosomes
readily form seals with fire polished electrodes, making feasible the
application of patch-clamp techniques to characterize the ionic currents from
both the terminal membrane and intracellular organelles, such as neurosecretory
granules. Finally, membrane capacitance measurements can be utilized in these
preparations to directly determine the relationship between ionic channel
activity and secretion at the level of the nerve terminal. These preparations,
therefore, have all the properties necessary to analyze in detail the process of
stimulus-secretion coupling. Elucidation of these mechanisms will represent a
major advance in our understanding of how neuronal activity is controlled.
