The goal of this project is to study some classic problems in combinatorial and
analytic number theory. More precisely, Yu will study (1) bounds for finite sets
of integers satisfying some binary additive properties, and (2) rank 0 quadratic
twists of elliptic curves over the rationals. The objects in study (1) are the
generalized Sidon sets and additive 2-basis of integers. A new idea is
introduced which captures the concentration of the sumset and the difference
set. Along with the classic methods of discrete Fourier analysis, this new idea
results in an improvement for currently the best upper bounds for the
cardinalities of generalized Sidon sets. This new approach will also be employed
to improve the lower bound for the 2-basis of integers. In study (2), Yu will
show that, for any elliptic curve which posses a 2-isogeny over the rationals, a
positive proportion of its quadratic twists have rank 0; and, for a pair of
elliptic curves over the rationals, there are infinitely many squarefree
integers D such that the quadratic twists of the two curves by the same D
simultaneously have rank 0. To achieve these, techniques such as the first
descent, sieve methods and estimation of character sums will be applied.
Besides, Yu will try to use the similar methods to prove boundedness of the
average rank of the quadratic twists of every elliptic curve over the rationals.

The problem of bounding a (generalized) Sidon set has attracted a lot of
attentions. While an upper bound for a generalized Sidon set has natural
implication in the study of Fourier series from Sidon's work back in 1930's, it
is also closely related to some other problems in harmonic analysis and
continuous Ramsey theory. In the first part of this project, Yu studies the
upper bounds for generalized Sidon sets, and use the new idea involved to study
some related problems. In the other part of the project, Yu is devoted to
studying some arithmetic of elliptic curves. Yu will partially solve a
longstanding problem related to the rank of elliptic curves, and will also study
some related problems.
