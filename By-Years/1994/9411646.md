ABSTRACT Roger Arndt CTS-9411646 The St. Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory of
the University of Minnesota will purchase a Phase Doppler Anemometer System
(PDA) for use in a broad range of fluid mechanics research. The PDA system is
essential for further work in cavitation, and will also enhance the capabilities
for research in fluid mechanics, river mechanics, turbidity currents, aerosols,
airborne particle motion, and aeration. The system is designed for analysis of
two phase flows containing bubbles, droplets or particles for measruements of
particle size, velocity and volumn flux. The system will also be used to replace
the existing (purchased in 1983) 2D Laser Doppler Anemometer for single phase
turbulence measurements. This system will also be used in the high speed water
tunnel, turbine test stand and the NSF sponsored wind tunnel for atmospheric
flow simulation. ***
