This project supports eighteen faculty members from Tribal Colleges which are
members of the American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC) to attend the
1992 American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES) Conference in
Washington, DC, November 5-8, 1992. This is an extremely worthwhile activity and
serves to supplement the program CISE supports to bring faculty, from the more
general category of minority institutions, to computer related conferences. The
AISES conferences addresses a much broader range of issues relating to science
and engineering education at these institutions which serve a primarily Native
American population. It is critical that faculty at minority institutions attend
national conferences of this type in order to become better integrated into the
research and education communities. This project represents a strong effort in
that direction.
