Despite the dramatic developments that have taken place in ecology since World
War II, the period between the two world wars is a fascinating subject for
historical investigation into ecological science. Many of the approaches later
associated with postwar ecology were introduced during this time, older concepts
were refined and modified, identifiable schools emerged, new ecological research
institutions came into existence, ecological theory interacted with social and
political views, and ecological knowledge was applied to a variety of nature
conservation and preservation issues. Under this grant, Dr. Cittadino is
undertaking a thorough investigation into the history of ecological science
during the 1920s and 1930s from an international perspective and with an effort
to interrelate intellectual, cultural, social, and institutional themes. He is
examining and synthesizing primary sources, secondary literature and archival
documents. His goal is to carry out a study which provides an accurate
assessment of the nature of the ecological science during the interwar years and
addresses the question of the place of ecology in Western science and Western
culture during this period.
