This proposed research will be a continuation of a study of the long term
properties of cosmic ray anisotropies in interplanetary space surrounding the
earth, with emphasis on the information that can be extracted from these data
regarding the properties and long term variations of cosmic ray density
gradients in the inner heliosphere. This work is expected to yield important
information on the three-dimensional magnetic and cosmic ray profile near the
earth, and on the way in which it changes when the sun's polar magnetic field
gradually changes, and then reverses every eleven years. With the data obtained
during the study, together with data accumulated since 1965, it will be possible
to examine data for a 30-year period, including nearly three solar activity
cycles. This will allow us to study the continuing evolution of the heliospheric
magnetic field and its influence on high rigidity galactic cosmic radiation in
the inner heliosphere.
