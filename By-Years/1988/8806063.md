The control engineer is often confronted with the task of designing controllers
for noisy systems whose parameter variation is so severe that classical or state
space based controllers cannot handle it. This problem provides the material of
Adaptive Control Theory. There are several aspects to Adaptive Control Theory.
The design problem is to produce algorithms that will adjust control settings in
real time in response to plant variations. The analysis problem is to study the
behavior and performance of such algorithms. Analysis may (and has) lead(led) to
design changes. Analysis involves questions of global stability particularly in
the presence of unmodeled dynamics and performance (e.g. attained tracking error
power and required control power or effort). The aim of the work proposed here
is to look at these issues in a stochastic setting. To design new algorithms it
seems useful to consider modelling the parameter variation, but this immediately
raises a dimensionality problem; a resolution of this based on Factor Analysis
ideas is suggested. Next is the issue most basic to Adaptive Control, namely
stability. Three stochastic tools available to deal with this are reviewed and
likely successful avenues explored. The way in which the unmodeled dynamics
problem impinges is also assessed. Finally the performance issues can be tackled
in a manner developed in Adaptive Signal Processing through the idea of
misadjustment and excess lag. For good technical reasons, the deterministic and
Stochastic Adaptive Control developments have hitherto been somewhat split, it
may now be possible to begin to bring them together.
