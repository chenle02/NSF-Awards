In this project, various apparatus are developed to make fast, state-of-the-art
phase equilibrium measurements of CO2 + N2 and CO2 + C2 H6 systems. The goal is
to collect thermodynamic data at a rate of one datum for every 30 minutes.
Apparatus under development are: fast Burnett, hybrid Burnett-Isochoric, and
direct weighing pycnometer. Pressure measurements range from 0-2,000 BAR with
precision of 10-3%; temperatures range from 100-500 degrees K with precisions of
2x10-3 degrees K; densities are at the 3x10-2% level. Mixtures are constructed
gravimetrically to point 0.001 mole fractions. The correlation development
revolves around an equation of state which separates attractive and repulsive
terms. Proper application of temperature dependence in the repulsive term
provides significant advantages over perturbed hard body expressions.
