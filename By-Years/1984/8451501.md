A research program is conducted in parallel computing systems and VLSI design
and test. This research project involves two major areas. The primary area
concerns algorithms and architectures for parallel processing systems. The
secondary area deals with the computer-aided design and testing of VLSI
circuits. The work explores the automated design and implementation of multiple
processor systems for signal processing and other applications. The focus is on
the design of individual special purpose processing elements, as well as the
design of the interprocessor interconnection structures. The hardware
acceleration of certain computation-intensive CAD algorithms is also
investigated. Candidate algorithms include circuit simulation and finite element
analysis. Reliability and fault tolerance issues related to these parallel
systems are studied. Efforts are underway to develop a new methodology and
associated software tools for testing modern MOS VLSI circuits.
