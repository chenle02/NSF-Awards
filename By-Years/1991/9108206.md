The effects of surface basicity and microporosity of the support on the
conversion of n-hexane over platinum on magnesia catalysts is examined. Platinum
clusters inside the channels of basic zeolites catalyze the aromatization of n-
hexane with high activity and selectivity; recently it has been discovered that
platinum clusters on a nonzeolitic basic oxide possess similar activity and
selectivity, throwing into question the usual explanations for this property. In
this study, the composition of the oxide is varied systematically to change both
the microporosity and the surface basicity in predictable and measurable ways.
Reactivity measurements are used to determine the importance of these structural
and chemical variables on the selectivity of platinum-catalyzed aromatization.
This work attempts to redefine the factors responsible for the high selectivity
observed. It is already clear that this approach should have a broader scope
than thought previously, but the limits of the scope are unknown. Applications
in processing of chemicals and fuels are numerous.
