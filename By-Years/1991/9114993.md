The Persian Gulf situation presents a unique opportunity to assess the impact
of massive fossil fuel fires on the atmosphere. In particular, measurements of
the effects on cloud and precipitation processes, radiation, and atmospheric
chemistry would provide data that could be used in cloud physics, climate,
global change, and air pollution research. The National Center for Atmospheric
Research (NCAR) and the University of Washington have developed a plan, with
university and Federal scientists, to mount an initial intensive observational
program by one or two aircraft during a four-week period in May and June. The
scientific objectives of the program are: o To characterize the regional
emission rates of the fires. o To measure radiative properties of the smoke, and
the net radiative effects of the plumes. o To measure characteristics of the
smoke particles and determine if the particles have a hygroscopic component. o
To determine the effects of the smoke on the composition and radiative
properties of clouds. o To measure the chemical composition of the plume and
determine how that composition changes with time. o To study regional weather
anomalies associated with these smoke emissions. The proposed observational
equipment will include the University of Washington Convair C-131A and/or NCAR
Electra. In addition to Federal support for this effort, Gilbert Grosvenor,
President of the National Geographic Society, has contacted NSF to provide some
support for this project.
