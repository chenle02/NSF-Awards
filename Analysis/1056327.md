The focus of the research component of this project is analytical study of
models of reactive processes, such as combustion, taking place in fluid flow. In
recent years, there has been significant progress in the mathematical
understanding of the effects of flow on combustion. Nevertheless, the inherent
complexity and richness of the phenomena continues to present a challenge to our
study of this problem. These models are given by nonlinear partial differential
equations, in particular, by reaction-diffusion equations which may also be
coupled to equations of fluid dynamics. One of the goals of the proposed
research is a continuation of previous work on passive combustion in periodic,
random, as well as general inhomogeneous media. The main questions of interest
include the effects of flows on mixing and on speed-up of propagation of
reaction. In addition, simplified models will be considered and experience
gained from their study will be applied to the original problems. Another goal
of the project is the study of propagation of reaction in a model of active
combustion, with direct feedback of reaction on the fluid motion via the
buoyancy force and gravity-induced mixing. In many situations this effect cannot
be ignored, particularly in highly turbulent combustion regimes. Although this
is a very difficult problem, limited progress has been achieved recently and it
is proposed here to build upon these results. The developed techniques will also
be applied to the study of other related models, including systems of reaction-
diffusion equations and a model of liquid suspensions.

Reactive processes, such as burning in internal combustion engines, nuclear
reactions in stars, and forest fires, are ubiquitous in nature. Their study is
relevant to several branches of science and engineering such as astrophysics,
biology, environmental science, and chemical engineering. The research proposed
here focuses on the influence of the motion of the underlying medium, such as
fluid flow, on the speed of spreading of reactive processes. It aims at
improving our understanding of fundamental mathematical models describing such
processes, which may provide useful qualitative insights into real life
phenomena. An important part of this proposal is its educational component. The
principal investigator (PI) plans to develop an undergraduate partial
differential equations (PDE) course at the University of Wisconsin, mentor
undergraduate mathematics majors in the study of advanced topics, and organize a
Research Experience for Undergraduates program in analysis and PDEs. The PI will
also teach specialized graduate courses and involve graduate students in working
under his supervision.
