CAREER: Architectural Support for Online Security
Analysis&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A pressing problem facing
modern computer system design is how to ensure that computers connected to the
network are safe from attack. The research will investigate computer
architectures that enable a new generation of network security devices capable
of detecting suspicious network behavior and known attacks. Several different
security applications are characterized by requiring the frequent access and
maintenance of large amounts of state, such as large lookup tables, on every
byte or packet, with worst-case bounds on throughput. Our architecture will take
advantage of many small, wide word, on-chip memories to rapidly traverse large
graph structures that are not well supported on current existing or proposed
machines. This approach results in significant reduction in memory usage and
increase in throughput. Such architecture could result in a new generation of
devices capable of significantly reducing the damages caused by viruses, worms,
and malicious attacks. The development of a functional prototype will enable
both researchers and students to study the internal dynamics a network under
attack, and the architectural challenges it presents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
