This Nanotechnology in Undergraduate Education (NUE) award to Professor John
Texter at Eastern Michigan University (EMU) is made by the Division of
Chemistry, the Division of Physics and the Division of Materials Science in the
Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and the Division of
Undergraduate Education in the Directorate for Education and Human Resources to
support the development of three new courses addressing aspects of
nanotechnology. These courses will help shape a new Bachelor of Science
curriculum in Nanotechnology in the College of Technology at EMU.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two courses for first year students, Miniaturization in
Technology (a science and technology history course) and a survey course on
Ultra-Small in Science and Technology (illustrating the diversity of phenomena
important on nano through micron length scales), are designed to increase
interest in becoming science, engineering, and technology majors. Both of these
courses will be designed to motivate interest in biology, chemistry, physics,
materials science, computing science, and engineering. A laboratory course,
Laboratory Measurements on the Nanoscale, for second year students will include
active hands-on projects and experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first two
courses will also be used to provide material for updating introductory
chemistry, physics, and biology courses, as the internal impact of these courses
is evaluated by the EMU University Nanotechnology Curriculum Committee. The
courses will be presented to a diverse student body at an institution committed
to the education and training of women and minorities. Evaluation and
dissemination plans will lead to oral presentations at professional society
meetings, journal publications, a monograph on Miniaturization in Technology
topics, and web-based module sharing and feedback through established science
and technology web sites. &lt;br/&gt;
