The 10th William Rowan Hamilton Geometry and Topology Workshop is a five-day,
directed workshop on Homology and Geometry, to be held at the Hamilton
Mathematical Institute (HMI) in Dublin, Ireland, August 26-30, 2014. The goal of
the William Rowan Hamilton Geometry and Topology Workshop is to investigate
common themes and techniques among significant areas of current research in
geometry and topology and to support junior researchers interested in these
areas. The workshop will bring together leading researchers in geometry and
topology with graduates students and junior researchers who have a special
interest in problems related to low-dimensional geometry, topology and geometric
group theory, to investigate questions at the forefront of research in these
areas. The confluence of expertise from different areas will result in new
collaborative projects, and in broadening the research horizons of the
participants.

The workshop will consist of a two-day mini-course for graduate students and
junior researchers, followed by a three day lecture series. The purpose of the
workshop is to investigate common themes and techniques among significant areas
of current research in geometry and topology. Major topics of this year's
workshop include, the behavior of homology invariants under coverings, minimal
genus representatives of 4-manifold homology classes, and homological properties
of manifolds with left-orderable fundamental groups.
