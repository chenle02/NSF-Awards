A fundamental problem in parallel computing is to design high-level,
architecture independent, algorithms that execute efficiently on general purpose
parallel machines. The purpose of this project is to advance our understanding
of the main factors required for designing practical parallel algorithms and to
develop techniques and data sets for experimentally validating the results. As a
byproduct, portable parallel programs and data sets for a number of specific
important problems arising in combinatorial computing and image processing will
be developed and made available to other researchers through the PI's Web page.
There are currently two factors that make this fundamental problem more
tractable. The first is the convergence of parallel architectures toward a
unifying model and the second is the emergence of standards such as the message
passing standard MPI. The technical approach to be followed is based on (1) a
simple computation model that incorporates communication costs into the
complexity of the algorithms, and (2) a SPMD programming model that makes
effective use of communication primitives. ***
