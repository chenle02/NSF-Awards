This research is designed to foster our understanding of the relationship
between diversification of a complex structure/function system and the evolution
of a lineage. The project entails a detailed morphological and phylogenetic
analysis of the feeding apparatus of frogs, focusing on a set of species chosen
to represent the major functional transformations that have occurred in the
anuran feeding system during phylogenesis. The morphology of the musculoskeletal
system, peripheral innervation, and associated motor nuclei of the hyolingual
apparatus will be used to derive characters for analysis of anuran relationships
and to test general and specific hypotheses of structural transformation. This
project will contribute (1) important baseline data for biomechanical and
functional analyses of feeding systems, (2) an increase in the resolution of the
phylogenetic relationships of the major lineages of anurans, and (3) a general
understanding of the relationship between diversification of a complex
functional system and the evolution of a lineage.
