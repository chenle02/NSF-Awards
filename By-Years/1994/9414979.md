9414979 Rankin The American Mathematical Society requests a grant in the amount
of $122,573 to support a mathematical research institute during the summer of
1995. The proposed institute will be the forty-second in a series planned with
the purpose of bringing together a group of mathematicians interested in a
particular field of mathematical research. Emphasis is placed on instruction at
every high level with seminars and lectures by distinguished mathematicians in
related fields, to promote interaction between participants while broadening
their mathematical perspectives. "Algebraic Geometry" has been selected as the
topic of the 1995 Summer Research Institute by the 1993 AMS Committee on Summer
Institutes and Special Symposia. Members of the Organizing Committee for the
proposed 1995 Summer Research Institute on "Algebraic Geometry" are: Henri
Gillet, Janos Kollar, Robert Lazarfeld, Robert Mcpherson, David Morrison and
Y.-T. Siu. The 1995 Institute will be held at a location in the western United
States. The Society will be responsible for making suitable arrangements for
lecture and seminar rooms and for the handling of local administrative matters.
The institute is expected to be held during a three-week period in July/August,
1995.
