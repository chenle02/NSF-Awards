Abstract ATM-9707538 D'Arrigo, Rosanne Columbia University - Lamont-Doherty
Earth Observatory Title: Southeast Asian Dendrochronology: A PAGES Workshop and
the First Southeast Asian Dendroecological Fieldweek; February 1998 in Chiang
Mia, Thailand Monsoon and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability impact
much of Southeast Asia and the globe. High-resolution paleoclimatic records,
including tree-ring data, can yield information about past behavior of climate
in Southeast Asia prior to the period of instrumental record. However, few tree-
ring chronologies have been produced to date. To foster development of such
records, identify critical research questions, and initiate collaborations among
interested scientists, this award will support a workshop on Southeast Asian
dendrochronology to be held in February, 1998, in Chiang Mai, Thailand. It will
be immediately followed by the first Southeast Asian Dendroecological Fieldweek,
which will allow scientists to learn techniques and initiate projects in
collaboration with others involved in tree-ring studies in the region.
