A fundamental quest for ecologists is to understand the complex interactions
between ecosystems and climate. We want to predict how ecosystems will respond
to changing temperature, precipitation and carbon dioxide concentrations, and,
in turn, how ecosystems themselves can influence climate change. Enormous
progress has been made toward this quest. However, although 20% of the earth's
land surface, including many of the world's most productive ecosystems, is
covered by mountains, almost all of the measurement tools currently available to
examine metabolic processes of ecosystems can only be used on flat land. Do the
concepts developed from "flat land" studies apply to mountainous terrain? To
answer this question, we need new ways to study ecosystem processes. This
project takes a novel approach: we propose to take advantage of "cold air
drainage systems". Under certain conditions, cold air actually sinks and
"drains" through mountainous systems, creating an airshed that is similar
topographically as well as conceptually to a watershed. Just as water in
watersheds carries dissolved materials, air within airsheds contains small
particles and gases that it picks up along the airflow path. In this project we
will focus on the concentration as well as tiny variations in the isotopic
composition, or mass, a particular gas, carbon dioxide. An interdisciplinary
team of scientists will closely examine air drainage systems, the carbon isotope
composition of carbon dioxide in the drainage systems, and ecosystem metabolic
processes. We will test the overall hypothesis that the variations in isotopes
can be used as indicators of change in ecosystem metabolism.

The project will be installed in a long-term ecological research station that
has well-developed educational programs for public schools, teachers and the
general public. We anticipate that the "high tech" equipment installed within
the forest for this project, as well as the projects goals, will be of broad
interest and educational value.
