SOUNDPRINT, the weekly half-hour nationally broadcast public radio documentary
series, proposes a 16-program SOUNDPRINT SCIENCE SERIES comprising four thematic
components of four programs each, which explore and examine current issues and
ideas in the areas of 1) Biodiversity and Species Management; 2) Invasions: The
Predator and the Prey; 3) Cultural Geography; and 4) The Meanings of Science.
The series offers listeners a variety of experiences illustrative of the breadth
of what is defined as science. Scientific thought and method are presented
through a humanistic storytelling approach that capitalizes on the imaginative
quality of sound to immerse listeners in the exploration of phenomena. Each
documentary explores a single subject, placing it in a meaningful context, and
taking listeners beyond the surface of simple fact reporting. Programs translate
complex scientific ideas into accessible, memorable stories that increase
awareness and understanding of science for a broad population (SOUNDPRINT
REACHES OVER 250,000 LISTENERS EACH WEEK). The SOUNDPRINT SCIENCE SERIES will be
broad cast as a series of quarterly, month-long specials, with promotional,
education and community outreach materials provided to stations. Post- broadcast
application of the programs includes development of teacher guide packets
targeted to the middle school level and repacking of programs for educational
purposes in multi-media and interactive settings. Cassette copies of programs
are shared by listeners in professional, educational, and informal settings.
Major scientific disciplines involved include: biology, environmental sciences,
geography, life sciences, mathematics and physics. The Proposed SOUNDPRINT
SCIENCES SERIES is submitted to the National Science Foundation Informal Science
Education Program. Programs in the series are geared to a broad, general
audience, elementary through adult populations.
