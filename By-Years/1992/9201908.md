During the demolition of a 23-year old concrete bridge in Reno, a large number
of plant-cast prestressed concrete box girders with a length of 69' were
recovered in good condition. Six of the girders have been donated to the
University of Nevada, Reno (UNR), for research purpose. These girders provide an
excellent opportunity to study different aspects of the behavior, design,
repair, and fatigue life of existing structures. Research funds have been
received from the Department of Energy to test two girders to determine their
actual stiffness and strength and to conduct limited studies on the repair of
the girders. The primary objective of this proposal is to study four additional
girders to determine (1) the actual prestress forces, (2) the extent of chloride
contamination after 23 years of exposure to deicing salt, (3) the effect of low-
level damage on the remaining life, and (4) appropriate repair techniques for
girders damaged by collision, and to investigate the fatigue performance of the
repaired girders.
