The research in mathematical statistics is divided into three parts: testing
for overdispersion in discrete distributions, testing that a sample comes from a
normal distribution rather than a finite mixture of normal distributions, and
semi-parametric estimation of a mixed normal density. A new test will be
constructed for the presence of a mixture. Also a new test and diagnostic for
the number of components in a mixture will be derived. This will be achieved by
exploiting the geometry of ratios of mixed and unmixed densities. A further goal
is to estimate the mixed normal density using an approach in which a smoothing
parameter is selected via cross- validation.
