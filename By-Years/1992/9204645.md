This project will continue to research of an interdisciplinary team to
establish an accurate theoretical model of the electrical double layer at the
surface of 2:1 clay minerals suspended in 1-1 and 2-1 electrolyte solutions. The
research proposed has become feasible recently because of important, new results
obtained by the Principal Investigators and other researchers. The renewal
project objectives are: (I) To perform Monte Carlo simulations of the ion
distributions in a 1-1 electrolyte near the surface of a 2:1 clay mineral,
including fully molecular-scale water-water, water-ion, and ion-ion
interactions. (II) To perform statistical mechanical calculations of the
interactions ("swelling pressure") between planar charged surfaces immersed in
1-1, 2-1, and 1-2-1 electrolyte solutions. The results obtained will provide a
significantly-improved, quantitative foundation for the surface chemistry of 2:1
clay minerals as it occurs typically in mineral weathering and diagenesis.
