From Atoms to Continuum: A Multi-Scale Multi-Phenomena
Theory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;James D. Lee and Youping Chen&lt;br/&gt;School of
Engineering and Applied Science&lt;br/&gt;The George Washington
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In ABO3
ferroelectrics, the displacements of ions at sub-nanometer scale account for the
piezoelectricity and the polarization reorientation. Grain and grain boundary
structures, from nano- to micro-scale, of a macroscopic ceramics remarkably
influence the electromechanical response. The physics of ferroelectrics is
multi-scale in nature. The objective of this research is to enhance the
scientific understanding of multi-scale multi-physics phenomena. We will start
from atomistic lattice dynamics, through statistical mechanics, molecular
dynamics simulations and microcontinuum modeling, to link atomic model to
micromorphic electromechanical theory, and to investigate the fully coupled
thermo-electro-mechanical response of ferroelectric ceramics. This research is
expected to be an important step forward for microcontinuum theories by finding
the material parameters from atomistic models. It will be applicable to problems
in a wide range of length and time scales from nano- to macroscopic. If
successful, it will have immediate engineering applications, including sensors,
actuators, capacitors and memory devices, etc. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
