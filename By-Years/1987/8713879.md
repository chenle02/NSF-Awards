This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. C. L. Liu, Department of Computer
Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, to pursue with Professor H.
W. Leong, Department of Information Systems and Computer Science, National
University of Singapore, for a period of 24 months, a program of research on
computer aided design of very large scale integrated circuits (VLSI). The
collaborators will develop design models that accurately describe the
constraints and requirements of the physical design process. They also will be
concerned with improving design methodologies. Their research will be directed
toward the goal of solving design problems and developing new design tools to
handle the extremely complex VLSI circuits. The research problem, while
theoretical in nature, may impact favorably on the semiconductor industries in
the United States and Singapore. This research could assist semiconductor
industries in solving today's design problems and, also, could produce new
design tools for the future. Drs. Liu and Leong are highly respected scientists
with a record of successful collaboration in the field of this project. This
project is relevant to the objectives of the Science in Developing Countries
Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. scientists
and engineers and their counterparts in developing countries through the
exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through
collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.
