9401910 Semtner The PI has an operational world ocean circulation model which
has been used to simulate ocean circulation for the period 1985-89. The current
project is to test improved physical formulations for the addition of sea ice,
mixed-layer dynamics, and parameterizations of deep overflows and deep
convection. Techniques will be tested for incorporating satellite altimeter data
from the Geosat, TOPEX/Poseidon, and ERS-1,2 missions into the model. Model
simulations will be conducted with and without the inclusion of satellite data,
including some simulations in near-real time for the WOCE observing period. In-
situ WOCE observations will be used to evaluate the realism of the simulations.
