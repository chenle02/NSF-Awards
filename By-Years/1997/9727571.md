This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports research in the laboratories of Professors David Richardson and John
Eyler at the University of Florida. The research to be performed will utilize
electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass
spectrometry to examine the role of solvation in the thermodynamic properties
and the reactivity of metal complexes. Specific areas to be studied include: the
effects of solvation on charge-transfer in excited state complexes; measurement
of solvent binding energies; the relationship between gas-phase and solution-
phase reactivity of olefin polymerization catalysts; and reaction pathway
studies of metal-hydroxide complex catalyzed hydrolysis of biopolymers. The
biopolymer studies could lead to methodologies that greatly reduce the need of
solution pretreatment for mass spectrometric analysis of proteins. Inorganic
complexes mediate a wide range of chemical reactions. This research will lead to
an improved theoretical understanding of the behavior of metal complexes in
solution and enable the production of more desirable complexes for reaction
specific reagents and catalysts.
