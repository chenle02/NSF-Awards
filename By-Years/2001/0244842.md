The physics program supported by this grant is directed at the&lt;br/&gt;study
of experimental nuclear physics at the HERA collider ring in&lt;br/&gt;Germany.
Research will be carried out in high energy electron&lt;br/&gt;scattering to
determine the contribution of quarks and gluons to&lt;br/&gt;the intrinsic
angular momentum of the proton and neutron by&lt;br/&gt;measuring the scattering
of polarized electrons on polarized&lt;br/&gt;targets. The main emphasis will be
on studying the gluon&lt;br/&gt;polarization, the orbital angular momentum
contribution to the&lt;br/&gt;nucleon spin, and transverse polarization effects
in nucleons.&lt;br/&gt;Education and training of both, undergraduate and
graduate&lt;br/&gt;students, and postdoctoral scholars, as well as outreach
aimed at&lt;br/&gt;the general public is an important aspect of this research
program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
