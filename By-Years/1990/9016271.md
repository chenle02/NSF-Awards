Description: This project supports collaborative research by Dr. Serge
Timasheff of Brandeis University, Waltham, MA, and Dr. V. Prakash of the Central
Food Technology Research Institute in Mysore, India. The research is aimed at
understanding the interaction between proteins and various ligands present in
oil seeds such as sunflower, sesame, peanut, and cotton seeds. The presence of
these ligands prevents the full utilization of the proteins in these seeds. In
this research, isolation of high and low molecular weight proteins as well as
isolation of constituant ligands will be completed. A study will be made of the
interactions of pairs of individual proteins and individual ligands, to
determine the results under different reaction conditions, and to understand the
nature of the binding site stoichiometry, geometry and reaction kinetics.
Various biophysical techniques will be used in the study including
spectropolarimetry, analytical ultracentrifugation, fluoresence polarisation,
affinity chromatography, and spectrophotometry. Scope: This research brings
together a well-established U.S. scientist and a highly productive young
researcher from India to work on a problem of basic scientific interest in the
biophysics and biochemistry areas. In addition, this research has potentially
significant benefits in improving the capabilities of many Less Developed
Countries to meet their nutritional needs. The two scientists will complement
each others' work to enhance the expected research output. This project meets
the objectives of the U.S.-India Cooperative Science Program. Funding: This
project is being funded under two grants as follows: Brandeis Univ. Centr Food
