A molecular graphics workstation will be acquired to conduct research including
the molecular modelling of proteins and polypeptides, the study of catalytic
antibodies, the design of mechanism-based enzyme inhibitors, and the
spectroscopic study of protein dynamics. The molecular graphics package acquired
here will allow the visualisation of the complex dynamic structure of biological
macromolecules at the atomic level and prediction of the response of the
structure to alterations in chemical composition or environment with the overall
goals of deducing specific structure-function relationships.
