An international conference on constitutive laws for engineering materials will
be held. The primary emphasis of this meeting will be to lay the foundations for
developing unified constitutive relationships for solids and geo-materials and
specifically apply the new developments in theories of elasticity,
hypoelasticity, plasticity, viscoplasticity, and endochronic concepts and model
discontinuities such as contacts, interfaces, joints, and fractures. A short
course will follow the meeting in which the international experts will deliver
their views on an integrated approach for constitutive modeling of solid and
geo-materials.
