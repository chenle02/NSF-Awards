Many of today's mission critical databases have not been designed with a
particular focus on security aspects such as integrity, confidentiality, and
availability. Even if security mechanisms have been used during the initial
design, these mechanisms are often outdated due to new requirements and
applications, and do not reflect current security polices, thus leaving ways for
insider misuse and intrusion. The proposed research is concerned with analyzing
various security aspects of mission critical (relational)databases that are
embedded in complex information system infrastructures. We propose four
complementary avenues of research: (1) models and techniques to profile the
behavior of mission critical data stored in databases, (2) algorithms to
correlate (anomalous) data behavior to application/user behavior, (3) techniques
to determine and model user profiles and roles from behavioral descriptions, and
(4) the integration of techniques, algorithms, and mechanisms into a security
re-engineering workbench for (relational) databases. Two major themes build the
core of the proposed approaches. First, the analysis of database vulnerabilities
and violations of security paradigms is data-driven, i.e., first the behavior of
the data is analyzed and modeled before it is correlated to users and
applications. Second, we introduce the concept of access path model to uniformly
model and correlate data flow and access behavior among relations, users, and
applications. This model allows security personnel to fully inspect database
security aspects in complex settings in a focused, aspect (policy) driven
fashion.
