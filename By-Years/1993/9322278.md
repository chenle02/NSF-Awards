Madden 9322278 This award provides funds for the expansion of a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates Program at Louisiana State University. The
project will support twelve students through institutional resources and
additional four from this grant. The program runs for eight weeks focusing on
research in the areas of algebraic geometry and knot theory. Two faculty
advisors will coordinate the effort. Students will work in small groups and be
expected to make presentations during the course of the program. Interspersed
will be lectures by visiting scientists. All participants will be expected to
write up the results of their experience with the more successful preparing
papers for publication or presentation at professional meetings. Recruiting will
be done by personal visits to regional institutions. Efforts will be made to
attract applications from students in under represented groups. Availability of
university resources such as a computer laboratory will add to the strength of
the activity. ***
