This is an individual award in the Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Plant
Biology Program for 1988. The Fellow will conduct research on "The involvement
of mobile genetic elements in the phenotypic variance of virulence of plant
pathogens", in the laboratory of Dr. Richard Michelmore, University of
California, Davis, California. The award provides training in research in a
critical area of plant biology to a promising young scientist. It should help to
contribute to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific effort and lead to
advances in our knowledge and understanding of the biology of plant systems.
