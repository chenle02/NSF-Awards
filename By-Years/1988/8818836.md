It is proposed to investigate another simple quark model of nuclei, employing
the light-front representation, introduced by Dirac, and used extensively by
Brodsky in perturbative QCD, and apply it to calculations of elementary particle
and nuclear form factors, nuclear forces, and exchange currents in nuclei. This
model gives correctly the separation of relative and center of mass motion and
relativistic boosts in the particle conserving approximation, so that it is not
limited to small momentum transfer like the bag model, and can hopefully be made
more realistic than skyrmion models.
