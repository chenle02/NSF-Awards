There are two problems suggested in this proposal for further investigation. The
first problem is completing our understanding of the deformation space of
hyperbolic structures on open 3-manifolds and describing the geometry of such
structures. This problem has been the subject of many studies started by Bill
Thurston and followed by Bonahon, Canary, Minsky, Brock and others. Their work
provided very interesting results especially in the case of incompressible
boundary 3-manifolds. However such a nice description does not exist in general
for hyperbolic structures on other 3-manifolds and in particular handlebodies.
Namazi will focus on deepening our understanding of this general case. The
second problem deals with the geometry of closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds. A very
fundamental problem in the subject is to describe the geometry of a hyperbolic
manifold and find a recipe to construct a very accurate approximation for the
hyperbolic metric. These two problems are very closely related to each other and
in earlier work Namazi was able to construct models for the geometry of a large
class of hyperbolic structures on handlebodies and this was used to construct
accurate approximations of the hyperbolic metric on a family of closed
3-manifolds. The hope is to extend this to a broader set of closed 3-manifolds.

A 3-manifold is an object, which looks like the regular Euclidean 3-dimensional
space around every point. The problem of classifying 3-manifolds has been one of
the fundamental questions in mathematics, which perhaps started by Poincare's
work and conjecture in the early twentieth century. Thurston pushed the subject
much further and conjectured that understanding and classifying hyperbolic
3-manifolds results in a classification of all 3-manifolds. The recent
development of the subject in the last few years has brought us closer than ever
to see a complete proof of Thurston's conjecture. A consequence of this
classification is the fact that these fundamental objects have an almost
canonical shape. What remains unanswered is a description of this shape and this
is the major subject that Namazi will try to address in this project. Similar to
his earlier work he also expects that such a description makes it possible to
answer many unanswered questions in the study of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.
