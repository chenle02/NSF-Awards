9453881 Gerace A classroom communication system is being developed as a catalyst
for promoting a more dynamic and constructivist classroom environment. Students
will not only engage in cooperative learning activities, but also communicate
their understanding to the instructor, thereby permitting the instructor to
respond to students' specific instructional needs. The project is a
collaborative among science and mathematics instructors at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst Regional High School, educational researchers and
curriculum developers at the UMASS Scientific Reasoning Research Institute, and
educational technologists at Better education Incorporated. The project focuses
primarily on the subject matter appropriate for a one year course at the high
school or college level. The complete system will be developed, consisting of
hardware, documented software, and curriculum materials. Exemplar materials will
also be developed in mathematics and chemistry. A primary aspect of the project
is also evaluation of the comparative effectiveness of the classroom
communication system as an instructional approach.
