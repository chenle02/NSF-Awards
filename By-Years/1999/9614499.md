9614499 Barth The plate configurations during Precambrian time are difficult to
reconstruct, but are of considerable interest, both from a global perspective
(style of tectonics including assembly of supercontinents) and more local
(influence of precambrian geometry on younger events). This project will examine
early proterozoic gneisses in southern California that contain evidence of a
deformation event, possibly associated with an arc and a western Archean (?)
craton. The study will support mapping and structural analysis of this
hypothesized arc accretion event in the western mojave province, supported by
U-Pb geochronology to constrain the timing of orogeny. Insights into the origin
of the Mojave province from this study will provide important constraints on
geochemical models for Precambrian growth of the North American craton,
subsequent deformation and plate tectonic models for accretion of the Late
Proterozoic supercontinent.
