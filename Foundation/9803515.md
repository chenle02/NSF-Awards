The research of Buss deals with the mathematical aspects of computational
complexity and logic, especially the relationships between computational
complexity and circuit complexity and formal systems of mathematical logic and
proof complexity. The logical systems to be investigated include fragments of
arithmetic, propositional logics, first-order logics, and second-order logics.
The computational classes to be investigated include polynomial time,
alternating logarithmic time, low-level circuit classes, and cryptographic
protocols. The proposed research is aimed at proving new upper and lower bounds
on the complexity of proofs and the complexity of computations, and the
development of interactions between these two problems.

Past research has developed intimate connections between formal proof systems
and formal models of computation. Buss's research on proof theory includes
investigations into the efficiency of proof systems, both in terms of the size
of optimal proofs and in terms of the difficulty of proof search. These problems
are closely related to some of the most important open problems in computational
complexity, e.g., to the P versus NP question and to the mathematical
foundations of cryptography. These open problems are of fundamental importance
to computability theory since, until they are resolved, it will be impossible to
mathematically prove good lower bounds on computational complexity; for
instance, it will be impossible to mathematically prove the security of
cryptographic systems without resolving some of these open questions. Prior
research of Buss and others has established direct links between proof
complexity and these problems in the foundations of computability. The main
thrust of the research supported by this grant is the investigation of proof
complexity and proof search, and the relationship between proof complexity and
computational/circuit complexity.
