ABSTRACT

The investigation of non-smooth phenomena is one of the main subjects of
contemporary Geometric Function Theory. The purpose of this project is to study
metric structures on spaces and appropriate nonsmooth classes of mappings
between these spaces such as bilipschitz, quasisymmetric, quasiconformal, and
quasiregular mappings. Many basic questions in this area are open. For example,
a satisfactory characterization of two-dimensional metric spheres that are
quasisymmetric to the standard two-dimensional sphere is unknown. This problem
is relevant in connection to Thurston's hyperbolization conjecture. Progress in
the field relies on a combination of geometric and analytic methods that were
recently established in the analysis of metric spaces.

The particular question of how to map surfaces has a long history. Cartography
aims to preserve particular features of a surface under suitable mappings. This
has lead to major mathematical developments. In the nineteenth century basic
problems of surveying and geodesy motivated Gauss to build up a systematic
theory of curved surfaces which laid the foundation of modern differential
geometry. For the investigation of wrinkled and fractal objects new mathematical
tools are required. A clear understanding of the mathematical concepts for
describing nonsmooth phenomena will benefit research in other areas and lead to
practical applications. For example, methods for attacking the theoretical
questions of quasiconformal parametrizations of spheres were also used for
finding algorithms for mapping the surface of the human brain. One of the aims
of the project is to involve graduate students in this promising and important
area of mathematical research.
