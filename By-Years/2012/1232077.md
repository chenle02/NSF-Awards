The objective of this program is to conduct experimental investigation of novel
nonlinear material and waveguide designs and to develop a compact, integrated
photonic device platform for nonlinear optical devices operating in the mid-
infrared spectral region. There is a current dearth of nonlinear optical devices
in the mid-infrared and the proposed research program aims to fill this void.
The intellectual merits are: (1) novel device architecture for slow light
propagation with low loss and (2) new tunable light sources and amplifiers for
the mid-infrared frequency region. The slow light devices are based on photonic
crystals to enable dispersion engineering necessary for slow light but has
radically different designs to circumvent the fundamental limits imposed by
scattering loss. Additionally, the devices will be implemented in a chalcogenide
material system, with high nonlinearity and Raman gain, long infrared
transparency, and a high glass transition temperature. The broader impacts are
many. First, the proposed work will broadly impact the applied physics and
materials science world by providing a new class of devices based on nonlinear-
enhancement from slow light. The capability of ultralow threshold for
nonlinearities will open a wide application space for the use of devices with
standard, low cost lasers. The potential to demonstrate a low-threshold
nonlinear optical device in the mid-infrared will be transformative for
applications in sensing, spectroscopy, communications, medicine and more. The
project is also designed to integrate research with education at both
undergraduate and graduate levels, attract underrepresented minority students,
and offer outreach to general public.
