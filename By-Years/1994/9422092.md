9422092 Medhi This award is to purchase multi-processor computer equipment which
will be dedicated to support research in Computer Science Telecommunications
Program at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. The equipment will be used
for several research projects, including in particular: "Routing and Design of
Wide-Area Broadband Networks," "Call Admission for Video Traffic in High Speed
Networking," "High Speed Integrated ATM Networking," "Self-Routing and Network
Embedding Problems in Parallel Processing," and "Evaluation of the Signaling
System No. 7 Protocol for Emerging Services". To conduct these research
projects, the hardware platform will be used for solving large-scale network
optimization problems, for doing extensive simulation of networks and network
protocols, for doing statistical analysis of traffic data, and for solving
computing intensive problems in parallel processing. The multi-processor
computers with large memories provide a flexible computing environment by making
efficient use of resources and making it possible to solve large models in a
timely manner, thus resulting in effective research.
