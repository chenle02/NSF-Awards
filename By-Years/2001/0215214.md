This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes the
development of integrated optoelectronic circuits through a novel integration
process. These devices will be hybrid electronic/optical elements embedded in an
integrated platform comparable in size to existing electronic integrated
circuits, and will permit the monolithic integration of microelectronic and
photonic elements. This project will fabricate a test 'chip' to demonstrate
controllable phase modulation on the sub-micron scale while contemplating the
integration of multiple devices onto a single platform to confirm dense
integration densities.

This approach to integrated optoelectronic circuits to act as an enabling
technology for tomorrow's dense optical networks, significantly improve
processing speed and computational precision for multiple applications including
intra-computer and inter-computer communications, image processing, and
increasingly more dense processing platforms. This potential suggests that
integrated optoelectronic circuits will have applications in the telecomm
industry, the medical imaging device market, and the computing equipment market
including, but not limited to, Digital Signal Processors and CPUs for digital
communications networks.
