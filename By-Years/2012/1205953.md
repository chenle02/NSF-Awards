Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-1205953 &lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: Claude R. LeBrun&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator
plans to study a family of related global problems in 4-dimensional Riemannian
geometry. The primary goal of the proposed research is to discover and develop
fundamental links between the curvature of a Riemannian 4-manifold and the
differential topology of the underlying space. The main problems to be
investigated focus on the existence, uniqueness, and detailed structure of
several classes of canonical metrics. Topics of study will include Einstein
metrics, extremal Kaehler metrics, Bach-flat metrics, and self-dual metrics.
Some related problems in higher dimensions will also be considered, in
anticipation of the discovery of further fundamental differences between the
4-dimensional and higher-dimensional settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research program aims both to explore fundamental issues in the mathematical
field of differential geometry, and to discover new links between mathematics
and theoretical physics. Much of the planned research activity takes its
inspiration from current attempts to bridge the gulf separating Einstein's
theory of gravitation from the quantum field theories that describe the forces
of nature on a microscopic scale. A major focus of the research is the influence
of the large-scale (topological) structure of a 4-dimensional universe on
whether or not it admits Riemannian-signature solutions of Einstein's
gravitational field equations.
