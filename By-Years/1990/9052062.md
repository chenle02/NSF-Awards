Through this project, the Department of Chemistry acquired a FTIR, HPLC, and
Atomic Absorption and UV-Visible spectrometers. These systems are computer
accessed and controlled. The use and application of the instrumentation affects
all students within the science division. The project is designed specifically
to improve the science instruction capabilities of the institution, and
strengthen and upgrade the instrumental analysis and physical chemistry
laboratories. Students' experiences in instrumental methods, their knowledge of
modern analytical techniques, and their laboratory skills have been greatly
enhanced by this project. The project has aided in increasing the instrumental
emphasis in certain coursed, the depth and scope of experimentation in others,
and the students' knowledge of computer interface. The project has also provided
students with hands-on experience in basic spectroscopy. The institution has
contributed to this project in an amount equal to the NSF funds.
