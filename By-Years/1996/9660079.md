*** 96-60079 Owen This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is
feasibility study of a proposed Coastal Ocean Processes Sensor (COPS) array of
fiber-optics linked sensors. COPS uses video holography and wavelet-transform
optical correlation to record and analyze ocean particulates. COPS integrates a
number of small, rugged sensors and, once deployed, sensors can be added. Each
sensor can be relocated within the reach of its fiber link. Detailed
characterization of particulates is central to understanding the subsea
environment. COPS measures particulates at a variety of scattered sites with a
collection of holographic sensors linked to a central data processing unit on
shore. The objective of the research is to build and test a breadboard COPS
sensor and fiber links. Each COPS sensor records a 3-D field of particulates for
wavelet analysis and classification. By the end of Phase I, there will be a
detailed COPS design. Workers will record video holograms of particulates
through fibers to show hardware feasibility. They will use wavelet processing to
analyze mass and fluid transport and show software feasibility. The next phase
of the research will include sea trials. The commercial applications of this
Coastal Ocean Processes Sensor, include studies of marine aggregate particle
dynamics; these dynamics involve biological processes and mechanisms, as well as
the chemical/physical processes that affect aggregation. Other applications
include environmental surveying, aquaculture, ocean waste disposal monitoring,
engineering turbidity, mine tailing monitoring, and underwater lidar. Government
applications include a variety of naval coastal sensors. ***
