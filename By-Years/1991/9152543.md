St. John's College, with its unique approach to education, has been particularly
successful at integrating the sciences into a liberal arts curriculum. Because a
working knowledge of observational astronomy is fundamental to understanding
many of the readings of the St. John's program, in music and literature as well
as in mathematics and physics, St. John's College is upgrading its capabilities
with the purchase of a 14" telescope, equipped for photometric applications,
installed in a permanently mounted dome on the Annapolis campus. A faculty study
group is developing manuals and collecting original papers to guide the use of
astronomical telescopes in a liberal arts setting.The addition of this telescope
and laboratory manuals materially enhances the science portion of the curriculum
and also benefits all other parts of the St. John's program. This project may be
a model for other liberal arts colleges and a growing number of secondary
schools who have expressed interest in the program.
