This award funds research on sovereign debt crises. This type of crisis occurs
when there is a large increase in the prices of a country's sovereign bonds
compared to low-risk or risk-free bonds. The Greek debt crisis is a recent
example. This research project seeks to determine if changes in beliefs and
information acquisition by investors can explain some key observed features of
these crises. First, that these crises seem to come and go without much warning
and with only a loose connection to country-level fundamentals. Second, that
they also exhibit contagion - that is, they spread from one country to the next.
The first part of the project considers whether crises may turn on relatively
minor pieces of information. The second part examines the role of information in
debt crises by modeling how investors make decisions about whether or not to
gather additional information before bidding on government bonds. The project
develops basic insights that can aid U.S. policymakers in determining the
correct responses to sovereign debt crises outside the United States, as well as
helping policymakers around the world avoid these crises altogether.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first project funded by this award considers the full
set of equilibria in models of self-fulfilling crisis models along the lines of
Cole and Kehoe (2000). The goal is to demonstrate that one equilibrium in these
models has not been recognized by previous research. That equilibrium is
consistent with the data in two different ways: first, a crisis can occur
without a fail auction leading to default. Second, sovereign spreads are not
tightly linked to country fundamentals. The second project continues with this
model but adds an information choice decision for investors and carefully models
the sort of trading gains investors can expect to accrue based on information.
The project will then analyze the model to determine if equilibria with and
without information acquisition can simultaneously exist and to characterize the
equilibrium results.
