9510416 Webb Low temperature transport and magnetic susceptibility measurements
will be carried out on a variety of mesoscopic structures. The experiments will
likely elucidate the nature of the persistent current in isolated rings and
arrays of rings and the role of phase coherent electrons in screening a single
magnetic impurity. These measurements will require fabrication of the highest
resolution magnetic detectors currently available. Other investigations of
magnetic properties include non-periodic fluctuation effects, study of the Kondo
Effect in mesoscopic dots, and an investigation of the dynamic properties of
mesoscopic systems using dc squids in nuclear magnetic and electron spin
resonance experiments. %%% The physics of small structures provides the
foundation upon which future electronic technologies will be based. It is
consequently extremely important that all of the potentially relevant physical
properties of these systems are identified and understood. The current research
carries out such systematic investigation of the low temperature magnetic
properties of ultrasmall devices. During the course of these investigations some
of the most sensitive detectors available anywhere, which can discern very small
spatial dimensions, will be built and tested. ***
