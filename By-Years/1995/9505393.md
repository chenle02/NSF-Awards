Numerical methods are developed for solving large scale matrix problems arising
in applications. These applications are quite diverse and include such areas as
statistical modeling and quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The basic tool for these
computations comes from the classical theory of moments and numerical
quadrature. These problems are equivalent to estimating upper and lower bounds
for a quadratic form. One area of particular interest is computing the
generalized cross validation parameter. This technique is used in solving ill-
posed least squares problems by regularization methods. A numerical procedure is
developed which enables one to analyze very large data sets. Also, a method for
computing a parameter which is of importance in solving ill-conditioned sparse
least squares problems is developed. The basic objective of this research is to
develop new and robust algorithms for solving very large scale linear problems.
