The goal of this project is to improve the analytical chemistry education of
undergraduate students at Avila College. In recent years there has been great
expansion both in the variety and utility of electrochemical methods of analysis
and in the development of equipment controlled by microprocessors. Through this
project students will work with a Bioanalytical Systems electrochemical
analyzer, and will gain first-hand laboratory experience with modern
microprocessor-controlled instrumentation capable of performing seventeen
different methods of electrochemical analysis. Students in instrumental
analysis, physical chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemistry, and undergraduate
research will use this versatile instrument for a variety of applications,
including comparisons of pulse and cyclic voltammetry, use of DC polarography
for analysis of vitamins, comparisons of different types of electrodes, and
kinetic studies.
