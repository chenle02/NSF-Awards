The methods of stochastic analysis have found applications in many fields, some
far removed from probability itself. This is the case for both harmonic analysis
and differential equations. As an example, the problem of determining interior
temperature from the boundary distribution has an appealing and significant
solution through probability theory. One introduces an infinite dimensional
space of random paths, which provides a richer structure for many problems than
the customary finite dimensional Euclidean space. It is in this context, the use
of stochastic reasoning to improve our understanding of functions on Euclidean
space, that Professor Gundy's research takes place. That is to say, he
specializes in problems in the margin between probability theory and classical
analysis. He has utilized martingale theory to study orthogonal polynomials, and
he has made major contributions to function theory, Hardy space analysis, and
Brownian motion. The current proposal concerns the extension of these ideas to
the infinite dimensional space of continuous functions on Wiener space.
