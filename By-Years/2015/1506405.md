With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry
Division is funding Dr. Stefan Lutz from Emory University to create novel
biocatalysts for Baeyer-Villiger oxidation with enhanced regio-selectivity.
Catalysts not only facilitate chemical reactions in industrial processes as
diverse as producing petrochemical fuels and manufacturing pharmaceuticals, but
they also govern the chemistry of life, playing a key role in driving
biochemical reactions in cells. A better understanding of the fundamentals of
(bio)catalysts, as well as advances in synthetic biology and biotechnology now
allow scientists to manipulate and tailor biocatalysts for properties such as
stability and recognition of new substances. These capabilities have created
unprecedented opportunities to adapt these highly efficient and renewable
catalysts for novel, unnatural functions needed in industrial applications,
thereby creating new, safer and more sustainable processes. This project will
provide graduate students with specialized training in preparing biocatalysts,
as well as tailoring them to specific industrial applications. It also
introduces undergraduate researchers, as well as high school teachers and
students to the concepts of biocatalysis and green chemistry.

The area of flavo-enzyme engineering for utility in synthetic chemistry is one
that is ripe for development. Directed enzyme 'evolution' is a burgeoning field,
but this enzyme class is relatively underexplored, and yet holds great potential
for application to chemistry of interest. Employing a combination of flavin
cofactor analog substitution and protein mutagenesis, native monooxygenases will
be tailored for effective and selective conversion of asymmetric ketones to the
corresponding ester regio-isomers. Lead candidates among these engineered
enzymes will be characterized via comprehensive biochemical and biophysical
analysis. These studies will provide detailed information concerning the impact
of various engineering strategies and assist in developing accurate predictive
frameworks for future enzyme redesigning endeavors.
