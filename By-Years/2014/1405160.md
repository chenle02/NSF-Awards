The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), defined as the atmospheric pressure
differences between the Iceland Low and Azores High, is a dominant feature of
climate in the North Atlantic region and is associated with climate changes at
interannual and interdecadal timescales. The NAO is also associated with changes
in temperature, salinity, and circulation patterns in the northwest Atlantic,
but high-quality instrumental records of these variables are only available for
the past 60 years. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, led by a researcher from
the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, will develop the first long term
record of the ocean's response to the NAO. Specifically, benthic foraminiferal
stable oxygen isotope records from sediment cores from the Gulf of Maine,
Scotian shelf, and the Newfoundland continental shelf will be used to
reconstruct temperature and salinity patterns in sea surface conditions
associated with positive and negative phases of the NAO. The project will
include a research expedition to collect sediment cores that are not available
in existing collections. The results will complement land-based NAO records and
together these data sets should provide a holistic picture of the atmosphere-
ocean-cryosphere variability in the North Atlantic region over the past few
millennia. Funding also supports research opportunities for graduate and
undergraduate students, and an at-sea research experience for a high school
teacher.
