This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I Project will adapt
localized microwave heating techniques to emerging System on a Package (SOP)
interconnect designs. One critical bottleneck in the realization of the next-
generation, micro-electronic industry migration to SOP is the need for an
interconnect technology that can handle 20 to 100 micron pitch line widths. The
objective of this project is to develop bonding recipes around existing tool
sets that will allow realization of interconnect designs. The long-term goal of
this project is to develop tools that will facilitate rapid prototype
development of a next generation SOP designs.

The broader impacts of this technology will be tools that will facilitate rapid
prototype development of a next generation SOP designs that will be cheaper and
much smaller than existing chips.
