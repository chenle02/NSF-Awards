This research will advance our understanding of quantum gravity, a deep
understanding of which has been a goal of theoretical physics for more than 50
years and has attracted the attention of such well-known physicists as Dirac,
Penrose, and Hawking. The term "quantum gravity" refers to any structure that
would bring together the lessons of quantum mechanics (developed by Bohr,
Heisenberg, and others and which is essential to describe the physics of atoms,
molecules, and smaller objects) and general relativity (developed by Einstein,
and describing gravity in terms of curved spacetime). Specifically, this
research addresses quantum aspects of black holes and the microscopic structure
of spacetime.

One expects a deep understanding of quantum gravity to be critical for
deciphering the behavior of matter and energy in the deep interior of black
holes and in the very early universe. It is widely agreed that, if there are to
be further major revisions in our conception of the universe comparable to those
associated with Einstein's development of relativity 100 years ago, this is the
field from which they will emerge. As a result, such research in principle has
the potential to completely revolutionize science, technology, and our entire
civilization. In the shorter term, it captivates the interest of both science
students and the lay public and encourages the growth of a scientifically
literate and technologically knowledgeable public and workforce.
