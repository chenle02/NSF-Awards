An ion trap detector for an existing gas chromatographic analysis system is
acquired for conducting research in specific areas dealing with combustion
processes and fuel technology. Special emphasis is placed on pollutant formation
and control and on combustion kinetics and reaction phenomena of complex
hydrocarbon fuels. This equipment can contribute significantly to the
university's established on going research programs and increase the future
research capabilities and flexibility.
