We live in an era when vast amounts of data are being generated at a low cost in
several domains of science and engineering. However, advances in analytics tools
have not caught up with data generation. In particular, existing tools take too
much time. A main reason is that core memories of computers cannot hold all the
data to be analyzed -- most of the data have to be stored in secondary storages
(SSs) such as solid state drives and (rotating) disks. Data access times from
SSs are several orders of magnitude more than from core memories. Tremendous
speedups can be obtained by minimizing the number of data accesses from SSs.
Also, although there has been much recent research in the development of
multicore and GPU algorithms for biological problems, for many of the problems
only sequential in-core algorithms are known.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
is to develop novel out-of-core algorithms for biological big data (BBD)
analytics. The proposed novel parallel algorithms employ various architectures
including heterogeneous clusters of multicores and GPUs, to solve BBD problems.
The developed novel scalable algorithms can handle petabytes of data and beyond
for data mining applicable over varied datasets. This interdisciplinary project
provides a new computation suite for mining voluminous biological and other
data. This project provides educational opportunities to graduate and
undergraduate students to get first-hand research experience in computational
aspects of biological data analysis.
