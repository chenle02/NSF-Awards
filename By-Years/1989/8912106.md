Dr. Bechtel is examining research on the function of the mitochondrion in
cellular respiration between 1940 and 1965 in order to address two sets of
philosophical issues: (1) the nature of the interactions between researchers
trained in different disciplines (biochemistry and cell biology) that culminated
in the integration of morphological and functional perspectives in a mechanistic
theory of the role of the mitochondrion in cellular respiration and (2) the role
played by new research techniques (electron microscopy and cell fractionation)
in opening this domain of inquiry and in facilitating interactions between cell
biologists and biochemists. Dr. Bechtel is focusing on two stages in the history
of investigations into the mitochondrion's role in cellular respiration. During
the first period, he is concentrating on the cell biology investigations carried
out at the Rockefeller Institute where the techniques of cell fractionation and
electron microscopy were developed and employed to identify the mitochondrion as
the locus of cell respiration and to discover its internal structure. In the
second period, he will examine the endeavors of four different biochemists who
then made use of these techniques in their attempts to explain how mitochondria
figure in cellular respiration and oxidative phosphorylation in particular.
