Proposal # 9421287 Carnegie Mellon University The success of green products in
the marketplace depends crucially on all stakeholders enjoying incentives. For
that, all parties in the value chain - manufactures, wholesalers, transporters,
retailers and consumers - should find green products attractive, with benefits
exceeding costs. The goal of the study is to develop and test a framework that
will permit green products designers to evaluate alternative packaging
strategies from the perspective of all elements of the value chain. The
framework developed in this proposed study will integrate methodologies from
accountings, marketing, engineering and operation management. A workbench
incorporating this framework will be tested using real production and market
data on repackaged products. The manufactures of consumer products -- Eastman
Kodak and Dow Brands, and a major retailer -- Giant Eagle are partners in the
study. The investigative team consists of Carnegie Mellon's faculty both from
the business and engineering schools. The methodology of this study should yield
a tool for developing "win-win" green product design strategies and increase the
market success of green products. The project, besides providing a rigorous
framework for the practitioners to evaluate and increase the success potential
of green products, is also expected to be reported in major academic
publications, and incorporated into seminars and courses in business and
engineering schools' curricula.
