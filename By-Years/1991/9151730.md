This project introduces experimental astrophysics to the undergraduate physics
curriculum via the mini-project-based advanced physics laboratory, through
upperclass independent study/research projects, and to a lesser degree, the
introductory astronomy courses. These goals are achieved by the replacement of
the current educational grade 10" telescope with a 16" research grade
instrument, and the associated acquisition of a CCD camera system for digital
imaging analysis. A computer workstation is included for using existing
sophisticated UNIX-based imaging software. The equipment effectively complements
the existing observatory facility and instrumentation available, and the
projected experimentation made possible with it significantly contribute to the
current student research capabilities of the department.
