Support is requested for an intensive 9-day course entitled "Molecular Biology
and Development of Xenopus laevis". This course will be offered annually in the
spring as part of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory's post-graduate education
program. The course will provide extensive laboratory exposure to the biology
and manipulation of embryos from the frog Xenopus laevis. Xenopus is a
vertebrate uniquely suited for studies of early development because large
numbers of embryos, from fertilization onward, can easily be obtained.
Development is rapid, and the large size of the embryos facilitates their
micromanipulation to allow analysis of the role of cell interactions
("inductions") in development, in ways that are not feasible in mammalian
embryos, such as mice. The course is particularly suited for those who have a
current training in molecular biology and knowledge of developmental biology,
but have had no experience with Xenopus. Five main areas will be covered both in
the laboratory and by expert lecturers. These are: (i) care and handling of
adults and embryos, (ii) stages of embryonic development and anatomy (iii) whole
mount in situ hybridization, (iv) microinjection of eggs and oocytes, (v)
microinjection of blastula and gastrula stages, and induction assays.
