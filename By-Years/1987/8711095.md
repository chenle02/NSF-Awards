The proposed experimentation will isolate and characterize the arabidopsis gene
encoding NADPH- protochlorophyllide oxioreductase (PCR). This appears to be a
nuclear gene whose product is found in immature chloroplasts (etioplasts). The
level of gene product in the cell is light-regulated, as is that of a number of
other gene products found in the chloroplast. A novel feature of this gene is
that the amount of product is decreased by exposure to light, whereas expression
of most other light-regulated genes so far studied is augmented by light. Timko
will isolate the structural gene for PCR, then determine its sequence and the
start sites for its transcription. He will use plant DNA transformation
techniques to define the regulatory elements of the gene, including the
photoresponsive element. The element will be used to isolate and characterize
the cellular factor(s) to which it responds. The regulation of plant gene
expression by light has been a central problem in plant molecular biology. The
proposed work will examine the structure and regulation of a novel
photoregulated gene; one whose expression appears to be inhibited by light. The
gene's product acts at an important step in the light-induced maturation of the
chloroplast. Thus, the proposed work should lead to a valuable increase in our
understanding of the regulation of plant gene expression and of the
morphogenesis of the chloroplast.
