The International Association of Mathematical Physics hosts the International
Congress of Mathematical Physics (ICMP) every three years. The XVIIth ICMP will
be held 6-11 August 2012 in Aalborg, Denmark. This project will fund ICMP
participation for approximately 15 young mathematical physics researchers from
institutions in the US working in various areas of mathematical physics, from
quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, to string theory. In addition, the
supported participants will attend the Young Researchers Symposium 3-4 August
2011 in Aalborg before the ICMP. The ICMP is the main meeting of mathematical
physicists from around the world. The primary speakers present work on the
cutting-edge of the various fields of mathematical physics. This is an
outstanding opportunity for young research at US institutions to meet these
renowned mathematicians and to learn about recent advances. The topical programs
allow the participants to focus on the subfield of their interests and learn
about recent work. In addition to the ICMP, the Young Researcher Symposium will
allow the recipients to present their own work and to interact more closely with
leaders in the field. The selection committee will choose the grant recipients
based on their research achievements and promise. The committee will strive to
ensure that participation in the ICMP will greatly contribute to the
professional development of the applicant. The availability of these travel
grants will be posted on the AMS, AWM, and ICMP web sites, and it will be
electronically distributed to mathematical physicists, both mathematicians and
physicists, throughout the US.
