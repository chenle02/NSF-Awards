Previous curricula have provided undergraduate students very little laboratory
experience in the thermal sciences. To many students, thermal sciences is an
abstraction with many equations and block diagrams. Societal attitudes impede
underrepresented groups from entering engineering programs. Through this
project, an integrated thermal science laboratory is set up for undergraduate
and precollege students, where basic principles and component and system
operations are illustrated through several systems employing commercially
available hardware (system denotes a collection of components to achieve a
desired output). Additionally, air compressors, small engines, small turbines,
diesel fuel injection pumps, and so on are available to the students to
disassemble and assemble the equipment. The objectives of the laboratory are (1)
to demonstrate the basic principles in the context of systems and to demonstrate
component and system operation, (2) to expose the students to current technology
in instrumentation, data acquisition, and processing, and yet retain some of the
simpler methods of measurement, (3) to involve precollege students in the study
of engineering systems, and (4) to encourage the students to disassemble and
assemble hardware to make the study of engineering exciting. The laboratory is
introduced as an elective course to departmental students and opened to
precollege students who participate in the many summer programs at the
university (with emphasis on underrepresented groups). The effectiveness of the
laboratory can be evaluated through questionnaires at the beginning and end of
the laboratory course and by tracking the precollege students to determine if
participation in the laboratory has an effect on their interest in studying
engineering. The results of the study can be presented before an ASEE session
and by making the laboratory manual available to other institutions. *
