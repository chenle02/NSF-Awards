The goal of this project is to improve the quality of under- graduate
laboratory experiences by equipping the organismal physiology laboratories with
computer-assisted data acquisition apparati. Three courses in the Biology
Department (General Zoology, Human Anatomy and Physiology, and Animal
Physiology) will be directly affected. Previously, physiological experimentation
in the laboratory sections of these courses was limited by inadequate equipment.
The acquisition of computers, printers and appropriate hardware-software
packages greatly enhances the ability of students to gather and analyze data.
Six Laser 128 computers with monitors and printers and four software packages
(Physiogrip, Spirocomp, Experiments in Human Physiology and Physio-graphic)
constitute the suite of new equipment. These programs allow both majors and non-
majors to collect data with a minimum of frustration, and introduce
undergraduates to sophisticated uses of computers in Biology. The grantee
institution is matching the NSF award with an equal sum obtained from non-
Federal sources.
