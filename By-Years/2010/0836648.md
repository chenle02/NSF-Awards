This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program
entitled, "NUE: Societal Dimensions of Nanotechnology: A Course Connecting
Communities", at the University of Virginia (UVA), under the direction of Dr.
Michael E. Gorman, will develop a new course on societal dimensions of
nanotechnology that will be taught interactively, both to students at a major
research University and to members of a community (Danville, VA) that are
seeking to use emerging technologies to revive their economy. The course will be
designed for first and second year students and will be offered through UVA's
engineering school, though it will be open to students from any major. The
course will place particular emphasis on developing "interactional expertise"
relevant to nanotechnology, meaning that students will learn enough about
technical aspects at nanoscale to understand its potential social impacts.
