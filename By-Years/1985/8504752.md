The objective of this research project is to develop analytical tools for the
study of the error probability and computational complexity of decentralized
multi-user detectors and the performance limits achievable by coding. To
approach the analysis of the error probability of these signal detection
problems, the techniques of optimum sequence detection in colored non-Gaussian
noise will be applied. Computational complexity will be studied to determine
whether polynomial-time rules exist with near-minimum probability of error. The
primary objectives of the analysis of performance limits are to determine
whether existing results that assume symbol-synchronization among users holds in
the completely asynchronous case, and to analyze the dependence of system
performance on signal energies.
