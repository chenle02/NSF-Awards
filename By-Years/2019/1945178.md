Minimal surfaces, Constant Mean Curvature (CMC) surfaces, and Prescribed Mean
Curvature (PMC) surfaces are mathematical models of soap films, soap bubbles,
and capillary surfaces. These types of surfaces have always been important
topics in geometry and general relativity, and have also inspired advances of
many other subjects in mathematics and science. Geometric Variational Theory is
the major method for proving the existence of these types of surfaces. In this
research program, the PI will conduct a number of research projects on the
existence of minimal, CMC, and PMC surfaces by further advancing Geometric
Variational Theory. This research program also includes support for educational
activities. The PI will develop new curricula for graduate research topic
courses, recruit and mentor Ph. D. students and postdocs, and direct advanced
undergraduate students for honors theses. The PI will also organize a summer
workshop for graduate students and junior postdocs on topics related to this
research program. The goal is to promote early career researchers and encourage
collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first subject, the PI will explore
important applications of the recent resolution of the Multiplicity One
Conjecture. In particular, the PI will investigate new ergodic properties of
minimal surfaces, and the Multiplicity One Conjecture in the Simon-Smith setting
and the free boundary setting. In the second subject, the PI will continue the
research on Geometric Variational Theory with Lagrange multipliers. The PI
anticipates to prove topological bounds for the min-max CMC surfaces in three
manifolds, as well as to prove the existence of multiple CMC surfaces. PI also
intends to establish the general existence theory for capillary surfaces. In the
last subject, the PI will investigate existence problems and applications for
minimal surfaces in singular and noncompact spaces via approximations using the
free boundary min-max theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
