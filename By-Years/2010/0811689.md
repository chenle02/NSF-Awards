With the emergence of the multicore architecture comes the promise of
integrating enormous computing power in a single chip, thereby enabling parallel
computing in all types of platforms including handheld computers and desktop
machines. Providing proper software support for applications is critical to
harness the true power of this architecture. An inherent characteristic of
multicores that presents a significant obstacle is runtime variation:
reliability, energy/thermal behavior and process variation will vary across
identically designed components of a multicore, producing a negative impact on
application power consumption and performance. Runtime variation has been
identified as one of the key problems that could block further scaling of
circuits if not properly addressed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project
is developing an advanced execution system, called a Robust Execution
Environment (REEact), that dynamically mediates, controls and adapts an
application's execution to the runtime resource landscape originating from
runtime variations. It employs a combination of techniques in adapting both the
hardware resources and the application software code to overcome the impact of
runtime variations. At the hardware level, it adapts the resources, such as
setting the speed/voltage of a node on the multicore. At the software level,
REEact dynamically optimizes code, taking into account performance and power
consumption due to runtime variations. It elicits the help of the OS in
determining what resources to use in running the application. REEact informs the
OS about information it dynamically discovers about latency, power, and
application behavior. REEact is built as multi-layer hierarchical runtime system
that interacts with the parallel application, the OS, and the underlying
multicore architecture to ensure that maximum performance is achieved.
