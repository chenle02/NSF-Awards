This project will use simplified models (barotropic vorticity equation, shallow-
water equation, two-layer and multi-layer quasi-geostrophic), together with an
atmospheric general circulation model, to better understand the mechanisms of
atmospheric low-frequency variability in midlatitudes. It addresses the
importance of eddy-feedback, interactions with the subtropical jet,
tropospheric-stratospheric interaction, as well as interactions with the
underlying ocean. These are long-standing problems that are important to the
current concerns of regional climate variability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If
successful, this project is expected to provide useful forecast guidance for
cold air outbreak events, with benefits in the area of understanding medium to
long-term climate variability. The work will support a graduate student and
partially support a postdoc, and aspects of the research will be integrated into
the graduate courses of the principal investigator. The results will be
disseminated via publications in international scientific journals and at
scientific conferences.&lt;br/&gt;
