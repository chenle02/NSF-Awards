This research will continue the principal investigator's study of Diophantine
Equations and Diophantine Approximations. One of the main areas of research will
continue to be on obtaining upper bounds for the number of integral solutions of
Thue's equation and Thue's inequality. The bounds are to involve the number of
variables occurring and not the height of the coefficients. A modified version
of the method developed by the principal investigator and W. M. Schmidt is
expected to apply to some of the problems in this proposed research which are
generalizations and applications of the principal investigator's current and
prior research. The principal investigator also intends to investigate problems
in simultaneous Diophantine Approximation.
