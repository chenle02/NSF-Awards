9313434 Clough The Biology and Chemistry Departments of the University of
Richmond are housed in Gottwald Science Center, which was constructed in 1978
primarily for classroom use. Since that time, a significant number of younger
faculty members have been added to the staff, and their high levels of research
activity are poorly served by the Science Center's laboratory spaces. In
particular, there are an insufficient number of efficient fume hoods, and the
building's ventilation system and hazardous material storage rooms are
inadequate. To address these concerns, the University will upgrade the
building's HVAC system, modernize the chemical storage facilities, and add 24
new fume hoods. The planned upgrading of Gottwald Science Center will have
several significant effects: 1) the safety of students, staff, and faculty in
the Center will be safeguarded; 2) research instrumentation will have more
suitable environments; 3) the scope and quality of faculty research will be
increased; and 4) joint student-faculty research projects will be easier to
pursue. These changes will serve to attract more students into scientific
careers. ***
