Funds are requested to purchase state-of-the-art plant growth chambers. The
incubators will provide space to enable four different investigators to proceed
with work involving plant molecular genetics. All of the projects require
rearing considerable numbers of plants under completely controlled conditions
and two occasionally need isolation as viral and viroid pathogens are used.
Growth chamber space presently available is completely inadequate to support
these projects.
