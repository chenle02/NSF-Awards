This project exploits recent advances in the use of sophisticated mathematical
methodologies to address related fundamental questions in the foundations of
computation theory and programming language semantics. Many important questions
arise out of a desire and need to capture in a semantic setting both minor and
major variations in computational strategies. The significance in investigating
such variations lies in the fact that they can both provide a means of
interpreting increasingly sophisticated programming language constructs, and
also isolate fundamental mathematical processes at work that help define and
distinguish between different notions of computation. The main focus of the
research entails the utilization of new approaches in the use of algebras,
monads and comonads, categories, logic and sheaves to provide a systematic and
conceptual approach to the interpretation and solution of these questions.
Questions to be addressed include: finding an algebraically robust
interpretation for partial data types and partial maps; generating an intrinsic
characterization of fixed point constructions, including the generation of
recursive data types, and isolating the special role of invariance in this
process; defining a categorical foundation for semantics in general and
describing a synthetic domain theory in particular; and identifying and
utilizing in a semantic setting logical properties resident in sheaf-theoretic
structures. General areas of investigation include partial data types and
computation, fixed point semantics, monadic and comonadic computation,
invariance and algebras, and partial sheaf semantics. Technical tools include
functorial liftings on categories of algebras, refined partial map classifiers,
algebraic uniformity, induction and coinduction principles, natural and
dinatural transformations, monadic and comonadic strength, domain theory and
extensional PERs.
