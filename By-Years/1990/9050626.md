A laboratory course, "Properties of Engineering Materials," has been developed
for mechanical engineers. The goals of the new course are: (1) To show the
effects of structure and mechanical processing on material properties, (2) To
show the differences between the behavior of metals, polymers and composites,
(3) To become familiar with standard experimental techniques, and (4) To show
the importance of these effects and differences in design and manufacturing. The
equipment required for this project includes an impact machine and a computer
controlled tensile machine suitable for testing ductile polymers and elastomers.
These make possible the study of new polymer and composite materials, especially
the internal damping and creep behavior that occurs at room temperature. Also
the effects of material processing on mechanical properties can be investigated.
The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's
institution.
