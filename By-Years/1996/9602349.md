As the semiconductor manufacturing and wafer fabrication industries expand
throughout the western US, the demand for highly-skilled technicians grows. This
expansion creates the difficult challenge of upgrading course content and
pedagogy, and providing adequate faculty development opportunities among
community colleges, the primary workforce providers, and high school tech prep
programs. The Albuquerque Technical Vocational Institute's (TVI) Project TIE,
Training for Industry Education, will address this problem by holding twelve,
five-day seminars in which up to 120 community college and high school faculty
perform semiconductor manufacturing processes in a clean room environment. TVI's
Regional Semiconductor Manufacturing Training Laboratory (RSMT Lab) is a
cleanroom that has been built to meet industry demands for well-trained
semiconductor manufacturing technicians. Seminars, planned by an administrative
team of industry (Intel) and educational (TVI) representatives, will be designed
to provide hands-on work in TVI's RMST Lab, dialogue about pedagogy, and
discussions with semiconductor manufacturing engineers, scientists, and
technicians. Participants will receive a resource packet containing a technical
manual, bibliography, and information on developing SMT degree programs and
laboratories. The target audience is community college and Tech Prep high school
faculty. TVI's primary partner in this project is Intel Corporation, which has
built Fab 11, its largest plant, in Albuquerque. Sandia National Laboratories is
a secondary partner. Project TIE will provide faculty a rare opportunity to
acquire hands-on experience in cleanroom environment. Improved and enhanced
instruction and communication among community colleges throughout the US are
anticiDated results as faculty take newly-acquired skills and resources to their
schools.
