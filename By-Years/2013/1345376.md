This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop and commercialize an online video-
sharing platform that scales math teacher education and training. The platform
embeds a novel pedagogical method that combines gamification, algorithm-based
peer review processes, and social learning technologies. The platform allows
aspiring and new math teachers to develop and hone their teaching skills through
frequent practice, observation of self, observation of others, and peer and
expert feedback loops. The goal for the project is to beta test a prototype of
the platform, collect survey responses, and iterate the prototype in response to
the users' experience.

The broader/commercial impact of this project is to provide a platform for math
teachers dispersed across the U.S. to learn from each other and strengthen their
teaching skills by providing multiple opportunities for the teachers to practice
skills, observe themselves, observe and collaborate with other teachers, and
learn from mentors. Each of these steps has been identified as critical to
effective teacher training. Recent meta-analyses of research show that teacher
professional development has a significant positive effect on student
achievement. Compared to 60 world education systems, the U.S. ranked ninth in
fourth grade math and twelfth in eighth grade math. The proposed training
platform is an innovative response to the need for low-cost, high-scale math
teacher training. Investing in innovative math teacher education and training
will foster higher student achievement in math and consequently, fill existing
high skill jobs, spur innovation, and play a role in the growth of the U.S.
economy.
