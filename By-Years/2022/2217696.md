Just-in-time (JIT) compilers are integral to many popular programming languages,
such as Java, C#, or JavaScript. These languages use managed runtime
environments, where the execution of a program starts in an interpreted mode,
but as code gets executed more times, a JIT compiler recompiles code blocks into
an optimized native form, ensuring faster and more optimized versions of code.
JIT compilers are instrumental in ensuring that software written in the
aforementioned languages is highly performant. Despite the immense importance of
JIT compilers for optimizing deployed software, there is little research focused
on JIT compilation, particularly in the area of software testing.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop techniques to support both JIT
compiler developers to better test their compilers and general software
developers to improve their software testing process by taking advantage of the
underlying JIT compiler with which they run. To accomplish this goal, this
project will (1) develop test generation techniques that allow JIT compiler
developers to bring their domain knowledge to better test JIT compilers, (2)
accelerate software testing via compiler-cognizant analyses, and (3) integrate
existing testing techniques closer with the compilers. This proposal has the
potential to substantially reduce the cost of software testing and software
development, as well as increase the quality of JIT compilers and the code they
produce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
