In this CAREER project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics &amp;
Mechanisms B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Alexander R. Lippert
of the Department of Chemistry at Southern Methodist University is developing
responsive glow stick chemistry (chemiluminescence) for biological imaging. The
project aims to synthesize and understand specialized molecules that
spontaneously emit light in response to biological events. Mastering this
fundamental chemical phenomenon found in fireflies and jellyfish provides new
methods to measure and visualize the chemistry that lies at the heart of
biological processes. The visual appeal of multi-colored chemiluminescence will
be used to inspire future generations of students from K-12 to the graduate
level with a centralized outreach theme of encouraging scientific creativity
through seminars, K-12 research opportunities, and coursework aimed at teaching
the creative process in a scientific context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Triggered
chemiluminescence has the potential to dramatically transform biological imaging
in wild-type organisms by eliminating autofluorescence, photobleaching, and
other issues endemic to traditional fluorescence imaging techniques, but
fundamental advances in understanding how molecular structure affects
chemiluminescence emission is required. This project aims to synthesize,
characterize, and understand new classes of triggered chemiluminescent imaging
agents structurally designed to manipulate energy transfer processes.
Fundamental questions to be addressed include: 1) How can the energy in a
chemiluminescent excited state be efficiently transferred by through-space and
through-bond energy transfer mechanisms to enhance luminescence emission? 2)
What molecular structures will enable tuning of emission wavelengths for near-
infrared and ratiometric readouts? 3) How can chemiluminescence emission be
dynamically triggered with spatiotemporally controlled illumination to maximize
signal to background in a region of interest?
