The focus of this research is the use of photochemical methods for the synthesis
of organic compounds in the crystalline state. Photodecarbonylation of aliphatic
ketones to produce biradicals and the decomposition of diazo compounds is
expected to lead to facile entry to cyclic compounds and singlet carbenes that
are useful synthetic intermediates. Mechanistic studies of the reaction pathways
will shed light on radical dimerization and hydrogen abstraction processes in
the solid state. Dr. Garcia-Baribay's educational efforts focus on the training
of graduate, undergraduate and post-doctoral chemists, many who come from non-
traditional and disadvantaged backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this
renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research and educational efforts of Dr. Miguel A. Garcia-Garibay in the
Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at UCLA. Professor Garcia-Garibay will
focus his work on the development of chemical processes that can be performed in
the solid state with light as a reagent. These processes will allow the
synthesis of complex organic compounds without the use of solvents or heavy
metals that can pollute the environment. The resulting "green chemistry" is
expected to be of use by pharmaceutical companies. The educational activities of
the award will enhance opportunities for women and Hispanic students at UCLA.
