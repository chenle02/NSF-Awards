This project addresses the formation of pollutants (other than dioxins and
furans) in the cool zone--the region downstream from the flame in a combustor
where radical quenching and surface catalysis are the dominant modes of
reaction. A dual-chamber reactor is used in which the first chamber houses a
diffusion flame and the second chamber (simulating the cool zone) can be
configured to study gas-phase reactions, wall and surface effects, or catalysis
by entrained particles. Effluents from both chambers are analyzed by gas
chromatography. The study uses methane as a fuel pure and doped with ethylene,
benzene or trichlorobenzene. Dopants can also be added to the effluent of the
combustor, hydrogen chloride, nitrogen oxides, and water are used. Surfaces
studied include silica, solica doped with copper oxide or iron oxide, a model
fly ash, and real fly ashes from a municipal solid-waste incinerator and a coal
combustor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This effort provides fundamental data on
formation of pollutants and provides a rational basis for strategies to reduce
pollutant emissions from incinerators, power and heating plants, and industrial
operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
