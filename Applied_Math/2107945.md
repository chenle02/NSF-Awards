Understanding how systems respond to sudden changes is critical to science and
engineering applications. Classic examples include explosions in confined areas,
gases compressed in a piston chamber, or breaking of water reservoir dams.
Important applications include design of impact absorbers, which are important
in protecting civil infrastructure and passengers in automobile accidents. They
also play a crucial role in the deployment and landing of spacecraft. This
project studies a class of systems modeled by nonlinear lattices, mathematical
models of chains of particles that interact with each other in a nonlinear
fashion. Models of origami-based materials will be the primary nonlinear
lattices considered in this project since such materials exhibit desirable
properties for applications. For example, the harder an origami lattice is hit,
the slower a wave will travel through it. The project aims to improve
understanding of wave propagation in nonlinear lattices through mathematical
modeling, computer simulation, and experimentation. Results are expected to aid
in the design of impact-mitigating devices. Students who belong to groups
underrepresented in the sciences will be trained and recruited to participate in
summer research experiences via a work-study program.

In some systems subjected to a sudden change in state, an oscillating wave is
formed that connects (local) states of different amplitude. Such oscillating
waves are called dispersive shock waves (DSWs). The standard approach to analyze
a DSW is based on Whitham modulation theory. In the case of nonlinear lattices,
the Whitham modulation equations are prohibitively complex. In this project, a
low-dimensional differential equation that accurately describes the waves that
make up a DSW in a lattice will be sought using data-driven methodologies. This
low-dimensional differential equation will be exploited to obtain a simple
analytical description of a DSW. A quasi-continuum approach will also be
employed to analytically identify the underlying low-dimensional differential
equation. A systematic study of two-dimensional DSWs will also be conducted.
Numerical simulations, small-amplitude approximations, modulation theory, and
experimentation will be employed.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
