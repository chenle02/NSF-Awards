The researchers are working to develop general tools to diagnose end-to-
end&lt;br/&gt;performance problems of advanced network applications
on&lt;br/&gt;high-speed research networks. This tool development will be
grounded&lt;br/&gt;in addressing the needs of two representative
applications,&lt;br/&gt;one with bulk throughput requirements and one with
interactive&lt;br/&gt;requirements. The researchers capitalize on the existing
Surveyor infrastructure and&lt;br/&gt;will work with other NSF-funded projects
(both applications and&lt;br/&gt;measurement), coordinating closely with the
Internet2 End-to-End&lt;br/&gt;Performance Initiative to ensure the results
continue to be&lt;br/&gt;used past the expiration of this grant for problems
facing&lt;br/&gt;higher-education.&lt;br/&gt;
