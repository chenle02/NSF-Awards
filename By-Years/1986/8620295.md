A half-day symposium entitled "Molecular and Genetic Organization of Plant
Genomes" will held be held August 11, 1987, at the meeting of the Genetics
Section of the Botanical Society of America in conjunction with the American
Institute of Biological Sciences at Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio. This
symposium is part of an ongoing effort by the Genetics Section to encourage
application of molecular genetics to botanical problems. We have selected
speakers with important current research programs in plant molecular genetics
and developmental biology who will be of interest to a broad audience. For the
most part, the Botanical Society of America is composed of non- molecular
scientists. This half-day symposium brings to their attention some of the most
important molecular work in progress in the plant world and will provide an
environment in which non-molecular botanists can interact with molecular
botanists.
