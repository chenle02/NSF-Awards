Peterson Improved understanding of the nitrogen cycle in estuaries is needed to
help explain how anthropogenic changes in nitrogen inputs are affecting coastal
systems. We propose to experimentally test conceptual and numerical models of
nitrogen dynamics in an estuary by adding 15N-enriched dissolved inorganic
nitrogen to the upper reaches of the Parker River-Plum Island Estuary, the site
of and ongoing NSF-funded Land Margin Ecosystem Research (LMER) program.
Previous whole system labeling experiments in forested watersheds, lakes and
rivers have demonstrated there feasibility, power and cost effectiveness of the
tracer addition approach. In the Parker River-Plum Island Sound estuary,
intensive measurements of the distribution of the added nitrogen tracer will
yield estimates of fluxes and residence times of nitrogen in water, food web
components and sediments. The 15N addition experiment will provide information
to test and refine complex models estuarine N flow that are otherwise very
difficult to validate. The product will be greatly improved understanding of the
transport, transformation, and fate of nitrogen in riverine saltmarsh estuaries.
