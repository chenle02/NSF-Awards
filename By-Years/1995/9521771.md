The Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL) is an independent, nonprofit
field station with no institutional affiliation, which provides facilities for
researchers who which to study high-altitude biology in a field setting.
Researchers have come to the RMBL for 68 years, and during that time have
patiently put up with inadequate housing and research facilities. Recent
facilities grants from the NSF have assisted with construction and renovation of
several buildings. This project will support renovation of undergraduate
researcher and research assistant housing. The building for which this project
will be conducted was built in 1932 and has been used to house up to 10
undergraduate researchers. Years of winter snow damage have caused structural
distress that has been repaired from season to season, but annual reports from a
structural engineer suggest that the safety of the building is in question. This
building is a landmark at the RMBL and has historic value to us. We will
renovate the interior and exterior to provide safe, warm housing for
undergraduate research students.
