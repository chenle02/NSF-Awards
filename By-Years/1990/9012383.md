The objectives of this project are: to conduct research in numerical relativity
and cosmology aimed at understanding the physics of the gravitational field.
This work will be carried out using large-scale numerical simulations supported
by analytic work and extensive test-bed calculations. A major feature of this
program is the development of significant numerical tools and their successful
application to outstanding problems in gravitational waves and astrophysics.
