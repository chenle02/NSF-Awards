IIP 0934418&lt;br/&gt;Arizona State
University&lt;br/&gt;Spanias&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sensor Signal and
Information Processing (SenSIP) consortium at the Arizona State University (ASU)
is planning to join the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC)
entitled "Net-Centric Software and Systems" which currently is a multi-
university Center comprised of the University of North Texas (lead institution),
and the University of Texas at Dallas. The mission of SenSIP at ASU is to
develop signal and information processing foundations for next-generation
integrated multidisciplinary sensing applications in biomedicine, defense,
energy, and other systems. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;ASU will bring to the existing
Center much needed complementary capabilities in the areas of digital signal and
image processing, multimedia systems, sensor networks, information theory and
wireless communications. The proposed site will enable the creation of new
capabilities in sensor signal processing and will bridge the gap between sensor
development and large scale sensor deployment; and, is uniquely positioned to
promote industry research, education, scholarship that will integrate well with
the existing Net-Centric I/UCRC umbrella. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research at
ASU SenSIP will lead to inexpensive, compact, and reusable sensors for industry
applications of relevance to medicine, sustainability, and defense. Publications
in scientific journals and conferences will be complemented with a strong
dissemination effort. The ASU SenSIP site has several established programs for
recruitment from underrepresented groups, involvement of undergraduate students
in research, and mechanisms to create and package online modules with
interdisciplinary research and education content. ASU site also plans to create
a workforce in signal processing related areas that support national initiatives
in medicine, energy, and defense industries.
