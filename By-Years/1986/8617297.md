Robinson Vogt Stover The enormous value of charge-coupled devices (CCDs) for
observational astronomical research is becoming apparent. The use of these two
dimensional detectors with their high quantum efficiency, large wavelength
coverage, linearity, large dynamic range, and low noise has significantly
improved the research effectiveness of large telescopes. However, high quality
CCDs with performance well matched to astronomical research needs are still not
commercially available. This project seeks to help alleviate that problem. In a
cooperative venture between industry and a university, Lick Observatory and the
Reticon Corporation plan to carry out a program leading ultimately to the
production of high quality CCDs optimized for astronomical research. Reticon has
had extensive experience in the production of silicon sensors, many tailored to
astronomical research needs, and Lick Observatory has had considerable
experience in the testing, evaluation, and use of CCDs at the telescope. The
goal is to produce CCDs with a 1200x400 pixel format, with pixels approximately
20 microns in size. The devices will have the high quantum efficiency,
linearity, high charge transfer efficiency, low readout noise, and other
characteristics that are important for astronomical sensors. In consultation
with Lick astronomers, Reticon will be responsible for the design and
construction of the CCDs, and Lick Observatory will carry out a detailed testing
and evaluation of the resulting devices both in the laboratory and at the
telescope. At the completion of the project, Reticon is committed to having
these CCDs readily available to the astronomical community. In addition to the
value of the detectors for astronomical research, significant advances in the
understanding of the basic physics and materials characteristics are expected.
These will be of value to Reticon in bringing this and other products to the
marketplace.
