9414452 LARSON The Alaska Native community desires to become actively involved
in scientific research. One way to achieve this is through the establishment of
a Native Science Commission. The purpose of this workshop proposal is to develop
a number of processes which can facilitiate collaboration and communication
between Native communities and researchers in Alaska. Two workshops, including
both international and Alaska experts, will be held to define the scientific
framework and organization of the Native Science Commisssion. The long-term goal
is to improve communication between the Native and scientific communities, to
stimulate the use of indigenous knowledge in science, to contribute to Arctic
logistics, and to establish a process for approval of research in Alaska. ***
