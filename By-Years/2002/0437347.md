The Institute for Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) funds every year a
summer graduate program in an area of interest to graduate students in
mathematics. The 2004 edition will be held at the University of Notre Dame from
June 8 until June 27, 2004. The topic of the summer school will be on coding
theory and cryptography. About 60 graduate students, 20 recent Ph.D's and 10
more senior researchers will participate in this three week event.

The summer school will combine both teaching and research. Half the time will be
devoted to teaching coding theory and cryptography by some leading researchers
in the field. During the other half of the day groups of 3-4 graduate students
will do research under the supervision of a senior mentor who typically is a
recent PhD. A broad variety of research projects will be studied by the graduate
students. The school will provide a learning and research experience both for
the graduate students and their senior mentors. Details about the summer program
and the studied research projects can be found on the web:

participants.
