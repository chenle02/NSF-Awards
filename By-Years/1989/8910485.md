The primary objective of this U.S.-Poland cooperative research project between
Dr. Alan Litke of the University of California at Santa Cruz and Dr. Michal
Turala of the Institute of Nuclear Physics, Krakow, is to develop a means for
detecting and identifying short-lived particles, including charm hadrones,
bottom hadrons and tau leptons, which emerge from high energy collisions. In
addition to contributing to progress on a prototype vertex detector, the results
of the project are expected to produce measurements of the decays of the Zo into
heavy quark-anti-quark final states. The researchers also anticipate that their
efforts will contribute to the fundamental search for the top quark. This
project in particle physics fulfills the program objective of advancing
scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and
Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in
areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
