This three-year grant supports the research of Professor John P. Wefel and
collaborators at Louisiana State University at Baton Rouge. The group is a
central part of the Japanese- American emulsion chamber collaboration. They
perform measurements of the high energy cosmic ray energy spectra with
experiments carried to high altitudes on balloons. The group will also perform
research on high energy nucleus-nucleus interactions using emulsion techniques
at accelerator experiments at CERN. The group uses experimental techniques which
produce measurements with very high spatial accuracy. These techniques find
application in measurements of rare cosmic ray fluxes and interactions and
nucleus-nucleus interactions. The experiments will yield new information of
great astrophysical interest, and will continue the search for the "quark-gluon
plasma", a new state of matter.
