The Department of Chemistry is developing a series of laboratories for
introductory chemistry that: (1) uses modern technology to engage the students;
(2) provides students with opportunities to design experiments that explore
topics of current chemical interest; and (3) allows students to discover or
develop appropriate ways to analyze their data. These laboratory experiments
designed for the SCI Technologies interface board developed at Montana State
University span a range of subjects including atomic and molecular structure,
macroscopic properties of compounds and materials, energetics, and dynamics and
vary from basic ones to those with a high degree of sophistication. The
experiments are being compiled into a laboratory manual so that they may be
readily adopted by a variety of other educational institutions.
