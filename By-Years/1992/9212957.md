The MINT Center at the University of Alabama will purchase equipment to upgrade
an existing Vac-Tec four target sputtering system. Specifically the proposal
requests funds for retro-fitting a computer based control system and the
installation of a dedicated residual gas analyzer. The equipment will be used to
accelerate progress on several research projects, including an investigation of
the physical, magnetic and magnetoresistive properties of giant
magnetoresistance multilayers for use in MR heads, and of the properties of
sputtered FeN based materials for both thin film recording heads and media. Both
of these projects currently receive significant NSF funding in the form of
individual investigator grants. A continuing commitment to these education and
training of graduate students is evidenced by 13 students supported on related
projects. The performance increases, which may be possible using these
materials, especially in atomically engineered multilayer configurations, make
them very attractive candidates for exploitation in the data recording industry.
The routine production of multilayers composed of a large number of identical
bilayers and of reactively sputtered FeN films and multilayers requires a high
degree of process control. This control will be provided by the proposed upgrade
greatly enhancing the ongoing research program.
