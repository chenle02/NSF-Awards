Dr. Harriet Dinerstein will use several observational techniques to address the
question of how stars undergo the transformation from late stage red giants into
planetary nebulae and ultimately white dwarfs. This transitory evolutionary
episode is a crucial turning point in stellar life histories, yet it is still
not well understood. Dr. Dinerstein will investigate and define the properties
of the massive residual neutral envelopes around the ionized cores of planetary
nebulae. Recent work has demonstrated the presence of these envelopes and
illustrated the use of optical and infrared spectroscopy to determine their
parameters. Data on the amount and distribution of neutral material are
essential to any comprehensive picture of the mass loss and planetary nebula
formation process. Dr. Dinerstein will also study evolved bipolar nebulae, which
represent the phase immediately preceding the appearance of a recognizable
planetary nebula. By combining results of observations at several wavelengths,
Dr. Dinerstein will be able to determine the general geometry of these
structures and locate the main mass and emission components. The comparison of
objects at different stages of development should clarify the evolutionary
progression through this transient and transforming stage of stellar evolution.
