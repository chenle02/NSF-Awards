9310116 LUCAS ABSTRACT Based on a large videotaped corpus representative of the
American Deaf community, this study of sociolinguistic variation in American
Sign Language (ASL) will investigate two theoretical questions: 1) Can the
internal linguistic restraints on variation such as those identified and
described in spoken language studies be identified and described for variation
in ASL; 2) Similarly, can external social constraints be identified and
described and what kind of model best accounts for the external constraints?
Specifically, is a traditional stratification model most appropriate or can a
social network analysis be used to account for individual variability, and are
there factors relevant to the determination of the network score that may be
unique to the American Deaf community? Videotaped data will be collected in
eight representative geographical regions, in group sessions and in individual
interviews. Informants will include White and African_American native or near-
native user of ASL in three age groups controlled for socioeconomic status. The
data will be examined for phonological, lexical, and morphosyntactic variables,
and the internal and external constraints on these variables will be described,
using the Varbrul program. Social network scores will be calculated for selected
informants and correlated for their linguistic behavior. The study has both
theoretical and practical importance: it will contribute to our understanding of
ASL as a human language at a time when the instruction of ASL is rapidly
expanding both for hearing adults and children and for deaf children. ***
