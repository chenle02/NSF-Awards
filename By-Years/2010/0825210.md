Recent installation of a well-head bridge plug at the A(advanced)CORK site in
the Nankai Trough now permits continued monitoring of pressures with superior
resolution in geological formations of a subduction zone (upper basement of
incoming plate, plate boundary fault itself, and overlying sediments). This
important time series of pressure measurements will be made from two ACORKs
deployed during IODP leg 196: 1) a reference hole (1173B) through the sediment
column in the oceanic plate and 2) at a deep site (hole 8081) at the frontal
thrust of an accretionary prism. From these measurements relationships between
subseafloor fluid pressures, fluid flow, and tectonic strain events will be
made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Relationships between subseafloor
pressures and earth quake cycles have societal relevance. The research wiIl
support graduate research, strengthen international collaborations between
RSMAS-JAMSTEC-GSC, and make good use of existing ODP observatories such as
ACORKs&lt;br/&gt;
