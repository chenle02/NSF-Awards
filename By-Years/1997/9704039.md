*** 9704039 Sobenin This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is
for the construction/testing of an accelerating-focusing Rectangular Cavity
Biperiodic Structure (RCBS) to be used in an electron Race Track Microtron
(RTM). Circular cross section cavities produce weak radial focusing of
relativistic electrons. In rectangular cross section cavities, the balance
between transverse electric and magnetic forces acting on these electrons is
changed so that there is substantially increased focusing in one transverse
direction and weak defocusing in the other. In Phase I the rectangular cavity
focusing strengths were further increased by replacing circular beam holes with
rectangular beam slots. Methods were also developed to optimize these
rectangular accelerating-focusing structures by varying both the cavity and beam
aperture dimensions, thus allowing a beam to be tailored to a specific
application. Introducing a RCBS into an RTM allowed the so-called 1st orbit
problem to be elegantly solved and assisted in obtaining appropriate beam
optics, while the impact of space charge effects were few and negligible. Thus,
in Phase II the RCBS design parameters will be optimized for a compact 70 MeV
prototype RTM. This structure will be manufactured, tuned, and its
electrodynamic characteristics measured and then it will be subjected it to a
full range of field tests. Commercial applications of RCBS in addition to those
in RTMS, include high-power Continuous Wave Electron Linacs (CWEL), high charge-
per-bunch Free Electron Laser (FEL) drivers, and electron-positron linear
colliders.
