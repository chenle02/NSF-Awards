Usage patterns in large-scale datasets, such as linguistic corpora collected
from digital social media, can provide insights into many aspects of
communication. These resources have inspired new quantitative analyses and
measures, some of which originated with computer scientists, mathematicians, and
physicists and others with psychologists and linguists. The technology itself is
also being transformed in order to communicate the social and emotional aspects
of human behavior. Innovative lines of inquiry attest to the mutual influence
between technology and behavior and the transformation that ensues as the
relevant disciplines come into contact.

This award will bring together a panel of psychologists, linguists and computer
scientists at the 2015 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement
of Science in San Jose, CA. The theme of the meeting is "Innovations,
Information, and Imaging." The panel will describe research and analytic
techniques for developing new insights into how individuals convey and
understand emotions in dialog, speech, and text. More broadly, the panel will
discuss how linguistic and non-linguistic coordination arise across individuals
and groups as they communicate using new technologies.
