The project focuses on the modernization and upgrading of existing
instrumentation with construction of computer links for a sixty-five foot
instructional and research vessel on Seneca Lake. The two courses most affected
are Physical Oceanography and Meteorology. These two courses are the most
quantitatively offered in the department, and deal with numerous aspects of
fluid dynamics. The field/laboratory components of both courses take the
mathematics and physics into the real world of weather and water. The
institution's research vessel enables students to get hands-on shipboard
experience with the techniques and processes studied in class. Laboratory
experiences that demonstrate instruments and allow the interpretation of
archived data have to be converted into ones that provide for the analysis and
interpretation of relevant data. Acquisition of this equipment is giving
students an experience more like that of the practicing professional scientist.
