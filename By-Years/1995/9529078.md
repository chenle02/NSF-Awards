AST-9529078 Alan Stockton Continuum Components in High-Redshift Galaxies. The
broad central theme of Dr. Stockton's research program is the formation and
evolution of galaxies over roughly the first third of the history of the
Universe. The focus is on galaxies in the redshift range 1 &lt; z &lt; 1.5,
although one of the projects uses such galaxies as a means to investigate
episodes of star formation at much earlier times and another project seeks an
understanding of a common phenomenon in radio galaxies at z &gt; 0.8 through
observations at much lower redshifts.
