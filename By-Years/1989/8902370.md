The heat and mass transfer in a monolithic style automotive catalytic converter
is to be modeled with a scaled-up channel flow facility, equipped with segmented
walls designed to maintain uniform wall temperatures. Velocity, stable species
concentrations, and temperatures are to be measured across the channel and the
heat flux distribution along the wall will be monitored. Numerical modeling of
the reacting flow will accompany the experiments, with the stated overall
objective of predicting the detailed thermal and chemical performance of an
exhaust gas catalytic reactor under steady-state and transient conditions. The
automotive industry relies heavily on catalytic converters to meet EPA standards
for the emission of CO, NO, and unburnt hydrocarbons. More stringent regulation
of these pollutants, availability of precious metal catalysts, and changing fuel
requirements will stress to the limit present converter designs, especially
under light-off and other transient operating conditions. This research program,
which will involve industrial collaboration, will shore up the science base
necessary for the next generation of exhaust gas reactors.
