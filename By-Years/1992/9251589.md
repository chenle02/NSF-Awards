The Department of Plant and Soil Science and the Alabama Center for Applications
of Remote Sensing (ACARS) Laboratory is acquiring equipment for instruction in
spatial analysis and image processing of radiometric data and manipulation and
modeling of geographical data. The project is enabling students being trained in
soil science, physical geography and cartography, plant science, environmental
science and forestry an opportunity to acquire a working knowledge of the
current technology being used in the workplace. Specialized instruction in the
use of the equipment and basic applications of its use in decision-making
processes is being developed.***//
