Time series data for the major compounds in the cycle of dime thylsulfide in
open ocean water will be integrated with experimental studies to address
controlling processes. DMS, DMSP, and DMSO will be measured in Bermuda waters in
conjunction with the time-series studies at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-Series
program. Complementary chemical and biological data collected as part of the
JGOFS program will provide insights into the importance of blooms and
phytoplankton speciation to the DMS cycle. Specific processes involved in the
cycling of DMS, its precursors an its products, will be investigated in
coordinated laboratory experiments. Time-series measurements and laboratory
experiments will be linked by a series of short but intensive process-oriented
field studies at the Bermuda site to test hypotheses derived from time-series
and laboratory work. The major goal of the project is to identify and quantify
the key controlling processes throughout the annual cycle.
