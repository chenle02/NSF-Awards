Boise State University will host the 25th Annual Pacific Northwest Numerical
Analysis Seminar October 26-27, 2012. The goal of the meeting is to bring
together interdisciplinary researchers from universities, government research
labs, and industry from the Pacific Northwest to share expertise in both pure
and applied aspects of numerical analysis and computational mathematics. The
traditional format of a day-long Saturday session for invited talks will be
modified to include a Friday evening poster session for students and
postdoctoral fellows to present their work. This will create a vertically
integrated meeting bringing together individuals from undergraduates to
distinguished researchers. The inclusion of participants from national labs and
industry will foster new potential research and employment opportunities for a
broadened presence of students and postdocs.

Boise State University, which for many years served as an undergraduate teaching
institution, has recently been making key investments in faculty, staff, and
infrastructure to transition into a research-oriented institution. The Pacific
Northwest Numerical Analysis Seminar will be the first conference ever held at
Boise State University in this area of mathematics, and will help strengthen the
recently developed foundation in computational mathematics that is needed to
educate a technological workforce in this underrepresented region of the US.
There will be speakers whose work: (1) interfaces with the biological and
mathematical sciences; (2) involves energy sustainability; (3) focuses on the
challenges of ?big-data?; and (4) concerns the development of
cyberinfrastructure. Speakers will include senior and junior faculty, women
researchers/educators, and graduate students. In addition to standard
communication channels, the seminar will be promoted through the Boise State
University student chapters of the Society of Women Engineers, the Society of
Hispanic Professional Engineers, and the Pacific Northwest Louis Stokes Alliance
for Minority Participation (LSAMP) consortium to broaden participation from
underrepresented groups.
