With this New award, the Chemical Synthesis Program supports Professor Regan J.
Thomson of Northwestern University in an investigation of new reactions that
enable the coupling of two or more molecular fragments to generate new molecules
with specific molecular shapes. These reactions will be especially powerful
within the realm of drug discovery, and ultimately facilitate the rate at which
new biologically active entities can be prepared for further evaluation. These
studies will expose students to a diversity of research areas including
synthesis design, catalysis, methodology development, and the use of mass
spectrometric techniques to screen products. The undergraduates and graduate
students participating in this project will be involved in mentoring the
research projects of Chicago area high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project will study new carbon-carbon bond forming reactions utilizing
N-allylhydrazones and N-sulfonylhydrazones. The approach will involve the
oxidation of allyl hydrazones to diazoallenes, which then undergo a
stereoselective [3,3]-rearrangement with the formation of a new carbon-carbon
bond ultimately producing carbocations, which can be trapped with external
nucelophiles. In addition, sulfonyl hydrazones will be utilized in new carbon-
carbon bond forming reactions. These stereoselective fragment coupling reactions
will be employed in the systhesis of biologically active natural products.
