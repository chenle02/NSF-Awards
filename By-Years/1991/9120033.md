This is a travel grant for a Gordon research conference (August 19-23, 1991)
for ion exchangers and adsorbents. The presentations focus on ion exchange
phenomena and materials. About twenty industrial and academic speakers from the
U. S. and abroad will participate. A poster session for graduate students is
also planned. The discussions will help scientific communications,
interdisciplinary interaction, and education in important fields of separation
science and technology.
