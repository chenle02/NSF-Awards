9627795 Sloan The purpose of this study is to investigate the issue of
continentality (i.e., temperatures associated with large land masses), from the
perspective of possible model sources for discrepancies between model results
and proxy data interpretations of Eocene continental temperatures. The issue of
continental interior climate characteristics persists as one of the major
questions and most active debates of paleoclimatology. Inclusion of the correct
zonal temperature profile, along with the annual cycle in model calculations,
may result in large winter freeze line displacements, and associated changes in
other temperature parameters. This work will focus on (i) the position and
locations of the model-predicted freeze line throughout the year (including
isotherms for +2, 0, -2 and -5 degrees C, corresponding to various biologic
tolerance limits), (ii) the annual amplitude of temperature change over the
continents, (iii) the summer maximum temperature values in continental interior
regions.
