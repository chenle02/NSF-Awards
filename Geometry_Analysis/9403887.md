9403887 MCCrory The group of researchers will be working on several projects in
areas of geometric analysis, Hamiltonian systems and algebraic geometry. Many of
the projects have potential applications to other branches of mathematics
including number theory, Lie groups and certain topics in mathematical physics
including the theory of solitons and its applications. ***
