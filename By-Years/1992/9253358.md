9253358 Bowen The National Teacher Enhancement Project (NTEP) is a collaborative
five-year effort of the Department of Energy (DOE) national laboratories to
improve science education in grades K-8. The project is designed to create
cadres of lead teachers who will serve as role models and mentors for their
colleagues and who will be district leaders in systemic reform initiatives.
Several additional laboratories will be included in the current effort. The
laboratories will optimize their impact on science and mathematics education by
strengthening their growing collective efforts and by providing regional
teachers with access to resources through the DOE national network. During this
project over 240 teachers will receive direct training at the laboratories, and
each of them will conduct inservice programs for other teachers in their
schools, this impacting a large number of teachers nationally. This proposal is
appropriate for teacher enhancement because it is a leadership project which
will bring elementary teachers into the science community, provide extensive
networking among teachers and the National Laboratories, and leverage effective
synergy among the participating Laboratories through its truly collaborative
design. It is also consistent with FCCSET and other national efforts to
coordinate, facilitate, and strengthen efforts to improve science education.
Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 120% of the amount requested from NSF. ***
