This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will explore a
low-frequency positioning system for locating and tracking people inside of
buildings. Phase I will establish system feasibility by showing that lower
frequencies will not be subject to the guided-wave propagation modes caused by
typical indoor structures of hallways, partition walls, and floors. These
guided-wave modes can cause unacceptably large errors in indoor positioning
systems. The concept will be validated by a combination of electromagnetic
modeling and experiments. It is expected that a phase-only, low-frequency
approach will produce high accuracy and good penetration into buildings with
modest bandwidth requirements and minimum problems for licensing approval.

The principal commercial application is in the firefighter market. The system
will monitor not only a firefighter's position but also vital biometric data,
e.g., pulse, respiration, temperature, air tank level. Further, this system will
be portable, obviating the need for a supporting infrastructure. It can also be
used for tracking prison guards and rescuers entering a collapsed building after
an earthquake or other natural disasters. Hospitals could use this technology to
track critical mobile equipment or personnel.
