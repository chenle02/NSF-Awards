The goal of this project is to upgrade the department's Isotope Ratio Mass
Spectrometer (IRMS) because this instrument has become a central instructional
tool in several advanced courses and is now essential for the independent
study/research participation programs mentored by three faculty members. The
instrument allows students to study ecological, physiological and biochemical
phenomena with a modern approach utilizing natural abundances of the stable
isotopes of carbon (13C) and nitrogen (15N) as quantitative tracers. The upgrade
automates sample analyses and facilitates throughput by students, adds a third
detector to facilitate isotopic corrections, allows nitrogen analyses to be
undertaken readily, and utilizes a computer-controlled analytical system which
transmits data to a departmental network for reduction, statistical analyses,
and presentation. The instrument is being supported by an IRMS technician who
facilitates student training and use. The upgrade is significant because it
extends the instrument into the hands of more students in advanced courses and
enhances student-mentor opportunities. The grantee institution is matching the
NSF award with an equal sum obtained from non-Federal sources.
