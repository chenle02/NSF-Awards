This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) to explore the effects of
team-based effects on learning engineering at the undergraduate level. The work
will be undertaken in two main phases. The first phase includes the development,
validation, and testing of a new student assessment protocol for team-based
learning in engineering. The second phase includes the development and use of an
observation protocol in assessing team behaviors, which will be used in refining
the model of team design offered in the proposal. Several propositions have been
put forth as to what factors affect the outcomes of group learning experiences.
The work will take place at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Pennsylvania
State University, and with students participating in electronic teams as part of
the National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance (NCIIA). The team
represents expertise in engineering and educational psychology.&lt;br/&gt;
