9614457 Halliday This proposal will focus on placing constrains on the early
evolution of the Earth-Moon system by studying chalcophile and siderophile
element abundances and isotopic compositions. The concentrations of Zn, Ga, Ge,
Mo, Ru, Pd, Ag, Cd, In, Sn, Te, W, Ir, Pt and Tl will be determined by isotope
dilution, primarily using the new technique of MC-ICPMS. Isotopic compositions
and concentration data will then be used to test models of accretion and core
formation. The history of core formation and accretion in the inner solar system
will be constrained using high precision W isotopic compositions of chondritic
meteorites, early lunar rocks and achondrites. In addition, Pb-Tl geochronology
will be developed in order to explore the timing of the dominant depletion of
volatile elements on the Moon and other inner solar system objects, and possibly
to allow measurement of precise ages for differentiated meteorites.
