Clark Atlanta University is sponsoring a four-week Summer Science Camp for
forty seventh and eighth grade African-American students each summer for the
three year period, 1992-1994. Program participants, selected from elementary and
middle schools in Metropolitan Atlanta, enroll in an academic enrichment
experience that includes interdisciplinary science, computer applications,
mathematics, and communication skills. Instruction emphasizes problem solving
and critical thinking while focusing on real life situations. In addition to
classroom experiences, participants interact with research scientists in their
laboratories and in career awareness seminars and discussion groups. Weekly
field trips round out the academic experiences of the program. Follow-up
activities during the academic year include workshops each semester for program
participants and their parents, an awards program at the end of the school year,
and a mentoring program in which participants are matched with undergraduate or
graduate student science majors who serve as their mentors.
