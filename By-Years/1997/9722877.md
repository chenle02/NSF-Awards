Cording 9722877 This award supports a three-year collaborative research project
between Dr. Edward Cording of the University of Illinois and Dr. Hakmoon Kim of
the University of Dankook in Seoul, Korea on "Subsurface Construction, Resulting
Ground Movements, and Protection of the Built Environment." The project will
involve 1) large-scale modeling, 2) collection and analysis of field data, 3)
numerical analysis, and 4) development of guidelines and recommendations related
to ground movement and building damage. The study will benefit from data on the
more than 100 construction-related excavations currently underway in Seoul.
Excavations and tunnels are constructed adjacent to and beneath thousands of
buildings each year, and with each instance, there is the possibility of damage
to structures. With ever increasing demands being placed on limited urban space,
subsurface construction projects will continue to increase. This research effort
will combine the expertise, facilities and data of the American and Korean
research groups to assess how best to deal with potential damage to structures
due to nearby subsurface construction. ***
