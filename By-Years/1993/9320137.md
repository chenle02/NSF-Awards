9320137 Congleton Increased worker productivity and safety are directly related
to ergonomics. An Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Ergonomics
can study the systematic and rational means to fit the work to the person. The
primary goal of the proposed Center's research would be to improve work
performance and safety through the study and development of general principles
that govern the interaction of humans and their working environment. This action
funds Texas A&amp;M University to hold a planning meeting with potential
industry members to determine a possible research agenda for the Center and its
potential for support as an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center. The
Co-Principal Investigators are nationally recognized researchers in ergonomics
and have the facilities to conduct a planning meeting. The Program Manager
recommends that Texas A&amp;M University be awarded $10,000 for one year for
this project.
