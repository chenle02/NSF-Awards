This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan Cooperative
Photoconversion/Photosynthesis Research Program project between Professor Peter
Ford, Department of Chemistry, University of California, Santa Barbara, and Dr.
Mikio Hoshino, Solar Energy Research Group, The Institute of Physical and
Chemical Research (RIKEN), Tokyo, Japan. The project will focus on the
investigation of the fundamental chemistry of new metallo-organic compounds that
are photochemical precursors to nitric oxide (NO) formation. Nitric oxide is a
known cardiovascular dilator recently identified as the endothelium-derived
relaxing factor in blood vessels and implicated as having an intercellular
messenger role in mammalian neural transmission and in the activation of
macrophages to the bactericidal/tumoricidal state. The collaboration will bring
together the complementary talents and expertise of two very productive research
groups in the United States and Japan to investigate the synthesis and
photoreaction behavior of a variety of nitrosyl metal complexes with the long
term (speculative) goal of understanding fundamental principles necessary for
the design of new photodynamic therapy (PDT) drugs.
