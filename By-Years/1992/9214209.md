This proposal is for funds to purchase a transmission electron microscope for
the Microelectronics and Engineering Research. It will be used mainly for
research in materials science such as studies of epitaxial growth of Si-Ge
films, deformation mechanisms of high temperature intermetallic compounds, and
microstructural development in permanent magnet alloys.
