This award provides travel support for undergraduate student participation in
the Symposium on Undergraduate Research. This Symposium will be held at the
annual meeting of the American Physical Society Division of Laser Science (DLS),
in conjunction with the annual Frontiers in Optics (FiO) meeting of the Optical
Society of America. The conference program includes many of the research topics
central to Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics. The support of students
through this award makes a substantial contribution to the education and
training of future scientists. Students who graduate with a background in laser
science acquire a broad range of knowledge and skills that enable them to
contribute to progress in many areas of science and technology.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting is scheduled to be held Washington DC on
September 14, 2020. It offers an opportunity for undergraduate students to
present their research results and to interact with senior scientists primarily
from the United States, but also the broader international community. Support is
provided only for US students (students enrolled in US
universities).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
