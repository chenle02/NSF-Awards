A variety of mass spectrometric analyses of undifferentiated meteorites will be
conducted to study the conditions, processes and timescales involved in the
early history of the solar system and in the formation of planetary bodies. The
samples will be both whole rock and seperated phases, notably phosphates. The
analyses will include coordinated application of both noble gas and thermal
emission mass spectrometry. The research is organized into three related
projects: 1) An attempt will be made to determine the cosmic abundance of Pu-244
based on analysis of fission Xe in undifferentiated meteorites, 2) Rb, Sr, and
Sr-87/Sr-86 in low Rb/Sr phases of chondrites will be determined in order
identify initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios and constrain the duration of 'metamorphism'
for these meteorites, 3) Noble gas abundances in chondrites will be measured
using isotope dilution rather than the conventional peak-height comparison
technique. This should give an order-of-magnitude improvement in accuracy. The
PIs will collaborate in these analyses with Lugmair at Scripps, Burnett at Cal
Tech, and Pellas at Paris.
