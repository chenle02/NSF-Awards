A new theoretical model has been developed to analyze laboratory experiments and
field measurements of fallout from volcanic eruption plumes. The model is based
on the sedimentation from lateral gravity currents which develop at the top of
plumes in stratified environments. It allows for the prediction of fallout
patterns from plumes such as volcanic eruptions or black smoker vents. This
project seeks to develop a general model of volcanic ash fallout from explosive
eruptions which utilizes this new theory. A major task of the work will be to
develop a computer model which can incorporate the effect of wind transport with
the theoretical sedimentation relationship. It will involve collaboration with
British scientists who have been concerned with this problem.
