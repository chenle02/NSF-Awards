The enteric nervous system controls motility. Enteric neurons produce a variety
of neurotransmitters and form a neuronal network in the gut. The long-term
objective of this research is to elucidate the mechanisms which regulate the
development of these neuronal transmitter phenotypes and the formation of the
enteric neuronal circuitry. Evidence indicates that the environment in general
and the gut in particular can influence the expression of peptide transmitter
phenotypes. The goal of this research is to find the components in the gut
environment that are instructive to the neural crest cells which are the
precursors of enteric neurons. Previous work from Dr. Epstein's laboratory has
indicated that instruction is best observed in intact gut. Studies will be
carried out to describe systematically the formation of enteric ganglia and the
differentiation of enteric neurons in order to pinpoint conditions critical to
these processes. Immunostaining and radioautography will be used to characterize
the phenotypes and birthdates of cells in ganglia from intact gut. Studies will
also be carried out to determine the number, location, and phenotypes of the
descendants of single neural crest cells injected into pieces of isolated chick
gut grown on chorioallantoic membrane of chick hosts. These cells and their
descendants will be detected by either quail-specific antisera or by the
presence of a histochemical marker for beta-galactosidase. Quail cells will have
been previously transfected with a retro- virus carrying the beta-galactosidase
gene. The single cell experiments will indicate if patterns of expression can be
detected in cells placed in the intact gut environment. The knowledge obtained
will be useful in designing future experiments to elucidate the mechanisms which
regulate the phenotypic expression. Basic information about the development and
organization of the enteric neuronal circuitry will help in understanding the
reasons for defects in gut motility as manifested by conditions such as pseudo-
obstruction.
