It is planned to study high energy phenomena on the sun using microwave data
from the Owen's Valley Solar Array (OVRO). Improved imaging capability
approaching that of a subarrayed VLA, will also be available when the array is
expanded to 5 elements in the near future. The many frequencies observed at OVRO
also permit the use of frequency synthesis, a technique for utilizing the full
spatial information available in the data. Research will be focussed on mapping
and determination of brightness temperature spectra of solar flares, on
determination of the position and nature of millisecond bursts, on mapping of
active region brightness temperatures as a function of frequency, on VLA
observations, and on analysis of data already in hand. OVRO will be an active
and important participant in the Max'91 Program by operating during the current
solar maximum. Outside users will also be invited to make use of the facility
and the acquired data. ***
