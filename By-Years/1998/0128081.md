This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
new approach to economical, ultra high performance coating composites. This
approach is based on the use of alumoxane nanoparticles. These functional
inorganic-organic nanoparticles improve physical properties such as toughness,
impermeability, chemical resistance and flexibility. This novel approach to
production will demonstrate a highly cost effective manufacturing methodology
that can be easily carried out in the coating plant, wherein the nanoparticle
production becomes an integral part of the coating manufacturing process. The
project will seek an understanding of the mechanisms that influence the top down
fragmenting phenomenon. Nanoparticles, in slurry form, will be functionalized
and then incorporated into the high performance coating.

The commercial applications of this project will have a broad and significant
impact in the nation's 1.7 billion dollar industrial coatings market. This
market includes interior linings, chemical resistant coatings and rail car
linings.
