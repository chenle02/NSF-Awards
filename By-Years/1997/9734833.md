This award provides partial support for US participants to attend an
international workshop on nonlinear model predictive control to be held in
Ascona, Switzerland, June 3-5, 1998. The co-organizers are Zhi (Alex) Qiang
Zheng of the University of Massachusetts and Frank Allgower of the Swiss Federal
Institute of Technology. The purpose of the workshop is to gather researchers
from the US and Europe to assess and discuss current status and future research
directions in nonlinear model predictive control and to identify areas for
future international collaboration. Three areas will constitute the main topics
of the workshop: theory of estimation, stability and robustness; computation;
and applications in all areas including chemical and manufacturing processes.
