The Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics of the University of Stony
Brook will purchase a 56-node Intel Paragon parallel computer with 32 Mbyte
memory per node to support the following research: 1. Hyperbolic Waves and
Applications to Industrial Processes. 2. Bio-Mathematics and Statistics. 3.
Robotic Motion for Efficient Manufacturing. This equipment will also provide
advanced training to students learning efficient techniques for parallel
computing.
