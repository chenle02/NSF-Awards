This award is for travel funds to support technical coordination by various
collaborators with the Blue Waters project team and vendor technical
team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will make available on Blue Waters
computational tools and environments for social and biological research
involving interacting automata at nodes of very large social contact network or
interaction graphs. Such research includes the evaluation of mitigation
strategies for contagion on realistic national- and global-scale social contact
networks, worm propagation on the Internet, percolation processes, viral
marketing, database replication (in particular for sensor networks), and social
phenomenon such as the propagation of fads and norms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
results of research with the tools to be deployed may help provide better
understanding of how different strategies for dealing with emerging infectious
diseases can influence the course and impact of pandemics. The principal
investigators are new NSF investigators.&lt;br/&gt;
