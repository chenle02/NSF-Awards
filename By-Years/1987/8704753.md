Semiconductor heterojunctions and superlattices are critical material
structures for high performance electronic and opto- electronic devices. A broad
program at Princeton is currently underway studying the basic physics, material
growth processes, and device applications of these structures in three different
material classes -- (1) III-V crystalline semiconductors, (2) silicon-based
heterostructures, and (3) amorphous superlattices. For a complete research
program in any of these material systems, it is necessary to know the
composition of the grown films, the microstructure of the films and of the
devices fabricated in them, and the transport properties of carriers in these
films. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) will be added to the laboratory to
allow these meassurements. Energy dispersive x-ray analysis and beam induced
current analysis will be required. The SEM will be a great aid to the research
groups in all three of the above areas.
