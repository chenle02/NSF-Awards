Two workshops will be held for 20 faculty each in the areas of Ozone Depletion
and the Greenhouse Effect. The audiences will be 20 faculty from undergraduate
institutions and 20 from community colleges in the Philadelphia vicinity. These
current topics can be incorporated into curricula in several science
departments. The workshops will provide the participants with hands-on
experience with detection equipment used in the field. The participants will
also receive in-depth lectures on the science relevant to the two topics and
will discuss society's responses to these environmental challenges through
legislation and court decisions and the portrayal of these issues in the mass
media. One day follow-up workshops will be conducted for each of the two groups,
and evaluations will be done at each workshop.
