This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to make it much
easier to create unit-level regression tests for Java programs. Their benefits
are clear, but existing techniques for creating them are flawed because they are
difficult to apply to existing code, and tool support requires modification of
the target code. The innovation is to instrument a gold-standard version of the
module of interest so that when a client application executes, all events that
cross the boundary to the module are intercepted and logged to a file. Later,
after the unit has been modified or extended, and without any further need for
the client application, the events can be reconstructed and fed to the unit. The
results are checked for consistency with the log, and discrepancies flagged as
faults. This makes it much easier for a user to create a test suite for a
module. The approach is made feasible by using Aspect-Oriented Programming, and
object mocking. The research challenges are: how to devise techniques for
tolerating permitted changes in the target module, and how to reduce the chances
of a single failure triggering a profusion of cascading failures. The use of
advanced static analysis techniques, including dependence analysis, is the key
to solving these problems.

If successful, this system will help software development organizations reduce
the cost of development and maintenance of their software assets while at the
same time increasing its quality. It will help increase assurance of safety-
critical software, such as in medical equipment, or flight-control systems, thus
reducing the risk of damage to property and loss of life.
