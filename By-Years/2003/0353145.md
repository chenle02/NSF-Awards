The focus of this research is the development of asymmetric methods for
synthesis using boronic acid chemistry. Conversion of boronic esters to stable
alkyltrifluoroborates and then on to highly reactive alkyldihaloboranes will be
used for the asymmetric synthesis of secondary amines and development of new
carbon-carbon bond forming reactions. Catalysis involving an enantioenriched
boronic acid as the catalyst and a dialkyl bifluoroborate salt as a trap for the
reaction products will be explored. The ability to construct vicinal alkyl-
bearing stereocenters, unique amine-bearing stereocenters, and highly
functionalized four- and five-membered rings will be exploited in the total
synthesis of representative natural products.

With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is
supporting the research of Dr. Donald S. Matteson, of the Department of
Chemistry at Washington State University. Professor Matteson will focus his work
on developing asymmetric synthesis methodology using boronic ester chemistry.
The area of research is excellent for the training of graduate students and the
results of the research could have implications for the pharmaceutical and
agricultural industries.
