This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will fill a
critical need for accurate location and depth measurement of undersea fiberoptic
cables. This program will builds on prior expertise in ultra-sensitive magnetic
susceptibility detection in the human body. The susceptometry technique provides
the high signal-to-noise ratios, and then ability to suppress the background
response of bottom sediments, that are needed for accurate depth measurements.
At the same time, this program will require significant high-risk developments
to maximize the accuracy of depth determination, localize fiberoptic cables 2 m
or more below the sea floor, and adapt the measurement system to the deep ocean
environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program has strong support from industry
leaders. These experts emphasize that no existing cable location system provides
adequate depth information, and that accurate cable depths are crucial to avoid
damage that can cost millions of dollars per second. With more than 680,000
kilometers of fiberoptic cables in the ocean, and the cable inspection market
growing at an estimated 30% per year, this new fiberoptic locator system has
excellent commercial potential.
