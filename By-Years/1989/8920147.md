Kent State University, together with Case Western Reserve University and the
University of Akron, will establish a Science and Technology Research Center for
Advanced Liquid Crystalline Optical Materials under the leadership of J. William
Doane. The Center will provide a new comprehensive, vertically integrated
approach to research in liquid crystalline optical materials, beginning with
strong emphasis on synthesis, processing, and characterization, investigation of
physical properties, through construction of prototype devices using the unique
properties of these materials. The major goal of the research is to improve
understanding of these materials on both molecular and macroscopic levels to
allow prediction and optimization of their optical behavior. There are five
research areas including: ADVANCED MATERIALS FORMULATION AND SYNTHESIS (Novel
materials with designed specific optical performance, low molecular weight
liquid crystals, liquid crystal polymers, and polymer dispersions of liquid
crystals will be synthesized and studied) PHYSICAL PROPERTIES (Pure liquid
crystalline compounds mixed with other liquid crystals or polymers will be
investigated for unusual electro-optic and non-linear optical applications.)
INTERFACES AND FINITE SIZE EFFECTS (Effects on the behavior of liquid
crystalline materials will be investigated using scanning tunneling microscopy
and light scattering. Langmuir-Blodgett techniques will be used to form polar
ultra-thin films for non-linear optical and microelectronic applications.)
THEORY AND COMPUTATION (Prediction of elastic, optical, hydrodynamic, and phase
behavior of liquid crystals based on their molecular structure and composition
and boundary conditions.) ELECTRO-OPTICS AND NONLINEAR OPTICS (Prototypes of
optical devices such as spatial light modulators and switchable waveguides will
be developed.) A resource facility will be established to provide larger
quantities of advanced liquid crystalline materials, to characterize materials,
and to evaluate their performance for specific applications. The Center will
stimulate enhance activity in precollege education and in the development of
human resources.
