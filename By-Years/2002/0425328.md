In association with recent climatic warming in interior Alaska, water bodies in
some wetland regions are drying (for example, the Yukon Flats), while other
regions are becoming wetter (for example, the Tanana Flats). In a wetland
located near Fairbanks, three plots will be established: (1) a non-manipulated
control plot, (2) a plot that is ditched to lower the water table, and (3) a
plot to which water is added to raise the water table. In sub-plots of each
plot, insulation will be added during the winter to locally increase soil
temperature. The net fluxes of carbon dioxide and methane will be measured
regularly on these plots to quantify the dynamics and mechanisms responsible for
the responses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Global warming is affecting much of the
boreal forest region, a region which contains between ~30% of the world's soil
carbon, much of it stored in wetlands. The response of the two most important
greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide and methane, in boreal wetlands has the
potential to alter the warming effects of these gases on climate. This study
will improve the ability to quantify how responses of these gases may enhance or
mitigate the warming effects of these gases on
climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
