9628074 Kong Recent studies have indicated that large changes occur in strain
distribution or partitioning and strain accommodation during the evolution of a
collisional event. This project will attempt to model dynamic causes for major
spatial and temporal changes in strain distribution and initiation of major
intracontinental faults in Asia during Indo-Asian collision. In order to
evaluate the role of various input factors, the work will use a newly developed
finite element technique to simulate both the evolution of major fault systems
and related deformation within major continental blocks. Faults will be
sequentially introduced into the model according to their ages determined by
recent geochronologic studies. The resultant systematic restoration of both
distributed deformation and discrete fault movement will allow a rigorous
evaluation of dynamic causes for the changes in tectonic styles and strain
distribution in Asia during the Indo-Asian collision.
