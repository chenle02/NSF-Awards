Japan STA Program: Numerical Simulations of a DC Offset Free Magnetic Field
Detector This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Mark
Jeffery of Drexel University to conduct collaborative research with Dr. Eiichi
Goto for 24 months at the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research in Japan.
They will utilize Dr. Jeffery's numerical simulation of a new type of magnetic
field measurement device in order to demonstrate any flaws in the detector's
design. Present Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) technology
can accurately measure changes in magnetic fields, however, in many applications
the absolute magnitude of the magnetic field must also be measured. Dr. Goto has
patented a prototype magnetometer (IKA) which could measure the absolute
magnitude of magnetic fields. Before the IKA can be constructed, a detailed
numerical simulation of the device is needed to illustrate any problems
associated with parameters such as the nonlinear properties of the Josephson
junctions, temperature dependent quantum fluctuations, and noise due to
inductive coupling between components. Dr. Jeffery's experience in
superconducting network theory and numerical modeling will complement Dr. Goto's
expertise in superconducting device technology and will facilitate the design
and effective construction of the IKA magnetic field detection device.
