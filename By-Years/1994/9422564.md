9422564 Coppens This U.S.-Argentina Program award will fund a planning visit by
Dr. Philip Coppens, of the State University of New York at Buffalo, to go to
Argentina to visit and consult with Prof. Dr. Graciela Punte and her colleagues
at the Universidad Nacional de La Plata, active in the study of X- ray
diffraction, for the purpose of developing a collaborative research project in
charge density analysis of molecules and solids, and in the study of excited
state species by diffraction and spectroscopic techniques. ***
