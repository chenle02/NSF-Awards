ABSTRACT OPP-9614297 SERREZE, MARK UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO The research project
will examine the fluctuations in fresh water input into the Arctic by utilizing
output from historical weather prediction models in the Arctic as a means for
predicting climate variables in the region. The model output will be validated
using observed data. The resulting calibrated models of Arctic temperature and
precipitation, for example, will be used to examine the relationship between
climate variables and fresh water input, circulation fields, and sea ice extent.
The results of this project will provide a very important set of predicted
climate parameters for regions where observational data is scarce or absent.
Therefore the output of the derived data will serve as input for other models
that require closely-spaced observational data that is not available directly.
