This research project builds upon an Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL)
project (DRL#1114674) that investigated preschoolers' self-directed science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) related play experiences in
outdoor nature-based playscapes. An emerging trend, nature-based playscapes have
great potential for exposing young children to STEM-related phenomena, concepts,
and processes in a variety of early childhood education settings, including
daycare centers, pre-schools, playgrounds, and children's museums. In contrast
to traditional playgrounds, playscapes are designed to result in complex,
sensory-rich environments in which extensive access to natural materials and
resources inspires young children's investigative and exploratory behaviors.
This study explores the hypothesis that play in nature provides young children
(ages 3-5) with extensive contact with science content and that a play-based
curriculum could expand opportunities for STEM learning.

This Research-in-Service of Practice project will: 1) design, implement, and
evaluate four digital play-based professional development curriculum modules for
pre-school educators across multiple partner sites; 2) research the impact of
professional training on educators' facilitation of STEM content and activities;
3) examine the impacts of play-based facilitation on young children's
understanding of and engagement with STEM; and 4) evaluate the transferability
and sustainability of new playscape design principles at three partner sites.
This investigation will be led by researchers at the University of Cincinnati in
close collaboration with early childhood educators at the Arlitt Center,
Cincinnati Nature Center, and two local early childhood organizations that serve
children in Head Start programs. The study will use a mixed-methods approach.
Data sources include video observations, behavior mapping, teacher self-studies,
surveys, interviews, child assessments and children's photo documentation of
their experiences.

This research project is being funded by the AISL program, which seeks to
advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and
development of STEM learning in informal environments. Research that promotes
the understanding of how designed play-based natural environments and related
instructional approaches support the development of young children's engagement
with STEM could lead to new learning theory, pedagogical approaches, and inform
the design of effective informal learning experiences. Understanding the
affordances of particular components of playscapes with respect to young
children, as well as how pre-school educators could productively facilitate
young children's engagement with, and understanding of, STEM would be a
contribution to the informal STEM field.
