This instrumentation award is to purchase VLSI design and test equipment
dedicated to research in novel chip architectures for parallel processing and
graphics. The specific research projects for which the equipment will be used
include the development of high level specification, synthesis, and testing
tools; the development of a graphics chip for 3D volume visualization; and the
development of custom VLSI chips for memory buses in a heterogeneous parallel
computing environment. The development of custom VLSI chips is increasingly
dependent on access to computer software that aids the designer of the chip. In
particular, testing tools are critical so as to allow the testing of chips
before they are sold or installed in devices. This award will allow the pruchase
of a high speed tester that will experimentally validate such testing tools. The
chips to be tested incude a three dimensional graphics custom chip consisting of
256 separate "voxel" processors and a very high speed memory bus chip to be used
in the construction of a high speed distributed network of computers.
