To provide the general public with an understanding of the basic principles
that underlie the transmission, storage, and retrieval of information, the Fleet
Center proposes to build SIGNALS, a 4,500 square foot exhibition. SIGNALS will
be divided into three sections, of approximately 15 interactive exhibits each,
which explore the physical principles of wave motion, the properties of
electromagnetic pulses useful for communications, and the signal processing that
enables us to handle information. An Advisory Committee comprised of highly
qualified individuals at the leading edge of their fields will support
development of SIGNALS; a very experienced team of exhibit developers will
fabricate the exhibition. SIGNALS will become a permanent exhibition in an
expanded Fleet Center, where it is expected to attract 1 million visitors a
year, including at least 100,000 K-12 students. Since the lack of technological
understanding is a national problem, we propose to build a 3,000 square foot
traveling version of SIGNALS, contingent upon an NSF review of the completed
permanent exhibition. The total cost for both exhibitions is $1,983,480. We are
requesting $985,900 from NSF: $692,800 for the permanent exhibition and $293,100
for the traveling exhibition. The project will begin in June, 1992, and be
completed by June, 1996.
