9619644 Kachanov Materials may contain defects that are a mixture of diverse
shapes, such as pores and microcracks. The microfracturing patterns of the
material are strongly affected by these shape factors. A study of the
interpretation of data obtained for materials with such defects is being
conducted. the prediction of effective moduli and wavespeeds from information of
damage is done. The microfracturing patterns in damaged materials as functions
of shapes and relative sizes of damage elements are being addressed. Also, the
identification of signatures of the fluid presence in pores of various shapes is
being conducted. Application areas include, powder metallurgy and hot
processing, geophysics and rock mechanics, behavior of porous materials, etc.
