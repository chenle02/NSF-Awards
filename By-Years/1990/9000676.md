This award supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site
proposal to provide research experiences for selected undergraduates in marine
sciences, with special emphasis on nutrient flux/mass energy transformations,
crustacean larval biology and hydrocarbon contamination in the marine
environment, to acquaint them with the excitement and opportunities of academic
research and to encourage them to pursue graduates studies and a career of
research.
