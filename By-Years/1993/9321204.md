9321204 Clark This award supports a study of Paleozoic conodonts from cores
collected on the Northwind Ridge in the Arctic Ocean. The conodonts include both
Permian and either Ordovician or Silurian forms and were derived from submarine
weathering of Paleozoic rocks underlying Northwind Ridge. Study of these
conodonts is expected to lead to fingerprinting of the Paleozoic stratigraphic
units. This information will provide constraints for the original location of
the crustal block represented by the Northwind Ridge and this, in turn, will
help to constrain models of the tectonic evolution of the Amerasian Basin
portion of the Arctic Ocean basin. ***
