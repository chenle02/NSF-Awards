This project supports the travel of 20 graduate students from U.S. institutions
to the ACM SIGCOMM 2015 Conference that will be held Aug. 17-21, 2015, in
London, United Kingdom. ACM SIGCOMM is the flagship annual conference of the
Special Interest Group on Data Communications (SIGCOMM), a special interest
group of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). This project project
integrates research and education of students through exposure to a premier
technical meeting in computer networks and communications. Students will have
the opportunity to observe high-quality presentations and interact with senior
researchers in the field both in the main conference and the associated
workshops. The PIs especially encourage women and other minorities to
participate. SIGCOMM is the flagship international conference for computer
networking research, and presents a unique opportunity for students to expand
their breadth of ideas, research skills, and technical
perspectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide each student with a
travel award of $1,250 or the actual documented amount of expenses, whichever
amounts to less. The availability of the travel awards will be well publicized
throughout the U.S. research community. The project has established processes
for selecting the awardees that are well described and that are appropriate for
such a student travel grant.
