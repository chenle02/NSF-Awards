This research project is directed towards the development of an important new
criterion for establishing the machinability of a work material as well as to
provide an important new method of predicting the shear angle for a given set of
cutting conditions. This investigation involves tests on a wide range of
materials and conditions and includes a simple noncutting test that gives the
rate of increase of shear stress with shear strain for large strains. The
results will be used to better understand the relation between workpiece
chemistry and structure and the slope of the shear stress-shear strain curve for
large strains. The results will also be used to verify a new shear angle
criterion. An important secondary objective of this work is to provide a better
understanding of basic mechanisms involved in large strain deformation.
