Investigations in three general areas in which scanning probe microscopy is
employed for materials research: (i) fundamental studies of probe-surface
interactions to enhance understanding of contrast mechanisms in imaging, (ii)
trial applications in materials research, with special emphasis on imaging
current transport paths, and (iii) development of gentler atomic force
microscopes for soft materials, development of liquid nitrogen temperature
microscopes, and development of atomic force microscopes with conducting tips
for simultaneous imaging of surface topography and surface conductivity.
