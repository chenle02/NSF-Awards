Phylogenetic relationships among higher taxa of plants (subclasses, orders,
families) often are widely disputed, particularly within a number of troublesome
tropical-temperate sister-family pairs. A classic example of the tropical-
temperate sister-family problem is exemplified by two families usually placed
within Apiales: the tropical, woody Araliaceae and the temperate, herbaceous
Apiaceae. Further disputed is the relationship of Apiales to other order
(Cornales, Pittosporales, Asterales), as well as the relationships within each
family, especially Apiaceae, in which there are three subfamilies (Apioideae,
Saniculoideae, and Hydrocotyloideae). Phylogenetic relationships at the ordinal
and interfamilial levels will be examined using comparative gene sequencing of
the chloroplast gene rbcL. Comparative sequencing of the much more rapidly-
changing ORFK will be used to elucidate infrafamilial relationships. Preliminary
studies to date indicate that a contracted Inverted Repeat characterizes some,
but not all, species of Apioideae. The taxonomic distribution of this
chloroplast genome rearrangement will therefore be examined in detail to help
resolve relationships in Apiaceae. The character state changes of certain
morphological traits will also be examined in light of the molecular phylogeny.
Preliminary data indicate that many of the traditional concepts of relationships
in Apiales are inaccurate and that further sampling of representative taxa will
greatly increase our understanding of this order. This study will, therefore,
provide an important model for the examination of other tropical-temperate
sister families.
