This is a SGER project to collect and to study the perishable earthquake and
structural response/damage data due to the October 17, 1989 Loma Prieta
earthquake. This project provides travel support for field investigation to
collect perishable data for shear wall buildings. The data collection is focused
on both damaged and undamaged buildings. The general and performance data
collected will be made available to the general research community as a valuable
information source for their future research.
