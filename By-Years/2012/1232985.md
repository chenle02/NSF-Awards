This proposal seeks to measure noble gases in odp drill core gabbros, diorites
and diabases from holes 735B and 1256D. The gases will be extracted by in vacuo
and heating methods. He, Ne, and Ar will be measured and ratios used to separate
atmospheric, radiogenic and non-radiogenic components of the gas. 3He, in
particular, is of interest because the only possible source for this isotope is
the Earth's mantle. Preliminary measurements reveal that He is surprisingly high
in oceanic intrusive rocks, especially deformed rocks. The hypothesis that
deformation adds noble gas to the crust will be tested by a depth study of
granoblastic dikes from hole1256D. Preliminary results also reveal surprising
small scale variability in noble gas concentration within samples, possibly
related to amphibole concentration and hydrous melting. This hypothesis will be
tested by a detailed transect in an amphibole diorite with special attention
paid to mineralogy and fluid inclusions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This will be the
first comprehensive study of noble gas concentration in oceanic gabbroic rocks
and the first ever in amphibole. The results will be of interest to a broad
range of earth scientists. The work will have implications for the origins and
abundance of volatiles in ocean crust and, ultimately, subduction-related
volcanos. The project has an international component, will provide funds for a
Ph.D. student and will involve undergraduates through WHOI fellowships and
collaboration with a local state college.
