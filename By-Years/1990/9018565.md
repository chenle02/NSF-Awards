A newly developed atomic absorption instrument dramatically improves the
technical capabilities of Zeeman graphite furnace atomic absorption. A DC
permanent magnet system and other improvements in optics and electronics leads
to a 5-10 fold improvement in detection limits for certain key elements. This
improvement will enable the analysis of samples which were previously too small
and also will allow for more efficient laboratory operation. For example, Cd/Ca
analysis in foraminifera requires several hours of microscopic examination and
separation before sufficient specimens are found, and in some important samples,
there are insufficient individuals for analysis in the largest available sample.
The instrument has the capability to do both flame and graphite furnace work,
and so also will address a looming problem concerning the repairability of our
19-year old flame atomic absorption instrument.
