This project concerns research in number theory and geometry. These areas of
mathematics have applications to computer science and to cyber security, which
are areas of emphasis in the project. In addition to the research the PI will
continue to - work with undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral
researchers, to introduce them to ideas and methods of use in their own
research; - write expository articles and notes for journals and for online
mathematical sites; - maintain and develop web pages that feature interaction
between sophisticated research mathematics and elementary topics and puzzles; -
present expository mathematical lectures, some aimed at high school students or
non-math majors in college, often featuring mathematical aspects of music or
chess.

This research project addresses fundamental theoretical and computational
questions in arithmetic geometry: the behavior of elliptic curves and higher
varieties (especially K3 surfaces, Calabi-Yau threefolds, and their moduli
varieties) over finite fields, function fields, and number fields. It also
explores the construction and application of generalized weight enumerators of
error-correcting codes and related problems on spherical codes and analogous
combinatorial structures. Better understanding of spherical and error-correcting
codes may increase the efficiency of analog and digital communication that
relies on such structures.
