HRD-9628526 Cal State LA University Auxiliary "Theoretical Studies of Nanowires
Inside Carbon Nanotubes" We propose to carry out a research program to
investigate the stability conditions of chains of different materials inside
carbon nanotubes, of various chiralities and diameters, by employing first-
principles, total-energy calculations within the local density functional
approach. Chains of different types of materials will be considered, namely,
transition metals, Sulfur, Selenium, and Tellurium, and lastly, polysulfur
nitride. Some transition metals were shown experimentally to form continuous
nanowires inside carbon nanotubes. S, Se, and Te have a propensity to form
semiconducting chains, and the polymer (SN)x is known to be a superconductor
below 0.3 K. The electronic energy bands of these composite systems, and the
amount of charge transfer between the chains and carbon atoms, will be
calculated. The resultant shifts in the vibrational mode frequencies of the
carbon nanotubes will be estimated. Four students from minority groups
underrepresented in Physics, specifically, African-American, Hispanics, and
women, will be involved in this project. This will be greatly beneficial to
their future education and career. ***
