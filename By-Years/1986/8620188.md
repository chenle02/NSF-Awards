Abstract Narrative The investigators will document trends in the geographical
incidence of poverty among females at three scales: the 50 states in the United
States, all Standard Metropolitan Areas, and in a sample of nonmetropolitan
counties. They will then conduct an analysis of the relative importance of the
several mechanisms suggested in existing literature on poverty feminization, to
illustrate how determinants vary between rural and urban areas and at different
scales. The goal of the research is to clarify how conditions responsible for
poverty feminization vary throughout the country, and thereby help explain the
substantial increase in female-headed families that occurred between 1970 and
1980. The geographic dimensions of poverty are important theoretical and policy
concerns. The investigators are capable young scholars whose work on the topic
will help fill a serious gap in the literature in social geography and will also
provide valuable results for policy and program formulation.
