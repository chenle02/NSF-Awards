The objective of this award is to organize the annual Principal Investigators
(PI) meeting for the National Robotics Initiative (NRI), which was launched in
2011. The PI meeting brings together the community of researchers, companies,
and program officers who are actively engaged in the NRI to provide cross-
project coordination in terms of common intellectual challenges, methods for
education and training, best practices in terms of transition of results, and a
centralized and lasting repository illustrating the research ideas explored and
milestones achieved by the NRI projects. The meeting will be two days during
late fall 2016 in the vicinity of Washington DC. The format will include short
presentations by all the attending PIs, a poster session, keynote speeches, and
panel discussions. Invitations to the meeting will include all PIs with active
NRI grants, program managers with robotics-related programs, and members of the
press.
