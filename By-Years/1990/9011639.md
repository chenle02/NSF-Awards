For environmentalists and industrialists alike, technological innovation is
emerging as the principal means by which we achieve environmentally sustainable
economic growth. To this end, new approaches are needed to routinely integrate
environmental factors into the engineering of transportation and energy systems,
manufacturing processes, and industrial products. This grant supports the
organization of symposium, "Toward 2000: Environment, Technology and the New
Century," to conceptualize and define issues and modernization. Undertaken in
collaboration with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD), in the context of OECD's Society, Technology and Economy Program (TEP),
the symposium will bring together about 50 experts in science, technology,
industry, finance and government, and will include international representation.
