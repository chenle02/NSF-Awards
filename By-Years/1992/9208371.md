This project will investigate the algorithmic aspects of matrix scaling
problems. These problems call for pre and post multiplication of a given matrix
by two diagonal matrices so that the resulting scaled matrix satisfies
prescribed conditions. A wide variety of practical and theoretical problems fall
within the general framework of matrix scaling problems. These include: (i)
scaling of nonnegative matrices to prescribed row-column sums, (ii) similarity
scaling, balancing, and matrix preconditioning, (iii) scaling of nonnegative
matrices to prescribed row-column maxima-minima, (iv) scaling of positive
semidefinite matrices, and some others. Cases (i) and (ii) of the scaling
problem and their applications have been studied for a long time, case (iii) of
the problem includes the problem of determining the ergodic values of matrix
games, and case (iv) turn out to be a natrual generalization of linear
programming. The emphasis of this research is the study of the computational
complexity of various types of scaling problems, as well as the development of
effective algorithms and approximation schemes, and to test the algorithms
computationally.
