This project utilizes the integral equation method to formulate and solve
several types of multi-domain and thin-body problems in acoustics. For the
multi-domain problem, the acoustic domain of interest is interior to a closed
surface of arbitrary shape, exterior to a closed body, or coupled to another
domain. For the thin body problem, the acoustic domain is exterior to a body
whose smallest dimension is of the same order or less than some numerical
parameter such as element length. By using integral equation methods, all
numerical approximations are confined to the boundaries of the domains. There is
no need to discretize the interior of the domain, and therefore a reduction in
the computational dimension of the problem by one (three dimensional problems
are solved on the two dimensional boundary of the domain), and there is none of
the difficulty associated with finite element methods, for example, of deciding
where in the acoustic medium to stop the elements. It is thereby potentially
simpler and more accurate to solve multi-domain problems using integral
equations than alternative techniques requiring solution throughout the domains.
The development of methods for the solution of multi-domain and thin-body
acoustic problems will be beneficial to a wide range of specific engineering
problems. These include the prediction of sound pressure and power radiated by
industrial products such as engines, pumps and compressors when partially
shrouded by an enclosure for noise control; design of quiet interiors of
vehicles and aircraft; understanding how multiple sources may be used in active
vibration/active noise control; and the design and optimization of complex
networks of acoustic passageways such as those that occur in the interior of
mufflers, induction systems of engines and silencers for fans.
