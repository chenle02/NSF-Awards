A group of about 20 synthetic organic and natural products chemists will be
selected to receive travel assistance to attend the 16th International Symposium
on the Chemistry of Natural Products, which will be held in Kyoto, Japan, May
29-June 3, 1988. A strong presence at this meeting is extremely important in
view of the ever-increasing strength of the Japanese chemical community.
Increased visibility of U.S. chemists will be beneficial to fruitful
interactions between the two scientific communities. The possibility of travel
support through this grant will be advertised and the applications will be
reviewed by a panel of senior scientists. Professional, ethnic, and geographic
considerations will be considered in the final selection of grantees. This
travel grant is being funded by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
Program.
