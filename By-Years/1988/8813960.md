This proposal is a request to purchase a 20 Watt copper vapor laser. Such a
laser could be used in several different ways in research into nonlinear optics.
Copper vapor lasers are an alternative to argon ion lasers for pumping other
lasers, such as dye and solid state lasers. Copper vapor lasers have such high
gain that they will lase without any end mirrors whatsoever by amplified
spontaneous emission. This makes them ideal as gain media for studies of
nonlinear optical oscillators such as phase conjugate resonators. They have
strong laser emission in the yellow at 578nm. This makes them good laser sources
for writing high diffraction efficiency real time holograms in bismuth silicon
oxide. Previously, this has been done using the 568nm yellow line of the
comparatively expensive and low powered Krypton laser.
