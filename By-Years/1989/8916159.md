This research deals with an interesting tectonic problem, the rapid on-going
orogenic process in Taiwan. Several recent developments there have produced
valuable data sets needed to carry out this proposed work: 3-D velocity data
from travel-time inversion, Bouguer gravity data of Taiwan, C14 dating of marine
terraces, paleomagnetic findings, and geodetic surveys. This research involves
synthesizing these data sets by further complementing them with earthquake
moment tensor solutions and spatial distribution of seismic events. The results
will be applied to the improvement/modification of current orogenic models of
the mountain-building process of Taiwan. Because this work deals directly with
the processes of mountain-building and seismic activity, it has direct
application to the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
