The grant application proposes a conference to be held at the University of
Pittsburgh, in association with the Journal of Economic Education. The
conference aims to advance the integration of new instructional technologies
into the teaching of economics at the undergraduate level which, for reasons
outlined in the project narrative, has been slow to take advantage of new and
innovative teaching methods. The proposed conference will review recent
applications of new technologies and ways of overcoming institutional and other
obstacles that have slowed the pace of innovation. Presenters will be carefully
screened to assure that the teaching methods discussed have either demonstrated
effectiveness or built-in capabilities for monitoring contributions to student
learning. The conference proceedings will be disseminated in a topical issue of
the Journal of Economic Education and abstracts of the papers will be available
at the JEE's web site. The organizers propose to follow-up the conference by
working with participants to apply and evaluate the teaching methods featured in
the program.
