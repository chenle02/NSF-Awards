IBN 9728453 LLOYD The long range goal of this research is to gain insight into
mechanisms underlying the modulation of synaptic transmission, that is
modifications in the way one nerve cell (neuron) in the nervous system
communicates with another, through release of chemical signaling molecules. It
is now clear that many neurons contain more than one transmitter and it is
important to determine how multiple transmitters released from the terminals
(endings) of single neurons interact on presynaptic and postsynaptic targets.
Specifically, neuropeptide transmitters (polypeptides serving as transmitters)
appear to commonly coexist along with conventional transmitters (such as acetyl
choline). The relatively simple nervous system of Aplysia (the "sea hare," a
marine mollusc) has a number of advantages that make it particularly useful as a
model system for these studies. One goal of this grant is to explore the manner
in which neuropeptides that are released from motor neurons (neurons innervating
muscle) interact to modulate the effectiveness of other transmitters released
from the same neuron. A second goal is to investigate the effects of a "biogenic
amine", serotonin, released from purely modulatory neurons which have
neuromuscular terminals. The neuropeptides and serotonin have been shown to be
potent modulators of neuromuscular transmission. These studies have implications
for vertebrate skeletal neuromuscular junctions where peptide cotransmitters
have also been found. Understanding fundamental neural processes such as the
modulation of synaptic transmission at these neuromuscular synapses could
provide a more general understanding of synapses which release multiple
transmitters as well as have relevance to disorders of movement.
