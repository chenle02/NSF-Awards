Randomized experiments (sometimes called "A/B tests") play increasingly
fundamental roles in the design and refinement of modern online systems that
drive the internet economy. Common design decisions include: What headline
should be used with a news article; What prices should an item be offered at; or
How should search results be ranked? However, modern web platforms exist atop
strong networks of information flow and social interactions that mar the
statistical validity of traditional experimental designs and analyses. This
project aims to design graph clustering algorithms that can be used to
administer experimental treatments in network-aware randomization designs and
yield practically useful results. The project will train new graduate and
undergraduate students in cutting-edge data science as they develop and deploy
new research algorithms and software for causal inference at the intersection of
modern computational and statistical research. The project will ultimately
deliver new technical tools that increase the certainty of experiments that
feature network interference, helping designers of online systems, both in
industry and in government, make better decisions and craft better policies for
an increasingly networked world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to
develop algorithmic tools for causal inference under network interference that
go beyond mere proof-of-concepts, placing a specific focus on developments that
will make network experimentation tools practical and provide significant and
relevant results. The project will develop tools that harness graph metadata for
variance reduction, and also develop techniques for running experiments in
marketplaces, bipartite graphs rife with interference. In considering graph
metadata, the goal is to develop stratified graph sampling methods that balance
graph structure directly against latent traits. The deliverable assets of this
project, which include algorithmic research as well as software for designing
experiments, are intended to benefit computer scientists and statisticians, as
well the broader community of researchers in the social and economic sciences
that study networks. Research result, including software will be accessible via
the project web site (http://stanford.edu/~jugander/crii/).
