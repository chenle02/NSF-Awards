Higson will continue his study of several problems related to Baum-Connes
conjecture which asserts that for a locally compact group G, the K-theory of the
reduced C*-algebra of G is equivariant to the K-theory of its universal proper
G-space. This investigation will involve the use of an index theorem for proper
actions, elliptic operators on buildings, and equivariant E-theory. This is part
of the more general K-theory for operator algebras. The general area of
mathematics of this project has its basis in the theory of algebras of Hilbert
space operators. Operators can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of
complex numbers. Special types of operators are often put together in an
algebra, naturally called an operator algebra. These seemingly abstract objects
have a surprising variety of applications. For example, they play a key role in
knot theory, which in turn is currently being used to study the structure of
DNA. **//
