The field of evaluation has expanded quite rapidly over the past twenty five
years so that evaluation of programs is standard practice in large
organizations. Relatively recently, school districts, state and federal
agencies, and large organizations have established internal evaluation staffs,
procedures, and policies. These offices of evaluation are being created in faith
that they will serve a useful function in improving science and mathematics
education. In their infancy, agencies tend to aggressively pursue their mission.
Later they become facilitators between the larger organization and the
constituency regulated or observed. Finally, they become an arm of their
constituency. If this is the normal development path, the evaluation agencies
may not, in the long term, continue to pursue their mission effectively. No one
knows, except through anecdote, what issues and policies arise, how they are
disposed of, and how internal evaluation functions. This study proposes to
examine the development of mathematics and science education evaluation issues,
policies, and processes as they develop over a five year period within the
Directorate of Education and Human Resources (EHR), of the National Science
Foundation. By combining the results with evaluation theory, more general
perspectives on the development of evaluation within large organizations should
lead to deeper theory and understanding so that evaluation can serve the
anticipated role in large organizations. The quality of evaluations in EHR may
be facilitated by providing feedback from the study to people in EHR annually.
