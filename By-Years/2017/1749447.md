Mathematics can be used to understand a vast range of different things. The
research in this project is motivated by the study of shapes, in particular one
can ask the question: what does it mean for an object to have a "best shape"?
Surprisingly it turns out that aspects of this question are related to a
seemingly unrelated piece of fluid mechanics called the Hele-Shaw flow. The
project aims at building, extending and exploiting this deep connection with the
expectation of revealing new insights into both shape and fluid flows, which is
likely to have impact in both pure and applied mathematics. The project includes
an educational program that provides specialized training in this area aimed at
the next generation of research mathematicians, and a component that explores
how undergraduate-level mathematics can be communicated though the medium of
sequential art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research project combines algebraic
geometry, complex geometry and free boundary problems using algebraic, analytic
and computational techniques. First, the investigator studies a new notion of
K-stable map which extends and clarifies the Yau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture
connecting algebraic stability with canonical Kahler metrics. Second, the
investigator builds on and extend the his previous success in studying problems
in complex geometry through the Hele-Shaw flow, giving new insight into what
kinds of behavior solutions to such equations can display. The educational
activities aimed at training early-career mathematicians include a combined two-
week graduate-school and research workshop, and activities aimed at
undergraduates include an annual undergraduate research symposium, and summer
research opportunities related to this research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
