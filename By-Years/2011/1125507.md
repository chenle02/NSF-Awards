This project will study shape variation in the upper ankle bones of primates of
modern aspects (Euprimates) and their closest relatives. Ankle bones are
commonly well-preserved in the fossil record, and their shape variation is
thought to reflect the way the hind limbs are used in locomotion. The major
questions being addressed in this research relate to reconstructing the sequence
of changes in locomotion that occurred in the evolutionary origin and subsequent
radiation of Euprimates, which will help identify patterns of ancestry through
time. The project is novel in utilizing digital imagery, experimental methods,
and inclusion of a comprehensive sample of extant and extinct primates. The
broader impacts include support of a young investigator, training of graduate
and undergraduates of typically under-represented minorities in science. The
data will be made available in an online digital
library.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will focus on generating digital
models of primate astragali and calcanei using microCT and laser scanning, and
optical topography. Travel is planned to visit museums where obscure and
important specimens reside in order to image those specimens. Digital data will
be quantified using precise linear measurements, geometric morphometrics, and
new automated methods being developed by the PI and collaborators. The data will
be analyzed using traditional statistical techniques as well as using new
methods that take into account potential non-independence of biological data due
to differential phylogenetic relatedness. With this project the PIs will
evaluate several types of hypotheses: those concerning the 1) correlation
between ankle shape and different modes of locomotion, 2) presence (and
significance) of similiarities among certain fossil euprimates (i.e., Adapidae,
Omomyidae, Eosimiidae, and definitive stem-Anthropoidea) and the rest of the
euprimate radiation, and 3) evolutionary pattern and adaptive significance of
shape variation in the primate astragalus and calcaneus.
