This research is the analysis of hybrid random-access systems which use a
combination of multi-user coding and collision resolution algorithms to
accommodate the bursty transmissions of many independent users on a single
communications channel. The main idea is to avoid collisions among T or less
simultaneous users by the use of multi-user codes and to resolve occasional
collisions among more than T users by the use of a collision resolution
algorithm. A gain in throughput and delay performance can thus be expected if
close to T users transmit at the same time, but a penalty must be paid if only
one user transmits because the symmetric code rate of almost all multi-user
codes must be less than one for each individual user. One of the major goals of
this research is to determine the properties which a multi-user code must
possess such that the use of a hybrid random access system yields better overall
performance than an uncoded random access system.
