The requirements for motion control and for high efficiency drives have
increased dramatically in industrial applications such as automated
manufacturing and robotics. The recent advances in power electronic devices,
magnetic materials in electric motors, and in control systems theory as
implemented with the use of microprocessors and VLSI circuits, have allowed the
development of such drives. An improvement plan for the recently established
laboratory in electrical machines and drives will shift the emphasis from the
characteristics of isolated electrical machines to the concept of a drive
consisting of a collection of hardware and software. The new equipment required
for this project includes new types of electrical machines, modern power
electronic drives (rectifiers and inverters), accurate sensors for measurement
and control, and computers to control the experiments and collect and analyze
data. With this equipment, the experiments in the laboratory will allow the
student to study the drive characteristics and use knowledge from such diverse
areas as energy conversion, digital systems, or control theory to analyze and
design a motion control system. These equipment will be also used for the
laboratory section of the power electronics course.
