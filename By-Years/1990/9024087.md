A robotic control system for automated container ship loading will be developed
and tested in a computer simulation of the container loading process. The key
innovation is the combination of efficient feedforward control laws with a
linear feedback based on both container and ship states. The sensor system is an
extension of the ship-tracking sensor suite developed in Phase I. As
demonstrated in Phase I, the technical problems associated with automation are
(1) determining the precise position of the ship at the time of loading, (2)
damping the pendulum motion of the suspended container, and (3) compensating for
the flexibility of the crane and cables. The Phase II research will develop a
ship/container sensor system, derive mathematical models of system components,
develop a control law, build and validate a computer model, and use it to verify
the control system performance. The system can be retrofitted to existing cranes
with suitable crane controls and mechanical sway damping, providing tremendous
improvement and savings at a relatively small cost. In Phase III a prototype
working system on a ship load crane will be built, in cooperation with a
consortium of major U.S. shipping lines and port authorities.
