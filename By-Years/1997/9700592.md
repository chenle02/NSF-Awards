This research project, which is supported in the Analytical and Surface
Chemistry Program, addresses the detailed mechanisms of metal thin film growth.
Professors Evans and Thiel at Iowa State University will combine experimental
studies of growth mechanism and morphology, using scanning probe microscopy and
high resolution low energy electron diffraction measurements, with theoretical
modelling of these processes. The theoretical approaches are based on atomistic
lattice-gas models, and incorporate Monte Carlo molecular dynamics methods. The
interaction between theory and experiment helps to define the complex model
systems under study, which include both homoepitaxial and heteroepitaxial
growth. Emphasis in this work is on uncovering the detailed atomic level
mechanisms of the growth of metal thin films. These metal thin films are
technologically important in the manufacture of electronic devices, in the
packaging and coatings industry, and in optical material synthesis. A detailed
understanding of the growth process is developed by a combination of
experimental and theoretical approaches, including scanning probe microscopy,
electron diffraction, and molecular dynamics modelling.
