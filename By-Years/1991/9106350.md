This proposal addresses the interactions between nuclearly and mitochondrially
encoded proteins by study of the function of a novel protein--localized in yeast
mitochrondria--that is essential for complex III of the electron transport
chain. This nuclearly encoded protein (CBP4) is not a component of the
respiratory chain but is essential for an active enzyme complex in vivo. The
effects of this protein on the import into the mitochrondrion of complex III
subunits, more rapid turnover of the subunits, subunit-binding to CBP4, and the
relative kinetics of CBP4 and complex III subunit syntheses during de novo
protein synthesis will be among the foci of the research. Use of a suppressor
mutant strain should aid the analyses of the functional role of CBP4 and/or
other proteins that may be shown to have a role in regulation of respiratory
function.
