This action is to complete the data processing and all pertinent data file
information. It involves the preparation of a list of all relevant parameters
describing all digitized accelerograms, including the coordinates, time, depth,
magnitude, and maximum intensity of all earthquakes; coordinates of the
recording stations; and all relevant properties of the recording instruments
such as orientation, and the soil and geological characteristics of the site.
