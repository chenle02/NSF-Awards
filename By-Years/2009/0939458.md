CBET-0939458 &lt;br/&gt;Plesniak &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will
facilitate participant travel to the American Physical Society, Division of
Fluid Dynamics, 62nd Annual DFD Meeting 2009 in Minneapolis, MN, November 22-24,
2009. This is the largest international annual meeting of fluid dynamicists in
the world, with 1800 anticipated attendees. The meeting has been successfully
run for over sixty years. The intellectual merit of this conference lies in the
exchange of scientific ideas, presentations of cutting edge research and
exposure to a richly diverse array of topics in virtually every sub-discipline
of fluid dynamics. The broader impact will be to increase participation of
students and young scientists who would not otherwise be able to afford to
travel to the meeting and pay associated costs. Since the awards are meant to
supplement participant travel funds, not to cover these entirely, the committee
takes into account the travel budget entered on the application. Special effort
is made to achieve diverse participation from underrepresented groups in
engineering, including women and members of minority groups. The application and
selection process is under the auspices of the DFD External Affairs Committee,
Prof. Michael Plesniak, Chair (The George Washington University). Typical awards
will be $500-$1000. NSF support will fund students from the U.S.
