The blood brain barrier is an absolutely vital intercellular defense mechanism
in vertebrates and invertebrates. This system restricts the nervous system from
contact with toxins, water soluble compounds and ionic imbalances present in the
blood. Nerves in particular must be bathed in fluid of special ion
concentrations and thus cannot have direct access to blood (which has a
different constitution). The blood brain barrier is not always a blessing to
life, as many drugs cannot cross this barrier to cure or relieve neurological
diseases and syndromes. (This is especially true for AIDS). Insects too have a
blood-brain barrier. Nevertheless, very little else is known about this system
relative to the growing and metamorphosing insect larva. In many insect species,
the larval stage is the longest life stage, and the one in which most economic
damage is wrought. Once the dynamics of this barrier are understood in insects
and its genesis, placement and extent, compromising the barrier may be possible.
Insects without this barrier would die quickly of natural causes. It is likely
there may be physical means and/or environmentally safe compounds that would
transiently impair the barrier system in insects and so assist in population
suppression. This latter goal would only be possible after a thorough structural
and functional study has been made of the larval insect blood brain barrier as
set forth in the studies.
