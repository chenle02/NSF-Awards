This project will analyze planktic foraminiferal assemblage and stable isotopes
over the last full glacial/interglacial cycle in ODP site 1002 from the Cariaco
Basin. Time slices will be sampled at 100-year intervals to provide records of
century to millenial variability during glacial maxima (Stages 2 and 4) and the
last interglacial maximum (Stage 5e). Results will address millenial variation
in the tropics under extreme climate states, and can be directly compared to
high-latitude records from Greenland ice cores to assess large-scale linkages.
