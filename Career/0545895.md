The multiparticle Schrodinger equation is the basic governing equation in
quantum mechanics, and thus the foundation for much of chemistry and physics. A
tremendous amount of effort, over several decades, has gone into approximating
its solutions, but high-quality numerical solutions have proved elusive.
Recently-developed mathematical tools for computing in high dimensions have
revealed a new path toward such solutions, which this project will explore. Such
solutions will enable accurate computation of chemical and physical properties
of molecules and materials, and thus have an impact on many problems in
chemistry, physics, biology, and materials science.

This research will occur in the Department of Mathematics at Ohio University, a
state university located in the Appalachian region of southeastern Ohio, with a
renewed commitment to strengthening its research at all levels. The research
group will include both undergraduate and graduate students, who will contribute
to this project and develop valuable skills in computational mathematics. The
students will also learn about the research process and develop their skills at
communicating mathematics.
