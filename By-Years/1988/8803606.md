This project analyzes the economic cost of building owner responses to both
physical damage from the October 1, 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake and
regulatory change. The goal is to advance knowledge on the institutional
response to earthquakes and the economic costs of that response. The work is
conceived to be of value to local government officials and planners charged with
planning for earthquake safety.
