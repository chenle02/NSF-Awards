1140065&lt;br/&gt;Dzenis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current methods of oil capture
from water have proven inadequate in the Gulf of Mexico spill cleanup. There is
a pressing need for the development of novel efficient materials and methods for
capturing crude oil from water surface. An ideal material would be
simultaneously hydrophobic and oleophilic, environmentally friendly, have high
oil absorption capacity, and be easily deployable and collectable from water
surface. No current absorbent satisfies all these requirements. It is proposed
here to explore the feasibility of oil absorbing materials based on continuous
nanofiber technology. Continuous nanofibers may have critical advantages to
conventional absorbents and discontinuous nanomaterials in terms of efficiency,
cost, and environmental and health concerns. The goal of this project is a
proof-of-concept demonstration of the efficient oil collection using these
materials. Several candidate materials will be screened and feasibility of
nanomanufacturing of quantities of selected nanofibers will be explored and
demonstrated. Their oil absorption performance will be verified and quantified.
Finally, application and collection of the nanofibers from the water surface
will be studied and demonstrated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project builds on
the recently funded MRI RAPID instrumentation project. The results will provide
the necessary proof-of-concept for the future in-depth studies that can lead to
novel superoleophilic/superhydrophobic nanofilamentary materials with
revolutionary properties. As a result, this research can have significant impact
on the current and future spills, particularly on the difficult long-term clean-
up efforts after the initial clean-up, and can bring substantial economic
benefits. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Continuous nanofibers have critical advantages
to other nanomaterials in terms of cost and ease of their nanomanufacturing,
possibility of integrated control of their geometry, properties, and
hierarchical assemblies/architectures, and elimination of health related
concerns. A large number of nanofiber applications is being currently developed
by academic, Federal, and industrial researchers including researchers in
Nebraska. The new methods and materials developed in the course of this research
will critically contribute to these developments and will assure continuing US
leadership in the nanofiber research. One post-doc and several graduate and
undergraduate students including minorities (funded from different sources) will
receive high quality interdisciplinary research training and will be available
for competitive employment. Plans for mentoring of an aspiring post-doctoral
associate are also described
