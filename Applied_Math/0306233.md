This research project concerns development of new numerical methods for
stochastic partial differential equations and their application to mathematical
finance. These applications include option hedging and pricing, stochastic
volatility models, computation of value-at-risk, asset management, and interest
rate term structure modeling.

On one hand, this research will combine techniques including control theory,
high-performance computing, Ito analysis, and Malliavin calculus to numerically
solve sophisticated random systems. On the other hand, it will provide better
understanding of a central problem in finance, namely, crossing the bridge from
discrete time models to continuous time ones. This work has potential to improve
the practical implementation of mathematical models in the finance industry,
with resultant increase in efficiency and decrease in the probability of
financial crisis.
