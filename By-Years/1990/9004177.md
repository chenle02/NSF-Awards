This research is to study the crust and upper mantle beneath central California
using a new and independent teleseismic data set collected in the region by
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. First, the receiver function technique will be used
to study the orientation and possible imbrication of the oceanic crust beneath
the continental margin in addition to looking for variations in crustal
thickness along the margin. Second, the data set will be merged with that of the
USGS to do a 3-D seismic travel time residual study of the crust and mantle
beneath the margin. Understanding the tectonic history is essential for better
understanding and characterization of the potential seismic hazards present
today. This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction
Program.
