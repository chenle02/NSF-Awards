Robert H. Todd 9410494 This project is a workshop on capstone senior engineering
design courses. The workshop will bring together engineering educators from all
over the country to exchange information on capstone experiences. The ties to
engineering design research are a significant part of the program. These
capstone design courses are seen as an important link in transferring our
country's research results into industrial practice. This workshop will
accelerate the improvement of these courses across the country, and in turn
improvement of American manufacturing.
