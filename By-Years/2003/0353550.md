The New Philadelphia NSF REU project is an interdisciplinary scientific
archaeological Study of an integrated town established on the midwestern
frontier. New Philadelphia was the first town incorporated by an African
American in the pre-emancipation era. The town thrived as a small, integrated
rural town with craftsmen, laborers, farmers, and their families until the
railroad company routed its line around New Philadelphia in 1869. Residents
unincorporated the place in 1885, and it slowly disappeared from the landscape
as people moved to the larger surrounding towns and distant urban areas. Today,
the site is situated in a plowed field with only a few remaining fieldstone
foundations. The goal of this research project is to understand how ethnicity
and race may have influenced consumer choice, landscapes, and diet. This study
will add a new perspective to understanding the changing relationships between
whites and blacks in an integrated community over the course of antebellum and
postbellum eras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU Site will incorporate students in
the research design, data collections, and analysis of the archaeological
materials. The Site will accept 9 students for 10 weeks. The program is divided
into three components: a one-week orientation and background session that
includes the geophysical testing of archaeological sites; a four week
archaeology field season collecting data; and a five week session at the
Illinois State Museum scientifically analyzing material culture and
archaeobiological data. Students will work in a collaborative effort while also
receiving mentorship from an interdisciplinary team of professionals. Students
will receive training in archaeological field methods, artifact identification,
and cataloguing, as well as in faunal and macrofloral
analyses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award contributes to the Foundation's
continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through
active undergraduate research experiences.&lt;br/&gt;
