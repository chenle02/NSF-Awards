This award contributes funds to the Department of Animal Ecology at Iowa State
University to provide Modern instrumentation and technology which will improve
instruction for undergraduate majors in their principal laboratory course in
aquatic ecology. (1) Microvideo technology will be used to do a more effective
job of teaching students how to study microscopic organisms, how to make
quantitative measurements of plankton populations, and how to use scales and
otoliths for aging fish. The major instrumentation to be purchased includes a
microscope equipped with a color video camera, a VCR, and a color video monitor.
(2) Students will be introduced to the concept and use of instruments interfaced
with computers. As an example one procedure will use an electronic digitization
board linked to a computer for measurements of lake morphometry and for
calculating growth rates of fish from measurements of annual marks on hard parts
of fish. (3) Students will gain experience in using microcomputer techniques for
analyzing and presenting limnological and fisheries data. A statistical package
combined with a microcomputer will be used to increase the efficiency of
exercises on data processing, analysis, and presentation. The grantee is
matching this award with non- Federal sources.
