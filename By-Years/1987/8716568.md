The sino-atrial node of the heart is comprised of extremely important tissue
since it is this node which is responsible for the heart rate. Dr. John W. Clark
is studying the pacemaker role of the sino-atrial node and the autonomic nerves
which control this function and in the process he is using his engineering
background to try to put this function into a mathematical model. Dr. Clark will
incorporate into his model the various cell functions, both intracellular and
extracellular. This work is important in itself because of the biological
structure upon which it concentrates. However, this work is ground breaking
since it attempts to quantify another biological system. This work will
represent a substantial advance in our understanding of the operation and
modulation of the sino-atrial node cells of the heart.
