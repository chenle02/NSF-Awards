The next decade will see increasing levels of integration of all kinds of
communication needs in a common network. There has been a marked interest in
packet-switched networks as a means to attain that goal. While the performance
of data traffic is measured in terms of delay, real-time traffic such as voice
and video is measured in terms of packet losses. Besides giving real-time
traffic priority over data traffic, little work has been done in determining
scheduling policies which minimize packet losses. This research models nodes in
the network as queues with customers (packets), each of which has a deadline for
service which, if exceeded, leads to a packet loss. A scheduling policy, called
the shortest time to extinction (STE) policy, is shown to be optimal for a class
of queues. These results are extended to a larger class of queueing systems,
including multi-server and multi-class queues. To aid the analysis and design of
queues with such scheduling policies, methods of computing losses for such
queues are developed.
