This proposal requests funds to initiate a New England Workshop on Science and
Social Change, hosted by the University of Massachusetts Boston but located at
the Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, over a 4-5 day period in the
spring. The innovative, interactive-intensive nature of these workshops, which
will have about 12 participants, is designed to facilitate discussion and
longer-term collaboration among college faculty who teach and write about
interactions between scientific developments and social change. The general
impact of the project will derive from showing the following: scientists,
science educators, and STS scholars can cross fertilize each other's work;
academic workshops that allow participants to connect theoretical, pedagogical,
practical, political, and personal aspects of the issue at hand can foster new
projects and collaborations; and, productive workshops can be run at modest
costs. The specific intellectual impact will depend on the theme of the
workshop. The first workshop on "Complexities of environment and development in
the Age of DNA" will foster critical commentary by scientists and STS scholars
on genetics and biological determinism and seek to stimulate deeper discussions
about environmental contributions in development. Evaluation of the first
workshop will provide a basis for requesting funding a second workshop.
