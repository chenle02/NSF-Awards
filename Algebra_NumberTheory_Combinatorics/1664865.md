Algebraic and geometric combinatorics, and, in particular, the study of discrete
objects that approximate high-dimensional shapes, is a rapidly developing field
that has close connections to optimization, computer science, engineering,
statistics, and mathematical biology. For instance, in engineering and computer
science, e.g., robotics, one often needs to describe a space of "allowed
motions." This space can usually be approximated by a collection of points,
segments, triangles, pyramids, and higher dimensional analogs of pyramids nicely
glued together -- an object known as a simplicial complex. A simplicial complex,
in turn, can be encoded in a certain algebraic structure that involves
polynomials. Study of this algebraic structure led to several spectacular
developments in the field. This research project aims to deepen understanding of
various aspects of simplicial complexes and the corresponding algebraic
structures.

The project aims to deepen our understanding of algebraic, combinatorial, and
topological invariants of simplicial complexes through the study of their face
numbers and Stanley-Reisner rings. Specifically, research on this project will
attack fundamental questions related to (1) tracing various topological
invariants (beyond the usual simplicial homology) in the Stanley-Reisner rings,
(2) extending results on face numbers and Stanley-Reisner rings of
triangulations of manifolds to the setting of normal pseudomanifolds, and (3)
studying face numbers of simplicial complexes with an additional structure such
as balancedness or symmetry. Thus, this project seeks to vastly improve our
understanding of Stanley-Reisner rings (and modules) of complexes, especially
when they are not Cohen-Macaulay or even not Buchsbaum. Consequently, it is
expected that results of the project will impact not only algebraic and
geometric combinatorics, but also commutative algebra, discrete geometry, and
potentially even algebraic topology.
