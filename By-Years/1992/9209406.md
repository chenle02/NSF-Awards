Hashing techniques are used extensively in databases and file structures, text
retrieval systems, and in hardware. This research is addressing the fundamental
question of the relationship between the results of probabilistic analysis of
hashing techniques and their practical performance. The goals include
investigating: (1) if and how the analytical performance can be achieved in
practice; (2) the effect of different distributions of the key sets; and (3)
application of hashing and perfect hashing to hardware implementation.
Preliminary results obtained thus far are promising and indicate that the
analytical performance can indeed be achieved in practice. These fundamental
results are useful in other areas such as in signature files for text searching
and parallel hashing. By addressing the long open question in the area of
hashing, this research enables the users of hashing techniques to have a formal
basis for file design and confidence in the expected performance of the
resulting file structures.
