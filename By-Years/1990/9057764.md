For this PYI award research will be conducted in two areas of theoretical
polymer physics: (1) the statistics of polymer blends and solutions, and (2) the
dynamics of long polymer chains in topologically restricted environments. In the
first area studies are underway on equilibrium microphases, their morphology and
the dynamics of microphase transitions. Other studies will include segregation
in blends of network with linear polymers or solvent, and homopolymer blend
statistics and dynamics. Computer simulations and analytic methods will be used
to study the dynamics of polymer chains.
