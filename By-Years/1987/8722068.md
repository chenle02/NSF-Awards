This research will contribute to the scientific basis for integrating
production and inventory control as it relates to material flow in small-lot
assembly. This work will focus on the electronics industry; however, the results
could find general application in a broad range of assembly systems. The
research will also add to the understanding of the particular process of
inventorying/accumulating components for assembly through an examination of five
alternative model building paradigms. The new models developed as part of this
research will be based on Phase-type and Coxian-type distributions to better
capture the complexities of small-lot assembly systems. Other areas to be
studied include cost- effective management procedures, effective means of
allocating on-hand components to satisfy customer requirements while promoting
assembly productivity, and flexible models of transient material flow for
coordinating operations. The research program includes relevant interaction with
industry.
