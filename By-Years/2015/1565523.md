The Georgia Institute of Technology proposes to add four new cohorts of
undergraduate and graduate students to their existing CyberCorps(R) Scholarship
for Service (SFS) program in cybersecurity with strong background in network
forensics and big data analytics. Georgia Tech is a premier technological
university that offers a rich set of educational programs in the broad area of
cybersecurity. Its graduate degree in information security was launched in 2002,
and students in other degree programs can also choose cybersecurity focus. The
previous SFS Scholarship award has graduated 40 students and it provided
evidence for the quality and diversity of students Georgia Tech attracts, its
rich and broad cybersecurity curriculum; and quality of research programs in
many areas of cybersecurity. Students who have graduated from Georgia Tech have
become leaders in the cybersecurity field, serving in key roles in government
and industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This five year CyberCorps(R) SFS proposal
seeks funding to support a total of 28 students. These students will come from
all degree levels - ranging from undergraduates to PhDs - from multiple colleges
at Georgia Tech. In addition to scholarships for students, a capacity building
component will allow new courses to be developed in emerging areas such as
Internet-scale network forensics and big data analytics for better understanding
of malware threats. Georgia Tech has been at the forefront for both educational
innovation and cybersecurity curriculum content creation and dissemination in
the past. It has collaborated with industry and government agencies to host
multiple workshops for this purpose. By supplementing a demanding curriculum
with research and leadership mentoring, SFS students will be presented with
opportunities that will help them prepare for high impact careers.
