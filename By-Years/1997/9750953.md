The geometric increase in computer power and the ubiquitous availability of
network connectivity are revolutionizing computing. A computer science
curriculum that is based on old teaching techniques may seem dull and irrelevant
to the modern student. Instruction in the undergraduate curriculum for the most
part does not make active use of new technology. A multimedia presentation
during a lecture by an instructor is considered to be a passive use of
technology. In contrast, a student who can control a multimedia visualization is
making active use of such technology. The difference between passive and active
use of technology is similar to the difference between watching a laboratory
demonstration and performing an experiment yourself. Aside from making the
learning experience more interesting, a well designed experiment can challenge
the student and encourage creativity. A well designed user-controlled animation
can have a similar effect and provide the student with a virtual laboratory
environment. Half of the curriculum for an undergraduate operating systems
course has been redesigned by constructing a series of programming projects that
enable students to experiment with concurrency and communication. Although the
remainder of the curriculum in a traditional operating systems course does not
easily lend itself to exploration using programming projects that can be
completed by a student in a short period of time, this project designs a
curriculum for this second part of operating systems and for computer networks
that is based on having the students perform experiments in a virtual laboratory
setting. The laboratory experiments use animated simulations written in the Java
language, allowing them to be run on virtually any computer connected to the
Internet. A framework for developing active animations is set up so that these
animations can be efficiently produced. *
