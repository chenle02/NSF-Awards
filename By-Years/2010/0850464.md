This CISE Special Project award provides funding for the organization of the
2008 CISE Pathways to Revitalized Undergraduate Computing Education (CPATH)
Program principle investigators? meeting. It includes funds for the meeting
itself as well as for a planning meeting of the executive team overseeing the PI
meeting. The 2008 meeting is to be held in the fall of 2008 in Arlington,
Virginia. The workshop provides a forum for dissemination of research results,
collaboration among project teams, and exchange of information to the broader
community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project lies with
the expertise of the participating computing professionals to contribute to the
knowledge and research on innovation in undergraduate computing
education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts revolve around the potential
for the collected group to raise public awareness about transformation of
undergraduate computing education and to collectively initiate projects that may
broaden the pathways into and through undergraduate computing education thus
opening doors for a more diverse student population. &lt;br/&gt;
