This award supports the research of Professor A. Garsia to work in
combinatorics. He intends to investigate representations of finite reflection
groups, in particular, problems derived from studying the Macdonald basis. He
will also study orbit harmonics and graded representations and the q,t-Kostka
coefficients of bigraded modules. The research is in the general area of
combinatorics. Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how
discrete collections of objects can be organized. And, so it is extremely
important to modern communications, for example the design of large networks as
in telephone systems and the design of algorithms in computer science.
