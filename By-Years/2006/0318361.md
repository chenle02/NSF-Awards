The aim of this award is to reconstruct at sub-centennial to millennial
resolution the Holocene SST and d180sw variability from two Marion Dufresne
cores recovered from the Orca Basin in the Gulf of Mexico. The cores have 300 to
500 cm of Holocene and are laminated due to brine infiltration of a slope basin.
The SST proxies that will be used to determine climate variability include
oxygen isotopes of G. ruber, planktonic foraminiferal assemblages, and Mg/Ca
rations.
