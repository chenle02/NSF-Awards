The project is to develop two innovative nano-stereo lithography (nSL)
techniques: two-photon nSL and near-field nSL with the resolution down to 50nm.
Both methods promise 3D nanofabrications with computer-aided design/modeling
capabilities. Preliminary numerical simulations suggest that a spatial
resolution down to 60 nm can be achieved with near-field nSL. Techniques, such
as electrical force controlled nano stereo lithography, will be investigated and
employed to further enhance lithography resolutions. Through this project, not
only novel nSL processes will be developed, but intriguing fundamental
mechanisms of nano-stereo-lithography will also be studied to intensify our
understanding on fundamental science on molecular-scale photon-material
interactions, for instance self-focusing, radical diffusion, thermal transport
and viscous effects, and their influences on the resolution. Upon the success of
the development of proposed nSL techniques, a set of specific nano devices will
be designed and fabricated.

Viable three dimensional nanomanufacturing technologies and its applications
developed in this project will have important impacts in human society from
biomedical diagnostics to optical communications. The research outcome will also
benefit the emerging high technology industries in United States in competition
with foreign countries. Another important aspect of this proposed project is the
integration of research and edcuation through summer undergraduate research.
Armed with solid knowledgements, state-of-art techniques and innovative ideas,
students, especially minority and women students will be ready to serve industry
needs in the nanomanufacturing arena.
