This research will develop and test "smart" balloons whose altitude can be
controlled to provide the capability to follow isentropic, constant pressure
surfaces or other chosen strategies. In addition to providing track information
through Global Positioning System (GPS) derived position data, the smart
balloons will carry pressure, temperature and humidity sensors, and these data
will be transmitted along with the position data. By including pressure and
temperature sensors and a pressure pump, the smart balloon can be programmed to
track along isentropic, moist isentropic, isopycnic or constant pressure
surfaces. The ballasting of the smart balloon will be achieved using an helium
filled, expandable balloon inside an air-filled constant-volume, pressurized
balloon. If a higher altitude is required during an experiment, air is released
from the pressurized outer balloon. This action allows the helium-filled inner
balloon to expand and take the place of the heavier released air. If a lower
altitude is desired, outside air is pumped into the outer balloon, which
increases its density and causes the balloon package to decrease in altitude.
The virtue in development of this capability is that the instrumented smart
balloons can be utilized in a number of observational applications including:
Lagrangian observational strategies, or in prescribed sounding strategies,
without the threat of balloon loss through groundings. Smart balloons capitalize
on recent technological advances to provide a cost-effective, new data gathering
capability for the atmospheric sciences research community. Such balloons, or
tetroons, can be deployed during field experiments directed at investigation a
variety of research problems ranging from storm structure to atmospheric
chemistry in the troposphere and stratosphere. In situ observational data for
the previous seven hours are transmitted at five minute intervals on UHF along
with GPS position of the tetroon. These da ta can then be intercepted by
receivers on-board research platforms within approximately one hundred miles of
the tetroon.
