The objective of this research project is to create techniques for capturing and
reusing design procedures for parametric design. The proposed techniques will be
implemented as a transparent software layer that will be placed over existing
design tools, transforming them into trainable design automation tools. The
designer will train these tools by solving a few sample design problems. Once
trained, the tools will be capable of solving similar problems with a minimum of
human intervention. The proposed approach will use decision tree learning
algorithms to learn which attributes of the design best indicate which parameter
the designer will change at any given point in the design procedure. Background
knowledge will be used to improve the learning accuracy and to generalize the
learned procedures. Neural networks will be used to learn representations for
the implicit design constraints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this work
will help to preserve design knowledge in a reusable form. A tremendous amount
of useful information is generated during the process of designing, but often
only the final result is recorded, in the form of detailed drawings. When design
information is lost, future efforts to maintain the design may result in
unexpected failures. Similarly, future designers may have to reinvent what was
once known, or they may repeat past mistakes. The proposed work directly
addresses these issues by creating techniques for capturing the procedures by
which design problems are solved. Solution procedures are the distillation of
the designer's understanding of a problem, thus preserving them provides a
valuable resource for others who must solve similar problems.
