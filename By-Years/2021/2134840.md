Coordinated networked microgrids (NMs) promise to significantly enhance power
grid reliability. Three main challenges prevent their wide adoption: 1) Lack of
understanding of NM dynamics; 2) Big data but limited/unscalable analytics; 3)
Cyber-infrastructure bottlenecks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to
develop AI-Grid: AI-enabled, provably resilient NMs. Key innovations are a
programmable platform integrating reliable modeling under uncertainty,
reachability analysis, formal control, high-assurance software architectures,
and cybersecurity technologies to enable scalable, autonomic, and ultra-
resilient microgrids and NMs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
