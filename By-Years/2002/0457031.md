"Funding request to help fund the CTEQ Summer Schools in QCD Analysis and
&lt;br/&gt;Phenomenology" &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the past decade CTEQ Summer
Schools have played an important role in the world wide elementary particle and
nuclear physics enterprises by promoting the knowledge of QCD and its
applications to electroweak precision measurements and new physics searches. The
Schools consist of eight days of lectures and discussion in which students
interact closely with distinguished experts, both theoretical and experimental.
The shoools aid intellectual advances by deepening the background of young
scientists who contribute to the experimental and theoretical programs. The
school provides young experimentalists with the essential tools for analyzing
the results of their experiments. &lt;br/&gt;
