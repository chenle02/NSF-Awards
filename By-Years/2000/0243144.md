This project covers the hardware design of a large-format, wide-field imager for
the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). The imager is in the critical path
for the LSST, and may eventually represent a $20 M expenditure. The project
covers the investigation of key hardware issues for the imager mosaic module,
and will include the following tasks: definition of detector specifications
based upon community-defined science requirements; competition for the supply of
sample imager modules; engineering of the focal plane array layout and cool
substrate; panel analysis of the module performance and estimated cost; and the
letting of a contract for two science-grade sample modules, with lab tests. The
design process is critical to the eventual development of the wide-field imager,
which will have broad impact to the astronomical community as a critical
component of the LSST.
