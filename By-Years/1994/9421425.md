9421425 Truskey This project is on research to evaluate the hypothesis that the
size and number of focal contacts regulate cytoskeleton organization which, in
turn, controls cell shape and growth. A major problem in cell culture and tissue
engineering is retaining morphology and function in vitro. This research will
study rat hepatocytes because they are difficult to maintain in a differentiated
state in vitro, and spreading has been correlated with changes in cell
replication and protein synthesis. The specific aims of this research are to:
(1) develop micropatterned surfaces with immobilized peptides and sugar groups;
(2) study the effect of pattern dimensions and ligand density upon focal
contacts, cytoskeleton organization, cell shape, and growth; and (3) study the
effect of perturbations in focal contact area and cytoskeleton organization upon
hepatocyte spreading and function. ***
