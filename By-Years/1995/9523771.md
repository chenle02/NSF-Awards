9523771 Kesler This proposal requests support for an evaluation of processes
that could deposit gold in sediment-hosted micron gold (SHMG) deposits. Despite
their importance, we lack comprehensive models for gold deposition in these
ores, largely because we do not understand the mineralogical form of gold in the
ore and its relation to geologic features. In order to evaluate the feasibility
of the solid solution/adsorbtion/electrochemical depositional processes for SHMG
deposits, we need to know: 1) the geologic setting of pyrite with different
textures and gold contents; 2) the degree to which overgrowths on pyrite can be
correlated; 3) the form of gold in pyrite. Efforts to answer these questions
will focus on deposit-scale studies at the large Twin Creeks deposit in Nevada,
which contains widespread pyrite textures of the type described here. Work will
also include a reconnaissance survey of the distribution of pyrite in Paleozoic
sedimentary rocks of northern Nevada to test the importance of pre-existing
pyrite to gold deposition. In addition to their obvious importance to genetic
theories, results could aid exploration by forecasting grades and delimiting
targets during early stages of drilling.
