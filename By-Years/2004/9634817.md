Beatty 9634817 The proposed research is aimed at developing a constitutive model
for modeling the Mullins effect, a nonlinear stress softening phenomenon
observed in elastomers and soft biological tissues subjected to repeated loading
and unloading. Both static and dynamic effects of stress softening will be
studied analytically to provide insight to phenomena related to difficulties
encountered in use of surgical balloons, to enhance understanding of the
material properties of stress softened elastomers and to investigate the Mullins
effect in some useful technical applications. The balance of experimental work
with modeling and relevance to applied problems is excellent. The research
approach is novel and likely to yield results of significant engineering
importance. ***
