In this project, Dr. Dagosto will study approximately 200 postcranial skeletal
remains of specimens of the genus Hemiacodon. This is a form of early primate
which inhabited both Europe and North America during the Eocene period. Dr.
Dagosto will visit museums in both the United States and Europe which contain
these specimens. She will describe and measure them to produce a comprehensive
assessment of the limb skeleton in order to: 1. assess variation among species;
2. reconstruct locomotor and postural behavior; 3. test competing ideas on the
taxonomic place of these groups within the primate order. While research has
been conducted on Hemiacodon cranial remains, postcranial materials remain
undescribed. Relatively little is known about the early stages of the
development of the primates and the position of the group to which Hemiacodon
belongs has been much debated. This research should help to resolve this issue
and provide new insight into the emergence of the human lineage.
