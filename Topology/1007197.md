The first main theme of the proposed research is quantum 6j-symbols and
3-manifold invariants. The Principal Investigator, Patureau-Mirand and Turaev
have shown that categories with vanishing quantum dimensions naturally give rise
to modified 6j-symbols and re-normalized link and 3-manifold invariants. The
project continues this work with a goal of further understanding these objects
by deriving explicit formulas for these modified 6j-symbols and constructing
Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs) from the re-normalized 3-manifold
invariants. This work is related to the Volume Conjecture. The proposed research
will also focus on constructing generalized Kashaev-type quantum hyperbolic
invariants of 3-manifolds with an aim of defining Chern-Simons-type invariants
for non-compact groups. A final theme of the proposed research is the
construction of new state-sum invariants of shadows.

With the influx of quantum field theory into low-dimensional topology, the past
two decades have seen the emergence of a revolutionary point of view in the
theory of link and 3-manifold invariants. The discovery of the V. Jones
polynomial by Jones in 1984 and its 3-dimensional quantum field theory
interpretation by E. Witten in 1989 have opened the door for the use of new
algebraic techniques to study topology. These developments led to a new branch
of mathematic known as "quantum topology." Many useful and interesting topics of
quantum topology are enriched by vanishing quantum dimensions; for example the
construction of quantum 3-manifold invariants and the Volume Conjecture both
depend on the subtleties of such vanishing. This project has three components,
all concerning the vanishing of quantum dimensions in low-dimensional topology.
