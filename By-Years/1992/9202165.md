Research will develop mechanics modeling of failure in metal interconnects in
very large-scale integrated circuits. A unified approach to diffusive void
growth caused by thermal stress and electromigration and their combination is
proposed, incorporating grain boundary diffusion driven concurrently by stress
and electric current, and governing equations for stress and current density
distributions. The primary goal would be to model void growth and thereby
predict the lifetime of interconnects.
