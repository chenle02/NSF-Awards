The collisionless shock is a fundamental process in space plasmas that involves
energy conversion between electromagnetic fields and particles. Magnetic
pulsations in the foreshock region are sites with efficient energy conversion
and rich wave-particle interactions. This work studies the magnetic pulsations
in the Earthâ€™s foreshock region. It will advance understanding of wave-particle
interactions and shock dissipation. Two early career researchers will be
supported.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project employs high time resolution
spacecraft observations and multi-dimensional fully kinetic simulations. The
objectives include: (1) Understand how the magnetic pulsations are generated
from instabilities; (2) Understand how secondary waves in the magnetic
pulsations are generated and coupled with each other; (3) Understand the plasma
energization and wave-particle interaction in the magnetic pulsations. The
research uses fully kinetic simulations and spacecraft observations that resolve
cross-scale (ion to electron scales) processes with 3D distribution functions,
an effective approach to enhance the science impact of the research and achieve
closure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
