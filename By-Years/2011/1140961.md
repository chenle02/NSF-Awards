The Educating the Next Generation of Geoscientists (ENGAGE) project is providing
opportunities for members of underrepresented groups, primarily Hispanic, to
experience the geosciences in formal and informal settings via classroom,
lecture, workshop, and field experiences. This collaboration between San Jose
State University, San Francisco State University, and the U.S. Geological Survey
in Menlo Park, is developing approaches that make use of the social and cultural
values ethnic groups to support motivation, learning, and student confidence in
their own abilities. Strategies to overcome academic, socio-cultural, and
economic obstacles include guest lectures and workshops, family science nights,
integration of laboratory and field research experiences in the undergraduate
curriculum, paid summer internships and scholarships, and strengthening of
pathways between lower level undergraduate programs in area community colleges
and the upper level geoscience majors program at SJSU. These combined efforts
serve the important goals of increasing the diversity of students pursuing and
achieving undergraduate degrees in the geosciences and increasing Earth System
Science literacy among communities that are underrepresented in the STEM fields.
