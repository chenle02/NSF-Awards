In his 1948 paper that founded information theory, Shannon introduced a notion
of "entropy" to measure the amount of "randomness" in a process. However, to a
computer with bounded resources, the amount of randomness can appear to be very
different from the Shannon entropy. Indeed, various measures of "computational
entropy" have been very useful in computational complexity and the foundations
of cryptography. Recent work by the PI and others have introduced new measures
of computational entropy, increased our understanding the new and old
computational entropy measures, and found greater applicability of the these
measures in cryptography and complexity theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project aims to refine our understanding of computational entropy, use
computational entropy to seek unified and optimal constructions of cryptographic
primitives, bring us closer to resolving the power of randomness in space-
bounded computation, and identify new applications of computational entropy in
the theory of computation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is closely
integrated with the PI's educational efforts. The PI continues to develop
courses and online lecture notes related to the project (on topics such as
Pseudorandomness, Cryptography, and Applied Algebra). Graduate students are
involved in all aspects of the research, and undergraduates participate
regularly as well. The PI is also very active in service to the scientific
community, including outreach efforts such as "vision nuggets" that convey
research directions in theoretical computer science to a broad audience.
