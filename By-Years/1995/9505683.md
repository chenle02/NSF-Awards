The electrochemical and spectroscopic characterization of diamond thin film
electrodes forms the focus of this research project at Utah State University,
supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program. Synthetic diamond
thin films show promise as physically and chemically robust electrode materials
which may have application in a wide variety of electrochemical sensors and
electrochemical processes in severe service environments. The work of this
project is designed to develop the basic understanding of these materials
necessary for their subsequent use in a variety of important technologies. The
synthesis and characterization of diamond thin film electrodes is the subject of
this research project. Diamond possesses an interesting combination of physical,
chemical and electrochemical properties which make it promising as an electrode
material in a number of sensing and process applications. A basic science
understanding of the relationship between the structure of these films and their
electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical activity is the goal of this
research.
