This research is to analyze an extensive ocean bottom seismometer data set
collected in 1986 by US and Canadian government agencies and universities in the
Great Lakes. The project was designed to image the crustal structure associated
with the Midcontinent Rift and Grenville Front as part of the GLIMPCE project.
The method of analysis is an innovative 2D ray- tracing and single shot
migration of the seismic data. Increasing our understanding of the
midcontinental rift is an important scientific goal that will help to explain
the mechanism of rifting and associated crustal thinning. The results may also
bear on the difficult problem if intraplate tectonic activity that is the cause
of earthquakes outside from crustal plate boundary zones and thus the work is a
contribution to the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
