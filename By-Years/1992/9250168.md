A Quality Engineering Laboratory enhances undergraduate Quality Control courses
in the Department of Industrial Engineering at Kansas State University. The
laboratory covers both, Product Design and Statistical Process Control. Students
are responsible for proper selection of components for the best possible design
that meets the functional requirements. Off- line quality engineering and its
influence on product quality is demonstrated through hands-on laboratory
experiments. In addition, students implement statistical process control
techniques in a model production facility with two multi- station production
lines after they have learned the underlying principles which include how
quality control techniques relate to Computer Integrated Manufacturing.
