9308937 Brinson The research addresses a critical concern for the advancement
and use of shape memory alloys (SMAs) in smart structure technology. In this
investigation a generalized and unified constitutive law is developed that
describes the thermomechanical behavior of shape memory materials in terms of
their martensitic phase transformations. The derived relations will be
incorporated into a nonlinear finite element procedure and used to replicate
experiments. This research will utilize mathematical and numerical methods and
limited experimental testing, combined with detailed understanding of the
micromechanical material behavior, to develop constitutive relations that
extend, correct and advance work previously done in this area. ***
