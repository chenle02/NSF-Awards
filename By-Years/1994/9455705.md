9455705 Bedard This project pioneers a new way to provide experimental
complements to theoretical courses. The goal is to train students to use what
they learn to examine all that they see and as a result, to question. The
fundamental idea is to create a suite of simple experiments which can be done in
the home and assigned like homework problems. Such simple, but elegant
experiments are dubbed Hands-On-Homework (HOH) which: * encourages students to
use engineering theory to explain everyday phenomena, and to compare their
observations to theoretical prediction; * provides open-ended opportunities to
explore engineering questions using readily available materials and familiar
experiences; * trains students to conduct "reality checks" and naturally apply
theoretical analysis to experimental observations; and * provides continuous
opportunities for students to empirically explore engineering questions
throughout their college careers and develop habits contpibuting to life long
learning. This project is tied to curriculum changes planned for the new
Integrated Teaching Laboratory. Hands-On Homework is liberally sprinkled
throughout the entire curriculum, primarily in the first three years, including
introductory mathematics and physics courses. Initial disciplinary courses such
as statics, dynamics, thermodynamics, and circuits benefit, as well as more
advanced courses such as fluid mechanics, heat transfer, control theory, or
materials. HOH problems are piloted in two courses while doing an outreach to
identify further courses. Evaluation is done by holding consensus groups during
the semester and comparing performance of students with and without HOH. Results
will be presented at meetings and reviews. Ultimately, a user's guide will be
produced containing all the Hands-On-Homeworks as well as the performance
evaluations. Because HOH's are low-cost, they can be easily rep- licated and the
results of the project widely exported.
