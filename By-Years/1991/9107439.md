Resource dilemmas are created when group members shared limited resources to
which all have free access(e.g., groundwater, energy, minerals, endangered
species.) When group members request their share from the resource pool
independently, with no communication among them, there is experimental evidence
showing that as the uncertainty about the size of the resource increases, people
increase their requests thereby lowering the probability that their request will
be granted. Six experiments are proposed to study the effects of several
variables (e.g., amount of uncertainty about the resource, group size, real-time
updating of information about total group request) about the resolution of
resource dilemmas under two protocols of play. Under one protocol, requests are
made simultaneously, and under the other, sequentially with full information
about previous requests. The proposed experiments are driven by a game
theoretical model prescribing an equilibrium solution and by a decision
theoretical model. The findings should be useful in understanding the effects of
alternative mechanisms on decision behavior in resource dilemmas, which are
among the most serious problems facing modern society.
