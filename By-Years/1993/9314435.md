This project provides international travel support for the Principal
investigator to conduct cooperative studies in Taiwan on a short-term scientific
visit basis. The investigation will conduct cooperative studies with researchers
at the National Taiwan University and National Cheng-Kung University on the
seismic repair and rehabilitation of low-rise reinforced concrete buildings.
Extensive experimental data available through recent studies by Taiwanese
researchers will be collected and analyzed to form the basis of a mathematical
model for such structures. With such a model, complex nonlinear analysis which
is required to determine the degree of potential seismic damage can then be
performed. In addition, the feasibility of using Taiwan's building inventory and
data base to investigate the hybrid techniques to control the dynamic movements
caused by earthquakes and/or wind forces will be investigated. The cooperative
studies will improve engineering understanding of the nonlinear seismic behavior
of low-rise buildings, increase the ability to model such structures, and
develop viable framework for cooperative studies in structural control research.
