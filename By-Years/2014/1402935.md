Title: Integrated Synthesized Optical
Sources&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The successful pursuit of this research
could lead to the first widely-tunable, integrated synthesized optical sources,
which would be much more stable, and have smaller size, weight and power
requirements than components currently available. The combination of photonic
and electronic integration will produce a chip-scale tunable sources that do not
require accurate temperature control or high input power to operate. The
project's GOALI partner, Freedom Photonics LLC., intends to commercialize some
version of the proposed device that may impact the optical components
marketplace. The new technology will be developed within the NSF-NNIN facility
and the new fabrication processes will be made to students and outside users.
The PIs have a strong commitment to involving high school, and undergraduate
students in research activities, including summer internships, and students of
under-represented groups in STEM learning programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed research aims to develop a highly-integrated widely-tunable optical
frequency synthesizer (OFS) with sub-Hz-level accuracy. The integrated OFS is
based on a monolithic, 4-section, widely-tunable laser offset-locked to any one
of the lines of a frequency comb. By employing a combination of photonic and
electronic integration, sub-Hz-level accuracy can be obtained with an integrated
optical phase-locked loop (OPLL) technology. All of the photonics, except for
the external reference laser, the photodiodes, and the comb generator, will be
integrated on a single InP photonic IC . The tunable laser's output can be tuned
across the entire comb by tuning the laser between the comb lines with the RF
offset source, and alternately selecting different comb lines. With this
approach sub-Hz-level relative frequency accuracy, as well as sub-kHz linewidth,
should be possible. If successful, the proposed work would have a transformative
impact on the design of optical systems for a series of new optical
technologies.
