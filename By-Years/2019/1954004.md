The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
application of a non-pharmacological approach using â€œneurostimulation socks" in
the treatment of chronic foot and ankle pain. The neurostimulation market is
valued at $5 B and is projected to grow at 12.5 % annually through 2026 because
of factors such as renewed regulatory attention to these problems, demand for
nonpharmaceutical treatments, and rising incidences of chronic diseases. As pain
management devices dominate this market, the proposed technology could enter the
$1.5 B foot and ankle pain sector as a new treatment option for the millions of
people suffering from this debilitating condition. Electrostimulation has been
widely used for pain management, but integration with a wearable system has not
yet been widely adopted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on
the development of a neurostimulation device that can reduce chronic foot and
ankle pain in nurses and assist in muscle recovery for athletes. The invention
is a knee-high sock that delivers electrical impulses to the muscles within the
foot for reducing chronic pain and inflammation. The sock is removable, reusable
and all electrical components are integrated with the plantar area of the sock.
When the user experiences pain, nerve stimulation is activated via their
smartphone that can provide instant pain relief. The user also may program the
smartphone to automatically deliver neurostimulation if they expect to be
standing for long periods. In addition, the sock features a shock-absorbing
insole that can automatically adjust the compression of the fabric based on the
current circumference of the foot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
