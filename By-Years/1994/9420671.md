9420671 Grannis A group of faculty, support staff and graduate students at the
State University of New York at Stony Brook will continue to study antiproton-
proton annihilation reactions at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory.
(FNAL). The research aims to uncover fundamental components, the quarks and
leptons, basic to all matter, to determine their properties and coordinate
observations with predictions of the standard model of elementary particles.
This is done with the use of the technologically sophisticated complex detector
apparatus DO at the Teveatron particle collider in a collaboration of physicists
from institutions around the world. Partial support is provided for a program to
improve the apparatus to fit it better to a higher intensity Tevatron now being
developed. ***
