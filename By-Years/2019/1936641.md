Missouri State University (MSU) will implement an ADVANCE Catalyst project to
conduct an institutional self-assessment to understand the current status of
women faculty in STEM disciplines on the main campus. This project will include
a review of the current social and behavioral research on: gender equity, work-
life balance, underrepresentation of certain groups in STEM, and organizational
change. A central part of this project will be to undertake a comprehensive
review of retention, promotion, and tenure (RPT) policies and related procedures
and practices for each STEM department. The project includes strategies to get
direct input and advice from leaders of current and past ADVANCE
institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This two-year project will prepare the
university for future data collection and data analyses of faculty equity which
can be used by institutional leadership to inform decision-making. The Catalyst
work will also prepare the institution to implement evidence-based strategies to
enhance the university climate for all faculty which will be outlined in a five-
year faculty equity strategic plan that will be produced as part of this
project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster
gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of
organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of
diverse faculty in academic institutions. Organizational barriers that inhibit
equity may exist in policies, processes, practices, and the organizational
culture and climate. ADVANCE "Catalyst" awards provide support for institutional
equity assessments and the development of five-year faculty equity strategic
plans at an academic, non-profit institution of higher
education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
