Mathematical Sciences (21). This project is creating materials presenting the
structure of the hydrogen atom and the periodic table as a first example of the
power of representation theory in predicting physical phenomena from information
about symmetries. Despite the centrality of representation theory to modern
mathematics, mathematical physics and physical chemistry, undergraduate courses
in representation theory often ignore the physical applications. During this
proof-of-concept project materials are being tested at a number of different
institutions, and a modular approach is being incorporated into the materials
development so as to broaden the appeal of the materials to an audience that
includes disciplines outside of mathematics . A book on representation theory is
planned and an arrangement is already in place with a leading publisher.
