This project is a collaboration under the NSF-FDA Scholar-In-Residence (SIR)
program. Software increasingly is used in safety-critical medical devices. Given
the safety-critical nature of software controlling medical devices, regulatory
agencies are endowed by the government with authority to allow only software
meeting with high standards of quality to be put into use. For example, the US
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prohibits a medical device from being
marketed unless it can be reasonably trusted as safe and effective. Moreover, if
a device on the market is reported to fail and cause health consequences to
patients, the FDA has the right to take corrective actions, such as post-market
reviews of the device to find the root cause of the failure. As medical device
technology evolves, so does the software upon which the technology often relies.
Changes in device software, after it has been approved or cleared by the FDA,
may compromise the safety of that device. Assessing the safety of such changes
presents special challenges to regulators at the FDA. To address these
challenges in the context of regulation at the FDA, the research develops
differential analysis techniques using the technology of dynamic symbolic
execution to assess the effects of software changes on device safety. The
research explores new techniques for addressing unique requirements and
challenges posed by differential analysis in the context of FDA regulation.
These techniques also advance the fundamental state of the art in differential
analysis. Among the broader impacts of the project includes integration of the
research into education programs and enhancement of teaching and research
infrastructure.
