This grant provides computer equipment for image processing and computer vision
research. The system will replace an old system which is now obsolete and will
be operated and maintained in the Remote Sensing and Image Processing Laboratory
where faculty from different departments have ready access to the facilities.
The equipment will be used for research in image analysis with emphasis on
projects to study image analysis operators and computer vision systems.
