Mitochondria contain conserved proteins that facilitate the insertion of
proteins into their respective membranes. Prior NSF funding enabled the PI to
demonstrate that Oxa1 facilitates the inner membrane insertion of a subset of
nuclear- and mitochondrially-encoded proteins. In this new project the PI will
focus on how Oxa1 mediates membrane insertion of proteins. Major components of
this new study will be the interaction of mitochondrial ribosomes with Oxa1,
transmembrane segments of the protein, and identification of other components
that interact with the Oxa1 protein. The study will use a variety of biochemical
and genetic approaches. Studies of protein targeting and membrane insertion
events have important implications for the fundamental question of how
biological membranes establish and maintain their specificity and identity. The
project will provide research training at three levels: undergraduate, graduate
and postdoctoral.
