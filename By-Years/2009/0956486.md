Plastids are a defining feature of plant cells. These diverse organelles are the
sites of a wide array of essential processes that include photosynthesis and the
subsequent partitioning of carbon between sugars for immediate use throughout
the plant, and starch for temporary storage that is reclaimed during the night.
Phosphate concentrations strongly influence these processes, but understanding
of the transport proteins needed to coordinate plastidic phosphate levels with
environmental and metabolic conditions is incomplete. The objectives of this
project are to determine the transport mechanism and physiological role of
phosphate transporters that reside in either chloroplasts or non-photosynthetic
plastids of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Loss-of-function mutants for
these transporters display unique growth and metabolic phenotypes that suggest
distinct roles. Notably, a mutant for a root plastid transporter exhibits
increased cell proliferation in leaves with a corresponding increase in leaf
biomass. Grafting studies combined with genetic and biochemical studies will be
used to test the hypothesis that carbon allocation between root and shoot
tissues influences mitotic activity in leaves. This project will provide new
insight into how plants integrate phosphate and carbon metabolism at the
cellular level to control the physiology of photosynthetic and non-
photosynthetic tissues. Moreover, these studies may have practical implications
for agriculture. Graduate and undergraduate students will receive
multidisciplinary research training, formal teaching opportunities, and will
participate in the development and implementation of undergraduate biology
education workshops.
