Understanding the role of circulating fluids in controlling sedimentary
properties along convergent margins has become a high priority research
objective in the marine geosciences. In a number of areas the discharging fluid
can be sampled directly and inferences made about the depth of circulation,
interaction with surrounding sediments, and degree of modification of
sedimentary physical parameters. Sampling of sea-floor sediments and subsequent
analysis can allow the history of circulation systems to be examined. This award
will support an examination of the petrography and geochemistry of carbonate
sediments that have been deposited by circulating fluids along the Oregon
margin. Samples will be recovered by submersible in September of 1990. Samples
will be analyzed for their major element chemistry and isotope composition.
