Tutorials in Introductory Physics is a research-based curriculum that has been
demonstrably effective at improving students' conceptual understanding when
introduced in lieu of a standard recitation section in the introductory
calculus-based course. The project is creating a set of fifteen laboratories,
some of which are based on Tutorials. Others are based on new and existing
research into student understanding of three areas: conservation of energy and
momentum, vectors, and torque and rotation. The laboratories then undergo an
iterative development cycle of research, evaluation, and implementation and are
being tested at 6 universities that serve diverse student populations.
&lt;br/&gt; The intellectual merit of this project includes goals to (1)
contribute to efforts to understand the needs of different student populations;
(2) widen the impact of research-based curriculum, improving the introductory
physics course on a national scale; (3) build upon proven curricular materials;
and (4) develop assessment instruments for specific topics that are currently
inadequately addressed by existing instruments. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of
this project is to (1) broaden the research base for effective curriculum
development in introductory physics; (2) disseminate the results of research on
the teaching and learning of physics; (3) model effective laboratory pedagogy to
physics faculty and teaching assistants; (4) serve women, underrepresented
minorities, and persons with disabilities with aspirations for careers in
science-related fields; and (5) provide a laboratory experience involving the
process of scientific inquiry. &lt;br/&gt;
