9528581 Beck This research is a collaboration between the University of Arizona
and Carnegie Institute of Washington to accelerate the use of data recorded by a
temporary array which, by luck, was installed directly over the 1994 Bolivian
great deep earthquake. This magnitude 8.3 event occurred at a depth of 636 km,
was the largest earthquake in the world since 1977 and the largest deep
earthquake ever recorded. Data from this origin of deep seismicity and the
structure of one of the most seismically active areas in the world. This grant
will support the construction of an event data base for the mainshock and 42 of
the largest aftershocks that will immediately be made available to the general
scientific community through the on-line IRIS data center. Funding will also
augment an intensive research program in the analysis of these close-in station
recordings. This grant is supported under the Small Grants for Exploratory
Research Program and also is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard
Reduction Program.
