Summer Research Conference in Statistics, 2006

The Southern Regional Council on Statistics (SRCOS) together with the American
Statistical Association is organizing a Summer Research Conference (SRC) in
Statistics be held June 4-7, 2006, in Kerrville, Texas. The conference objective
is to bring together statistics researchers of all academic levels in a relaxed
and stimulating atmosphere. The program chairs for the 2006 Summer Research
Conference (SRC) on Statistics are Dr. Jack Tubbs, Department of Statistical
Science, Baylor University, and Dr. Jiayang Sun, Department of Statistics, Case
Western Reserve University. The session topics include; Bayesian Methods in
Pharmaceuticals, Adaptive Clinical Designs, Multiple Tests of Hypotheses,
Bioinformatics, Data Confidentiality and Security, and Text and Data Mining. The
principal Senior speakers include; Stacy Lindborg, Eli Lilly, Andre Rogatko,
Emory University, Don Berry, M D Anderson, Jeff Hart, Texas A&M, Rudy Guerra,
Rice University, Simon Sheather, Texas A&M, Alan Karr, NISS/SAMSI, and Ed
Wegman, George Mason University. A poster session is open for graduate students
and other attendees to present their research. The sessions of the conference
are not concurrent. The research topic areas are broad, with applications of the
methodologies in a spectrum of fields (such as medicine, homeland security,
business, etc.) The individual 90-minutes sessions, featuring a senior speaker
and two junior speakers, are structured to provide in-depth coverage of the
topic, from an overview by the senior speaker to specific, current research
problems of the junior researchers. Advanced graduate students, postdoctoral
fellows, and junior researchers are encouraged to attend and present in the
judged poster session. Support to offset travel expenses for students and junior
researchers by NSF is gratefully acknowledged. Detailed information about the
conference can be found at http://www.baylor.edu/statistics/srcos/
