Proposal ID: AST-0239321&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Lowell Observatory&lt;br/&gt;PI:
Oey, Sally&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Sally Oey will use her CAREER award at
Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, to model the feedback processes -
mechanical, radiative, and chemical - from massive stars. Mechanical feedback
and galactic outflows are a critical unknown in models of galaxy evolution, the
interstellar medium, the intergalactic medium (IGM), and cosmic evolution.
Radiative feedback controls vital nebular diagnostics of star-formation and the
escape fraction of ionizing photons from galaxies, central to understanding the
ionization of the universe. Chemical feedback controls the fundamental chemical
signatures of galaxy evolution, enrichment of the IGM, and cosmic chemical
evolution. Building on her combination of observational and theoretical work
that has so far successfully integrated the parameterization of mechanical and
radiative feedback, this award will allow her to fully include chemical feedback
as well. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research program will also supply a broad
science base from which Dr. Oey will draw material for Lowell Observatory's
public outreach programs. This material will nicely complement their dominant
science strengths, which have long been in the areas of solar system and low-
mass stars. Dr. Oey will expand and update the outreach programs to include
Galactic and extragalactic science, with an emphasis on LOPARC, Lowell's 16-in
telescope for public science activities, and LEARN, their electronic newsletter.
In addition to these public outreach efforts, she will continue working with
students in K-12 and higher education. &lt;br/&gt;
