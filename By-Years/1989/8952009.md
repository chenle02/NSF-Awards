The acquisition of a complete night-vision system with a video recorder and a
portable data-logger system to accumulate data for future analysis will provide
state-of-the-art instrumentation for remote environmental data gathering. This
equipment will be used in Ecology, Limnology, Wildlife Biology, Ornithology, and
Environmental Biology courses as well as in undergraduate student research
projects. The college will provide 50% matching funds.
