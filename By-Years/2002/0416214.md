Professor Eric J. Munson of the University of Kansas is supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry program to develop methods to improve the
analysis of pharmaceuticals using solid-state NMR spectroscopy (SSNMR). A magic-
angle spinning (MAS) NMR probe that contains multiple spinning systems is being
constructed. The probe design enables the spinning systems to be rapidly
shuttled in and out of the homogeneous region of the static magnetic field.
While the spectrum of one sample is being acquired, the magnetization of the
other samples are returning to equilibrium in the inhomogeneous region of the
field. The multiple sample capabilities increase sensitivity and throughput
compared to conventional MAS probes. The project is also investigating
fundamental problems related to the formulation of new drug compounds. One area
focuses on improving the capabilities of solid-state NMR spectroscopy to
identify, detect, and quantify polymorphs, solvates, and amorphous forms of a
pharmaceutical solid. Another is determining how relaxation and line width are
related to the physicochemical properties of the drug, such as particle size and
crystal defects. A third area is applying the knowledge gained from measured NMR
parameters to drug stability, with the ultimate goal of using solid-state NMR as
a predictive tool for early identification of stable
formulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SSNMR technology being developed is
providing new tools for the characterization of drug formulations. The advances
can also be applied broadly to the analysis of pharmaceuticals and samples that
include glasses, polymers, and catalysts. The project is providing training for
graduate students and enabling collaborations with the pharmaceutical
industry.&lt;br/&gt;
