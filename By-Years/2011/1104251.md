This project uses existing traditional computer lab facilities to support a
platform for remote access to virtual machines (VMs) to assist in teaching
Information Technology courses. The goals for the project are to 1) provide
Durham Technical Community College Information Technology students remote access
to a single or small set of VMs; 2) utilize existing lab computers and
infrastructure to reduce the cost of implementation of a remote lab; 3) provide
VM hosting accessible through a hosting pool; 4) provide a project and system
management learning opportunity for Information Technology students; and 5)
disseminate information about the project to the 58 community colleges in the
North Carolina Community College Systems through presentations at professional
state and regional conferences and assist other interested schools in
implementing the platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this project, students
have access to all functions of the computer and operating system, enabling
hands-on experience to complete networking or IT course assignments. Students
indirectly gain facility with virtual machines and remote access, two areas in
which employers have shown increased interest. The implementation and management
of the virtual machine infrastructure give students experience with project
management and OS administration. Additionally, the project conserves resources
and minimizes capital expense, thus reducing costs.
