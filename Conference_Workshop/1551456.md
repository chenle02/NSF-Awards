The 2015 Midwest Conference on Representation Theory will be held November
13-15, 2015, on the campus of University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri. The
conference will gather established experts, recent Ph.D.s, and graduate students
for the purpose of discussing and disseminating new research results in the
general area of representation theory, a fundamental mathematical subject with
applications to many other areas within mathematics. This is the 41st annual
meeting of this conference, which serves as an important forum in the field.
This award supports participation by graduate students, early career faculty,
and senior researchers with no other source of travel funds. The conference
website is http://faculty.missouri.edu/~takedas/Midwest_Rep_2015/index.html.

This year's conference will focus of representations of groups over non-
archimedean local fields. The representation theory of groups over non-
archimedean local fields is closely tied to number theory, in particular to the
study of automorphic forms, which are central objects of study in modern number
theory. The conference will feature nine speakers, including talks by young
researchers on a broad range of topics in the theory of representations of
groups over non-archimedean local fields and talks by senior researchers on
supercuspidal representations of these groups.
