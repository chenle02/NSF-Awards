This proposal builds on an existing CD-ROM, "Our Dynamic Planet" by creating a
realistic "virtual reality" trip to the seafloor intended for an introductory
course in oceanography. It supports work that will double the content of an
existing project, and enable students to explore a broader spectrum of
oceanographic sub-disciplines including ocean chemistry, biology, marine
resource development, and marine technology. Efforts are focused on compiling a
rich variety of recently collected data from the world's mid-ocean ridges and
enhancing the "point and click" user interface to facilitate student-subject
matter interaction. Supportive curriculum materials that will be integral to CD-
ROM are a key component of this initiative. Students will work with seafloor
topography, seafloor geology, sea life, and hydrothermal hot springs. The
students will also have access to other types of data, such as water chemistry,
temperature, light attenuation, rock chemistry, magnetic intensity, seismic
structure and more. Students are provided with a discovery experience tied to
observations and data taken during actual research expeditions that investigate
the link between lithosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere that uniquely occurs at
mid-ocean ridges, collecting the latest, cutting edge results from research
oceanographers and packaging them in an easy to use and understand format for
undergraduate non-science students. NSF FORM 1358 (1/94)
