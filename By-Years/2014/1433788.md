The SPARCS project will support 72 teachers of grades 7-9 to integrate computer
science into their science and math instruction. Because the world is adopting
computational tools quickly, students need to learn about how computational
technology can be leveraged to make informed decisions. This project will help
teachers integrate computational thinking and computer science principles into
their teaching through these tools, by engaging students in projects that
analyze data. The question of how to support secondary teachers to integrate
computer science and real world related applications into their STEM instruction
is on the cutting edge. This project will inform this issue.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teachers will participate in a summer institute, online
courses in computer science, monthly meetings during the school year, and
mentorship with industry professionals. During the summer institute, teachers
will work in small teams to create activities within a problem-based learning
(PBL) framework, which they will implement in their classrooms during the school
year. These activities will be informed by existing curricular resources,
publicly available electronic data, and advice from industry experts and project
staff. The efforts of these teachers will be documented through several forms of
data, including elaborate teacher portfolios, observations, interviews, and
student achievement results. These data will support refinement of the project
from year 1 to year 3, and will be designed to communicate to other educators
how to implement similar efforts in other schools.
