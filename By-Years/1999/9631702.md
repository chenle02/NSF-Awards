This project involves a Career Advancement Award to Julia E. Fulghum, Associate
Professor of Chemistry at Kent State University. The PI is a recognized expert
in X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and the purpose of this award is to
enable her to spend a sabbatical leave at the National Renewable Energy
Laboratory (NREL) in Denver, Colorado, to learn sample preparation and data
analysis for time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS). Both XPS
and TOF-SIMS are surface analysis techniques and the information they provide is
complimentary. The PI will be able to expand her XPS technique development to
encompass TOF-SIMS imaging with emphasis on organic and insulating samples. Part
of the work at NREL will involve studies on photovoltaic materials development.
In addition, the PI will be able to add TOF-SIMS capability to her on-going
research work on the surface chemistry of materials. The long-term goal is to
add TOF-SIMS instrumentation capability in her own laboratory. The project is
supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program and the Special
Projects Office in the Chemistry Division. This project will enable Professor
Julia E. Fulghum to examine the surface chemistry of important technological
materials such as liquid crystals and photovoltaics using two complementary
techniques: X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and time-of-flight-secondary ion
mass spectrometry. Little work is available in the literature regarding such a
comparison. Imaging is one aspect of the work and correlating information from
both techniques will aid in understanding the artifacts and limitations of each
of them. The results of the work will contribute to the development of solar
cells for energy conversion and the technology of optical materials.
