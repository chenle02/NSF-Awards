The topic of the project is development of a framework for robust active vision,
with the goal of obtaining systems capable of performing satisfactorily in the
presence of uncertainty, such as due to poor calibration, noise, or a changing
environment. The work will be complemented by a comprehensive experimental
validation and performance characterization.
