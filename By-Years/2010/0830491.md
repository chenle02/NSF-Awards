Concepts and techniques drawn from combinatorial and algebraic topology have
been successful at solving a number of fundamental problems common to concurrent
and distributed computing. This research focuses on two goals. First, much needs
to be done to further explore and exploit the emerging connection between
concurrent computing and topology. In particular, there is a need to reformulate
classical notions from algebraic and combinatorial topology in terms better-
suited to the demands of modeling computation. Second, there are many
opportunities to apply techniques based on topology to emerging models and
problems, refining and extending earlier results.

In the near future, nearly all computers, from supercomputers to smoke
detectors, will be shared-memory multiprocessors (often called multicores). As a
result, understanding how to exploit this new-found concurrency is one of the
central issues in modern Computer Science.
