This project combines theoretical and experimental studies of grain boundary
structure and properties, particularly as related to polycrystalline aggregates.
Attention is given to types of line defects not studied previously in grain
boundaries and to the effects of finite grain boundary length. Computer-based
experiments examine the effects of finite boundary size upon boundary structure
with relevance to nanocrystalline materials. The nature and behavior of triple
lines and associated defects (disclinations) are studied using computational
techniques for the analysis of their geometries and experiments on copper
tricrystals. Experiments are aimed at determining energy vs. misorientation
relationships for grain boundaries in non-cubic materials. Transmission electron
microscopy of tricrystals is employed to determine defect structure and grain
boundary energies in selected metal specimens. %%% This project has as an
overall goal to develop detailed understanding of the mechanisms by which grain
boundary structure determines grain boundary properties. This is pertinent to
all polycrystalline materials, but is particularly relevant to the new class of
nanostructured materials now seeing increased research attention.
