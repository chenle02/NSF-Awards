Investigators continue their quantitative observations of the solar calcium
K-line, as well as data reduction. Data is compared with UARS observations so
that future predictions of solar ultraviolet emission are available, regardless
of spacecraft status. In addition, they are developing other indices using
synoptic Big Bear data, and continuing digital measurements of white-light
emission of the Sun, particularly for determining sunspot areas and comparing
with solar constant data. Finally, they are investigating the role of different
magnetic features in constituting the K-line.
