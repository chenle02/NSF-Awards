A theory of "probable correctness" is proposed to assess the trustworthiness of
software through testing. Most current testing methods are intended for
debugging, to find failures and connect them to program faults for repair. When
these methods no longer expose errors, no analysis has been done to find the
confidence that may be placed in the software. (Preliminary results here are
that this confidence should be low.) The application of conventional decision
theory to tests as program samples is suspect because its assumptions concerning
independence and distribution do not hold. Thus there is no valid theoretical
basis for predicting probable software quality from test results. As software
becomes ever more complex, and its applications more critical, the need for a
sound evaluation metric grows. It is crucial that a theory of testing for
trustworthiness be plausible, which requires an analysis of the foundations of
program sampling. The flaws in current theory result from sampling the wrong
space: faults are distributed, not over the input domain, but over the program's
text and variable state space. Preliminary results using a probabilistic model
that arose in learning theory are promising. It is possible to analyze practical
testing methods, and to understand why they fail. Continued development of the
theory will yield quantitative comparison between methods, and can be used to
compare programs according to their "testability."
