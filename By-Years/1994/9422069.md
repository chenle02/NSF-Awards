9422069 Jain For the past decade, the importance of visual computing has
increased exponentially. Visual computing, which embraces processing,
interpreting, modeling, assimilating, storing and synthesizing visual
information, now plays a pivotal role in many fields. These include such
subjects as: virtual reality, multimedia, robotics, computer-human interaction,
scientific visualization and communication. This award is to purchase equipment
for supporting a number of ongoing research projects that are committed to this
important field. The goal of these projects is to improve visual information
computing through innovative experimental research. The equipment which include
two visualization systems, one real-time image processing subsystem, and a
number of visual sensors will be dedicated to support four individual research
projects each addressing a different aspect of visual computing, namely Visual
Information Assimilation, Visual Interaction through Gesture Recognition,
Modeling and Design of Optoelectronic Visual Information Processors, and
Physics-based Visualization of Multipedal Walking Systems. ***
