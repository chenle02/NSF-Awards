Diversifying STEM is a national priority in which the United States' government
has devoted immense resources. Because of this priority, many coalitions and
consortia have been developed, involving major foundations, companies,
universities, and organizations, to increase student access, engagement, and
success in engineering and other STEM-related fields. Mathematics, Engineering
and Science Achievement (MESA) USA is a national consortium, founded to focus on
increasing diversity in STEM careers by providing underrepresented, secondary
students with high-quality engineering and science education experiences. For
nearly 50 years, this consortium has been recognized as a national model for
promoting inclusion and equity in STEM. One of MESA's signature activities is
its annual National Engineering Design Challenge. The main objective of this
grant proposal is to create a Travel Grant Program for MESA USA, high school
participants to attend the annual challenge in 2018 and 2019. The national
competition is the culminating event, held annually in June and attended by many
state delegations: a middle school team (4 students/1 teacher), a high school
team (4 students/1 teacher), state MESA director and members of the national
Engineering Design Challenge planning committee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than
50 percent of MESA USA students come from disadvantaged, first-generation or
English as a second language backgrounds, where there are few immediate family
members or key adults to foster, support, and/or transmit their engineering
career outlook. The proposed travel grant will presents an opportunity for MESA
USA students to share and present their passion for engineering by attending and
competing in the National Engineering Design challenge and without the struggle
and difficulty of finding the needed financial resources to attend such a
meeting.
