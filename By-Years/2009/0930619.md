This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will develop a low cost
manufacturing process for a carbon nanotube based (CNT) dry adhesive that
emulates the mechanical properties of gecko feet and that can be scaled up to a
large scale.

The superior performance of CNT dry adhesives will significantly change the
horizon of the adhesives industry, heavily impact many industrial and consumer
production processes and create a broad array of products.
