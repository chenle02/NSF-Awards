9451740 Schurr This project adds experiments in geophysical sensing to the
classroom, laboratory, and field school program in archaeology at the
institution. Equipment includes a geophysical surveying station and
instrumentation, with ancillary computer equipment and software. The equipment
is being used by undergraduates for site-level geophysical surveys within the
context of a comprehensive program in archaeological theory, method, research,
and human landscape studies. Student activities involve course lectures and
specific field work, including geometric and soil resistivity surveys, computer
data processing, computerized mapping, and image processing. Students are also
able to complete class projects and term papers, or subsequently conduct
independent study research using the theoretical approaches or techniques
presented and learned in a course.
