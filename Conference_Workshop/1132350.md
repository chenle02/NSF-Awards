This award provides support for the 31st annual meeting of the Southeastern-
Atlantic Regional Conferences on Differential Equations (SEARCDE), held October
21-22, 2011 at Georgia State University. The conference financially supports
participation by students and recent Ph.D. recipients.

The meeting includes plenary lectures on topics of current research interest and
also especially encourages lectures by students and recent Ph.D. recipients. The
conference brings together workers in a variety of different areas of research
in differential equations, with emphasis on providing opportunities for new
researchers to present their work.
