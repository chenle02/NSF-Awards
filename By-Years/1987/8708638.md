The goal of this study is to learn the role that cell lineage plays in
specifying the development of the nervous system of a vertebrate. Dr. Kimmel
proposes to determine neuronal cell lineages directly by filling single
progenitor cells present in early embryos of the zebrafish with a fluorescent
lineage tracer dye. With the aid of an image intensifying video camera, he will
watch the subsequent development of the marked cell and its clonal progeny. Dr.
Kimmel will keep track of the sequence of divisions and of the movements of
individual cells in the clone during the period of gastrulation and subsequent
formation of the nervous system, until the time that cells stop dividing and
begin growing axons. At that stage specific types of neurons can be recognized.
To do this study, Dr. Kimmel will take advantage of the small size, optical
clarity, and rapid development of the zebrafish embryo. The principal
investigator has described individually identifiable neurons that begin to
differentiate during the first day following fertilization, and the primary
objective of this project is to learn the cell lineages that generate these
cells. Dr. Kimmel has a solid reputation for careful analysis of the development
of zebrafish, and this research will substantially increase our understanding of
the role of cell lineage in specification of cell type in the nervous system.
