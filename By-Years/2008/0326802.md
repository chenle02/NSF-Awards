Proposal #: 0326802&lt;br/&gt;PI: Ferris Webster&lt;br/&gt;Institution:
University of Delaware&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will build on an
existing research ship schedules and specifications database to
&lt;br/&gt;create an online portal to information on research vessels. The
portal will cover US and &lt;br/&gt;international research vessels with
information on their science missions, schedules, equipment, &lt;br/&gt;and
specifications. It will include the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory
System &lt;br/&gt;(UNOLS) fleet, US vessels outside of UNOLS, and international
vessels. The system will be &lt;br/&gt;open to all and will operate
continuously. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Ocean Information Center (OCEANIC) at
the University of Delaware's College of Marine &lt;br/&gt;Studies will support
the UNOLS Office activities to modernize their information technology
&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure and interfaces, such as a next-generation Ship Time
Request and Scheduling &lt;br/&gt;system. Joint development with the UNOLS
Office will help identify and eliminate duplication. &lt;br/&gt;Onsite
development and hosting of UNOLS content and hardware will provide a centralized
&lt;br/&gt;location for the UNOLS information technology infrastructure and data
as the UNOLS office &lt;br/&gt;moves among participating institutions.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The research element in this proposal is to develop
innovative procedures for presenting &lt;br/&gt;information and supporting users
needing assistance in cruise planning and scheduling. New &lt;br/&gt;elements to
be added to the existing system include open and innovative online tools to:
&lt;br/&gt;o Enable interested researchers and institutions to identify
opportunities for collaboration. &lt;br/&gt;o Locate areas where research
vessels are operating and the types of research being &lt;br/&gt;performed.
&lt;br/&gt;o Determine geographic hot spots where research vessel activity is
high for various &lt;br/&gt;scientific disciplines &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
