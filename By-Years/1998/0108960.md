All plants need to acquire at least 15 elements from their environment including
carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur. In addition to these element
resources, plants also require light and water. Although the relative
requirement for these resources by plants remains relatively constant, their
relative availability in the environment can vary drastically in both space and
time. Plants must therefore adjust to this variability in resource availability
to maintain a balanced nutrition. The relative success of various species in
making this adjustment will in part determine the productivity of the ecosystem,
the composition of the plant community, the species diversity, the rates of
nutrient cycling, and the rate of CO2 storage or loss. In this grant, a
theoretical foundation is established for understanding the complex interactions
among multiple resources and the consequences of these interactions on species,
on communities of plants, and on ecosystem processes like nutrient cycling and
carbon sequestration. The theory is then tested using data from the Arctic
Tundra Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site in northern Alaska.
