This EAGER project will provide an assessment of the potential use of a high
resolution proton transfer time of flight mass spectrometer (PTR-TOFMS) for eddy
covariance air/sea gas flux measurements. The composition and rates of emissions
of volatile organic compounds from the sea surface are poorly known, which is in
large part due to the lack of suitable instrumentation for measuring such
fluxes. The PTR-TOFMS will be deployed under field conditions aboard the R/V
Knorr in the North Atlantic Ocean. If successful, this will demonstrate the
viability of the approach to future field programs. The project may also result
in the first broad-spectrum analysis of fluxes of volatile organic compounds
emanating from a highly productive oceanic region. This could provide access to
new tracers for air/sea gas exchange and insight into the precursors of
secondary marine organic aerosols. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project will
provide support for a post-doctoral researcher, as well as involve at least one
undergraduate student who is participating in the institution's REU site
program.
