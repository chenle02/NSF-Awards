9402319 Crawford The proposed cross-disciplinary (pharmacy and engineering)
study will examine the impact of robotics technology in pharmacy practice. This
Planning Grant activities will include development of a statistically based
simulation model of the unit-dose medication cart filling process fop a hospital
pharmacy department. Activities will also include examination of attitudes about
the utilization of robotics technology in pharmacy practice. %%% The PI has been
trained in the field of Pharmacy Administration, and not trained in the area of
process simulation and modeling-a component of the planned proposal. A senior
investigator is listed within the planning grant with a specialty in process
simulation and modeling. This senior investigator will serve as a mentor to
allow the PI to develop an expertise in the process simulation and modeling
within the 12 month period allotted to the planning grant. ***
