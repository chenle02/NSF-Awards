Miocene crustal extension in Arizona was accompanied by uplift and uproofing of
metamorphic core complexes and crustal thinning, creating the presently observed
variation in crustal thickness from about 25 km in the Basin and Range to about
45 km beneath the Colorado Plateau. The effect of thinning on the lower crust is
poorly understood. Researchers at two universities will study four basalt-
rhyolite volcanic fields that define a transect spanning the Basin and Range -
Colorado Plateau province boundary. We will use trace element and isotopic
compositions of these lavas to constrain their source compositions. Inferred
source compositions will be compared with data collected from crustal xenoliths
from nearby localities. Preliminary work demonstrates that the rhyolites contain
a large crustal component and that the lavas change composition systematically
along the transect. Our major goals are to test hypotheses of the origins of the
rhyolite and to relate our crustal source constraints to recent and ancient
tectonic and crust formation events. Additionally, we will investigate the
relationship between the high-silica and low-silica rhyolites that occur in each
field and study the time- space relations of alkali-olivine and tholeiitic
basalt volcanism.
