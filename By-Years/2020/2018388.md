This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation, and the Chemistry
Research Instrumentation programs. Montana State University is acquiring a 400
MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer equipped with an automatic
sampler to support Professors Michael Mock, Valerie Copie, Matthew Cook, and
other colleagues. This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such
as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance,
as well as permitting study of biologically relevant species. In general, NMR
spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the
elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the
solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to
chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This instrument is an integral
part of teaching as well as research and research training of students in
chemistry and biochemistry at this institution and nearby Tribal Colleges as
well as the University of Montana and other small colleges across the state.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award of the NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing
research and education at all levels. It especially facilitates studies of
molecular catalysts for nitrogen reduction and ammonia oxidation of relevance to
the production of fertilizers. The instrumentation is also used for monitoring
cascade reactions and controlling site selectivity in cross-coupling reactions
and activating inert hydrocarbons using early transition metals. In addition, it
provides information to aid exploration of halogen bonding in supramolecular and
self-assembly chemistry. The spectrometer is also used to study mechanisms in
organic and organometallic chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
