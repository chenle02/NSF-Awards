Dr. Nancy Makri is supported by an NSF Young Investigator Award from the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to develop and apply theoretical
methods to the study of quantum dynamics of polyatomic systems. New numerical
schemes for evaluating real time path integrals will be employed to investigate
proton and electron tunneling in condensed phase and large biomolecular systems.
Dr. Makri will also use this theoretical approach to study quantum coherence
effects in intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution. %%% By far the
majority of important chemical and biological reactions take place in solution.
Many of these reactions involve the transfer of an electron or a proton form one
molecule to another. Quantum effects, including quantum mechanical tunneling,
play an important role in such chemical reactions. Dr. Makri is developing new
theoretical methods which will provide an important molecular level
understanding of such phenomena.
