9401491 Simon Professor Simon will continue his research looking into the
spectral theory of Schrodinger operators and research concerning inverse
spectral and inverse scattering problems. Both sets of research exploit detailed
studies of the Krein spectral shift. Among areas that will be explored are:
extending the rank one theory to include trace class perturbations, and the
inverse problem for unbounded potentials, which should be determined in some way
by the eigenvalues and Dirichlet eigenvalues. In particular, an attempt will be
made to describe the isospectral manifold for this problem. Professor Simon will
study a number of problems in the mathematical theory connected with quantum
mechanics. One aspect of his work involves the study of long-time behavior in
the model of electrons in solid and random media, whose properties are at the
forefront of innovative materials design. Simon also expects to study problems
in inverse spectral and scattering theory: the general issue of determining a
microscopic structure from data that can be readily observed. Inverse theory is
central to areas as varied as radar detection of submarines and the
interpretation of medical tomography. ***
