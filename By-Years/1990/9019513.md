This proposal requests funds to continue CALCRUST (California Consortium for
Crustal Studies) activities for the next year. CALCRUST is a consortium composed
of earth scientists from California institutions with a common interest in
crustal structure and evolution. CALCRUST scientific teams include individuals
with expertise ranging from regional geology to reflection seismology and
seismic data processing. The CALCRUST program continues to address important
scientific questions in southwestern U.S. including continental accretionary
tectonics, the mechanics of crustal extension and compression, modes of
deformation in the seismogenic regions of southwestern U.S., the structure of
batholiths, and basement tectonics of the petroliferous basins of coastal
California. CALCRUST seeks to carry structural relationships from the outcrop to
depth in seismic sections, and also hopes to investigate techniques by which
subsurface reflection data can be related directly to subsurface rheology and
petrochemistry, such as through the use of shear waves and seismic velocity
analysis. The CALCRUST activities during the award period will consist of data
processing and subsequent analysis of existing data sets and participation (with
USGS and Stanford) in a pilot study to image the crustal structure and active
faults of the San Francisco Bay area.
