Dr. Max L. Warshauer has worked with students in grades K-12 as well as his
undergraduate and graduate students for the past 22 years. He has worked to
recruit students, and uses innovative but sound pedagogical techniques to mentor
and motivate a diverse range of students to achieve and excel in mathematics.

Warshauer developed the Honors Summer Math Camp at Southwest Texas State
University twelve years ago; it is a program for high-school students which is
recognized as one of the top programs of this type in the country. Six years ago
he developed the Junior Summer Math Camp, which will engage one hundred twenty-
five teachers and more than twenty-five hundred students at six sites to improve
their skills in algebra and other areas of mathematics where they experience
difficulty.

Those he has mentored include underrepresented minority students (ethnicity
and/or socio-economic status) in science and mathematics fields. Approximately
half of his students are women, and he encourages all to explore research as a
part of the learning process. His mentor programs, particularly the summer math
camps, are nationally known, and he has a strong reputation for continuously
refining his programs and building replicable models that can be used by other
mentors and other universities.
