9511192 Petratos Research will be carried out in high energy electron scattering
reactions centered on the study of (1) nucleon charge, magnetization, and spin
structure, and (2) the short-range structure of few-nucleon systems. Research in
these areas will advance our understanding of the quark and gluon structure of
these systems. These topics are high priority activities in contemporary nuclear
physics. The work will be carried out at the SLAC and CEBAF electron accelerator
laboratories. Development, construction, and utilization of major state-of-the-
art equipment, including a plastic scintillator hodoscope for the CEBAF Hall A
spectrometer, is integral to this activity. Education of graduate and
undergraduate students and postdocs is a strong component in every aspect of
this grant for this Kent State University researcher. ***
