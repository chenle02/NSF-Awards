Between the extremes of perfect crystallinity and complete disorder there are a
number of interesting systems. In this proposal, they discuss two such problems
which have the common feature that the partial degree of spatial coherence is
important in understanding the physical behavior. 1) Interest in quasicrystals
has recently grown, due to the discovery of new materials which are much more
highly ordered than previously known samples, raising important new questions
about the atomic structure and disorder in these materials. In particular, they
will determine the phase diagrams and diffraction lineshapes of quasicrystalline
alloys. 2) They will study the growth of atomic layers and epitaxial interfaces
on surfaces, with an eye to understanding whether there are kinetic universality
classes that govern scaling behavior. Both of these research topics are well
matched to the experimental techniques of high-resolution X-ray scattering.
