This project is to study the three-dimensional structure of the wind-driven
subtropical/subpolar ocean circulation using a numerical model. Using a density
coordinate and ideal-fluid thermocline equations, the investigator will study
the non- linear interactions between the ventilated thermocline and other
aspects of the circulation. The model will enable the PI to obtain solutions for
the three-dimensional structure of the wind- driven circulation in a
continuously stratified ocean. The model will be applied to the North Atlantic
region.
