J. Daniel Gezelter of the University of Notre Dame is supported by an award from
the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to develop and test
efficient methods for carrying out molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of
solvated metal nanoparticles. These particles are simulated as they interact
with capping agents and other species in solution. His group is developing
empirical metal-solvent interaction potentials, as well constant-pressure
simulation algorithms for non-periodic systems.

The ultimate goal of the research is to understand how metallic nanoparticles
can be adapted for use in photothermal therapies, and to provide a detailed
picture of how heat is transferred between the nanoparticles and the surrounding
solvent. All of the methods and code developed for this grant are to be released
with an open source license. Dr. Gezelter also directs "The OpenScience
Project", a web-based directory of open source scientific software which
highlights excellent examples of scientific tools and research codes which are
available to other researchers and to the public.
