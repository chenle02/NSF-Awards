A biotechnology facility for work with proteins will be enhanced by the addition
of a variety of biochemical equipment. The Biotechnology Center has the capacity
of growing large amounts of bacterial strains for basic research and also
carries out core research on the methodology involved in large scale work with
the products of biotechnology research. This includes studies on new
fractionation methods, as well as broad scale efforts in biochemical studies.
