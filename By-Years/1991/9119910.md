This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organo- metallic program is to
support the investigation of poly- nuclear transition metal oxoalkoxide
complexes. The general focus is on compounds that may serve as soluble models
for oxide surfaces, intermediates in alkoxide hydrolysis, and as precursors for
sol-gel synthesis of new materials. The metals of interest are molybdenum and
vanadium with possible extensions to tantalum and niobium; alkoxides will be
chosen from among several polyfunctional hydroxylic compounds. The broad
objectives of the research are to gain insight into the fundamental aspects of
aggregation and thereby the control of nuclearity of the polynuclear species.
%%% Metal oxides are among the most common and most useful metallic compounds
but are also among the most difficult to characterize with respect to their
mechanisms of formation and action in many catalytic reactions. Many metal
oxides are prepared by reaction of metal alkoxides (metal salts of alcohols)
with water. This research is designed to improve our understanding of both
processes through the study of cluster molecules and ions that contain multiple
metal atoms, and both oxide and alkoxide ligands. The new compounds will be
studied in solution and in the solid state by a variety of spectroscopic methods
and solid state structures will be determined by x-ray crystallography. Some of
the compounds whose syntheses are proposed may be useful for the preparation of
new ceramic materials and catalysts.
