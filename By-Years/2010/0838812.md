This award provides travel support for Paul Overvoorde (PI) and Rebecca Hoye
(co-PI) to visit with Thomas Beeckman and other collaborators at the Flemish
Institute for Biotechnology (VIB), which is located in Ghent, Belgium. The
planning visit is scheduled for early August of 2008. This planning grant will
enable an expansion of an on-going collaboration between faculty members in the
Biology and Chemistry departments at Macalester College, an exclusively
undergraduate institution located in St. Paul, MN and members of the Plant
Systems Biology Department at the VIB. The collaborative work uses chemical
biology approaches to understand the regulation of root architecture though
control of the cell cycle and the influence of the plant hormone auxin. The
goals for this planning visit are to become familiar with facilities, personnel,
and resources, to refine on-going research plans, and to plan a pair of
proposals that would lead to the exchange of undergraduate students.
