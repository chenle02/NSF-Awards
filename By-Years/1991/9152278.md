The focus of the proposed project is enhancement of the laboratory component of
our Animal Physiology course (BIOL 342), whose student clientele comprises
juniors and seniors majoring in biology and/or seeking to fulfill entrance
requirements for health-professional schools. The objectives of this laboratory
are: reinforcement of the classical physiological principles presented in
lecture with hands-on experience; the practice of general, broadly applicable
investigative skills; and the development of skill in the use of physiological
methods and instruments. The aim of the project is to enhance our effectiveness
in pursuing these objectives by exposing students to a greater variety of
authentic investigative techniques and strategies, utilizing a greater variety
of animal models and more sophisticated instrumentation. The major instruments
we seek to purchase include oscilloscopes and digital storage modules for
electrophysiological recordings from nerves; electrolyte and blood-gas analyzers
for evaluation of renal and respiratory function; and an environmental chamber,
oxygen analyzer, and temperature telemetry equipment for measuring metabolic
responses to changes in temperature. We expect this project to intensely the
interest of our students in organismal biology generally, to prepare them for
subsequent independent investigative efforts, and to improve recruitment and
retention of majors in this curricular area.
