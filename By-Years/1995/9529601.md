9529601 Sturges This project is an individual contribution to a major study of
the North Atlantic to be carried out as part of the World Ocean Circulation
Experiment (WOCE). The PI will develop a way to separate the low-frequency (3-10
year) wind-driven variability in meridional flow in the North Atlantic from the
higher frequency fluctuations forced by transients in the wind. A simple model
using wind curl forcing in the open ocean will be used to determine sea level
variability and to compare it with observations. The results will be used to
"de-alias" data from hydrographic sections taken many years apart.
