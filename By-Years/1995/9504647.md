Dr. Lisa F. Szczepura has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship
in Chemistry. Dr. Szczepura received her doctoral degree from State University
of New York at Buffalo under the supervision of Professor Kenneth Takeuchi. Dr.
Szczepura will continue research at the University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign under the sponsorship of Professor Thomas Rauchfuss. Her postdoctoral
research will target transition metal cluster chemistry and the coordination
chemistry of sulfur. She will investigate the hydrodesulfurization and
hydrogenation reactivity of Mo6S8L6 clusters, where L is a monodentate phosphine
or nitrogen donor ligand. The work is important to the systematic development of
ligands for transition metal cluster complexes through the application of Werner
coordination chemistry principles. The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in
Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to
broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph. D.s and attract them into
meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
