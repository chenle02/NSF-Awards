Small headwater streams are a critical freshwater resource in the
agriculturally-dominated landscape of the Midwestern US, yet are understudied
relative to more pristine aquatic ecosystems. Agricultural practices that remove
natural streamside vegetation may change the energy base that fuels ecosystem
processes. Crop byproducts (e.g., non-harvested foliage) may represent a
dominant carbon source in agriculturally-influenced headwater streams. The role
of this novel carbon source to stream ecosystem function has not been
determined. We will quantify input, standing stocks, decomposition and transport
of corn foliar detritus and pollen in 18 streams across the
Midwest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2000, approximately 28 million hectares of corn
were planted in the North American corn-belt, with 18% of this area planted with
Bt corn. Because the Bt d-endotoxin is produced throughout the plant, dispersing
pollen and non-harvested foliage that enters agricultural streams may be
consumed by various aquatic organisms, and thus pose a threat to the
environment. The potential effect of genetically modified crops on non-target
species in aquatic ecosystems has received little attention, and consideration
of headwater streams as a mechanism for the unintended dispersal of Bt
d-endotoxin through the environment has been overlooked. We will determine if Bt
d-endotoxin is present in the food web and affecting aquatic biota. Bt corn
foliar detritus may detrimentally influence aquatic organisms and energy flow in
streams, and merits further study. &lt;br/&gt;
