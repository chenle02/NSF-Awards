9412783 Hawley ABSTRACT Education and Training Program in Composite Materials
for DoD and Durable Goods Industries Michigan State University (MSU) and the
University of Delaware (UD) will develop new courseware and software to advance
the dual-use potential of low-cost composite manufacturing. Education delivery
mechanisms to be used include computer-based simulations and interactive
learning, broadcasting of classes over satellite networks, and workshops on
design and processing of composites. Resources available to the universities
include the National Science Foundation's Center for Polymer Processing at MSU
and the Center for Composite Materials at UD, sponsored by the Army Research
Office. These centers are also supported by large industrial consortia, and have
excellent research and manufacturing facilities. Industry involvement in this
effort will include guest lectures and planning workshops. ***
