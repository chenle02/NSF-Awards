This MRI proposal is to build a network of cosmic ray detectors (neutron
monitors) at high latitudes. The detectors are placed at strategic Polar
locations to obtain information about the cosmic rays' angle of arrival. With
such an array, the entire Earth acts as a directional cosmic ray detector. The
fact that the Earth's magnetic field deflects the particles is used to determine
the direction of arrival of energetic cosmic rays. Compared with cosmic ray
detectors flown in space, this new "Spaceship Earth" will enjoy counting
statistics far exceeding current spacecraft capabilities. The Spaceship Earth
network is an international project, with participation from US, Russia and
Australia. The network consists of 9 high-latitude stations, roughly equidistant
in longitude (1 in Antarctica owned and operated by the Australians, 4 in
Russia, and 4 in Northern Canada which are covered by this proposal). The new
network will be used for research, graduate education, and postdoctoral
training. The data will be analyzed to understand the acceleration and transport
of solar energetic particles, to probe the structure of magnetic turbulence in
the solar wind, and to elucidate the mechanism of transient cosmic ray
variations. The network has a high societal impact because the PI's will examine
the role of cosmic rays in the context of space weather, and evaluate the
network role to forecast space weather. An advance warning of as much as 10
hours of potentially damaging magnetic storms might be possible. (Presently,
only one hour advance warning is possible).
