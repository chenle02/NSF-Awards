The Department of Statistics at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign,
will purchase computing equipment which will be dedicated to the support of
research in mathematical sciences. The equipment will support several research
projects, including in particular calibration of random curves including
algorithm for high-dimensional parameter estimation, bootstrap prediction and
calibration regions, and high-dimensional visualization; multidimensional
analysis of rank data including graphics for multidimensional unfolding models,
symbolic computation of exact means and variances in rank-based analysis-of-
variance, and extensions of univariate rank-based nonparametric procedures to
multiple dimensions; latent trait modeling of educational test data with
applications test fairness assessment and test dimensionality analysis,
including the development of software for general distribution; regression
modeling and curve fitting methods for conditional quantiles including algorithm
development and dynamical graphics for selecting curve smoothness.
