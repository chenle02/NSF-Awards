A theory of values and their measurement will be developed on the basis of two
distinctions among types of values: protected values vs. well-behaved values,
and fundamental vs. proxy values. Protected values, in contrast to well behaved
values, resist tradeoffs with other values and concern means rather than ends.
For example, some people think that destruction of species by logging should be
stopped at any cost. Proxy values are stand-ins for fundamental values, to which
they are related through beliefs (often uncertain). For example, percent of
children vaccinated is a proxy for disease prevention, to which it is related by
beliefs about vaccine effectiveness. These distinctions can help us understand
inconsistency in measurement of values for environmental amenities and
government policies. Two types of inconsistency involve insensitivity to
quantity (e.g., insensitivity to range in assigning relative weights to
attributes, quantity insensitivity in contingent valuation), and
nonconsequential principles that lead to different valuations of identical
outcomes achieved by different means (e.g., use of cost rather than benefit in
contingent valuation, omission bias). Hypotheses regarding the sources of these
inconsistencies will be tested by examining the effects of: fundamental vs.
proxy values; information relating proxy to fundamental values; manipulations of
the measurement task to bring subjects' approach in line with its purpose; and
combinations of these manipulations. It will also be determined whether
increased consistency within each of two measures will increase agreement
between them. This project is supported by the EPA/NSF Valuation for
Environmental Policy funding opportunity.
