summer residential program in earth sciences for 24 students entering grades
seven through nine. Students study landforms, energy production/use, water
quality, forest resources and technology using classroom, laboratory and field
activities. Participants work in small groups and cooperative learning is
stressed. Research mentorships at local industrial settings enable students to

science will be introduced using videos, simulation games and informal/formal
discussions. Follow up activities including a presentation by participants at
their high school or local civic organization conclude the program activities.
