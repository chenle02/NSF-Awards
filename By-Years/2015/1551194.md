Over the past three years, the SaTC program has funded about 50 research
projects bringing together social scientists and computer scientists in new
collaborations, where the two scientists had not previously performed research
together. These projects were invited through a series of NSF Dear Colleague
Letters. This workshop brings together researchers from these projects, for a
1.5 day workshop (to be scheduled in early calendar 2016 in the Washington DC
area) that will include a mixture of individual presentations and group
discussions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop participants will explores
measures of success and challenges in doing these projects like institutional
barriers for interdisciplinary collaboration, barriers for publication, and
difficulty in attracting and retaining students. The participants will also
identify areas where further collaborations would be worthwhile, and barriers to
submitting and being funded via traditional proposals/solicitations. The
outcomes will be documented in a public written report that defines lessons
learned from mixing the disciplines, and suggestions for future efforts to
encourage such cross-disciplinary collaboration.
