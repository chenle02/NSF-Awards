9422392 Ribak One of the parts of the brain important for learning in mammals is
called the hippocampus, lying deep beneath the cererbral hemispheres. The
hippocampus contains a curled formation called the dentate gyrus, which has
three layers of nerve cells, or neurons. These neurons have characteristic
shapes and some of their connections are known to form particular local
circuits. The basket cells, granule cells, mossy cells and mossy fibers form
circuits that are believed to underlie the functions of spatial learning. The
postnatal development of the functional connections within these circuits are
important to know if we are to understand the role of the hippocampus in early
learning. This collaborative work by an electron microscopist and a
neurophysiologist examines the ultrastructure of synapses (the functional
cellular connections) between particular classes of neurons and the membrane
properties of those neurons. Documenting changes in these structural and
functional features during development will allow a better understanding of how
the hippocampus begins to function during early learning. The results will be
important not only for understanding brain development, but also for
psychological studies on learning.
