9703751 Hagedorn This project concentrates on several mathematical problems in
quantum mechanics that are of interest in chemistry and physics. The main goal
is to study "surface hopping models" in an effort to develop useful improved
approximations for the computation of non-adiabatic phenomena in chemical
dynamics. A second goal is to study the effect of oscillating electromagnetic
fields on molecules. A third goal is to analyze the utility of high order time-
independent Born-Oppenheimer approximations and to improve those approximations
to obtain accurate results for molecular states with large vibrational and
rotational quantum numbers. A final goal is to study the impact parameter
approximation for many body scattering and to examine the high energy behavior
of "charge transfer" scattering amplitudes. The principal goal of this
interdisciplinary project is to derive new, more accurate approximations that
can be used in practical situations by chemists and physicists. The equations
that describe the motions of molecules in chemical reactions cannot be solved
exactly, so chemists and physicists must rely on approximate solutions. Improved
approximations could conceivably lead to applications in areas as diverse as the
synthesis of new chemical compounds, the design of new catalysts, or the
theoretical underpinnings of rational drug design.
