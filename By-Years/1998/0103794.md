Systematics and Biogeography of the Herpetofauna of Papua New
Guinea&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Guinea, the world's largest and highest tropical
island, has more than 530 species of &lt;br/&gt;amphibians and reptiles, about
5% of the world total. However, much of New Guinea remains poorly known and it
is estimated that as many as 200 species remain unknown to science. This project
focuses on inventorying unexplored regions of Papua New Guinea, a country that
occupies the eastern half of the island of New Guinea as well as associated
archipelagos to the north. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigators
will conduct intensive inventories of amphibians and reptiles of ten major
unstudied areas, provide logistical support for concordant studies of mammals,
land snails, scorpions, aquatic insects and other groups, train at least five
Papua New Guinea citizens as parataxonomists, and supervise two Papua New Guinea
graduate students in research being done as requirements for Master's Degrees.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will result in the description of new species,
a much better understanding of the fauna (particularly its evolution and
biogeography), compilation of a comprehensive spatial database on the
distribution of species, and publication of illustrated field guides with keys.
It also will provide essential information for conservation planning, and will
help advance and refine biodiversity predictive modeling methodology (BIORAP)
that uses locality information from museum specimen collections to identify
priority areas for conservation.&lt;br/&gt;
