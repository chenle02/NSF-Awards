The half-life for the decay of tritium will be measured with increased
precision by detecting the external bremsstrahlung from tritium-implanted
metallic foils and from tritium-xenon gas mixtures. This conclusion of a series
of measurements begun previously under grant PHY-8500520 will permit the
extraction of a more accurate value for the tritium decay axial vector matrix
element. This is a one year grant.
