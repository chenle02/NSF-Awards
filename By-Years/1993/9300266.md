This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will assist the
Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Irvine in the purchase
of an x-ray diffractometer with a rotating anode x-ray source, associated data
collection and analysis system and an upgrade of an older x-ray diffractometer.
This new instrumentation will enhance greatly research in a number of areas
including the following: 1) Synthesis and study of ligand-bridged transition
metal compounds, 2) The chemistry of low-valent organosamarium (II) complexes,
3) Synthesis and chemistry of httrium and lanthanide metal complexes, 4)
Silsesquioxanes as models for aluminosilicates, 5) Chemistry of organosulfur
compounds, 6) Catalytic asymmetric synthesis of quaternary carbon centers, 7)
Synthesis of complex polycyclics by palladium catalyzed polyene cyclizations, 8)
Structural studies of bridgehead alkenes, 9) Molecular deformations and chemical
reactivity. The rotating anode capability will permit structural studies which
are not possible with stationary source radiation. %%% The x-ray diffractometer
is used to make accurate and precise measurements of the full three-dimensional
structure of a molecule. The information obtained gives the precise values of
all the bond distances and bond angles of a given molecule and it gives accurate
information about the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the
neighboring molecules.
