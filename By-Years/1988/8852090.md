The Department of Biological Sciences is committed to teaching students an
understanding of biology through participation in scientific experimentation. In
addition to a better understanding of science, participation in the process of
science teaches students valuable skills for today's job market. To meet the
increased need for graduates who can bring an understanding of immunology to
their advanced studies as well as Minnesota's growing biotechnology industry,
the Biology department currently is updating and expanding this area of its
curriculum. This is being achieved by hiring a new faculty member with up-to-
date knowledge in immunology and purchasing an initial suite of equipment. The
goal of this project is to complement the original equipment purchases with
items commonly used in modern immunological technology. This allows the
Department to offer a program in immunology that aids students in their
understanding of biology and also prepares them for employment opportunities in
local industry. The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal
sum obtained from non-Federal sources.
