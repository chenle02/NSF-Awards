The goal of the proposed collaborative research project is to develop state-of-
the-art Monte Carlo (MC) algorithms for many-body quantum systems and exploit
them using widely distributed com- puting (three Beowolf clusters at UMass and
CSI, and the supercomputer center at ETH, Zurich) to simulate collective
phenomena in trapped ultra-cold atomic gases, multi-component condensates in
optical lattices, disordered superfuids, polarons and excitons. The new numeric
schemes will be based on the Worm algorithm (WA) and Diagrammatic Monte Carlo
(DMC) techniques. These are generic high-performance numeric approaches
introduced by the research team for simulations of systems with complex topology
of configuration space and a large number of continuous variables. The programs
will be made available as open source via a web page developed by the research
team.
