This study is designed to elucidate the function of the dnaB gene of B. subtilis
in the regulation of DNA replication and its relation to cell growth. The dnaB
gene is required for the initiation of DNA replication and for the attachment of
the origin of replication to the cell membrane. An attempt (i) to isolate the
product of the dnaB gene; (ii) to characterize the gene product biochemically;
(iii) to characterize the abnormal products of plasmid DNAs which replicate in
the absence of dnaB function; (iv) to examine the effect of the dnaB gene on the
expression of an RNA encoded near the oriC; (v) to examine the mode of
expression of the dnaB gene during cell growth. The long-term goal is to
understand the molecular bais of the regulation of chromosomal replication and
determine how replication is coupled to cell growth. Replication of bacterial
DNA usually starts at a unique site, the origin, and proceeds bidirectionally
around the circular genome to the termination site. After completion, the
daughter chromosomes are partitioned into the daughter cells that result from
cell division. An important step for both replication and partitioning of the
daughter chromosomes is attachment of the origin to the cell membrane. Dr.
Watabe will investigate a gene in B. subtilis, dnaB, that is required for both
initiation of replication and membrane attachment. His major goal is to isolate
and characterize biochemically the protein encoded by the dnaB gene. This study
should provide basic information about the control of cell proliferation in
bacteria and may serve as a model for understanding regulation of cell division
in higher organisms.
