climate change are predicted to be most rapidly and most acutely felt in the
Arctic. Two major manifestations of this change are a reduction in sea-ice cover
and the destabilization of permafrost soils, both of which will likely alter the
arctic carbon cycle. In particular, marked changes in terrestrial carbon fluxes
to the ocean and in marine productivity seem inevitable but the overall response
of the carbon system in the face of rapidly changing hydrographic and
biogeochemical conditions remain unknown. Answers to these questions are crucial
to our understanding of whether the Arctic will serve as a net CO2 source or
sink to the atmosphere, as well as how coastal and pelagic ecosystems will be
perturbed in response to climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
conduct a detailed examination of flux, sources, mode of delivery, and fate of
carbon exported to the deep Arctic Ocean during two consecutive years that
coincided with record sea-ice minima (2007-2009). The core sample suite for this
investigation stems from time-series sediment traps deployed on a physical
oceanographic mooring array in the Canada Basin. By comparing observed fluxes
and geochemical characteristics of particulate organic carbon and related
biogenic components during this time interval with observations from a prior,
more ice-replete period (2004- 2005), and by comparing fluxes for locations
currently under seasonal versus perennial ice cover, this research seeks to
determine how biogeochemical fluxes to the deep Arctic Ocean vary in response to
sea-ice and hydrographic conditions and identify the sources of POC, and the
mechanisms of supply to the deep Arctic Ocean. To do this, multiple geochemical
tracer approaches will be combined with biogeochemical flux data and synchronous
hydrographic measurements to delineate mechanisms that govern carbon export to
the deep basin and establish the provenance of this carbon. This will enabale us
to gauge future shifts in this system and predict how the arctic carbon cycle
may be modified in the face of the climate changes which have been set in
motion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
