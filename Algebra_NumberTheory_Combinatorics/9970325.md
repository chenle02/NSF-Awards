Professor Mubayi plans to undertake research in graph theory with emphasis on
Ramsey theory, hypergraph coloring, connectivity of cages, and graph covering.
The main thrust of his project is to study variations of problems in Ramsey
Theory posed by Paul Erdos. He will also develop the coloring theory of mixed
hypergraphs, investigate the connectivity properties of cages, and study a new
problem related to graph covering.

The proposed research falls into the general area of combinatorics. One of the
goals of combinatorics is to find efficient methods to study arrangements of
objects. These methods are extremely important to modern communications. For
example, the design of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone
systems or internet providers, deal with finite sets of objects and require
combinatorial analysis. Ramsey theory studies the conditions under which certain
substructures in a discrete setting are forced to appear. It has applications to
efficient information retrieval, to clear communication with noisy channels, and
to the effect of failure of intermediate facilities in a communication network.
