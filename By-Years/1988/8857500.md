In order to improve accuracy and efficiency in the modelling of multi-
dimensional flows, a variety of techniques must be developed. These techniques
could be developed in parallel, but utilized in combination. First, ways must be
found to use multi-dimensional information in the construction of the spatial
discretiation. Particularly important is recognizing strong discontinuities in
the flow field data, and treating these separately, rather than simply
differencing across them. Second, marching methods may be improved and
convergence-acceleration techniques introduced through the use of this multi-
dimensional information. Third, grid-adaptation techniques may be employed to
reduce the truncation error in selected regions of the flow. Fourth, the
marching algorithm to be used may be blended with grid-adaptation, specifically
through the use of multi-grid techniques.
