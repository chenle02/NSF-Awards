This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
Informatics for FY2002. The fellowship supports research and training at the
postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
these fellowships will play important roles in training the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Recovering the
influences of environmental change on vertebrate faunas using a morphological
phylogeographic analysis of recent and fossil erycine snakes." Morphometric
analysis and robust statistics are being used to determine phylogeographic
responses of recent and fossil erycine snake faunas to environmental
transitions. This research examines the systematic levels at which fossils can
be recognized by osteological variability, how reptiles respond to environmental
changes through time, and the extent that fossils can predict faunal responses
to anthropogenic environmental modifications.
