This project will utilize a scheduled JAMSTEC cruise that includes 10 research
dives to the Mariana volcanoes. Two primary objectives of this research cruise
are to understand 1) the evolution of the IBM forearc during subduction
initiation, and 2) the igneous and hydrothermal activity of the active modern
submarine arc. This work will investigate the submarine volcanology,
hydrothermal activity, and sulfide mineralogy of several active and dormant
volcanoes in the southern Mariana Arc (eg., Tracey, E. Diamante, NW and W Rota,
and Zealandia). A broad band ocean bottom seismometer instrument package is
likely to be deployed on the NW-Rota-1 for 10days. Rock samples will be
collected for future petrographic analyses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
impacts:&lt;br/&gt;This project provides a strong international collaboration
between US and Japanese scientists and thus promotes cross scientific exchange
within the IODP. It involves 7 US scientists and students from four
universities, including two female scientists. The project will assist the
research of three graduate students, and provide them a hands-on opportunity for
sample collection and direct exchange with an international team of scientists.
