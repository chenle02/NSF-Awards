This research project addresses problems in computational learning theory, the
investigation of algorithms and formal methods for various natural and
artificial learning systems. The following specific topics are addressed in this
project: the complexity of on-line learning with an oblivious environment; the
power of randomization for on-line learning; design of space-efficient
algorithms for on-line learning; design and analysis of error-tolerant on-line
learning algorithms; on-line learning of definitions in fragments of first order
predicate logic; analysis of the computational power of common computational
neural network models; design and analysis of learning algorithms for concept
classes on neural networks of depth 2.
