97-31324 Acevado This is a project to involve teams of Puerto Rico teachers and
students in research using forest reserves in Puerto Rico. During each year of
this 3-year project there will be a project set up phase, a summer residential
component, and an academic year (AY) follow-up. The summer residential component
is five weeks long. The project has an emphasis on ecological and environmental
research. Each year eight teams of one teacher and two students will conduct
research in a selected natural reserve of Puerto Rico. At the end of the summer
teams will make a joint presentation of their findings at a selected site.
Interspersed with the research activities are workshops that are intended to
prepare teachers and students for research activities; measurement and data
analysis skills will be mastered along with just-in-time content. The research
activities will be under the supervision of a group of scientists. It is
expected that teachers will integrate these experiences into school curricula in
the form of forest-related research projects.
