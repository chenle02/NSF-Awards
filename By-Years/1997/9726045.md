9726045 Blum This workshop would bring together experts from several fields to
develop reasonable protocols for handling authority files that are needed to
efficiently computerize natural history data. The absence of the protocols and
therefore the files themselves has hampered the development of biodiversity
informatics. WWW access to such data is critically needed by decision-makers and
scientists both nationally and internationally. This workshop project represents
a strong partnership among the Bishop Museum, the USGS/Biological Resources
Division, the Integrated Taxonomic Information System project, and the digital
libraries and natural history collections communities. Careful planning will be
undertaken by all concerned parties so that the results of the workshop will be
concrete and will further the development of a biodiversity informatics
infrastructure for the U.S., which will in turn be part of a global biodiversity
informatics infrastructure.
