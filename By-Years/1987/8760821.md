In this project, a general approach for the preparation of beta-barium borate
and other similarly growth-constrained crystalline materials is investigated.
The approach is a modification of the Heat Exchanger Method (HEM) of crystal
growth. The modification imposes the necessary process control to crystal growth
from high temperature molten salt solutions. The HEM allows a unique temperature
distribution to be created within an otherwise "ideal" black body, thereby
allowing mass transport from a nutrient zone to a growing crystal interface. The
two independently controlled process variables operative in HEM allow
optimization of the mass transport mechanism. The method allows crystal growth
to proceed without the complications currently encountered in high temperature
solution growth by slow cooling. Beta-barium borate, a non-linear optical
material, transforms to the non-optically active centrosymmetric alpha-phase at
925 degrees Celsius, before melting at 1105 degrees Celsius. The non-reversible
nature of this transformation imposes severe restrictions on the growth method
and precludes single crystal growth directly from the melt.
