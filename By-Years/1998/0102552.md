The principal investigator studies complete aspherical spaces with particular
emphasis on the rigidity of local splitting structures and the minimal volume
problem. Dr. Cao intends to continue his work on Gromov's minimal volume gap
conjecture jointly with his coauthors. Using the F-structure theory developed by
Cheeger and Gromov and the heat flow, he would like to study the minimal volume
gap conjecture for complete aspherical manifolds. The investigator hopes to show
that if a compact nonpositively curved manifold $M$ is homotopy equivalent to a
generalized graph-manifold, then $M$ must be a generalized graph-manifold with
vanishing minimal volume as well. In addition, Cao plans to continue his study
of the sign of the Euler number of compact aspherical manifolds.

This project focuses on the study of global geometric shape of aspherical
spaces. The examples of aspherical spaces include flat tires and surfaces with
more than two holes, such as pretzels. There are also examples of higher
dimensional aspherical spaces. Our universe can be viewed a 3-dimensional
aspherical space. Dr. Cao is trying to investigate diameter, volume, spectrum
and other geometric data of those spaces. Cao has also been interested in the
study of the shortest closed curves on non-positively curved spaces. He has
already shown that two such surfaces with possible cusps are isometric if and
only if the data of lengths of all shortest closed curves on the two surfaces
are identical. The data of lengths of all shortest closed curves on a closed
surface M is called the marked length spectrum of the space M. The study of
marked length spectrum on spaces with boundaries has a number of applications in
modern industry and geological sciences.
