Kavner &lt;br/&gt;0112448 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators plan to
provide an examination of the Earth's core-mantle boundary as an electrochemical
system. They will undertake a series of piston-cylinder experiments designed to
investigate the effect of an electric field on the physical and chemical
behavior at metal-silicate interfaces. Both DC resistance measurements and AC
impedance spectroscopy will be employed to examine the electrical behavior of a
metal-silicate interface, and electron microprobe analysis will record changes
in chemistry for a series of anodic and cathodic electrical loadings of the
interface. These results will be used, in turn, to show how differences in
chemistry and physical properties overlying local areas of the core-mantle
boundary may translate into geophysical and geochemical observables such as
length of day variations, the behavior of the magnetic field dynamo, and
creation of physical and chemical structure in the outer core and lower mantle.
The goal is to extend our understanding of the core-mantle boundary to encompass
electrical and electrochemical behavior at high pressures and temperatures,
examining both electrically-induced chemical partitioning and resultant core-
mantle dynamic coupling.
