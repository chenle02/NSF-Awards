This work will develop a generalized three-dimensional model for the
interaction of normal and strike-slip faults during continental extension. The
relationship between transverse structures (strike-slip faults) and detachment
(normal) faults in southern Nevada will be examined in detail, and a temporal
and structural history will be established. To accomplish this, an integrated
study will be conducted that involves geologic mapping, geochronology, and
seismic reflection profiling across both detachment and strike-slip faults. This
is a collaborative proposal with 9018301 which will concentrate on the seismic
aspects. Three classes of models will be tested: strike-slip faults ar crust-
penetrating, fundamental first order structures and normal faults are secondary;
detachment faults are first-order structures and strike-slip faults are
secondary transfer faults in the shallow crust; and, strike-slip and normal
faults are synchronous and allow extension to occur by the horizontal
translation of crustal blocks. The results of this study will provide
fundamental three-dimensional information on the mechanisms by which continental
crust may extend, and as such have wide-reaching tectonic importance.
