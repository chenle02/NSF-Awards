The purpose of the conference is to bring together academic workers who deal
with fundamental aspects of certain phenomena with industrial workers who are
concerned with certain more practical problems that are impeding progress of
technology. The academics are concerned with such fundamental phenomena as
fractal aspects of reaction rates or energy transport, and energy transport on
the picosecond or femtosecond time scale in simple "model" systems (such as
naphthalene). The industrial people are concerned with such problems as bulk
information storage using optical methods or detection of single molecules, and
with such systems as polymeric films and amorphous materials. This conference,
which will be dominated by discussions on organic materials, will enrich the
basic science activities while laying the groundwork for more rapid
technological progress.
