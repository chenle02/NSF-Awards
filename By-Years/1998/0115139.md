Das&lt;br/&gt;0115139&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As traditional integrated circuit
technology reaches both physical and economic limits, nanotechnology is
increasingly being viewed as an enabling technology to complement the next
generation of electronic devices. The objective of this project is to identify
barrier issues associated with the integration of nonlithographic nanostructure
fabrication technologies and RF integrated circuits. This will be accomplished
through an experimental investigation of the effects of an electrochemical
nanostructure fabrication technique on the performance of an RF transceiver
circuit fabricated using standard CMOS and SiGe technology. The results of this
investigation will help identify technological issues which must be addressed
for the integration of nonlithographic nanostructrues within RF circuit
designs.&lt;br/&gt;
