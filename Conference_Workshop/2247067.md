This award supports the participation of U.S.-based mathematicians in the
international conference ?Harmonic Analysis, Partial Differential Equations, and
Geometric Measure Theory in Bilbao 2023?, to be held at Bizkaia Aretoa, a
conference center in Bilbao, Basque Country, Spain, June 12--16, 2023. The
conference will bring together experts in the subjects of harmonic analysis,
geometric measure theory, and partial differential equations to foster the
exchange of ideas and to disseminate the latest research. The inclusion of
U.S.-based researchers in this event will promote and facilitate the ongoing
engagement of the U.S. research community with its global counterparts.

The conference will focus on recent developments in three areas: harmonic
analysis (including singular integrals, restriction theory, and decoupling
theory), partial differential equations (including boundary value problems,
elliptic and parabolic equations, and dispersive equations), and geometric
measure theory (including rectifiability, fractal and combinatorial geometry,
and area minimizing currents). A particular focus of the event will lie on the
mutual interactions amongst these fields. The conference will especially benefit
early-career researchers, as it will provide ample opportunities for dialogue
and the fostering of new international collaborations and partnerships.
