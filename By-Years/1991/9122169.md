Research will be performed on five topics in computational geometry, a field
concerned with designing efficient algorithms for solving geometric problems.
The first topic includes the problem of finding a way to cut open and unfold a
polyhedron so that it flattens without overlap. The second topic is concerned
with understanding the structure of lines of sight in a cluttered environment.
The third focuses on how to cut up a solid object into as few simple pieces as
possible. The fourth concentrates on reconstruction of (for example) the shape
of a tumor from CAT scans. The final topic includes studying how a robot hand
can grasp securely a complex object. Each topic lends itself to exploration by
undergraduates.
