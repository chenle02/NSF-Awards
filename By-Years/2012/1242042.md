This travel grant supports senior PhD students who are nearing graduation to
take part in a doctoral consortium at the 2012 IEEE Conference on Computer
Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR). The doctoral consortium highlights the
work of these up and coming researchers, and pairs each student with a senior
member of the computer vision community who serves as their mentor. The
mentorship process provides each student with valuable feedback on their
research, as well as meaningful career advice as the students move on to the
next phase of their professional development. The doctoral consortium event aims
to have representation from a diverse group of participants (in terms of gender,
ethnic background, academic institution and geographic location). The travel
grant ensures participation from a broad range of institutions across the
country and gives visibility to a diverse population of students.
