Today, if a user has a question, using Google or Bing, she still has to read
through multiple web pages to find answers. This paradigm is now changing due to
the rise of mobile devices. Over the last decade, it was witnessed that many
systems aim to answer queries directly, e.g., using knowledge graphs collected
from the Internet or through crowdsourcing. A real sea change in information
search is coming! A broad range of new applications are emerging in intelligent
policing, personal assistance, individualized healthcare, legal services,
scientific literature search, and recently robotics. This project will serve
these applications and make fundamental advances in querying heterogeneous
knowledge graphs, which are ubiquitous. It is going to significantly ease query
formulation and improve search quality/speed in these
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the high data heterogeneity in
knowledge graphs, writing structured queries that fully comply with data
specification is extremely hard for ordinary users, while keyword queries can be
too ambiguous to reflect user search intent. The situation becomes even worse
when there are various representations for the same entity or relation. It is
expected that a sophisticated query system shall be able to support different
concept representations without forcing users to use very controlled vocabulary.
It shall provide simple mechanisms to users so that they can quickly come up
with a right query either explicitly or implicitly (e.g., via relevance
feedback). This proposal is going to develop such system, make it user-friendly
and scalable. The proposed research includes a plan to build a flexible query
benchmark that is able to cope with heterogeneous, large-scale knowledge graphs,
as well as user specified configurations and performance metrics. Benchmarks are
indispensable for rapid development of database research. There were many
successful examples of how robust and meaningful benchmarks can greatly expedite
the development of a research area. The query benchmark proposed in this project
is very needed. It is going to (1) provide a standardized way to fairly and
comprehensively evaluate different knowledge graph query algorithms, (2) improve
the understanding of the existing query engines, and (3) advance the area by
getting researchers involved in the same play ground for building better,
faster, and more intelligent methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further
