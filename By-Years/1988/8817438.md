Two approaches are proposed to investigate the structure-function relationships
responsible for ligand binding affinities and catalytic mechanisms of two
different enzymes, T4 bacteriophage dihydrofolate reductase (T4 DHFR) and
citrate synthase (CS). The first will be a crystallographic analysis of the
structures of the enzymes, a comparison of these structures in terms of ligand
affinities and catalytic activity and a further comparison with known structures
of distantly related or mutant forms of the enzymes. The second approach will
involve an investigation of the role of electrostatic fields in these enzymes.
Dihydrofolate reductase catalyzes a reaction in a cyclic pathway essential to
DNA synthesis. In particular, it is highly susceptible to inhibition by
synthetic folate compounds, showing high species selectivity. These compounds
are of considerable interest for the control of rapidly dividing cells. Citrate
synthase catalyzes the condensation of oxaloacetate and acetylCoenzyme A to form
citrate and Coenzyme A. It is one of a few enzymes capable of directly forming a
carbon-carbon bond. It presents an unprecedented opportunity to examine an
unusual mechanism which probably involves sequential conformational changes and
electrostatic destabilization of substrate.***//
