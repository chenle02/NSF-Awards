0003400&lt;br/&gt;Wallace&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a project to
study the Caribbean-South American oblique arc-continent collision zone using
various geologic (mapping, structure), geochemical (Ar-Ar and U-Pb
Geochronology), and seismic (active MCS with onshore/offshore recording using
OBS instruments, passive array) techniques. There will also be a geodynamic
modeling study that, very innovatively, includes the dynamics of crust-mantle
interaction. The overall goal of the project is to understand further the
geometry and chronology of a world class, arc-continent accretion event.
Seosmic/geological cross-sections are to be derived for several transects across
the orogen at different ages of collision. The group of investigators include
highly capable seismologists in both active and passive seismology, as well as
geologists familiar with the orogenic developments on land. The cooperation with
Venezuelan scientists and students is excellent. &lt;br/&gt;***
