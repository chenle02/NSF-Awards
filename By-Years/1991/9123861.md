The objective of the research is to develop, implement and test novel concepts
for improved control of composite materials manufacturing process. Advanced
composite materials manufacturing is expensive, labor intensive and prone to
high part rejection rates. Raw materials costs are only 5 to 15% of the total
manufacturing cost. Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and
model-based control, combined with increased understanding of polymer processing
science and technology, provide a synergistic opportunity to advance the state
of the art in composite manufacturing. A strategy that combines an on-line
process model with experimential processing knowledge will be researched. The
system is intended to be adaptive and adjust the processing conditions to
compensate for changes in raw materials or product requirements. Due to the
difficulty of acquiring the processing knowledge and the volatile nature of this
knowledge, a strategy for constant updating and improvement is also required. To
achieve this, a methodology for capturing control knowledge from past
operational histories of the process is suggested. The result of these
innovations is an intelligent processing strategy that will reduce part
rejection rate and hence the overall manufacturing cost. The concept will be
implemented and tested on a selected process, namely the autoclave curing of
composites.
