The objective of this research is to study the merits of acoustic positron
sensing methods and to assess their usefulness as an absolute positron sensor
for robotic manipulators. Basic methods for inferring distance using an acoustic
source and a detector include measuring: traverse time for pulse from source to
detector (flight time), phase shift between source signal and detected signal,
frequency shift between source and detector if one or both are moving (Doppler
effect), and difference tone. Possible acoustic source types include pulse
trains, constant frequency signals, linearly varied frequency signals, and
pulses of constant or varied frequency. The research will investigate these
source types and measurement methods for the case of mutiple sources mounted on
the manipulator of a robot and multiple detectors in the surrounding
environment. The object is to produce a positron and orientation sensing system
suitable for robot control.
