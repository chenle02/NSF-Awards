In this project, the P.I. will study the vertical transport of momentum by
internal waves through turbulent mixing processes in a region with large mean
vertical shear, using a numerical model. The results will directly address the
mechanism for transporting large shear stresses, which might be generated by
wind at the surface, in a stably stratified and sheared ocean, such as the
equatorial Pacific, in which there is relatively small local dissipation of
mechanical energy. Particular application will be to the P.I.'s extensive data
set from the equatorial Pacific which motivated this study.
