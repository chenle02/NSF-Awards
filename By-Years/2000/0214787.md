This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop a fast density functional (DFT) program for accurate electronic
structure calculations on medium-sized molecules (30-200+ atoms). The proposed
method will have the same accuracy as traditional integral-based DFT codes, but
will be an order of magnitude faster, with the speed-up increasing with system
size. The increased efficiency is particularly important for molecular dynamics
applications. In the Phase I project, the accuracy and speed of the method for
single-point DFT energies will be demonstrated. In a follow on Phase II project,
a fully functioning program will be developed, including gradients (for geometry
optimization and dynamics), second derivatives (for vibrational frequencies),
NMR chemical shifts and other important molecular properties. The code will be
parallelized, integrated into our PQS program and supplied with our
QuantumStation, a combined hardware-software package for running parallel
implementations of the most important methods of quantum chemistry.

The commercial application of this project is in the area of software
development for academic and business community involved in biological and
biomedical research.
