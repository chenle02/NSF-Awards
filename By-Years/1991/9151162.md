All students of Electrical Engineering at University of Evansville take a
required year long Sophomore level lab course sequence in basic electrical
instrumentation. This is a two course lab sequence which parallels the Sophomore
Circuits sequence. The sequence currently consists of a variety of canned
experiments that cover the linear RLC circuit elements and linearized models of
diodes and transistors. Elementary digital and analog ICs are introduced. This
project provides a computer workstation with a spectrum analyzer to support a
major coherent revision in this sequence including the junior level follow on
courses. The equipment requested permits the course to pull together very
diverse topics such as RLC circuit elements, ICs, transducers, frequency
response, diodes, transistors, and amplifiers under a central audio theme.
