The Center for Trustworthy Scientific Cyberinfrastructure (CTSC) will transform
and improve the practice of cybersecurity and hence trustworthiness of NSF
scientific cyberinfrastructure. CTSC will provide readily available
cybersecurity expertise and services, as well as leadership and coordination
across a broad range of NSF scientific cyberinfrastructure projects via a series
of engagements with NSF cyberinfrastructure projects and a broader ongoing
education, outreach and training effort. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
Merit: CTSC will advance the state of cybersecurity practice across the
community by analyzing gaps in cybersecurity technology to provide guidance to
researchers and developers, addressing the application of software assessment to
complicated cyberinfrastructure software stacks, and fostering broadly the
transition of cybersecurity research to practice. Broader Impact: Scientific
computing and confidence in its results relies on trustworthy
cyberinfrastructure. The CTSC mission is to help provide the trustworthy
cyberinfrastructure that science requires across the ecosystem of NSF. CTSC's
work will impact science through dozens of cyberinfrastructure projects over the
project's lifetime. Additionally, CTSC will perform workforce development in the
area of cyberinfrastructure cybersecurity through EOT activities: training,
undergraduate curriculum development, and student education.
