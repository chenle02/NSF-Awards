Central Michigan University is a charter member of a collaboration of 10
institutions that worked together to construct a million dollar, high efficiency
neutron detector for use at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory.
The Modular Neutron Array (MoNA) is a critical instrument in the study of
neutron rich nuclei far from stability. One of the unique aspects of the
collaboration is that many of the members of the collaboration are from
primarily undergraduate institutions and the involvement of undergraduate
students is fundamental goal of the project. In the MoNA collaboration
undergraduate students from Central Michigan University have play integral roles
in the construction and operation of MoNA; they have built detector bars, wired
electronics, written code, sat shifts, and done both on- and off-line data
analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MoNA collaboration has been remarkably
successful at involving undergraduate students in front-line research. This
proposal will permit the PI and his undergraduates from Central Michigan
University to continue to participate in the experimental program. In addition,
the proposal presents a model for not only sustaining the momentum of an active
collaboration based on students and faculty from undergraduate departments, but
also moves the collaboration to more actively involve undergraduates in all the
experimental runs and in data analysis. If these measures are successful, they
will provide a prototype for involving undergraduates in cutting-edge
experimental physics at user facilities.
