The objective of this project is to construct comprehensive medical knowledge
graphs. Such knowledge graphs can satisfy users' growing needs for reliable
medical information, help the effective communication between patients and
doctors, and potentially help reduce the high costs of health care. This project
tackles a series of unique challenges observed in medical domains, and develops
effective approaches that can extract knowledge from the deluge of crowdsourced
data to augment medical knowledge graphs. The proposed research advances the
fields of knowledge graph construction and information trustworthiness analysis
by developing novel methods that mines knowledge from unstructured data in
medical domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates the problem of
medical graph construction from the following perspectives: 1) Effective
approaches are developed to take into account the semantic relations between
medical terms during the extraction of reliable medical facts from noisy answers
on healthcare question and answering websites; 2) A unified framework is
designed to integrate information from heterogeneous data sources in the process
of medical knowledge discovery; 3) The knowledge graph is completed by inferring
new relations based on existing relations between medical terms in the graph.
The proposed research is implemented into a system prototype that displays the
extracted medical facts and the knowledge graph, which benefit online users who
seek medical information. The proposed techniques are used to enhance
educational methodologies. Research results of this project are integrated into
course materials and projects that reinforce student training.
