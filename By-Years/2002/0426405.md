This award provides funding for a workshop to identify the major computational
challenges that must be overcome to enable MPS researchers to address many of
the pressing scientific problems of the next decade. The workshop is cross-
cutting and addresses common as well as discipline-specific cyberinfrastructure
needs. The program of the one-day workshop consists of a morning session with
six invited speakers, followed by break-out groups in the afternoon, and a
plenary session to summarize the workshop's findings in the
evening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
