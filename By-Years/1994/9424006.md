This award provides funds for a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site in
Sociology through SUNY, Stony Brook. The award provides the opportunity for ten
undergraduate students to be immersed into an active research environment
spanning the areas of social organizations across species, stratification,
demography, gender studies, homelessness, the sociology of warfare, and
intensive qualitative analysis. The students will work as apprentices under the
close supervision of faculty mentors and experienced graduate students. The goal
is to introduce students to research utilizing the most current theoretical
models and the latest, state-of-the-art equipment and methodological techniques.
In addition to the research experience, participants will receive academic
counseling and have access to a variety of support services. This award
contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students
into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.
