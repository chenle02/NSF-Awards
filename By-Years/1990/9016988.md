Funding is requested for a mini-super class computer unit which will facilitate
an environment for sophisticated calculations in the areas of biochemistry and
biophysics. The requested equipment, which is comprised of a processor (both
scalar and vector), 64 Mb operation memory and 4Gb disk storage will be put
together with the CONVEX 210 mini-supercomputer systems which was purchased last
year by the Chemistry Department through an NSF grant with a substantial
contribution from the University of Arizona. The new mini-super computer unit
will be shared by the Departments of Biochemistry and Chemistry and will foster
large- scale, biologically related computing. The research studies to be
performed with this computer will include the following areas of activity:
development of quantum chemical ab-initio methods more conducive to the
treatment of molecular systems with up to one hundred electrons; quantum
mechanical studies of elemental biological processes; theoretical modeling of
various physical and chemical properties of biomolecules; determination of
structures and dynamical behavior of a wide range of biologically active
molecules in the gas-phase and in solutions using molecular dynamics and Monte
Carlo simulations; and various experimental interfaces including 2-D and 3-D
NMR.
