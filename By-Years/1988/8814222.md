This project is in the Chemistry of Life Processes Initiative in the Office of
Special Projects in Chemistry. It is jointly supported with the Biochemistry
Program in the BBS Directorate. Advances in genetic engineering technology have
provided the potential for designing novel proteins that offer convenient routes
to the understanding of electron transfer mechanisms. By the use of site-
directed mutagenesis this project will prepare optimized yeast iso-1 cytochrome
c for the study of intramolecular electron-transfer mechanisms via the ruthenium
modification method. The principal criterion for the selection of mutable sites
is that the mutations be non-perturbative (that is each mutation should leave
the system functionally identical with the wild-type system). The investigators
have designed several mutants which will allow them to address the role of
distance, medium, and driving force on long-range electron transfer. The
distance study mutants cover a distance range of 12 to 18 Angstroms and are
located on the protein's N-terminal alpha helix. The pathway mutants contain
either aromatic or sulfur-containing residues in the electron-transfer pathways.
In addition, studies on a double mutant will allow the possibility of through-
bond electron transfer. Full driving force studies on ruthenated cytochromes at
different electron-transfer distances will allow this project to separate
electronic-coupling and nuclear-reorganization contributions to long-range
electron-transfer rates.
