The vertebrate skeleton provides a variety of important functions including
form, strength, flexibility, and protection of vital organs. Establishment of
the complex form of the skeleton requires the coordination of growth with the
differentiation of bone-forming cells and joint-forming cells. Indeed, much is
known about how cells divide and about how relevant cell types differentiate.
However, very little is understood about how these events are coordinated to
give rise to skeletal elements of the correct size and shape. The gap junction
protein Cx43 has been shown to regulate both cell proliferation and joint
formation during zebrafish fin regeneration, revealing that Cx43 coordinates
growth and patterning concomitantly. To determine how Cx43 mediates these
activities, putative target genes were identified using a molecular genetics
approach. Validated Cx43-dependent genes from this list of target genes will be
placed in an ordered pathway of genes acting downstream of Cx43. Thus, it will
be possible to reveal the step-wise molecular pathway(s) regulated by Cx43
during growth and patterning of the fin. The intellectual merit of this proposal
is that mechanistic insights into the establishment of skeletal form and
patterning will be revealed. Validation of the top 50 target genes will be
completed in part during a new inquiry-based laboratory course for
undergraduates. Thus, the broader impacts of this proposal include providing a
large number of students access to the practice of science while also providing
a set of core laboratory skills in Developmental Biology. The intellectual merit
and the broader impacts are fully integrated in this proposal, both advancing
the field of knowledge of skeletal morphogenesis and providing instruction on
how to solve complex biological problems in a laboratory setting.
