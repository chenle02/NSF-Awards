PI: Zolandz Institution: National Academy of Sciences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award, funded jointly by the Divisions of Chemistry and Chemical and Transport
Systems provides core support for the activities of the Board on Chemical
Sciences and Technology (BCST). This body is the locus of chemistry and chemical
engineering expertise within the National Research Council, an institution that
provides independent, technical advice to federal agencies. BCST has broad
representation from industry, academe and non-profit organizations. It will
identify topical studies and bring these to the attention of decision-makers. It
will work with them to obtain funding and technical advice to address these
issues. It responds via peer reviewed consensus reports, workshops, symposia and
broad outreach to the chemical and larger community. This proposal describes a
number of activities to be pursued: 1) Thrice yearly meetings to plan and
oversee studies. 2) Outreach to government agencies and other organizations. 3)
Oversee studies carried out under its authority. 4) Disseminate results of
studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
