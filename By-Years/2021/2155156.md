This project investigates partial differential equations (PDE) that arise in
several areas of pure and applied mathematics. One of the main objectives is the
formal derivation of physical models, whose mathematical description is based on
PDE of nonlocal type, that describe the dynamics of defect lines in crystalline
materials. In a different area, the PI will investigate the qualitative behavior
of solutions to nonlinear elliptic PDE that model segregation phenomena. The
project will fundamentally contribute to these fields by bridging the gap
between mathematical analysis and physics and will enable further mathematical
understanding of physical phenomena. The project provides research training
opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral
researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At a technical level, the objective of this
project is the study of forming interface surfaces through PDE methods. Thematic
areas of focus are: (i) Nonlocal reaction-diffusion equations, where the main
goals are to derive mesoscale and macroscopic scale models describing the
dynamics of defect lines in crystals (dislocations) through the study of the
asymptotic limits of Peierls-Nabarro models and to prove existence of
heteroclinic and multibump orbits for systems of equations driven by fractional
operators; and (ii) Segregation models and nonlinear eigenvalue problems. Here,
the main objective is the analysis of nodal sets of segregated stationary
configurations and their connection with eigenvalue problems for fully nonlinear
operators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
