This research project focuses on the study of discretizations of compact
manifolds in Euclidean space via minimal energy points, with special emphasis on
Riesz energy kernels. Previous work on the discrete equilibrium configurations
for the Riesz s-energy (generalized Thomson problem) showed the utility of
investigating the dependence of behavior on the parameter s. Of particular
interest is the critical value that occurs when s equals the Hausdorff dimension
of the manifold and a transition occurs from long range to short range
interactions. This project will investigate: (i) finer asymptotics for the
minimal energy and its connection with the curvature and smoothness properties
of the manifold; (ii) for dimensions 2, 8, and 24, the determination (or
estimation) of constants arising in the minimal energy expansion in terms of the
zeta functions in s for special lattices existing in these dimensions; (iii)
asymptotic results for energy on self-similar sets; (iv) the behavior of "greedy
energy points," especially in the presence of an external field; (v) the
determination of the limiting support of discrete long range minimal energy
configurations on surfaces of revolution; and (vi) development and analysis of
algorithms for the fast generation of uniformly distributed points on manifolds.

This research project focuses on the mathematics of how charged particles on a
curved surface arrange themselves in a stable configuration when interacting
through two-particle repulsive interactions. This study of the ordering of
matter will broaden the understanding of the physics of membranes and films and
has applications to the design of new materials with novel optical and
electronic properties. A related aspect of the project is the rapid generation
of data sampling points on curved surfaces (such as the earth) which can be used
to measure a variety of physical properties. Such methods for point generation
are also useful for testing detection devices such as radar systems. This
research addresses in several different contexts the fundamental problem of how
best to convert from analog to digital.
