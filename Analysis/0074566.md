ABSTRACT

The primary focus of this project is the study of a variety of mathematical
problems in quantum computation and information theory. Although building
quantum computers remains a formidable experimental challenge, they have the
potential to efficiently handle problems whose computational complexity puts
them beyond the scope of classical digital computers. Some aspects of this
proposal, such as error correction and the exploration of multi-bit gates, are
directly related to quantum computation. However, the main emphasis is on
problems in the related area of quantum communication, particularly channel
capacity, optimal encoding and decoding schemes and classification of
entanglement. The P.I.'s past work on the analysis of multi-particle systems in
strong magnetic fields, the properties of quantum-mechanical entropy, and maps
on operator algebras provides a strong starting point for developing new
mathematical tools needed to deal with these challenging issues.

The possibility of using quantum computers to efficiently factoring large
numbers, is a potential threat to the security of existing cryptographic
protocols. Fortunately, using quantum particles for communication, which is more
feasible experimentally, offers new mechanisms for distributing cryptographic
keys as well as encoding messages and transmitting information. These include
both procedures based on the transmission of quantum particles for encoding and
sending information; and innovative new protocols, based on a quantum phenomenon
known as entanglement, involving particles at distant sites augmented by some
classical communication. As with classical communication, one must be prepared
to deal with noisy channels and much of this proposal deals with the mathematics
of noisy channels. Some of this work has direct implications for experimental
design, since it is important to know how to best allocate resources and choose
coding schemes to minimize the effects of noise.
