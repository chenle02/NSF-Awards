Non-intrusive fluid velocity measurement allows the velocity of a fluid to be
measured without disturbing the flow field. The laser Doppler velocimeter
expands the capability of the existing flow measuring instrumentation at Oregon
Tech. This laser-based measuring system is used by industry to measure the flow
of fluids in the vicinity of rotating machinery and in wind tunnels, and will be
used in a similar way at Oregon Tech. The laser Doppler velocimeter will be used
in exercises involving, but not limited to, measurements in water and air, in
wind tunnels and between rotating fan blades. The use of the laser Doppler
velocimeter in our courses will enrich the experience of each student. The
instrumentation will be used by at least 100 students per year.
