In discrete mathematics, a graph is a set of points, some of which may be joined
by lines. Graphs are useful models for chemical structures, electrical grids,
the internet, transportation maps, and many other objects -- anything that can
be viewed as a network is, abstractly, a graph. Real world problems involving
such networks benefit from the theorems, algorithms, and insight of graph
theory. The PI is most interested in graph problems involving structure,
coloring, and related notions -- especially problems which connect coloring and
structure. This project in particular focuses on four sub-projects involving
immersion, edge-coloring, and flows.

The first two sub-projects are both motivated by an immersion-analog of
Hadwiger's Conjecture (the Abu-Khzam--Langston Conjecture), which links coloring
and immersion. One sub-project seeks to find exact structural characterizations
of graphs without specific immersions; the other seeks to better understand how
immersions (and colorings) are affected when creating new graphs from old. A
second conjecture involving coloring and structure that interests the PI greatly
is the Goldberg-Seymour Conjecture on chromatic index. The PI plans to work to
improve the method of Tashkinov trees -- the dominant technique used for
approximation results towards the conjecture. The final sub-project concerns
flows, and is somewhat different in flavor (although flows and colorings are
certainly related notions). Here, the objects of interest are 3-flows with large
support, and the backdrop is Tutte's famous 3-Flow Conjecture.
