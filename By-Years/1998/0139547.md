This award supports a collaborative research project between Professor Steven
Stephenson of Fairmont State College and Dr. Ceridwen Pearce of the Australian
Tropical Mycology Research Centre in Kuranda, Australia. The project will assess
the biodiversity and ecology (including patterns of distribution, relative
abundance, host/substrate associations, and interactions of different groups) of
mycetozoans associated with litter microhabitats of tropical forests in northern
Australia. Comparison of results with data from forests in the Northern
Hemisphere will enrich our understanding of this little understood group of
organisms. This project will benefit from the expertise and facilities of both
the U.S. and Australian institutions, and will include the active participation
of American students in the international collaboration.
