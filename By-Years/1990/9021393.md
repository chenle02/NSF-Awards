Prior research has found testosterone related to individual differences in
aggression, dominance, and criminal violence. This research will gather detailed
information on testosterone and antisocial behavior in delinquent and normal
populations. It will also test a biosocial model that predicts antisocial
behavior as a joint function of high testosterone and low social control.
Antisocial behavior ranges in severity from unfriendly facial expressions to
unstable personal relationships to criminal violence. All these behaviors are
correlated with testosterone, but the correlations are low, and large numbers of
subjects are needed to have enough statistical power to determine their exact
size. Other factors are needed to explain why high testosterone individuals are
not always violent. The model proposed here treats social control forces,
embodied in attachment to family and community, as restraining the more violent
effects of testosterone. Most high testosterone individuals engage in mild
antisocial behavior, especially when frustrated or challenged, but are violent
only when social controls are weak. The testosterone-violence correlation should
be strongest when social control is weakest, as when subjects do not identify
with family and community or when they are young, mentally incompetent, or under
the influence of drugs or alcohol. The research will employ salivary
testosterone measurements and behavioral observations of prison inmates, college
students, military veterans, children, and alcoholics. The findings will help to
specify exactly what antisocial behaviors are related to testosterone, how
strong the relationship is, and what other factors serve to increase or decrease
the size of the relationship.
