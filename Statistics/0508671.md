This project provides funds to partially support a research conference focusing
on several related important topics in nonparametric inference and probability,
with applications to science. The conference is planned to be held in Ann Arbor
at the University of Michigan, September 10-11, 2005. It will highlight
challenges and developments in biased sampling and missing data, shape-
restricted inference, contemporary sequential analysis, and modern nonparametric
inference, probability, and statistics in biology and physical sciences.

Statistical inference, the science of learning from data, has always had an
interdisciplinary focus, and as statistics and related areas of application
evolve and move forward, there is an ongoing need to share developments and new
ideas across related disciplines. This conference at the interface of statistics
and the sciences will promote this transfer of knowledge allowing researchers in
these related fields to share ideas and learn from one another. The conference
will also have broader impacts, allowing young and leading researchers to
interact and exchange ideas, promoting collaboration, broadening the scope of
applications, and contributing to further developments in these areas.
