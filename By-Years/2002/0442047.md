This project will develop radical polymerization-based techniques for
amplification of biomolecular recognition events, specifically olignucleotide
hybridization, such that detection of these events will be more facile, highly
parallel, feasible at reduced event threshold concentrations, and detectable
with an inexpensive detector. Radical polymerizations afford a unique
opportunity to amplify biomolecular recognition events since each initiation
event leads to the polymerization of a large number of vinyl groups. When
initiation is, in space or time, coupled to the oligonucleotide recognition
event, polymerization of highly absorptive moieties provide means for
amplification and subsequent detection by absorption, enabling the design of a
simple, portable detector. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is supported jointly
by the NSF and the Intelligence Community. The Approaches to Combat Terrorism
Program in the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences supports new
concepts in basic research and workforce development with the potential to
contribute to national security.
