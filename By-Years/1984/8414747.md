This research project improves an engineering understanding of the tsunami
damage by verifying tsunami predictive models and estimating the possible
effects of tsunamis along the coast of Alaska and Canada (Northern Pacific
Coastal region). These areas have been known to be prone to large earthquakes
and subsequent tsunamis. This study provides a systematic approach to understand
the tsunami runup characteristics for the most densely populated regions near
the Gulf of Alaska which are within the reach of a possible tsunami. A time-
dependent, two-dimensional numerical model will be developed to study the
generation and propagation of a tsunami from a major earthquake offshore of
Alaska. The results will then be verified based on actual tsunami data in this
region which are available from the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center (ATWC) and
from the Institute of Ocean Sciences in Sidney, B.C., and the data on deep sea
measurements of the region from the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory
(PMEL) in Seattle.
