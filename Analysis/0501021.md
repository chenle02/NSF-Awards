Divergence-measure fields and nonlinear conservation laws Abstract of proposed
research Monica Torres

In this project, the principal investigator will study divergence-measure
fields; that is, vector fields whose divergence is a Radon measure, and their
applications to nonlinear conservation laws. Even though divergence-measure
fields can be interesting solely from the analytical point of view, the main
motivation to study them is to advance our understanding of entropy solutions
for nonlinear conservation laws. It was proven by Glimm that the one-dimensional
system of strictly hyperbolic conservation laws has a global entropy solution in
the space of functions of bounded variation, assuming that the initial data has
sufficiently small total variation. However, when the initial data is large or
the system is not strictly hyperbolic (especially for the multidimensional
case), then the solution u is generally a signed Radon measure or a
L^p-function. Understanding more properties of divergence-measure fields will
advance our understanding of entropy solutions for nonlinear conservation laws.

Divergence-measure fields have been studied by authors including Ambrosio,
Anzellotti, Chen-Frid, Chen-Torres and Ziemer. However, there are still many
open questions concerning their analysis, especially for the case of unbounded
vector fields. Thus, the principal investigator will study analytical properties
of divergence-measure fields including normal traces and Gauss-Green formulas
for unbounded divergence-measure fields, over sets of finite perimeter. The
principal investigator will also apply the theory of divergence-measure fields
to the development of a general framework for the Cauchy flux over oriented
surfaces that are boundaries of sets of finite perimeter. This very general
framework will allow to capture measure-valued production density in the
formulation of the balance law and entropy dissipation for entropy solutions of
hyperbolic conservation laws. The study of multidimensional conservation laws,
both scalar equations and systems, is currently the subject of significant
research effort. The investigation of hyperbolic systems in many dimensions (and
even in the one-dimensional case) is motivating the search for new analytical
tools that could bring some insight to these difficult equations. The principal
investigator intends to use geometric measure theory techniques to study certain
hyperbolic conservation laws.
