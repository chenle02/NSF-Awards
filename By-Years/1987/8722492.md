Dr. McGovern and his colleagues will conduct archaeological excavation at the
large and deeply stratified farm midden site of Svalbard, Iceland. Preliminary
work in 1987 indicated that organic preservation is excellent and the skeletal
remains from a number of species (food remains) are present. In the summer of
1988, the team will conduct extensive stratigraphic excavation at Svalbard to
establish the chronology of the main deposit using artifacts, tephera and
radiocarbon dating. They will collect animal bone, artifacts, pollen macrofloral
and micorfaunal remains with two goals in mind: to reconstruct changing
environment over time and to document the inhabitant's response to it. Between
800 - 1000 AD Viking-age Scandinavian populations spread into the islands of the
North Atlantic taking with them a well- developed seafaring tradition and a
subsistence economy based upon domestic animals and some cereals. As they moved
into new regions they adapted this to include wild resources which were readily
available. Archaeology in Iceland can shed light on this adaptive process and is
especially interesting because it provides insight into how human populations
cope in marginal environments. Beginning ca. 1250 AD a significant climatic
cooling known as the "Little Ice Age" (LIA) began. This affected the Viking
colonies and placed great stress on local populations. The Svalbard site is
particularly interesting because it documents this period and the data which Dr.
McGovern recovers will provide insight into how human populations adapt to
severe climatic stress. Because faunal and floral material is so well preserved
detailed subsistence reconstruction will be possible.
