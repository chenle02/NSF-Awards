Modeling studies will be performed to plan new drilling for the next generation
of cross-hole and single well in situ hydrologic tests in overpressured
accretionary complexes. Planning for future drilling and hydrologic tests must
address two concerns. The first concern is that formation conditions during
previous tests were clearly disturbed but the extent of disturbance and
implications for the test results are poorly understood. The second concern is
the possibility that future tests may interfere with long-term monitoring
efforts by perturbing the in situ conditions. Two types of models will be used
to address the important questions. Using consolidation models, changes in
physical properties around boreholes when the formation is open to hydrostatic
conditions during extended periods will be examined. Using pore pressure and
solute transport models, different single and two well test scenarios will be
used to design optimal tests and assess their effect on long-term monitoring.
