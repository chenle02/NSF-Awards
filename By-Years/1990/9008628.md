In spite of the wide variety of synchronization problems and their broad-ranging
solutions, some fundamental questions regarding the nature and classification of
synchronization have remained unanswered. Led by the observation that any
synchronization necessarily involves some kind of arbitration among the
participating processes. The notion of the "rank" of a process that serves as
the basis for arbitration has been formulated, and an underlying mechanism,
called the "ranker", that computes the ranks for the processes has been
identified. In order to carry out any kind of arbitration, the ranks that are
computed by the ranker module should satisfy certain requirements. By
identifying these properties, four different specifications are obtained for the
ranker module; these four rankers form a hierarchy. Based on the correspondence
between a synchronization problem and the weakest ranker that can be used to
solve it, a classificiation of synchronization problems is obtained. This
classification subsumes the other classification proposed in the literature. The
problem of implementing rankers on various architectures will be considered and
the project intends to devise algorithms for translating programs across
different architectures.
