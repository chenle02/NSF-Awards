The aim of this project is to incorporate atomic absorption spectrophotometry
(AA) into undergraduate science and engineering curricula at Tri-State
University. An AA system will be used jointly by chemistry, biology, and
engineering programs to improve instrumentation- based laboratory instruction
and to provide students with the experimental capabilities afforded by modern
instrumentation. The equipment will provide analytical capability and training
in several interrelated areas: 1. Students in chemistry, chemical engineering,
materials science, metallurgy, biology, and toxicology will have experience with
AA, including theory, instrumental design, operation, and analytical
applications. 2. Biology students will use the extended capabilities provided by
AA to analyze heavy metals in tissues and in environmental samples. 3. Student
projects and research in water quality in the northeastern Indiana lakes region
will be expanded to include trace element analysis, thus adding considerably to
the scope of information obtained.
