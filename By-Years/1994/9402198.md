9402198 BOYLE With an increase in the number of laboratories throughout the
world making good Cd measurements, it is anticipated that there will be a rapid
expansion of available global Cd database in which to evaluate the role of
chemical changes in the changing atmospheric CO2 and the influence of ocean
circulation on global climate change. This research project will concentrate on
some particular issues within this global scale context. Specially, it will (1)
Establish how rapidly deep ocean chemical composition can change by studying
foraminiferal trace elements in high deposition rate cores, single individuals
(to search for "modes" of deepwater chemistry, and most importantly, deep sea
corals) which should allow for a very high resolution view of deepwater
chemistry; (2) Examine the origins of differences between 13C, Cd and Ba
paleochemical signals from detailed studies of Northwest Pacific cores and
through simple ocean geochemical models; (3) Continue to generate long high
resolution paleochemical records from key basins of the world oceans in order to
explore the spectral links between deep ocean chemistry, atmospheric PCO2, and
global climate; and (4) Continue testing of forminiferal accuracy as
paleochemical reorders by studying core tops from diverse environments,
individual benthic specimens from high sedimentation rate cores, and comparing
different calcitic and aragonitic benthic species and deep sea corals.
