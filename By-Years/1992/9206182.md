This project explores a new hypothesis for explaining the patterns of mating in
pelagically-spawning marine fish. The hypothesis states that spawning sites and
times are selected to improve fertilization rates. In general, spawning periods
represent critical times for production and vulnerable times for harvesting. It
is important to know more about their causal basis. In the bluehead wrasse,
Thalassoma bifasciatu, Dr. Petersen and colleagues found that the timing of
mating varies dramatically between local populations, the mean fertilization
rates were surprisingly low and appeared to be influenced by turbulence and
location on the reef, and the number of sperm released by males correlated
significantly with the size and fecundity of the female with whom they are
mating. This project will conduct three interrelated investigations: (1)
determine timing of mating by examining the relationships between several
measures of water movement and the time of spawning on reefs with different
schedules; (2) locate mating sites that facilitate fertilization, egg transport
off the reef, or both; and (3) investigate fertilization dynamics by examining
how the number of eggs fertilized varies with the number of sperm released by
the male, which generates specific predictions of how males should allocate
sperm among spawns.
