The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is the creation of a faster, more portable,
affordable and reliable blood typing and red blood cell concentration test. This
is important because trauma centers and hospitals rely extensively on blood
donations provided by blood banks across the U.S. to save lives. There are
currently 84 million blood typings per year in the U.S., with approximately 16
million donations annually. Processing costs approach $200 per pint of blood, so
the ability to pre-screen donors by blood type and selectively direct the
donation process (i.e. plasma, red cells) would result in significant savings
and bolster our declining blood supply. This portable technology could also be
translated to remote geographical locations for disaster relief applications.
This blood analysis microdevice will enhance scientific and technological
understanding by exploring the use of electric fields to identify cell
differences. In addition, the potential initial economic impact is expected to
be up to $12 million per year, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness
in healthcare including trauma, blood therapies, and surgeries.

The proposed project will play a key role in miniaturizing the bulky supporting
power supply infrastructure currently surrounding microfluidic device
operations. The proposed project will translate optical analysis of cell
responses into a pattern algorithm that outputs the result via a user-friendly
interface. Lastly, this project will combine two separate microfluidic devices
into a single prototype interfacing with the portable power supply and algorithm
to simultaneously discern blood type and hematocrit. This work advances
scientific knowledge and will be published after securing proper IP. It is also
a powerful alternative to expensive antigen/antibody molecular recognition
reactions for medical diagnosis for future point of care diagnostic
applications.
