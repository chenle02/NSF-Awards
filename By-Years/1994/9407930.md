9407930 Neuhauser San Francisco State University and the Direct Detection group
at Berkeley are beginning a project to investigate the use of superconducting
tunnel junction (STJ) arrays as phonon spectrometers for the detection of weakly
interacting dark matter particle candidates. The STJ arrays will be fabricated
in the Thin Film Laboratory at SFSU, and initial testing will be done in a 300
mK cryostat at SFSU. Recently an opportunity has arisen to make use of an
adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator (ADR) at Berkeley for testing the
devices. The availability of this cryostat will enable "proof of principle"
experiments on small samples at 80 mK, closer to the 20 mK temperature planned
for operation of the detectors. The ADR will be instrumented with an
experimental stage and cryogenic preamplifiers for initial device tests during
this award period. ***
