Objective:&lt;br/&gt;To support participation of students and young
professionals in science and engineering at the 2013 OSA Advanced Solid-State
Lasers (ASSL) meeting which will be held in Paris, France, October 27-November
1, 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;Topical meetings of
the Optical Society of America provide the occasion, the environment, and the
reinforcement necessary to nurture evolving science and technologies. The
proposed effort is to support the Materials Division of the ASSL meeting through
funding of students and young professionals in science and engineering. The
meeting encompasses advances in materials science, condensed matter physics, and
chemistry relevant to the development, characterization and new optical
applications. Presentations will address bulk crystals, glasses and ceramics,
micro-structured materials such as optical fibers, planar waveguides, and
periodically patterned non-linear crystals. The interdisciplinary nature of the
meeting will provide cross fertilization of concepts and techniques between
these fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;The ASSL meeting
aims to bring together international researchers from academia, government and
industry to present and assess the current state-of-the-art of solid state
lasers. The meeting will help to advance the field through sharing of results,
methods, inspiring of new ideas, and initiation of new collaborations.
Participation of students and young professionals in science and engineering
will be fostered based on NSF funds to partially cover travel expenses. A
technical digest will be available in both printed and CD-ROM format and will
contain general program information, abstracts of the paper summaries, and the
3-page summaries of all papers presented during the meeting.
