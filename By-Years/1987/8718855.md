As part of the Foundation's initiative to strengthen research environments in
primarily undergraduate institutions, the Division of Networking and
Communications Science and Infrastructure considers proposals to defray CSNET
dues and operating expenses under the research instrumentation category of the
Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) Program. Worcester Polytechnic
Institute has met CSNET membership requirements and demonstrates a genuine need
for network access. Initially, at least eight faculty members will use the CSNET
services. The benefits from network communication will be significant and
institutional commitment to future network use is evident.
