Linear-type Pulsed Laser Time-of-Flight Atom Probe FIM is a mass and ion
kinetic energy analyzer with sensitivity to detect single ions. It can be used
for the chemical analysis of solid surfaces, atomic layer by atomic layer, and
can also be used to measure ion kinetic energy distributions. It has a
resolution of 1 to 2 parts in 100,000 and a time resolution of better than 20 fs
in ion reaction rate measurements. It has been used for atomic scale surface and
interface compositional analysis of various materials, and to study atomic and
cluster ion formation in stimulated desorptions, gas-surface interactions, and
ion reactions, etc. It is a unique prototype system.
