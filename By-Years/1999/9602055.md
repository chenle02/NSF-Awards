This research extends traditional public goods theory by examining the
connectivity and communality properties of communication and information-based
public goods. The study is a longitudinal examination of a communication and
information-based public good, specifically, a large interorganizational
computer-supported collaborative work system. The type of collective action
involved in providing communication and information public goods is theorized to
possess two properties that are uniquely important to communication forms of
collective goods: connectivity and communality. A synthesis of the economic
theories of contribution games and the sociological framework offered by Marwell
and Oliver provides a model that considers both individual actors' rational
motivations as well as their socially constrained and informed behavior. The
research is designed to test multivariate, dynamic hypotheses that link
collective action theory, communication and information systems, and
collaborative work processes and effects.
