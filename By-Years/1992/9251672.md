Computing has experienced two major paradigm shifts in the past 25 years: from
batch computing to time-shared computing and from time-shared computing to
personal computer and workstation computing. A third paradigm shift, probably as
significant as the first two--the exploitation of three-dimensional
visualization, visual programming, and multimedia--will be next.In this project,
Brown University plans to continue to exert leadership in teaching and research
by being at the forefront of efforts to make this latest paradigm accessible and
useful to all. The project involves equipping the electronic classroom with the
latest generation of workstations with three-dimensional graphics and multimedia
capabilities, developing the necessary educational software to exploit the
capabilities of this new generation, and exporting both the software and the
educational materials developed with it to other institutions.The work is both a
continuation and a significant extension of the past and current efforts at
Brown. The current research efforts in graphics, programming environments, and
program visualization will be used as a foundation for the new tools, migrating
research software into the instructional environment. The curriculum will be
upgraded and, where necessary, revised to introduce advanced concepts in the
introductory courses and to reinforce these concepts in the latter courses.
