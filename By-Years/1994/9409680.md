9409680 Johnson This is an Engineering Research Deployment Teaching Initiative
award. Under this award, a service course will be developed to teach asymptotic
methods for approximate process models. The course and text will be aimed at
advanced students who are specializing in the area of deformation processing.
Over the last several years, several new approximate models for sheet rolling,
extrusion, coating flows, etc. have been developed using asymptotic methods. The
goal of this activity is to introduce these methods into engineering curricula,
educate engineers in their use, and provide a monograph that will cover the
recent developments. This project should enable advanced modelling methods to be
introduced into engineering curricula, improving the education of engineers in
an important area of manufacturing.
