9706711 Batiza This award provides partial funding for the support of a
laboratory manager of the University of Hawaii ICP-MS (inductively-coupled
plasma-mass spectrometer) facility in the School of Ocean and Earth Sciences and
Technology. The ICP-MS laboratory provides analyses of solid silicate and
carbonate samples, as well as of ocean and other fluid samples for a number of
research and teaching groups at the University. A new ICP-MS instrument was
recently installed, and this award is intended to provide partial support for
the technical operation of the laboratory for a limited period of 18 months
until the University of Hawaii will be able to provide support from its own
resources. ***
