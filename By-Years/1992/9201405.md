Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) are a highly sophisticated and increasingly
popular type of material handling device in flexible manufacturing systems.
Previous technology dictated movement of AGVs on a track embedded in the floor
or on a painted chemical strip. The increasing popularity of flexible, free-
ranging AGVs has brought with it a host of research issues related to effective
traffic control schemes and conflict-free routing strategies for different
demand assignments. The focus of this project will be on the development of
effective methodologies for real-time control of free-ranging AGVs. This
research will extend previous work on conflict-free routes for AGVs by testing a
variety of column-generation schemes and assignment rules in the free-ranging
environment. Alternate objective functions for the static problem and the
feasibility of new approaches for real-time routing of AGVs will be tested with
the aid of a factorial-designed simulation experiment. The experiment will be
conducted in both job-shop and cellular manufacturing environments based on the
layout of a very large manufacturing facility in Western New York. //
