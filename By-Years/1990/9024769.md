This project continues the studies of turbulence undertaken previously,
combining mathematical analysis, numerical simulations, and methods from
dynamical systems. The turbulent flows arise as solutions of the Navier-Stokes
equations. The permanent regime for a turbulent flow is related to an attractor
in the phase space of the flow. The attractor in turn is approximable by an
approximate inertial manifold. Hence development of numerical algorithms that
correspond to approximate inertial manifolds is a central theme of the work.
Turbulence is a fundamental phenomenon in fluid flows. Such flows arise in
describing the behavior of planes, boats, pumps, and engines. A better
understanding of turbulence will help to improve the design of these machines.
