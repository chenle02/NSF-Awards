This RUI activity focuses on two projects. The first project uses a laser-
cooling and trapping system for the measurement of metastable lifetimes in
magneto-optically trapped krypton and argon, using a method of photon counting
and metastable-state quenching to determine the single-atom spontaneous decay
rate to a few percent. The second project builds on an earlier discovery and
characterization of one-dimensional spatiotemporal patterns in a novel
dielectric-barrier discharge (DBD) system, a class of high-voltage, ac-driven
gaseous discharges that typically operate in the atmospheric pressure range and
produce reactive chemical species and intense excimer fluorescence. This pattern
formation is of basic interest in the field of non-linear dynamics and may hold
promise in various diagnostic and/or control schemes in DBD applications.
