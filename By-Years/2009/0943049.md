This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). This project is a two-phase theory-based study of virtual
organizations that enable massive virtual collaboration in scientific research.
The virtual organizations to be studied have a core of scientists and project
leaders coordinating the work of a larger number of volunteer contributors, a
format sometimes called citizen science. The project is directed at advancing
the understanding of what constitutes effective citizen science virtual
organizations and under what conditions citizen science virtual organizations
can enable and enhance scientific and education production and innovation.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study is theoretically grounded in small group theory
and rooted empirically in a survey of and case studies in citizen science
projects. The survey will be used to develop a typology of citizen science
projects, thus illuminating the important dimensions of this form. The case
studies will identify key lever points in work design for enabling citizen
science virtual organizations to involve distributed, diverse volunteers in
producing large-scale, high quality, valued scientific research in an
organizationally sustainable fashion. Findings from the study will be shared and
validated with citizen science practitioners in a workshop.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader importance of the research is that it will
indicate opportunities for employing citizen science in scientific research,
which could lead to novel implementations of citizen science in other areas of
scientific and engineering research and education. Results will aid scientists
and project leaders in identifying appropriate project structures and best
practices to employ when revising current citizen science projects or launching
new ones.
