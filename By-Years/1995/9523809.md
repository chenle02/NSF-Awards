9523809 Irani This research focuses on the development of hybrid shop floor
layout based on cellular manufacturing concept. Hybrid layout refers to a layout
with both dedicated and shared machine cells. In cellular manufacturing, parts
and machines are formed into clusters. Parts in the same cluster constitute a
family. The machines in a cluster are formed into a machine cell. A machine cell
is dedicated to the processing of parts in the same part-machine cluster. The
aim is to form cells that are independent and having no intercell material flow.
This approach differs from the traditional method, which emphasized independent
cells for all part families, by developing a functional cell, for machines
shared by multiple parts families, and placing machines, that are not shared by
multiple parts families, into dedicated cells. Hybrid layouts will be developed
based on the use of an heuristic algorithm for machine-part matrix clustering.
The algorithm will integrate a number of search strategies including string
matching and tabu search. The subsequent layout will be tested using simulation.
In addition, scheduling rules for machine and material handling will be
developed to support the simulation analysis. The suitability of VLSI CAD
algorithms for generating these hybrid layouts also will be investigated, and
industrial data will be used to validate these layout methodologies. The project
presents a different perspective or look at the cellular machine layout problem.
In the traditional cellular layout problem, creation of independent machine
cells with shared machines duplicated over multiple cells is the norm. This
research advocates the creation of a functional cell for shared machines instead
of machine duplication. The results of the research may make it easier to create
virtual machining cells to support such modern production concept as agile or
lean manufacturing. Improved material handling systems planning and control are
critical to the competitiveness of our nation's economic system. The outcome of
this research will increase use of material handling and layout systems
planning, design, and control algorithms. This will enhance material flow and
will improve production time on the shop floor.
