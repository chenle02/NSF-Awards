9403196 Banyaga The research covers several topics in symplectic and contact
geometry which revolve around the method of the momentum mapping and foliations.
It is intended to study analogs of Klein's Erlanger Program in contact geometry
and the relationship of the latter to instanton theory arising in mathematical
physics. ***
