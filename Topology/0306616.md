Many problems in "higher dimensional" topology have been reformulated in terms
of one or more of the following theories: homotopy theory; algebraic K-theory;
surgery L-theory; stable pseudoisotopy theory. In an effort to better understand
the latter three theories, Jones (in collaboration with F.T. Farrell) has
formulated an "Isomorphism Conjecture" for each of these three theories. For
example, the Isomorphism Conjecture for algebraic K-theory gives a simple recipe
for computing the algebraic K-groups for the integral group ring of a group G in
terms of the algebraic K-groups for the integral group rings of all the
infracyclic subgroups of G. (A group is "infracyclic" if it is a finite
extension of a cyclic group.) Quite a bit is know about the algebraic K-groups
for integral group rings of infracyclic groups; so the truth of the preceeding
conjecture would help considerably in understanding the algebraic K-theory of
all integral group rings. As part of this proposal, Jones intends to continue
working towards verifying the Isomorphism Conjecture for algebraic K-theory of
the integral group ring of G, under the condition that the group G acts
properly, discontinuously by isometries on a complete, Riemannian manifold which
has non-positive sectional curvature values everywhere.

Mathematicians study the structure of spaces by trying to find the "genetic
code" for each space. The "genetic code" for a space usually comes in the form
of an algebraic gadget associated to the space; typically there is a simple
recipe for constructing the algebraic gadget from the space. The hope is that
two spaces having equal or congruent "genetic codes" should be equal or
congruent as spaces. One of the first algebraic gadgets to be associated to a
space is called the "fundamental group" of the space. The French mathematician
Henri Poincare introduced this idea about a 100 years ago. The fundamental group
of a space is certainly an important ingredient in its "genetic code", but there
are examples of many different spaces which have the same fundamental group; in
these cases the fundamental group is not a complete "genetic code" for the
space. About 50 years ago the mathematician Armand Borel (of the Institute for
Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.) conjectured that for an important class of
spaces (called "aspherical spaces") the fundamental group does give the complete
"genetic code" for the space; that is, two aspherical spaces with the same
fundamental group are forced to be the same space. Jones has made some progress
towards proving Borel's Conjecture, and will continue his work in that
direction.
