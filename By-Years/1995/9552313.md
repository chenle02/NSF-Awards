ILI - IP Life Sciences Title: The Lux Genes: A New Light on Introductory Biology
Laboratories This project enhances and modernizes General Biology labs for three
courses by allowing the permanent establishment of a series of molecular biology
experiments that have been conducted on a trial basis for the past 2 years.
Students from science and nonscience curricula have been conducting exercises to
learn more about genes and their expression through the genetic transformation
of E. coli with plasmids containing the genes that are responsible for
bioluminescence. When transformed colonies are observed in a darkened room,
their bioluminescent glow elicits "wows" and "oohs" from observers, adding to
the excitement associated with learning about new biotechnologies. Each year the
project affects approximately 2500 college students including 150-200 preservice
teachers. Additionally, each year 48 precollege students (grades 8-12) and their
science teachers are exposed to the aforementioned experiments. Through this
project, sufficient equipment is funded to continue the current transformation
experiment and to reduce team sizes such that all students are able to get
"hands-on" experience. In addition, implementation of additional exercises in
restriction endonuclease digestion, gel electrophoresis, and gene regulation is
possible.
