Hemichordates are a group of marine invertebrates comprising over 100 species of
solitary and colonial wormlike creatures. Hemichordates have figured prominently
in hypotheses of the evolutionary origins of chordates because they are
relatively primitive relatives of vertebrate animals. Because of their
primitiveness, hemichordates also provide a key comparison group to understand
the evolution of key innovations of vertebrates, such as gill slits and a hollow
nerve chord. However, hemichordates have not been studied in depth, and
evolutionary relationships within the group are not well understood. The
proposed work will use genomic approaches to identify genes that will elucidate
evolutionary relationships among the hemichordates and clarify the evolutionary
history of the vertebrates in a broader sense. Results of this research will
provide a greater understanding of cellular, genetic, and developmental programs
that were likely present in the ancestral lineage that led to chordates and have
been evolutionarily conserved during vertebrate evolutionary history.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding hemichordate evolution is central to
research in fields ranging from neurobiology to developmental biology to
physiology, and the results of this research will be of wide interest to many
fields of science. The project will support training of students at various
levels from K-12 to graduate school. Undergraduates, including members of
underrepresented groups, will participate in the project through courses on the
campuses of Auburn University, the University of Washington, and the Friday
Harbor marine laboratories. The research will be publicized through talks to
public schools, web-based outlets, and introductory biology textbooks.
