This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes to develop
technology for joining metallic and ceramic components; this is a reactive
joining process that uses reactive multilayer foils as local heat sources for
melting solders. These foils are a new class of nano-engineered materials, in
which self-propagating exothermic reactions can be initiated at room temperature
using a hot filament or laser. By inserting a multilayer foil between two solder
layers and two components, heat generated by the reaction in the foil melts the
solder and consequently bonds the components. This new method of soldering
eliminates the need for a furnace or protective atmospheres and, with very
localized heating, avoids thermal damage to the components. The reactive bonding
process is far more rapid than most competing technologies, and results in
strong and cost-effective joints. The last and potentially most important
benefit is the fact that joining with multilayer foils enables the use of lead
free solders and therefore offers tremendous environmental benefits. The broader
impacts that could result from this project could be to microelectronic
packaging facilities.
