ABSTRACT CTS-9523579 A proof-of-concept study is proposed for a new approach to
predict cavitation and outgassing in a moving fluid. The previously used
threshold criterion based on pressure is replaced by one considering the
principal stresses in a flowing fluid. Experiments and direct simulations will
be conducted to verify the applicability of the proposed criterion in relatively
simple devices. The pertinent information from literature will be reviewed from
the perspective of this criterion. If successful, the new criterion will
fundamentally change our understanding of cavitation and outgassing in flowing
fluid, as well as the design methods of turbomachinery, hydraulic circuits, and
various fluid flow facilities in industry. ***
