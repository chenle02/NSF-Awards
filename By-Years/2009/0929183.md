This DDEP proposal is to support Ms. Christine M. Lucas working under PI Dr.
Emilio Bruna to conduct research in Brazil. Ms. Lucas will collaborate with two
mentors in Brazil and share their facility, namely Dr. Jochen Sh√∂ngart and Dr.
Maria Teresa F. Piedade of the Brazilian Amazon Research Institute (INPA). Ms.
Lucas will investigate the dynamics of flood plain forest regeneration and
succession, in particular how the interaction of flood stress and disturbances
affect the seedling community, a vulnerable stage in tree life history. The
Brazilian experts will guide Ms. Lucas to identify inventoried tree species and
to calculate aboveground carbon sequestration. By conducting collaborative
research in Brazil, Ms. Lucas expects to fill a broad gap in understanding how
tropical forested wetlands configure into Amazonian carbon budgets.
