Basri, Gibor 95-28272 T Tauri stars are solar-type stars at the beginning of
their lives. Studying them involves studies of star formation, stellar activity,
accretion disks and strong bipolar outflows. One of the richest sources of
information on these objects are their emission line profiles, though they are
poorly understood because the line formation region is complex and quite time-
variable on scales of minutes to years. Dr. Basri plans to characterize the
time-variable behavior of the spectral lines using numerous spectral
observations of bright T Tauri star systems. In addition he will undertake an
extensive program to model the line emission region within the star. His
research also involves a study of the first close low mass binary system forming
within a disk, while searching for similar systems. The last part of his
research program is to attempt to obtain velocities for some of the T Tauri
binaries. Along with orbits from speckle interferometry, this would allow a
direct measurement of the masses of both stars in the system, a major step in
the calibration of pre-main sequence evolutionary tracks. ***
