The project goal is the evolution of a scheme to determine an object's shape by
tactile sensing. A crucial direction of research in robotics is the development
of machines that interact with their environments comprehensively and
intelligently. This research addresses a part of the effort, namely the probing
of unknown surfaces and objects by tactile sensing, the determination of the
shape of the surface or object from this information, and the effect of this
shape determination on control algorithms. The work combines elements of
mechanics, online control, estimation theory, and artificial intelligence.
