This project is establishing a new visual programming computer lab to support
the teaching of software engineering and user-interface design. The visual
programming lab is equipped with five multimedia microcomputers, a file and
application server, a printer, a scanner, and the visual programming language
"Microsoft Visual Basic." The lab provides upper-division computer science
majors with hands-on experience designing, building, and evaluating event-driven
programs with graphical and multimedia user interfaces. Requirements analysis,
rapid prototyping, user testing, and design iteration are emphasized. Two
courses that benefit directly from the lab are CS 480 Software Engineering and
CS 481 Software Engineering Project. A special topics course, CS 498 User-
Interface Design, is offered as a test bed for the new hardware, software, and
teaching materials. Students apply what they learn in class to their programming
projects in the visual programming lab.
