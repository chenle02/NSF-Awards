9554161 Pennypacker This proposal, sponsored by the Lawrence-Berkeley Laboratory
of the University of California-Berkeley, seeks funding for a three year project
to teach teachers how to use computer based imaging techniques in their
classrooms to bring about deeper understanding of science concepts. Called
Hands-On Universe the program uses a comprehensive set of curriculum units,
developed under an NSF Instructional Materials award, which emphasizes the
understanding of basic concepts in astronomy and the math and science underlying
those concepts. The program uses a combination of real time astronomical images
as well as stored images. Topics include study of astronomical measurements
(size, distance and brightness), determination of the characteristics of
satellite and binary systems and searching for supernovae. Local resource teams
consisting of highly trained teachers, museum personnel and local scientists
will provide workshops and support for teachers implementing the program in
their region. The target sites are the state of California, and the cities of
Chicago, Illinois and Nashville, Tennessee. The project also has a pilot project
component which prepares and tests the effectiveness of modules at the Middle
School level. At the end of three years each site will have worked with 238
teachers. A total of 714 teachers will be enhanced by the project. The matching
funds, in support of the NSF award, are about 26% of the NSF grant amount.
