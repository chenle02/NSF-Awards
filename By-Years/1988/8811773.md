Dolakhali is a hitherto little known dialect of Newari, a Tibeto- Burman
language of Nepal. It is closely related to the better- known Kathmandu dialect
of the same language, but it has strikingly different verb morphology, and the
two dialects are mutually unintelligible. Products of this project include a
grammatical description of Dolakhali and the data for a comparative study that
will focus on the divergent morphosyntactic systems of the Dolakhali and
Kathmandu dialects. The primary areas for comparison are the structure of
relative clauses and nominalizations, clause chains and the grammaticalization
of verbs to auxiliaries, and finite verb morphology. The close genetic
relationship of Dolakhali and Kathmandu Newari, as well as the existence of
written Kathmandu Newari texts dating back to the fourteenth century provide an
excellent basis for a well-documented historical study, which can contribute to
the body of literature on historical syntax. It may also resolve questions of
the relationship of Newari to other languages of Nepal, and it will definitely
provide a data source for future cross-linguistic studies on typologically
dissimilar languages.
