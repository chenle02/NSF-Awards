Abstract&lt;br/&gt;EEC-0121931&lt;br/&gt;Silevitch&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will support a pilot program for a "University without Walls," including
Northeastern University's ERC for Subsurface Sensing and Imaging Systems
(CenSSIS), Confocal-microscopy Laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital, and
the Biomedical Research Partnership (BRP) Laboratory at the Massachusetts
General Hospital. Collaboration between biomedical researchers and engineers is
essential in creating breakthroughs in sensing an imaging that will be necessary
to solve complex biological processes. A three-year program is proposed
involving graduate students. Each student will have an academic advisor in the
home institution, responsible for directing the students' academic activity, and
two technical advisors, one in engineering an done in biology or medicine. The
research will focus on three areas: hyperspectral imaging, confocal microscopy
and quadrature tomographic microscope.&lt;br/&gt;
