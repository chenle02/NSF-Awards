Theoretical research will be conducted on non-equilibrium superconductivity, an
area of great current interest and probable technological importance. First,
work will be done on the dynamic properties of the vortex-liquid and vortex-
glass phases in disordered superconductors. Second, a study will be made of
pattern formation in superconductors due to strong magnetic fields. %%% The
theoretical research done in this award will deal with the dynamic behavior of
the magnetic flux in superconductors and its collective behavior. An
understanding of the behavior of magnetic flux is of fundamental importance and
is critical to the application of superconducting materials.
