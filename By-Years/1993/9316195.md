Abstract 939316195 Drescher, J. MCNC Center for Communication High speed
computer networks support shared databases and new modes of collaboration in
several scientific areas. These capabilities have yet to be widely applied at
the state level. The MCNC Center for Communication is convening a planning
workshop which will convene people from each state to provide information about
the National Research and Education Network (NREN). They request support for a
workshop to plan a framework for how the states could best invest in an
interoperable network that would take full advantage of the resources and
capabilities that the NREN has to offer. Network capabilities and database and
conferencing technology such as dial up video service would demonstrated in this
two day workshop. This conference will bring together many academic and
government representatives from the numerous states and from the networking
technology community who are essential for the design, development, deployment,
and operation of a robust, high performance computer network. This effort is in
step with federal initiatives in high performance computing and its plans to
meet pressing needs for improved research collaboration and productivity in the
United States.
