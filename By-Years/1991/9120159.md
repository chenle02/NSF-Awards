This project will complete analysis of one of the largest known family
reconstitution data sets from Croatia, in historical Europe. It will develop and
test new statistical methods for dealing with incomplete data to improve the
efficiency of data recovery. It will confirm fertility control responses to
fluctuating economic and political conditions and demonstrate early onset of
fertility decline (CA. 1780) as a response to progressive inmiseration of the
population. It will show that demographic response is conditioned primarily by
economic and social organizational factors rather than broad cultural factors.
This research is important because it expands and improves the theory of the
demographic transition from large to small families. Understanding how this has
happened in the past will help us design programs to impact family size in the
future.
