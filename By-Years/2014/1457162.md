The origin of nervous systems with complex brains represents a major
evolutionary transition in the history of animals. Investigators will test
alternative hypotheses for brain/memory evolution to determine whether these
functions have single or multiple origins. Genes expressed in Octopus brains
will be studied and compared with genes expressed in the brains of other
mollusks. New ways of assessing evolutionary relationships between the genes
from the different animals will be developed in order to determine whether
different animal groups use the same genes during brain development or whether
each type of animal has a different set of genes that organize brain centers
during development. Project outcomes include making available to the wider
research community inexpensive gene analysis techniques with short processing
turn-around times. The project will provide opportunities for students to
combine research training with field-based marine biodiversity research in
Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Palau, and Hawaii. Outreach activities are planned
for K-12 teachers and students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
investigate whether brains from diverse phylogenetic groups originate from a
single ancestral cell lineage or whether neurons and the brains they form have
developed from different lineages representing multiple, perhaps 9-12,
cephalization events. The tripartite brain hypothesis predicts that the
bilaterian brain is composed of three distinct regions which are determined by a
set of conserved transcription factors, Hox, Otx, and Pax2/5/6, whereas an
alternate view is that cephalopod-specific innovations may have led to
independent formation of the complex brains of species in this group. Single-
neuron genomics and connectivity will be used to reconstruct the evolutionary
fate of homologous cell populations in cephalopod and chordate brains.
