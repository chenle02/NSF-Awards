The University of Kansas Center for Research, Inc. will purchase microwave
interferometry equipment under this NSF Engineering Research Equipment Grant for
use in the Chemical and Petroleum Department, which will be dedicated to support
research in engineering. The equipment will be used for several research
projects on plasma processes used in the semiconductor industry including: (l)
development of a novel technique to measure electron concentration measurement
using electrical- impedance analysis, (2) development and testing of models of
electron and ion kinetics in a plasma discharge, and (3) research on the neutral
chemistry kinetics in plasma reactors. The overall goal of the research is to be
able to operate and develop plasma processes better for the future needs of the
semiconductor industry.
