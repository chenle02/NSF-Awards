Glutamate receptors are proteins that are essential for communication between
brain cells (neurons), and function in brain processes including learning and
memory. Mammalian glutamate receptors have evolved into a multi-gene family
containing subtypes with genetic, functional and pharmacological similarities.
Glutamate receptors are activated when they bind extracellular glutamate
(ligand). The binding to the receptor allows the protein to open a channel
(pore) through which ions flow across the neuron's membrane; converting a
chemical signal (glutamate) into an electrical signal (membrane depolarization).
The proposed study will test the hypothesis that one region common to all
glutamate receptors (the M3-M4 extracellular domain) participates in a common
mechanism to relay the signal between the ligand binding site and the pore
(allosteric signal transduction). Elucidation of a conserved functional role of
the M3-M4 extracellular domain would provide important insights into how ligand-
gated ion channels function.
