This award provides support for a workshop and panel, Good Intentions Are
Necessary but Not Sufficient: Steps Toward Best Practices in Mentoring
Underrepresented Students, at the January 2011 Joint Mathematics Meeting, to be
held in New Orleans. The panel will address broadening participation in the
mathematical sciences. The panel is comprised of experts who share a deep
commitment to ensuring diversity in the mathematical sciences. The primary goal
is to discuss ideas for programs that will bring underrepresented students into
mathematics.

The organizers seek to attract participants from a diverse set of institutions
to the workshop. An additional goal is to bring together a broad and diverse
group of stakeholders and critical consumers in order to help more mathematical
scientists become aware of developments in the discipline. A fundamental
understanding is that good intentions are necessary but not sufficient when
taking steps toward best practices in mentoring under-represented students.
