NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT: &lt;br/&gt;While a century old problem, magnetism
remains poorly understood. Of the two extreme magnetic states - those with
magnetic moments localized in small spatial volumes (local moments) and those
shared by the entire compound (itinerant moments), the former remains better
described theoretically, with most real materials actually residing in the
continuum between the two. The main goal of this project is to discover and
characterize novel itinerant magnets without magnetic elements. It is of
particular interest to understand what happens as the temperature is lowered
close to absolute zero, or towards quantum phase transitions (QPT),
fundamentally distinct transitions compared to the more familiar phase
transitions, for example liquid-to-solid. Exotic physics is believed to emerge
from QPTs and these will be studied with tuning parameters such as composition,
pressure or magnetic field. Undergraduate and graduate students involved in the
project will be trained in crystal growth and characterization, valuable tools
for materials driven condensed matter research. The PI will develop a class on
scientific presentation skills, and will establish two series of lab open
houses, for hands-on experience for children and for
adults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL ABSTRACT: &lt;br/&gt;This NSF award
supports experimental investigations and education in condensed matter physics,
with focus on novel magnetic states of matter in the itinerant moment regime. In
particular, the goal of this proposal is to investigate novel itinerant magnets
containing no magnetic elements, where the the chemical tunability of the only
three known such magnetic systems will be explored towards designing the new
compounds of interest. The main thrusts of the project are studies of (i) the
correlations between the structural and physical properties of itinerant
electron magnets, (ii) the interplay between electronic and magnetic ground
states and (iii) non-Fermi liquid behavior in itinerant magnet systems. In
addition, the recently discovered hardness of some related alloys will be
investigated and the materials optimized for medical and possibly new
technological applications. The PI will develop a class on scientific
presentation skills, and will establish two series of lab open houses, for
hands-on experience for children and for adults.
