This collaboration between Joseph Birman, City College, and Su Zhaobin,
Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, focuses on
developing a better theoretical understanding of the non-equilibrium transport
theory of microdevices. This builds on earlier collaboration between Birman and
Su. New classes of semiconductor materials, and new types of heterjunction
devices, with novel electronic properties have been produced in recent years.
This has been made possible by development of sophisticated techniques such as
molecular beam epitaxy and metallorganic chemical vapor deposition which allow
new types of engineering, and fabrication of special structures. Resonant
tunneling transistors are emerging as some of the most promising electron
functional devices, allowing implementation of a large class of circuits with
greatly reduced complexity. Investigation of the properties of these transistors
will improve understanding of their potential in development of new devices, and
even in development of new computer architectures.
