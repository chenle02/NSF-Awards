Marine ice sheets are largely based below sea level and are therefore influenced
directly not only by the atmosphere, but also by sea level and ocean
temperature, circulation and salinity. The West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which is
part of the south polar Antarctic Ice Sheet, is today's only truly marine ice
sheet. Rising levels of trace gases in the atmosphere may cause a climatic
warming which in turn may initiate a change in glacial ice volume and a rise in
sea level. The West Antarctic Ice Sheet may be unstable to such a sea level
rise. Coupled ice sheet- climate modeling studies are needed to gain insight
into the transient response of the Antarctic Ice Sheet to rising trace gas
levels, and will help set guidelines for managing the large scale consequences
of a potential rise in sea level. The long term goal is to develop a three-
dimensional Antarctic Ice Sheet-climate model. The first stage of this project
consists of a two-dimensional modeling study of marine ice sheet dynamics and of
a parallel study of ice sheet-atmosphere model coupling methods. This
investigation will develop a high resolution, thermomechanical, two-dimensional
finite-element marine ice sheet- ice shelf model to be used in a sensitivity
study to a variety of physical processes of potential importance in West
Antarctic Ice Sheet behavior. These modeling studies will help set priorities
for the development of a three-dimensional Antarctic Ice Sheet model.
