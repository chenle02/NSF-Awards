The objective of this award is to develop a computational framework for
identifying the critical network topology of brain connectivity in neuroimaging
data, specifically functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In this
framework, network optimization modeling and mathematical programming algorithms
will be employed to characterize connectivity patterns in fMRI data from
different brain regions. Machine learning techniques will be employed to
construct a pattern recognition model used to detect biomarkers and predict the
brain disease conditions (i.e., abnormals vs. controls). An information-
theoretic approach will be used to select the most informative brain regions to
improve the generalizability and to increase the accuracy of the diagnosis
prediction model.

If successful, the results of this research will lead to improvements in
efficiency and efficacy of brain functional connectivity modeling and new
developments of optimization methods for handling large-scale spatio-temporal
data. The developed computational framework will be extremely useful for
neuroscientists and neurologists to identify abnormal functional connectivity in
the brain and to gain a greater understanding of the brain function. The
framework will be employed and tested as a novel biomarker for differential
diagnoses of brain disorders. Alzheimer?s disease (AD), autism spectrum disorder
(ASD), and Parkinson?s disease (PD) will be the case points in this project to
test if our computational framework is a sensitive enough tool to detect
alterations in brain connectivity associated with brain disorders. Accurate
diagnosis can substantially extend a patient?s lifespan and some treatments have
different outcomes at different disease stages. Additionally, the developed
computational framework can be applied to other real-life large-scale spatio-
temporal data that arise in other research areas such as manufacturing,
medicine, bioinformatics, neuroscience, finance, and geosciences.
