The experiments of this proposal use three-dimensional recordings of electrical
potentials produced by brain cells in response to sound stimulation (auditory
evoked potentials or AEPs) to explore how the rat's brain processes auditory
information. These experiments will provide a basis for understanding the
relationship between the function of auditory cortex as measured in the AEP and
underlying anatomy in the rodent, bridging the gap in out understanding between
single cell properties in auditory cortex and the response properties of larger
systems of nerve cells. This work will also serve to verify and improve
physiological and mathematical models used to interpret the AEP, advancing the
use of evoked potential measurement as an invasive and noninvasive tool for
investigating brain function in animals and in man.//
