This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to
develop and validate highly sensitive contrasting agents in-vivo, for magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) diagnosis, based on a series of novel nano-sized
ferromagnets. Prior Phase I work used combinatorial chemistry to synthesize
magnetic nanoparticles with significantly enhanced magnetic resonance signal and
sensitivity than currently available paramagnetic contrasting agents. The
specific objectives of Phase II research are to further optimize the nano-magnet
cores with combinatorial chemistry , to functionalize their surfaces for in-
vitro imaging of cells, to validate the newly developed contrasting agents in
comparative animal MRI studies against products in use, and to evaluate their
toxicity effects.

The commercial application of this project will be in the area of whole-body
imaging techniques. The proposed technology will enable superior medical images
to be taken at significantly higher throughput and sensitivity, and at a lower
cost. Further, it may allow for new medical diagnosis-imaging applications using
magnetic resonance (for example, in the early detection and prevention of
cardiovascular disease).
