9454585 Newberry The Kentucky Community College System is establishing computer
facilities at each of its fifteen widely separated community college campuses.
These new facilities are being utilized for statewide reform of the mathematics
algebra-level and calculus which form part of the curriculum for students in
advanced technology programs. The labs will also support development of new two-
year curricula in telecommunications and computer system management. A system of
formal courses (taught using satellite facilities) to train faculty and staff to
maintain the network system are catalyzing Continuing Education/Community
Service programs in the use and administration of network systems and will
develop the capability to offer a new associate degree program in network system
administration. At the conclusion of this project approximately 40% of the
System's intermediate and college algebra level mathematics courses will be
taught as integrated courses in a collaborative learning environment using
technology as a learning tool. While 15,000 students across Kentucky will
directly benefit from the revised curriculum during the actual project period,
the project will ultimately affect many thousands more students and ordinary
citizens.
