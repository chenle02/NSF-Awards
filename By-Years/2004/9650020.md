The Mathematical Sciences Department has made a commitment to be on the
forefront of the current mathematics reform. In line with this commitment, the
department is developing a Mathematical Sciences Computer Lab and Resource
Center (MCLRC). The purpose of the MCLRC is to provide a central location for
students to engage in scholarly activities and discussions; to provide a state-
of-the-art facility where students can integrate mathematical theory with visual
discovery; to give student groups with different learning styles further
opportunities to succeed in mathematics and science; and to develop students'
ability to solve sophisticated real-world problems with modern software tools,
thereby better preparing them for the work force or graduate school. In order to
realize these goals, this project is modifying existing portions of the current
curriculum to make use of several software tools. In particular, this
reorganization involves several phases. Phase I consists of incorporating the
software tool functions into all sections of precalculus. Phase II is the
establishment of the MCLRC and the incorporation of MAPLE into calculus,
multivariable calculus, differential equations, and computational linear
algebra. Phase III involves the development of a scientific computing course
that brings students from the natural sciences together in a seminar type of
atmosphere, analyzing and solving problems in their various disciplines using
MAPLE and IGOR (data analysis software). Existing equipment is not sufficient
for Phases II and III, therefore, the department is acquiring 20 Power Macintosh
computers with networking hardware, 1 Apple share server, 2 portable classroom
computers with display equipment, and licenses for MAPLE and IGOR. The
department expects this project to have a significant impact on student
retention in the sciences, particularly among Pacific Islanders, and to result
in a number of published materials.
