9352942 Lenk This proposal is to develop and disseminate a middle school (5-8)
interactive CD-ROM based science unit on The Rain Forest Connection. This unit
will be a series of cooperative group activities that use video, still images,
animation, dramatic stories, and actual scientific data to involve students in
science learning. The content will focus on the search for plants in the
Indonesian rain forests containing compounds that may be successful in the
treatment of cancer or AIDS. Print materials are also available. The unique
nature of this project is that the CD-ROM unit may be used by a teacher with 30
or more students at the same time.
