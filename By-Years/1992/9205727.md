The need for a better understanding of the relation between hydrologic extremes
(droughts and floods) and long term climatic variability is underscored by
concerns of anthropogenic climate change. Investigations into these relations
using closed basin lakes and their basin hydrology are proposed. The Great Salt
Lake basin is arid and heterogeneous. Its climatic signal is well correlated
with the Western U.S. Recent climate research into sources of determinism (e.g.
ENSO) in global climatic variability has been very fruitful. Such research has
blossomed through creative data interpretation, and modeling of feedbacks and
interactions. The proposed research is in the same spirit. On interest is the
identification of persistent climatic anomalies, their generating regimes; the
aggregate basin hydrologic response and feedbacks; transitions between regimes;
their sensitivity to initial conditions and parameters, and to dynamic changes
in forcing functions. A nonlinear dynamical systems perspective is adopted.
Nonparametric methods for data analysis and systgm identification are proposed.
Physical and data based arguments for the possibility of chaotic behavior in the
coupled lake-basin-climate system, and the presence of multiple regimes are
advanced. The development of finite physical-statistical-dynamic models to study
system sensitivities is proposed.
