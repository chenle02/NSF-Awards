Developing the ability to communicate in a particular code involves learning
not just how to produce that code, but also how to use it. Dr. Pepperberg will
study these processes by determining the conditions that are required for
teaching a subject a repertoire that it would not normally acquire (an
"exceptional code"), and then examining its functional use of this code. Dr.
Pepperberg has shown previously that training procedures that rely on
referential social modeling enable an African Grey parrot to acquire and combine
English vocalizations (an exceptional code) to (a) request, refuse, quantify,
identify, and categorize objects, and (b) control, to a limited extent, its
immediate environment. Dr. Pepperberg will (1) extend her study to a second
parrot, examining the effects of (a) species identity of the social model (i.e.,
parrot vs. human) and (b) varying degrees of social interaction between the
trainers and trainee; (2) examine the level of acquired competence by
investigating the extent to which this code can be used for comprehending
questions, numerical concepts, object-object relations, prepositions, referring
to objects not physically present (displacement), describing novel objects or
circumstances (productivity), recognizing two- dimensional forms, use of verbs,
negation, and how labeling may affect the ability to recall an object. These
tasks are comparable to those that have been used with dolphins and non- human
primates. In this way, Dr. Pepperberg's research is expanding our view of the
cognitive capabilities of a non- mammalian species. Dr. Pepperberg also will
continue to examine how social modeling may offer insights into other studies of
vocal learning. Through such analyses, she is broadening and deepening our
scientific understanding of the development of bird song and of human speech.
Training techniques that she devises may prove valuable in work with
developmentally retarded persons.
