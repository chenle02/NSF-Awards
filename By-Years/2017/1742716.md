Students from groups underrepresented in the sciences are more likely to take
post-baccalaureate classes or pursue a Master's degree before applying to Ph.D.
programs. The goal of the Columbia Bridge-to-PhD Program is to increase the
number of underrepresented scholars entering STEM PhD programs and to give them
the skills necessary for success in those programs. One such necessity is a
network of mentors and colleagues. The program holds a half-day symposium every
year with returning alumni sharing their experiences. This grant will support a
"Super Symposium" to evaluate the lessons learned from the the ten-year history
of the program. Funds will support travel costs of program alumni to attend the
symposium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI has begun analyzing the impact of the
program on students' graduate career trajectories. His data show that the
program has a high success rate for students admitted to PhD programs, with 80%
of the program's applicants being accepted. Preliminary data show that the
Bridge Program's alumni are more likely to be admitted to higher-ranked, less
diverse graduate programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
