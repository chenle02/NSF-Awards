Non-technical Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Guam (UOG) will
establish the Guam Ecosystems Collaboratorium (GEC) to coordinate research in
coral and marine ecology. The project will leverage Guam?s unique marine
biodiversity to enhance research and education capacity while improving
understanding of how coral reefs respond to environmental stress and climate
change. The GEC will establish collaborations with leading universities and
researchers from around the US and globally to initiate a research and education
program at UOG focusing on coral reef ecology and marine biodiversity. The
project will provide mechanisms for collaborative visits, exchange of doctoral
students, and virtual collaborations. Cyberinfrastructure (CI) enhancements will
support a repository for marine biodiversity which will serve as a global
resource and establish Guam as a destination for marine ecosystems
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
GEC will use RNA sequencing analysis (RNA-seq) and single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) to examine genetically based stress responses in organisms
found in coral reefs around Guam. A repository for biological samples and
genomic and transcriptomic data will be established and connected globally via
an upgraded internet connection (500 Mbps). A sensor network will be established
in Pago Bay to measure environmental conditions such as temperature, salinity,
and turbidity for correlating with physiological responses of corals to
environmental stressors. Existing expertise in coral reef ecology and marine
biology will be enhanced through new faculty hires and collaborations with
researchers from other institutions. Agreements with other universities will
allow the shared training of doctoral students. Research experiences will be
provided for undergraduate students and teachers and the program would support a
citizen science project for Pago Bay synergistic with the coral ecology
research.
