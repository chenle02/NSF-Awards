9353217 Alcoze The proposed Native Science Connections (NCS) project is designed
to develop culturally relevant science modules that complement the existing
science curricula in grades 4 through 6. The curricular materials in science and
mathematics will focus on four Native American tribal nations: Zuni, Hopi,
Apache and Dine (Navajo) and will demonstrate the existence and validity of
Native American sciences and mathematics as they are manifested within the
traditions and cultures of the original peoples of the Americas. The project
will be directed and developed by experienced Native Americans science teachers
and education professionals. Materials produced from this project include four
science modules that will be developed around environmental themes. They will be
used in both Native American and mainstream classrooms. ***
