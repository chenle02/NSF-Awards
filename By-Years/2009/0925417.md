Abstract

The objective of this research is to develop a novel nanomechanical sensor with
single molecule detection sensitivity. The approach is to form a hybrid
cantilever with a functional virus at its tip. The cantilever/virus hybrid
structure will be used as a fishing rod to reel in the DNA, whereby the other
end of the DNA will capture a target entity from a sample by means of an
antibody. The packaging and reeling of the DNA upon the capture of target
analyte will be detected using magnetic actuation via a magnetic bead that binds
to the captured molecule. Intellectual merit: The developed system will be the
first sensor that uses a virus activity to achieve: single molecule sensitivity,
efficient target capture (target-capturing antibody will not be immobilized on a
surface, rather it will be extended into solution via DNA) and negligible
nonspecific binding (only the tip of the cantilever where the virus is located
will be in contact with the solution) and hence will finally allow
nanomechanical sensors to be useful in biological research and medicine. Broad
impact: This project has the potential to result in biosensors that are
extremely sensitive which can penetrate into clinical and biological research
laboratories and serve to numerous goals that range from disease biomarker
detection to understanding of protein-protein interactions at the single
molecule level. Also, as a part of this proposal, the laboratory portion of an
undergraduate course will be modified to have MEMS/NEMS devices, and hence will
educate undergraduates about this new field for years to come.
