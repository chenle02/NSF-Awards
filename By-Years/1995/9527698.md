9527698 Whiting Monitoring athe exchange of trace gases (especially greenhouse
gases) between terrestrial systems and the atomsphere will provide a means to
assess the effectiveness of changes in anthropogenic emissions of future
climatic conditions. Remote sensing technology has the potential to provide
monitoring capabilities in estimating carbon dioxide exchange (primary
production) and methane emission from wetlands. To utilize remote sensing as an
accurate predictive tool in estimating methane emissions form a variety of
wetland, a systematic comparison of methane emission, primary production and
remote sensing relationship across large latitudinal will be an important step.
This project will examine these relationship within and among three primary
wetland systems chosen along a wide latitudinal gradient (25 N to 60 N): the
subtropical Everglades, the expensive marshes of southwestern Louisiana, and the
boreal peatlands of Alberta and Northwest Territories. The project should
produce results applicable to a broad suite of questions at regional-t-global
scales having to do with the interaction of human activity and climate change.
