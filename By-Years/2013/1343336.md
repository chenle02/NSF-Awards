A GHz-wide radio spectrum sensing device capable of real-time, cheap, and low-
power measurements will be made. The hardware will build on recent advances in
the area of sparse Fourier transforms, which show that one can capture the
frequency representation of a sparse signal without sampling it at the Nyquist
rate. Preliminary results from a feasibility study show it is possible to
recover GHz of bandwidth using a few low-speed low-power analog-to-digital
converters similar to those used in inexpensive Wi-Fi
cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research enables efficient spectrum utilization
and scalable spectrum monitoring, and hence can help the government in managing
this important resource. Further, realtime GHz spectrum sensing can help
detecting radar signals, which are hard to detect using existing technologies.
This could open up large swaths of spectrum for sharing, which would stimulate
innovations in the mobile and wireless domain.
