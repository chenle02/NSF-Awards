This effort will improve the ability to model aerosol properties in the
atmosphere. It combines thermodynamic modeling and experimental studies to
better understand water uptake by particles and the interactions of gases, solid
and liquid aerosols, and water in the Earth's atmosphere. Project results will
benefit climate and air quality models and improve our ability to predict
ambient concentrations of particulate matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific
project outcomes expected are: (1) a parameterized predictive model for
equilibrium internal structure of atmospheric aerosol particles (internally
mixed, nodule, or core-shell) in complex multicomponent systems across the
entire range of particle liquid water content or gas phase relative humidity;
and (2) a novel microfluidic platform for mimicking and investigating aqueous-
organic and aqueous-vapor interfaces which will yield valuable data for
improving the parameterizations used in predictive models.
