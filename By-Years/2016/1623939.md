Recent advances in biomaterials, biomaterials fabrication, computation, biology,
and biomedical research have highlighted the need for advanced experimental
tools, new materials synthesis and fabrication methods, state-of-the-art
analytical techniques, and computational methods. This workshop identifies grand
challenges and opportunities in biomolecular and biomaterials systems that would
benefit from investment in both research teams and instrumentation. The workshop
will identify critical need areas where mid-scale level facilities and
instruments would be catalytic and collaborative interdisciplinary teams working
in a tightknit and iterative fashion could eliminate bottlenecks to accelerated
materials discovery. Making these instruments available to the biomaterials
community at large, through mechanisms such as a user facility program, could
lead to accelerated new biomaterials discoveries and technological innovation
throughout the nation. The workshop will include faculty and students from US
universities and researchers from national laboratories and industry. The
workshop will comprise of invited lectures, panel discussions, group break-out
sessions and reporting on current and emerging trends. This workshop, whose
results will appear in a formal report, will capture the excitement and promise
of potential opportunities.
