The massive hardware scale, labyrinthine software complexity, and tangled
external interactions of networked systems conspire to undermine reliability:
Scale increases the frequency of failures while interconnectedness exacerbates
their consequences by turning local mishaps into global disasters. This project
will establish new system support toward recoverable network applications on two
foundations. In an individual machine, fast, simple application recovery can be
greatly eased if the application state on the persistent storage is kept always
consistent. Over a networked system, the fault-tolerance and global consistency
can be better supported and reasoned if application components commit local
state before emitting any output to others. The time is right for this effort,
because emerging Flash-based solid-state disks (SSDs) promise to dramatically
reduce the cost of required persistent state management. Research will proceed
along three fronts: First, the project will design and implement a new operating
system mechanism (fast synchronous logging without double writes) for failure-
atomic, synchronous I/O on SSDs. Second, for broad applicability, this project
will present the programmers with simple extensions of familiar POSIX
interfaces. Third, to achieve efficiency and fairness, research will develop a
new I/O resource manager that combines the classic fair queuing scheduling with
SSD-oriented anticipatory I/O. Fast, simple failure recovery mechanisms
developed in this project will enable high reliability for a broad range of
networked applications that are critical to today's digital economy and society.
This project will also involve industry collaboration, curriculum enhancement,
and student training.
