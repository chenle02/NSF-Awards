Project develops a pre>.>stack depth migration and velocityanalysisinversion
scheme for imaging wide angle to verticalincidenceseismic data, using two
different extrapolationprocedures in thesame 3>.>step datuming/imaging/velocity
analysismethod. Techniqueis a layer stripping method. Velocityanalysis is
performedbetween the extrapolations in differentlayers. Application ofthe method
is made using data from thecentral California marginand from the Canadian
arctic.
