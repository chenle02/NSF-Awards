Objective: &lt;br/&gt;The objective of the 11th International Conference on
Infrared Optoelectronics: Materials and Devices is to provide a unique forum for
device physicists, and material scientists to assess the main issues in infrared
optoelectronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: &lt;br/&gt;The
Conference will be held on the campus of Northwestern University in Evanston, IL
is during September 4-8, 2012. Leading research professionals in industry,
academia, and government are scheduled to attend. The intent is to arrive at a
far-reaching overview of infrared optoelectronics. One of the major goals of the
Conference is to assess the current status and define future research directions
in infrared optoelectronics. This will be achieved through presentations and
open discussions of the key technical issues. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
impact: &lt;br/&gt;It is expected that this Conference will have a significant
impact in defining future research in infrared optoelectronics. This Conference
will also contribute to the training of participating graduate students and
junior faculty through open discussion of the presented topics. A Conference
Technical Digest will be disseminated to participants.
