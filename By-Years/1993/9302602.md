Passive chemical tracer (chlorofluorocarbon and carbon tetrachloride)
concentrations will be measured along an hydrographic section from Suva to
Papeete in the southwest Pacific as part of the World Ocean Circulation
Experiment (WOCE) one-time hydrographic survey. The goal of these measurements
is to provide additional estimates of the deep water mass pathways through the
Samoan Passage and the Robbie ridge.
