It is proposed to carry out theoretical research on the solutocapillary driven
convection in spherical shells. The problem arises from the accurate
manufacturing of laser targets in inertial confinement fusion (ICF) and future
inertial fusion energy (IFE) targets. To initate fusion, these targets must be
very smooth, otherwise Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities may be triggered thus
degrades the efficiency of fusion ignition. It has been demonstrated that the
bumpiness of the target surface is caused by Marangoni instabilities driven by
surface tension dependence on the solute concentration during the manufacturing
process. Linear stability analysis will be used to establish the critical
condition and to suggest initial conditions for nonlinear analysis. The surface
defortmation will be calculated by the nonlinear calculations. Results of the
calculations will be compared with the experimental results obtained by General
Atomics.
