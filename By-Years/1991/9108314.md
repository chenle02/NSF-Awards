Fundamental problems in distributed and parallel computation will be
investigated from both a theoretical and practical standpoint. A focal point of
the research will be the study of the sequence transmission problem. The
sequence transmission problem is the problem of transmitting an arbitrarily long
sequence of messages from one party to another over a channel which both reorder
and lose packets. This problem is an abstraction of the classic problem of
designing an end-to-end transport layer protocol in the OSI model of a computer
network. There is a series of new theoretical results, both upper and lower
bounds, which raise the possibility of a new class of efficient protocols for
this problem. This project will investigate this new class of protocols by
analytically and experimentally exploring which variations have the best chance
of practical implementations. Those with the most promise will be implemented
under Unix using IP in a controlled experimental environment. Experiments will
be undertaken on the INTERNET, but only after the protocols have been thoroughly
verified. In addition to the sequence transmission problem, several other
distributed and parallel computing problems will be studied.
