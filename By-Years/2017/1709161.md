Non-Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;In many newly discovered materials, there is a
particularly strong interaction between the electron charges or between the
magnetic moments leading to new phenomena at relatively low temperatures.
Examples include superconductivity - ability to conduct electricity without any
loss - or other complex macroscopically ordered phases of charge and spin
distributions. Understanding the unconventional properties of these materials
presents a great intellectual challenge, and enhancement of transition
temperatures of such macroscopically ordered states is critical to developing
new technologies. This project investigates the basic mechanisms responsible for
unconventional properties of strongly interacting materials by scattering light
(i.e., "photons") from the materials while tuning the materials' properties
through their novel phases. The goals of this project are to better understand
the conditions responsible for the emerging properties, and to assist in
development of novel materials with enhanced functionality.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Interaction between
electrons in "strongly correlated materials" is associated with many
scientifically important and technologically useful phenomena, including
superconductivity and exotically ordered charge and spin phases. This project
applies the advances in low energy spectroscopy to characterize these
extraordinary self-organized electronic phases, determine the condition under
which they are formed, identify the underlying microscopic mechanisms, and test
the relevant theories. This project also provides broad training to postdoc and
undergraduate students in low-temperature high resolution magneto-optical
spectroscopy.
