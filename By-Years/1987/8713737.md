This project is concerned with a computational attack on the Riemann
Hypothesis. Specifically, a lower bound for the constant of Newman will be found
using a combination of numerical calculations and analysis. The Riemann
Hypothesis is equivalent to this constant being less than or equal to zero.
Calculations of this type are entirely new and hold promise for estimating this
constant. A second approach to the Riemann Hypothesis involves the evaluation of
certain double integrals. The numerical evaluation of this type will be
explored.
