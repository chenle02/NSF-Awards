This workshop will bring together leading scientists and engineers who are at
the frontiers of electronic device and circuit research and development. Low
power digital electronics, microwave power circuits, wide band gap
semiconductors, nanotechnology, terahertz technology, and optoelectronics have
become the foundation of today's electronics technology.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This advanced workshop will be a special forum to gather
some of the most creative minds and leading experts from academia, industry, and
government agencies, and to review the most recent and exciting breakthroughs in
the fields, the underlying physical mechanisms that link these advancements, and
to exchange views on future trends and directions, the market pulls and the
necessary policy and infrastructure changes.
