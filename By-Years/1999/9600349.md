9600349 West This Americas Program award will fund travel and related expenses
for Dr. Douglas X. West and two students from Illinois State University, to
travel to Mexico to collaborate on a research project with Dr. Jesus Valdes-
Martinez, of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM). They will
conduct studies to synthesize and characterize a series of macrocyclic and
polynuclear metal complexes. The study of these complexes will present
interesting chemical challenges as well as the possibility of biological
activity. The project will allow for a strong complementary interaction between
the two researchers and their students. The Mexican side will bring to the
collaboration their expertise in crystal structures and solid state information,
while the U.S. group will provide organic ligands, spectroscopy data, and
interpretation of the Mexican compounds. ***
