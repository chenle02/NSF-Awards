The project involves the development of a new class of metal- cutting fluids
with higher thermal capacities than existing fluids. These two-component fluids
consist of micron-sized particles of microencapsulated phase-change materials in
a standard carrier oil. Phase I efforts showed that some beneficial effects of
the two- phase fluid could be demonstrated in cutting tests. The Phase II effort
will expand the development program to allow the formulation of optimal
compositions.
