The aim of robust adaptive control is to realize satisfactory performance in
adaptive systems when various classes of perturbations are present. Examples of
such perturbations include bounded disturbances, time- variations in plant
parameters, and unmodeled dynamics in the plant. While the behavior of adaptive
systems in the presence of bounded disturbances is currently well understood and
powerful results have been derived, robustness in the presence of parameter
variations and unmodeled dynamics has been established only under assumptions
that are quite restrictive. The proposal addresses robustness in the presence of
the latter two perturbations and is aimed not only at relaxing these assumptions
but also at developing a general set of conditions under which the adaptive
system exhibits satisfactory behavior. In the discussion of each problem, the
current status of research is first stated, followed by the approach that is
proposed and the adaptive procedure that will be employed. In each case, a
global analysis of the underlying nonlinear system will be carried out and
attempts will be made to derive sufficient conditions for global boundedness of
solutions as well as conditions under which the system can have unbounded
solutions. The aim of the research is to develop better methods for the design
of practical adaptive controllers which can meet stringent performance
requirements.
