The proposal is for a three year institute to train a cadre of 50 mathematics
teachers in grades 7-10 to learn modern mathematics concepts, develop
programming skills and learn effective leadership and teaching methods. The
cadre, or lead teachers, are to work with other teachers thereby affecting
approximately 240 teachers throughout the duration of the project. A problem
solving approach is to be taken that emphasizes algebra and geometry integrated
with computing. The cadre are qualified and highly motivated teachers, including
members of minority and underrepresented groups, who are to serve as mentors for
their peers. The recruitment and selection process is to emphasize selection of
teachers in underrepresented groups. The first summer activities consist of
courses in mathematics, mathematical problem solving, and discussions on
instructional strategies lasting for four weeks. During the academic year the
cadre members attend additional courses and work in the laboratory of the
center. In their teaching they pilot test the teaching modules that they develop
in the workshop under the supervision of the project staff. Classes and
demonstration lessons are to be video taped during the school year and used by
the cadre members with other teachers. During the second summer the cycle begins
anew with an additional 25 cadre members and the workshop involves members of
the earlier cadre group. The initial cadre also take additional courses during
the second summer and prepare to establish instructional settings for other
teachers. The third year of the project is to involve all cadre members in
working with other teachers, who are in turn observed and video taped by the
project staff.
