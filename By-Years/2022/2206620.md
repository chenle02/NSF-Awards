This project seeks to explore how large collections of electrons can be trapped
with different magnetic bottles. The results will be important for extending our
understanding of the role of the symmetry of traps for plasmas and will help us
make matter-antimatter plasmas, a unique kind of plasma that exists around
neutron stars and that existed in the early universe. The project will also
integrate research and education by engaging undergraduate students in the
effort.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Non-neutral plasmas confined in uniform magnetic
field traps can come to thermal equilibrium and be confined indefinitely. Such
thermal equilibrium states are understood in terms of symmetry of the system,
namely the conservation of canonical angular momentum. It is not clear whether
such states exist for more complicated magnetic geometries; existing theory
suggests they do not exist in a toroidal magnetic field, but that they may exist
for a dipole magnetic field. This project seeks to test these theories and to
develop a suitable electron plasma target for injection of positrons and
creation of a positron-electron plasma in a levitated dipole
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
