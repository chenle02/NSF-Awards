The Oregon State University will initiate a three-week, residential Young
Scholars (EAI) project in Physics and Mathematics for 30 students entering
grades 7,8. Participants chosen will be members of the existing OSU SMILE
Program that offers academic year math/science/computer enrichment activities
for minority middle-schoolers in disadvantaged rural Oregon communities in
cooperation with local school districts. Physics activities will focus on
acoustics and optics, emphasizing hands-on laboratory participation. Mathematics
activities are designed to complement the physics activities and also emphasize
hands-on discovery learning.
