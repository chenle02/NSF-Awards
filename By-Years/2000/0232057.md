This project will develop a new Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometer (CIMS)
instrument adapted to study peroxy radical reactions. Peroxy radicals are
important oxidants in the ambient atmosphere and difficult species to measure.
Initially, some experiments will be conducted with an existing CIMS instrument
at the National Center for Atmospheric Research to determine potential
improvements. Then a new instrument will be constructed at University of Miami
and laboratory studies of the uptake of peroxy radicals on surfaces
representative of ambient atmospheric aerosols conducted using the new
spectrometer. Results from this study should improve knowledge on the kinetics
of gas-surface heterogeneous interactions of oxidatively important peroxy
radicals on aerosol. Broader impacts of the research include: a substantive
addition to current understanding of reactions of peroxy radicals in the
atmosphere; establishing a state of the art permanent instrument capacity
enhancement at University of Miami under the direction of a new female faculty
member; and through the mentoring of postdoctoral scholars and students involved
on this project promoting scholarship, technology transfer, and research
experience to a new generation of young scientists.
