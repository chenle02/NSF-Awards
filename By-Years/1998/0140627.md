This project deals with questions from pluri-potential&lt;br/&gt;theory and
dynamics in several complex variables. &lt;br/&gt;Pluri-potential theory is the
higher dimensional version&lt;br/&gt;of potential theory in the complex plane.
The &lt;br/&gt;investigator plans to study certain classes of
&lt;br/&gt;pluricomplex Green functions for the complex &lt;br/&gt;Monge-Ampere
operator, from the point of view of their&lt;br/&gt;foliation structure and also
in relation to some questions&lt;br/&gt;from algebraic geometry. A second goal
of the project is &lt;br/&gt;to consider polynomial estimates of Bernstein-Walsh
type&lt;br/&gt;related to graphs of entire transcendental
functions.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator plans to study certain properties
of&lt;br/&gt;entire functions from this point of view. Such
properties&lt;br/&gt;are also of interest in transcendental number
theory.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the investigator is concerned with studying
the&lt;br/&gt;dynamics of classes of polynomial automorphisms
in&lt;br/&gt;higher dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complex analysis in one and
in higher dimensions has&lt;br/&gt;important connections with many fields of
pure and applied&lt;br/&gt;mathematics and, indeed, with other sciences. It is
often&lt;br/&gt;the case that one gains insight about concrete problems
&lt;br/&gt;once they are formulated in the context of complex
numbers.&lt;br/&gt;This is because of the powerful methods and tools
developed&lt;br/&gt;in the study of holomorphic functions in complex
analysis.&lt;br/&gt;Studying complex dynamical systems proved to be
important&lt;br/&gt;for understanding the behavior of more complicated real
&lt;br/&gt;dynamical systems arising in mathematics as well as in
&lt;br/&gt;physics and biology.
