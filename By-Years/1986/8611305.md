The primary objective of this research is to explore several innovative
strategies for the continuous overproduction of protein by recombinant
microorganisms. these strategies are based on a blend of biochemcial engineering
and genetic engineering methods. The major issues that are addressed include the
development and control of continuous bioprocesses, plasmid instability, fluid
dynamics, and genetic control of microbial flocculation. A team effort involving
a microbial physiologist, a yeast genticist, a biochemical engineer, a process
control engineer, and a fluid dynamicist is underway.
