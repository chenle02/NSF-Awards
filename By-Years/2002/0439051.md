The overall goal of this project is to use the MAGic (Makenzie, Arvidson, and
Guidry) model to comprehensively evaluate the sensitivity between tectonic
spreading rates, volcanic outgassing, continental weathering rates, and climate
over long geologic time scales. This modeling effort will include tests that
assess the possibility that quasi-periodic, self-organized modes of interaction
between atmosphere, ocean, chemical sediments, crust and shallow mantle gave
rise to the stable hothouse/greenhouse climatic modes characterizing the
Phanerozoic Eon. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This research will help improve the
wider science community's understanding of how Earth surface processes can
impact the long-term biogeochemical cycling of elements. It will also provide
new insights as to the relationship between carbon dioxide and climate in terms
of temporal forcing and outcome. &lt;br/&gt;
