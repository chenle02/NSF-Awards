The objective of this program is to recreate the functionality of a natural ion
channel using a solid-state nanopore. Natural ion channels are limited to narrow
ranges of temperature and pH, limiting their usability for biosensing
applications which are now emerging. Replacing natural ion channels with
electrostatically controllable solid-state nanopores enables operation of
biosensors in a wide range of environmental conditions. The transformative
aspect of the project is the ability to create a channel that is reconfigurable
via electric fields generated through an arrangement of embedded electrodes in a
particular geometry at the nanoscale level. Combined with the use of
electroactive polymers which enable the amplification of the nanopore on/off
ratio, the proposed platform will be universal and not limited to one particular
application.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is the ability to perform
fundamental studies of ionic and molecular translocation through a nanopore,
helping to gain insight into how permeation can be controlled on the nanoscale.
Using electrostatic fields inside the nanopore, molecules can be temporarily
docked and released, allowing reconfigurable and reusable sensors.&lt;br/&gt;The
broader impacts are on molecular filtration, biosensing, and localized drug
release and thus potentially improve society at large. The proposed
transdisciplinary research will be integrated as an emerging technology into the
graduate and undergraduate curriculum. The proposed middle and high school
outreach program modules will expose students to critical physical concepts
underlying the proposed research, including electric fields, surface tension and
low noise electronics.
