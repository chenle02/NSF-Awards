When a galaxy undergoes vigorous starbirth, supernova explosions and the winds
of massive stars heat the surrounding gas, and can drive it from the galaxy as a
wind. Since stars form only from cool dense gas, this 'feedback' regulates the
pace of starbirth. The Principal Investigator will study gas outflows from star-
forming galaxies, both locally and at distances so large that we see the
galaxies as they were when the cosmos was only half its present age. In the
nearby galaxies, spectral lines of many atoms and ions will be studied across
the face of the galaxy, to trace gas at different stages of ionization and at
different depths within the wind. Radiative transfer computations will be used
to interpret the observations, to search for regions of shocked gas and to
estimate how much mass is leaving the galaxy. These detailed studies will be
used to interpret observations of the more distant galaxies where fewer spectral
lines can be studied. The results will help us to understand how galaxies form,
and what controls the rate at which they make their stars.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two graduate students, a woman and a Latino man, will be
trained by participating in the research. The Principal Investigator accompanies
the 'UC Santa Barbara Physics Circus' annually on a visit to a local elementary
school. She also works with UCSB colleagues to present a popular public lecture
series at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History; the lectures are recorded
and aired on local television. These outreach activities will be supported and
enhanced by her research. The Principal Investigator will also contribute to
research infrastructure by helping to build the science case for instruments for
the planned Thirty Meter Telescope.
