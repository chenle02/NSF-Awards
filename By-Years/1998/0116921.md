The aim of this project is to study the role of mixing and vorticity generated
by breaking waves on the formation and evolution of Langmuir circulations in the
oceanic surface mixed layer. A theoretical model, consistent with data from
recent field experiments, will be developed. This model will extend GLM theory
from the weak-wave regime to a regime in which the surface waves have a more
realistic steepness and will include a representation of vorticity injection by
breaking waves. The dynamics of the model will be explored with numerical
methods. The anticipated outcome is a better model of the development and
structure of Langmuir-cell scale vortical motions in the ocean mixed layer. If
successful, this may be useful in the development of better mixed-layer
representations in large-scale ocean and climate models.
