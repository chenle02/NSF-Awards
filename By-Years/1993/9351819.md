Calvin College's Physics Department intends to strengthen its capabilities in
teaching, to intermediate- and upper-level undergraduates, the fundamental
experimental techniques used in solid-state physics and the neighboring areas of
materials science. To do so, we have selected the major areas of thermal,
magnetic, and electrical measurements, and have devised an instrumentation
initiative which enables these material properties to be measured over a wide
range of temperature. The initiative also introduces students to some of the
basic techniques of materials production widely used in condensed-matter
physics. Our initiative acquired a differential scanning calorimeter system, for
study of specific heat capacity and phase transitions; a magnetic susceptibility
system applicable over the 8-325 K range; and a very versatile electronic
instrument package for electrical transport and polarizability measurement. A
closed-cycle cryocooler is being acquired to provide the temperature control for
the magnetic and electrical measurements. Finally, for purposes of sample
preparation, we have acquired a simple furnace, and basic vacuum evaporation and
sputtering systems, for bulk and thin-film sample and materials preparation.
