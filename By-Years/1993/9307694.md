9307694 Goodnight In recent years the effect of interactions among genes on
evolution in structured populations has received increased attention. This is
due to an appreciation of the ubiquity of structured populations, along with
several recent studies that demonstrate that in subdivided populations gene
interactions can have unique evolutionary consequences%%%% This research is a
theoretical study using analytical and numerical approaches to investigate the
effects of population structure, genetic drift, and selection when there are
gene interactions. The analytical modes will examine the effects of genetic
drift on the distribution of genetic variance in subdivided populations.
Numerical simulation will be used to explore the effects of selection in
subdivided populations. In addition, the simulations will be used to examine the
role of gene interaction in the process of speciation.***
