9732632&lt;br/&gt;Hulet&lt;br/&gt;This work is a continuation of investigations
of quantum degenerate trapped gases of lithium-7 atoms. It expands upon the
previous observation of the PI that condensation is possible in this negative-
scattering-length system, although with a limited number of atoms in the
condensate. It focus on a series of experiments to explore the mechanisms by
which this limit is enforced and to examine the dynamical behavior of the
system. A second effort will focus on looking for a possible BCS-type transition
in a cooled sample of lithium-6 atoms.&lt;br/&gt;
