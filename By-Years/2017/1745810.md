This workshop brings together researchers to discuss current topics and trends
in quantum communications. This meeting addresses a central issue belonging to
the NSF's Quantum Leap Big Idea, related to development of secure and scalable
modes of communication based on quantum phenomena. Participants come from a
diverse pool of convergent disciplines, ranging from chemistry, materials
sciences, engineering to physics and quantum information. A post-meeting report
is planned to summarize the current status and challenges in the field. Members
of underrepresented groups and minorities will be encouraged to apply.
