9600283 Schmitz This award supports a 24 month Science and Technology Agency of
Japan (STA) Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Andrew Schmitz at the Hokkaido
National Research Institute, Sapporo, Japan. Dr. Schmitz will work with Dr.
Tadashi Yoshida, Director of the Macromolecular Science Section, on a research
project entitled "Carbon Dioxide Reforming of Methane". The proposed research
will develop techniques used in carbon dioxide reforming of methane to produce
synthesis gas (carbon monoxide and hydrogen). Synthesis gas is an important
feedstock for production of higher-value chemicals such as methanol, acetic acid
and hydrocarbons. Consequently, carbon dioxide reforming of methane is an
important step in the conversion of two greenhouse gases into useful chemicals.
This reforming reaction can also be used to store energy from a solar, nuclear
or fossil fuel source as chemical energy. The energy can then be released on
demand by reversing the chemical reaction or by synthesis gas combustion. Carbon
dioxide reforming of methane requires high reaction temperatures (in excess of
500 =BAC) where catalyst deactivation is an important concern. To identify
promising multimetallic catalysts for development, research will focus on the
comparative performance of candidate multimetallic catalysts with that of known
monometallic catalysts for carbon dioxide reforming of methane. Catalyst
activity and deactivation rate in the reforming reaction will be evaluated using
a quartz-tube flow reactor. Furthermore, a study of catalyst physicochemical
properties will be used to identify deactivation mechanisms and to tailor
multimetallic catalyst compositions to achieve high activity and high
deactivation resistance. Parameters of focus are identification of which
multimetallic systems show enhanced performance compared to monometallic
systems, and what relative metal concentrations are required to optimize
multimetallic catalyst performance. ***
