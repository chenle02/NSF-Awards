9727783 Belytschko The equipment grant enables the researchers at Northwestern
University to use much larger three-dimensional models than possible so far,
fundamentally changing the qualitative nature of problems solved, and leading to
new breakthroughs. The new equipment also allows to further exploit
parallelization tools in areas includingmeshless methods, multiple scale methods
for complex structures and manufacturing processes, enhanced tribological
performance, mechanics of geomaterials, fracture and fatigue and phase
tranformations. ***
