This three-year award supports U.S.-Italy collaborative research in database
security between Sushil Jajodia, George Mason University, and Elisa Bertino,
University of Milan, Italy. The objective of their research is to produce
flexible mechanisms that could be used to improve access controls in commercial
database management systems. Jajodia brings to the collaboration expertise in
the multilevel relational data model and Bertino, a thorough background in
object-oriented database systems, composite objects, and authorization for next-
generation database systems. The joint research will examine issues related to
access controls in relational databases and in object-oriented data bases, such
as negative and conflicting authorizations, modeling multilevel entities, secure
garbage collection mechanisms, polyinstantiation, and discretionary
authorization.
