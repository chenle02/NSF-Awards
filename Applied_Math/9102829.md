The principal investigator will continue looking at the connection between
variational models of coherent phase transitions, optimal bounds on the
effective moduli of composites and the relaxation of nonconvex variational
problems. In particular, he will attempt to predict the microstructure of two-
phase coherent phase mixtures via bulk energy minimization, evaluate the role of
surface energy in determining the microstructure of coherent phase mixtures, and
derive nonlinear results geometrically from linear ones by means of a theory of
deformations with uniformly small strain.
