The research plan is to develop shape representations for image and video
ulderstanding. The approach is to encode shape and motion in terms of nonrigid
deformations from prototypical or extremal views. This research builds on
previous work in modal matching, an orthogonal shape decomposition for matching,
describing, and comparing shapes despite sensor variations and nonrigid
deformations. Shape and motion coefficients are expressed in terms of the
eigenmodes of deformable shape models. The project extends this modal matching
framework in four main directions; comparison metrics, prototype-based shape
representations, including intensity information, and encoding motion and shape.
Primary system evaluation is on synthetic data sets specifically designed to
characterize algorithm limits with respect to noise and deformation. System
performance is to be evaluated using a large database of images collected by a
world wide web crawler. Towards this end, a web robot is being built. The
educational plan addresses course development and teaching in multimedia
computing, active engagement of undergraduates in research, and outreach for
recruiting a greater number of students from traditionally underrepresented
groups in computer science.
