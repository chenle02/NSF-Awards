This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of Colorado--Boulder
in the purchase of a IBM RS 6000/590 computer. This equipment will enhance
research in a number of areas including the following: Studies of the reactions
of ions with neutral molecules in the gas phase; Ab initio electronic structure
calculations; and Biradical-like Reactive Intermediates. A workstation network
of fast, modern computer workstations is a new way to satisfy the computing
needs of chemistry departments. Such a "computer network" also serves as a
development environment for new theoretical codes and algorithms, provides
state-of-the-art graphics and visualization facilities and supports research in
state-of-the-art applications of parallel processing.
