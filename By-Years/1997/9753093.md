9753093 Barros The objective of this project is to improve upon existing
empirical techniques to quantify rainfall impact by investigating the basic
mechanisms of wind-raindrop interactions in the atmospheric boundary-layer over
surfaces of varying slope, aspect and roughness. Rainfall impact on exposed
surfaces is one of the most critical agents of deterioration of buildings and
infrastructure, and a trigger mechanism of extended soil erosion. The research
approach is to assess rainfall impact based on the kinetic energy and angle of
impact of raindrops, which are determined by atmospheric conditions (average
wind conditions and dynamic stability parameters such as buoyancy and turbulent
shear) and the intrinsic properties of rainfall (intensity and raindrop size
distribution). For this purpose, acoustic emission testing of rainfall impact
will be conducted in the presence and absence of wind, while high-resolution
photography will be used to study the pathways and transformations of raindrops
moving through turbulent boundary-layers simulated in a large-scale wind tunnel.
Ultimately, the goal is to establish a conceptual framework of the physics of
wind-raindrop interactions to address a wide range of science and engineering
problems, such as to estimate soil erodibility indices as a function of climate,
or to define design criteria for building facades. The support provided by the
POWRE program will be used for the acquisition of an acoustic measurement unit
suitable to monitor the impact of rainfall at various locations simultaneously,
and to conduct exploratory wind-tunnel experiments at the Saint Anthony Falls
Hydraulic Laboratory, University of Minnesota. These experiments are essential
to obtain the data necessary to perform an evaluation of the feasibility and
potential success of the proposed research, before a comprehensive investigation
to characterize the fate of raindrops in the atmospheric boundary layer can be
pursued.
