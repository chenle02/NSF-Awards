9512104 Becchetti Studies of nuclear reactions induced by unstable, short-lived
nuclear particles will be carried out, providing insight into how the elements
are formed in supernova and in the Big Bang. The latter takes place on short
time scales and involve the type of nuclear reactions to be studied in this
work. These studies bear on the origin and nature of dark matter. The synthesis
of yet unknown types of nuclei an atoms will be pursued and their
characteristics studies. These are topics of great current interest within the
field. The experiments will be performed primarily at the National
Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (MSU, E. Lansing, MI) and at the University
of Notre Dame Nuclear Science Laboratory (South Bend, IN). Specially designed
large superconducting magnets and associated nuclear particle imaging detectors
will be utilized in the experiments. Both graduate and undergraduate students
will participate in the development and utilization of this equipment. The
students trained in this research will acquire a broad range of "hands-on"
scientific skills to permit them to pursue careers in any of several areas
related to academic and industrial research,or teaching. ***
