Cyberinfrastructure enables collaborative research and significantly impacts
scientific capacity and knowledge diffusion. In response to the growing need for
quantitatively evaluating outcomes and impact of federal investment on research,
this project deploys new data, tools, metrics, and methods for assessing the
impact of cyberinfrastructures and the data services built on them. This
research helps researchers and policy makers understand how cyberinfrastructure
affects collaboration dynamics and network structures of researchers. Datasets
organized by longitudinal, thematic, topical, geographical, institutional, and
author dimensions provided, which researchers, policy makers, and students can
access and use to explore data-intensive science of science and innovation
policy related research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metadata from GenBank, patent data
from U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and funding data from NIH ExPORT are
analyzed with descriptive statistics and models from Complex Network Analysis.
The project not only examines the topological properties of the data submission
and publication networks, but also the temporal ordering of collaborative
relationships and the overlap of the sequence submission and publication
networks. Through slicing, plotting, and visualizing data, appropriate sampling
strategies and algorithms are developed to more deeply explore collaboration
networks, both structurally and temporally. Algorithms used in community
detection, machine learning, and visualization serve as primary computational
methods in this research. Data products to be shared with research communities
include 1) discovery lifecycle datasets containing sequence submissions,
publications, and patents as well as the links between them and 2) funding
factor datasets containing links between U.S. federal funding data and the
discovery lifecycle datasets.
