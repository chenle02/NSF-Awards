This S-STEM project is increasing the numbers and academic success of
undergraduate women prepared to pursue a broad range of careers in science to
meet the growing demand in western Massachusetts, the state and the nation for a
highly skilled workforce. The project is targeting the 125 traditional
undergraduate women who are currently pursuing bachelor's degrees in Biology,
Biotechnology and Forensic Science, and prospective freshman and transfer
students interested in these academic majors and related career pathways.
Project activities are increasing enrollment in the Biology and Biotechnology
majors, increasing enrollment of minority women across all majors, reducing the
retention gap between minority and non-minority students in the first two years,
and increasing the overall numbers of science graduates. A Scholarship Selection
Committee awards scholarships to approximately 20-30 academically talented women
with financial need. Scholarship recipients are also offered paid positions as
laboratory or research assistants or peer tutors. Group professional tutoring is
offered, and Scholars are assigned to faculty mentors. An Advisory Committee
ensures these activities are coordinated and delivered to project participants
and that project goals and objectives are met.
