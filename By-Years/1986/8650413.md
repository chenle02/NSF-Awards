This project provides funds for Eastern Michigan University to strengthen and
expand the Immunology laboratory curriculum and to give students experience in
utilizing state-of-the-art instrumentation. The field of immunology is one of
the fastest growing scientific areas; immunological techniques are used by an
ever increasing number of scientists in a multitude of disciplines. Because of
the wide application of immunological methods in biotechnology, a basic
laboratory course in immunology is fundamental for students in biology,
chemistry, microbiology, immunology and related disciplines. The equipment
needed to implement the curricular revisions include an inverted phase contrast
fluorescent microscope, enzyme immunoassay reader-spectrophotometer,
scintillation counter, laminar flow hood, CO2 incubator, refrigerated
centrifuge, and immunoblot membrane filtration assay system. This equipment will
allow EMU's Biology faculty to focus on current techniques in both the cellular
and humoral aspects of the immune system. Curricular changes will result in an
ability to teach both basic and advanced techniques in one of the most
demanding, useful and interesting areas of science. The techniques learned will
provide a firm foundation for students seeking advanced courses in basic
sciences, and these methodologies will prove useful for future scientists in
academic or industrial research settings. This project holds considerable
promise for helping EMU's Biology Department to make an important advance in
modernizing its curriculum.
