Two new senior electives in signal processing with emphasis on digital filter
design and biomedical signal processing and systems are now being offered. This
new undergraduate program emphasis in signal processing requires a laboratory
that would provide experience in working on practical applications of signal
processing. A real-time signal processing laboratory that would support the
experiments and projects illustrating the concepts and techniques covered in the
two new senior electives and in the required junior-level course in filter
design is being developed. Emphasis will center on student educational projects
involving the processing of a variety of signals including speech, music,
seismic, biomedical, and video. The laboratory experience will be in the
acquisition as well as in the processing of these signals. The laboratory would
also serve as a test bed for VLSI signal processing architectures. The
laboratory is based on a central server computer networked via Ethernet to
workstations and personal computers. Personal computers will be used for the
acquisition and processing of temporal signals and for low level processing and
display of images that have been acquired by the server.
