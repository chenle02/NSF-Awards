This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
fundamentally new type of residual gas analyzer based on a novel ion source
concept. The new instrument will have a combination of performance, cost and
size parameters that greatly exceeds those of commercially available
instruments. The technical objectives of Phase I are to: (1) design and
construct a proof-of-principle experiment for the instrument concept; (2)
conduct tests to characterize the basic performance of the new instrument; and
(3) develop the preliminary design for a Phase II prototype instrument. If the
Phase I project is successful in demonstrating high sensitivity over a wide mass
range, it will provide a firm foundation for further development in Phase II.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will provide the basis for the development of
a new residual gas analyzer with substantial advantages in terms of cost, size
and performance over existing systems. The new instrument will reduce capital
and manufacturing costs in industries such as semiconductor manufacturing,
vacuum coating, electro-optics, and chemical processing. It will also have
widespread uses at research and educational institutions.
