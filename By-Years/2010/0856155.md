Solid foams have high stiffness- and strength-to-weight ratios, excellent energy
absorption characteristics and exceptional insulation and acoustic properties.
They are thus ideal materials as cores in sandwich structures, in impact
mitigation and energy absorption applications in vehicles of all kinds, as
insulation materials for sound and heat, for energy storage, etc. These
characteristics arise from their cellular microstructure. This project uses
X-ray tomography to characterize such microstructures. The geometry extracted is
introduced into micromechanically accurate analytical and finite element models
that are used together with the properties of the base material to calculate the
mechanical response to compressive loads. The uniqueness of the project is that
it models the initial elastic properties, the onset of yielding, the level and
extent of the stress plateau and ends with densification. The new work will
introduce the randomness of the microstructure to the models as well as the
behavior under multiaxial and dynamically applied loads. Both polymeric and
metallic open- and closed-cell foams will be analyzed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project aims to bring science to a hitherto empirical subject. The models and
closed-form expressions of properties developed can be used to design foams to
fit the application. The project will train researchers to become future leaders
in multidisciplinary research in academia and industry. The results are
disseminated through journal publications, conferences and university lectures
and through contact with international and industrial researchers in the field.
The latter serve to disseminate results directly to users and help keep the
project pointed towards what is practical.
