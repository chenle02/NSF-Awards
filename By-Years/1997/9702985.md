9702985 Ross The research portion this proposal is directed toward an
understanding of the cell adhesion process between bacterial cells and collagen
extracellular matrices. The ultimate goal is to better understand the bacterial
disease initiation process. The PI's hypothesis is that the ability of S. sureus
to adhere to collagen under physiological flow conditions is directly related to
the number of collagen receptors on the bacteria. Thus, the number of collagen
receptors will be determined, the cell adhesion measured, and the correlation
tested. The impact of fluid shear on receptor expression will also be
determined. The educational plan centers around increasing the participation of
women in the engineering profession. Academically talented young women will be
coached from high school through their undergraduate engineering training.
Research opportunities will be developed for juniors and seniors. ***
