OCE-9415632 Gravity, magnetic, side-scan sonar, and bathymetric data will be
collected on the east flank of the East Pacific Rise between 15 and 20 degrees
south. This region has four anomalous features: gravity lineations, abundant
seamounts, asymmetric subsidence, and asymmetric spreading. The primary
questions: are whether there are gravity lineations on the Nazca plate, does
small-scale convection in the Pacific asthenosphere bring about the anomalous
low subsidence of young Pacific seafloor, are the seamounts symmetrically
distributed about the axis, and how is the long- wavelength segmentation of the
ridge axis expressed off axis.
