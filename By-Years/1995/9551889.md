This grant is funding the purchase of one Silicon Graphics Indigo2 and four
Indys plus complementary software for the improvement of the chemistry
undergraduate curriculum to include course and laboratory work in computational
chemistry and molecular graphics. The courses that are affected most directly
are the biochemistry laboratory courses and NMR Methods. Biochemistry is being
expanded to include areas of structural biology, enabling students to analyze
protein and nucleic acid structures and perform energy calculations. In NMR
Methods, students learn modern techniques for problem-solving and structure
elucidation. New experiments are being added to the physical, organic, and
inorganic chemistry courses. The graphics display is being used as a lecture aid
in the lower- division classes. The SGI workstations offer outstanding 3D
graphical and calculational capabilities and are ubiquitous in teaching and
research.
