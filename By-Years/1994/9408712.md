9408712 Coleman Since 1978, long-term research has been conducted on the effects
of tillage regimes and the impacts of biotic manipulations on soil organic
matter (SOM) dynamics and nutrient cycling processes in southeastern
agroecosystems. Several studies have provided information on the long-term
changes which are occurring over time-spans of decades. This project will
maintain these long-term experiments. A comparative approach will continue to be
used in three core areas: soil structure, food webs, and education. This work
will continue to be of importance not only in the context of basic ecological
relationships, but also as a guide for improvement of agricultural practices. As
a project it is an excellent example of the immediate linkage between
fundamental discovery and application.
