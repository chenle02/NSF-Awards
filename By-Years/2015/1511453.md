CBET - 1511453&lt;br/&gt;PI: McCarthy, Matthew&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of
this project are to develop heterogeneous surface structures and investigate
effects of spatially varying surface wettability and thermal conductivity on
wetting and heat transfer rates during condensation. The project seeks to
improve heat transfer rates by maintaining precise control of the liquid-vapor
interfaces and segregating wetted and non-wetted regions on engineered surfaces.
Thus, results of the project could improve the design of heat transfer systems
and increase energy efficiency for a variety of applications, including
electronics cooling, desalination and water purification, and chemical
processing. The project will involve graduate and undergraduate students, and
outreach activities are planned to engage local students, especially those from
under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will combine bio-
templated nanofabrication techniques and initiated chemical vapor deposition
(iCVD) to create heterogeneous surfaces with patterned variations in wettability
and thermal conductivity. The bio-templating process uses self-assembly and
metallization of the Tobacco mosaic virus to create a uniform layer of high
surface area nanostructures. iCVD is used to coat the nanostructured surfaces
with thin layers of low surface energy polymeric materials. The combination of
mixed wettability and mixed conductivity will provide spatial control over
condensate droplets to enhance heat transfer. The investigators will use
confocal scanning laser microscopy and high-speed imaging during condensation
and condensate removal to characterize the performance of surfaces and the
effects of heterogeneous architectures. Results could guide practitioners in
improving condensation heat transfer rates by enabling precise control over
condensate dynamics.
