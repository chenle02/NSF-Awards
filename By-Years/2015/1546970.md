The Computational Cybersecurity in Compromised Environments (C3E) is a community
of interest that has annually gathered, since its inception in 2009, to address
some of the most arduous challenges of cybersecurity. Through these annual
workshops and planning meetings, C3E provides a forum for multi-disciplinary
researchers from the top academic, industry, and government to discuss
innovative approaches to the cybersecurity challenges facing our Nation. This
year the challenge will be related to cyber
deterrence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This travel grant will support an estimated ten
travelers to the 2015 C3E workshops. The results of these workshops will be
widely disseminated in the open literature, including on the CPS-VO web portal.
Additionally, this workshop and its challenge problems will create excellent
opportunity for students to engage with leaders in the field in the context of
unsolved problems.
