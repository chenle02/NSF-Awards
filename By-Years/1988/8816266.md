This award will support U.S. participants in an international workshop on the
magnetic properties of low dimensional systems. The workshop is jointly
organized by Professor Leo Falicov of the University of California, Berkeley and
Professor Jose L. Moran-Lopez of the Autonomous University of San Luis Potosi,
Mexico. Both investigators had previously organized a very successful workshop
on the same general topic in 1986. The subject of magnetism in restricted
dimensionality is one of increasing importance, not only because of the possible
enormous economic impact that magnetic recording is having in high technology
industries, but also because better equipment and techniques for surface science
make possible the discovery of new substances with magnetic properties and new
manufacturing techniques with small clusters (inks), thin films, and microscopic
periodic structures. This workshop will serve to assemble for 5 days a group of
scientists to discuss the state-of-the-art, learn from one another, and explore
future research collaborations.
