The Burnham Institute in California has been awarded a grant to develop modern
tools for comparing protein structures by treating them, true to their real
character, as flexible entities. Because of the limitations of the currently
available protein analysis and comparison tools, a whole class of questions
about changes in protein structure cannot be addressed with publicly available
software tools. The preliminary results of the flexible protein structure
alignment algorithm developed at the Burnham Institute suggest that it will be
able to address many of the shortcomings of the rigid body structure comparison
programs.
