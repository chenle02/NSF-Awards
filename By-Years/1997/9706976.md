9706976 Hartshorn This renewal award is to conduct Phase III of the Arthropods
of La Selva (ALAS) survey; Phases I and II were also funded by the Biotic
Surveys &amp; Inventories Program in partnership with the International Program
of NSF. As this Phase is finished, ALAS will be sufficiently near completion
that other types of studies (monographic and ecological) can be conducted on the
organisms discovered by ALAS. Since 1991, the project has built scientific
infrastructure (both physical and in terms of human resources) in Costa Rica,
formed strong partnerships with the Instituto Nacional de Biodiversidad of Costa
Rica, databased and prepared 84,000 specimens of arthropods collected at La
Selva, and designed and published a specimen-level database application (Biota).
Results of the project are being published as WWW information resources
(http://viceroy.eeb.uconn.edu/ALAS/ALAS.html). This phase of funding will
support continued species discovery, distribution of specimens to a variety of
specialists, productive use of the infrastructure that is already in place, and
innovative use of emerging technologies to increase efficiency of data capture
and dissemination.
