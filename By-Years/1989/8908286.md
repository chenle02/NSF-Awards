Various matching problems in strings, multi-dimensional arrays, and trees are
useful in computer science and related disciplines. A well- studied problem is
the exact matching problem, which is to find all occurrences of a pattern in a
text. However, exact matching is only a special case. Scientists in all fields
often need to analyze situations where the data is not completely reliable. The
first goal of this project is to find efficient serial and parallel algorithms
for the "inexact" matching problem. Following the technological developments of
the past decades we reached the point where the speed of hardware components is
very close to the physical lower bounds. Thus, it seems that the most feasible
way to increase the speed of computations substantially is by making them more
efficient. Inspired by this perception this project will also focus on the
following interlacing aspects of computation theory: design of efficient
parallel algorithms that work on an abstract machine model known in the
literature as PRAM, and design if efficient distributed algorithms for various
network models.
