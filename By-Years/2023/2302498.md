This award supports participation in the Southwest Local Algebra Meeting at the
University of North Texas, March 4–5, 2023. The conference will catalyze
interactions between students and faculty from institutions throughout the
Southwest working broadly in rings, fields, and groups. Algebraists in the
region pursue research on a variety of topics under the umbrella of pure and
applied algebra, but the geographical distances between institutions make it
difficult to establish new collaborations. This meeting will bring together
students and faculty from a variety of backgrounds for lively talks, scientific
interactions, and professional networking, with ample time to explore new
research projects. About 80 – 100 participants are expected from throughout the
Southwest and South regions, including graduate students and both junior and
senior faculty. The meeting particularly encourages participation of algebraists
from groups historically underrepresented in mathematics, as well as nontenured
faculty and faculty at non-PhD-granting institutions.

Algebraic structures are crucial to many branches of mathematics, including
coding theory, cryptography, combinatorics, geometry, topology, number theory,
and mathematical physics. At this conference, six experts will deliver hour-long
talks accessible to graduate students, and students will present research in
three hour-long poster sessions. The speakers are specialists in algebraic
combinatorics, automorphic forms, homological algebra, algebraic geometry, non-
commutative geometry, and both commutative and non-commutative algebra. This
variety of interests is expected to bolster creative interactions between
participants. More information can be found at the conference webpage:
