This project will support curriculum development for a collection of
combinatorics courses which will be offered to first-year students at the
University of Michigan. These courses will offer an alternative to calculus as
first courses in mathematics at the college level. They are designed to be
challenging courses which stress experimentation and discovery as vehicles for
learning. The goals of this curriculum development effort include: (1) the
development of critical and independent thinking by students of mathematics
early in their mathematical education; (2) the creation of a new alternate
vision of mathematics which points out its experimental side; and (3) the
generation of excitement about mathematics by those beginning its study at the
undergraduate level.
