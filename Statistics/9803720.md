Project: Statisitcal Analysis of Longitudinal Studies and Surveys with Missing
Values Abstract: Many empirical studies have problems with missing data, where
subjects with missing values differ systematically from subjects with complete
data. Discarding the incomplete cases leads to bias and loss of efficiency.
Model-based statistical methods allow for efficient and valid inferences based
on all the data, but require careful attention to correct modeling of the data
and the missing data mechanism. This research will develop new Bayesian and
maximum likelihood methods for handling incomplete data in the following
problems: Longitudinal data where study subjects are measured repeatedly over
time, and subjects are missing at certain times, or drop out of the study
prematurely; and survey data from complex survey designs where subjects have
differential probabilities of selection and nonresponse. Results from many
research studies are hard to interpret because of missing data. In an opinion
poll some of the randomly chosen subjects refuse to answer some of the
questions, and results based on the respondents may not be representative of the
population. In clinical trials some patients may drop out of the study because
they cannot tolerate a particular treatment, or simply move to a different
location and cannot be traced. Statistical methods for analyzing data with
missing values use partial information on nonrespondents to provide more precise
and more accurate answers than can be obtained by analyzing only the complete
cases.
