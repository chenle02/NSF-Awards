Computer systems are increasingly central to national infrastructure in the
financial, medical, manufacturing, defense, and other domains. This
infrastructure is at risk from sophisticated cyber-adversaries backed by
powerful nation-states, whose capabilities rapidly evolve, demanding equally
rapid responses. This calls for advances in artificial intelligence and
autonomous reasoning that are tightly integrated with advanced security
techniques to identify and correct vulnerabilities, detect threats and attribute
them to adversaries, and mitigate and recover from attacks. The ACTION Institute
will develop novel approaches that leverage artificial intelligence–informed by
and working with experts in security operations–to perform security tasks
rapidly and at scale, anticipating the moves of an adversary and taking
corrective actions to protect the security of computer networks as well as
people’s safety. The Institute will function as a nexus for the AI and
cybersecurity communities, and its research efforts will be complemented by
innovation in education from K-12 to postdoctoral students, the development of
new tools for workforce development, and the creation of new opportunities for
collaboration among the Institute’s organizations and with external industry
partners. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The AI Institute will initiate a revolutionary
approach to cybersecurity, in which AI-enabled intelligent security agents
cooperate with humans across the cyber-defense life cycle to jointly improve the
security posture of complex computer systems over time. Intelligent security
agents will follow a new paradigm of continuous, lifelong learning both
autonomously and in collaboration with human experts, supported by a shared
knowledge bank and an integrated AI stack that provides novel fundamental
primitives for (1) reasoning and learning that incorporates domain knowledge,
(2) human-agent interaction, (3) multi-agent collaboration, and (4) strategic
gaming and tactical planning. Over time, these intelligent security agents will
improve their domain knowledge, becoming increasingly robust and effective in
the face of changes in the adversaries’ modes of operation, composing defense
strategies and tactical plans in the presence of uncertainty, collaborating with
each other and with humans for mutually complementary teaming, and adapting to
unfamiliar and novel attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Department of Homeland
Security and IBM are partnering with NSF to provide funding for this
Institute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
