Quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity are the two central pillars on
which contemporary physics rests. Quantum field theory links and builds on them,
thus constituting our most fundamental physical theory. It is of proven
predictive and explanatory power. Yet this power has been purchased at
considerable conceptual costs: the conceptual foundations of quantum field
theory are ill-understood. Success in deriving predictions from its complex
mathematical formalism has not required the kind of clear analysis which is the
goal philosophy of physics. Previous research by Professor Healey has resulted
in an interpretation of non-relativistic quantum theory. In this research, he is
investigating the prospects of extending this work to an interpretation of
quantum field theory. If this extension proves possible, this would result in a
significant advance in our most fundamental physical theory. But the possibility
of the extension is not a presupposition of this research. Whether or not the
interactive interpretation that he has already advanced can be successfully
extended to quantum field theory, progress in understanding that theory is most
likely to result from a focused investigation which begins with a definite
interpretation of ordinary quantum mechanics, even if that interpretation must
be more or less radically modified before it yields understanding of quantum
field theory.
