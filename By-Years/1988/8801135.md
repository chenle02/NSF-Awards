The topology of smooth 4-dimensional manifolds will be studied by classical
techniques as well as by new methods from gauge theory. For example, a certain
infinite family of homotopy 4-spheres will be studied. This should provide
evidence for or against the 4-dimensional smooth Poincare conjecture, one of the
most notorious conjectures in topology.
