Weibel proposes to do research in the related fields of algebraic K-theory and
motivic theory. First, he proposes to complete the proof of a theorem which
describes the relationship that K-theory and motivic cohomology have with the
related fields of algebraic geometry and number theory. A second part of the
project is to apply new motivic techniques to long-standing problems in
algebraic geometry dealing with singularities. The third part of the project
will be to study the internal structure of motives in an attempt to explain the
behavior of Chow groups, which are classical invariants of algebraic
varieties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, Weibel proposes three strands of
research. He will try to establish the existence of Rost varieties, completing
the verification of the Bloch-Kato Conjecture. This conjecture links K-theory to
number theory and etale cohomology. He will also study the relationship between
the singularities of a variety, its K-theory and its cdh-cohomology, using
recently developed cohomological techniques. This involves several classical
questions about the K-theory of rings of integers in global fields which have
been a focal point of research in K-theory for the last 35 years, especially in
the last decade. In addition, he will study the structure of Motives, especially
the structure of slice filtration, as a way of attacking conjectures about
vanishing of Chow groups and higher Chow groups.&lt;br/&gt;
