This project is a small-scale, high-risk, high-potential effort to capitalize on
recent work on room temperature fusion. The P.I. is an experienced materials
scientist -- unlike most other workers in this field -- and intends to test out
possible substitutes for the expensive palladium now used in such experiments.
If successful, this work could have a major effect in making this technology
economically affordable.
