This award, a renewal of an earlier one, to Washington University by the Solid
State Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research is to develop an
understanding of factors governing the synthesis of metal nanostructures so that
one may predictably prepare them with well-controlled shapes, sizes, and
compositions for integration into various technologies. The main focus of this
work will be on the mechanistic studies of the generation and control of the
twin defects in the nanostructures and hence a deeper understanding of the
fundamental framework within which nanostructures of a certain shape can be
fabricated. This is an important area and yet challenging issue in nanoscience
and nanotechnology in that the materials properties and functionalities (e.g.,
photonics and catalysis) are sensitively dependent upon the surface
morphologies. The current state of the art is more like art than science. The
proposed work is anticipated to offer some fundamental insights to the
mechanistic control and hence a rationale for materials design and preparation.
Such a fundamental understanding is highly relevant to design such nanoparticles
for applications in sensing, electronics, catalysis and medicine.

The project has links with many scientific disciplines that include solid state
chemistry/physics, catalysis, and photonics, and has potential applications in
medicine, environment, energy and other fields. The PI plans to continue to
widely disseminate the results from his studies to the science community. This
project, if successful, is expected to provide new advances in such areas as new
class of nanomaterials for sensing, biomedical applications, and catalysis that
will address issues related to national security, health, environment, and
energy. In addition, the planned research is expected to enhance both graduate
and undergraduate education through this multidisciplinary research and
training.
