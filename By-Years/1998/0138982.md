This project will investigate the processes of formation and evolution of polar
mesospheric summer echoes (PMSE) and mesospheric summer echoes (MSE). Non-
turbulent and weakly turbulent PMSE and MSE events will be investigated through
a combination of modeling studies and observational data from radar and rocket-
based instrumentation. Rocket data will provide ion, electron, and temperature
profiles at very high vertical resolution which can be used to constrain the
modeling problems. The anticipated outcomes of this project are a comprehensive
understanding of PMSE and MSE formation and structure and interpretation of
rocket and radar data, which will lead to enhanced design of experiments and
instruments.
