for Undergraduates This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site
project supports eight students per year in programs carried out during the
summers, for three years. Five of the students are from other than the home
institution and significant effort is directed at recruiting women and minority
students. Areas of research in which the students will be involved include
parallel algorithms, system development environments, human-machine interfaces,
algorithm animation, and programming languages. The student will perform
independent research, give oral presentations on their work, prepare scientific
papers, and present their work at seminars at their home institutions and
national and regional meetings.
