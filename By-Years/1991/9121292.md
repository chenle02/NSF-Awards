The objective of this research project is to study the effects of differential
excitations along the base of a dam, caused by spatially varying earthquake
ground motion. The standard procedure is to assume that all points at the base
of the dam simultaneously experience the same earthquake-induced ground motion -
that is, that the dam is shaken by the motion of a rigid plate on which it
rests. In contrast, this study accounts for phase delay and incoherence effects
of the base excitations arising from the propagation and scattering of seismic
waves. Appropriate ground motion data are now available from the analysis and
stochastic modeling of recent accelerograph recordings on and near earth dams.
The research program involves: 1) The selection of a suitable ground motion
model from these data; 2) A linear random vibration analysis of a three-
dimensional earth dam model to study the effects of spatially varying ground
motions; 3) The development of approximate excitation specifications that yield
reasonable responses when the dam is analyzed using a two- dimensional model; 4)
A preliminary assessment of topographical effects; 5) Investigation of the non-
linear response using the method of equivalent linearization, with verification
by Monte Carlo simulation. The results from this research are relevant to safety
evaluations of existing earth dams, as well as to the design of new earth dams.
