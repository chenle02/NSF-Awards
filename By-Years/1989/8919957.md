Epicuticular hydrocarbons (HC) of insects play an essential role in their
adaptation to terrestrial environments because they help decrease cuticle
permeability to water, thereby reducing the risk of lethal dehydration. (The
cuticle is the external, hardened tissue which surrounds the body of an insect.
The epicuticle is the outermost layer of the cuticle.) The epicuticular HC also
perform a pheromonal function during courtship and mating of some Drosophila
species. The principal investigators have discovered that variation in the
epicuticular HC profile of male D. mojavensis is responsible for a large
proportion of intermale variation in male success--females mate five times more
frequently with males whose epicuticular HC profile is similar to that of males
raised at 17o C. The proposed research will examine the relationship between
variation in the abiotic and biotic environmental factors (temperature,
humidity, diet, etc.) that have been found in laboratory experiments to be
responsible for variation in epicuticular HC composition, cuticle permeability,
and sexual behavior in D. mojavensis. Data for all three parameters will be
obtained both in the lab and in the field under natural conditions, in concert
with a detailed assessment of the microhabitat climatological regime encountered
by male and female D. mojavensis during the course of their daily activities.
Additional field and laboratory experiments will assess the impact of variation
in the three parameters on the mating system of D. mojavensis. This research is
unique in that it promises to identify a biological trait that plays an
important role in individual survival as well as reproduction.
