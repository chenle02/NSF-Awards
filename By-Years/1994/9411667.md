9411667 Collier This project is the dissertation research of a cultural
anthropology student from Stanford, California. The project will examine how
residents of Granada, Spain understand their legal and cultural (ethnic)
identities in light of recent social and political changes. The student will
interview Spaniards who migrated to northern Europe a generation ago and
returned, and compare them to Spaniards of Moroccan ancestry who migrated to
Spain more recently. Both groups were considered culturally "inferior" in the
place they migrated to, and now are part of the expanded European Economic
Community. The project will describe how these people understand the
"rebordering" of the mediterranean through an examination of oral histories,
participant observation, archival research. This research is important because
it will illuminate the changes in ethnic relations in a country that was
previously thought to be more foreign but is now more tightly integrated into
the European community. Understanding how people change their sense of being "at
home" in different places will help planners develop programs to better
integrate foreigners into host societies.
