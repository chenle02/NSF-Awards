University of Maryland Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the heart of the
University of Maryland VIGRE project are Research Interaction Teams (RIT's),
usually consisting of one or more faculty, a postdoc, three to five graduate
students, and one or more undergraduates. Each team has a research focus with
component projects appropriate to each of its members. Team Plans are advertised
on the web. Students contract to an appropriate level of involvement. This
format provides undergraduates with an introduction to research, graduate
students with early entry into the research environment and postdoctoral fellows
with a working community. Advising and mentoring form an intrinsic part of this
team structure, as does oral and written presentation. The VIGRE Graduate
Traineeship, Postdoctoral Associate and Research Experience for Undergraduate
programs integrate naturally into this team approach.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three properties distinguish the Maryland VIGRE program
from other team based approaches: First, the Research Team approach is becoming
pervasive throughout all disciplines. Second, because of this the resources of
the VIGRE program are accessible to all disciplines in our Mathematics, Applied
Mathematics and Statistics programs. Third, our demonstrated success in
addressing diversity, especially the retention of underrepresented groups, is
strongly reinforced by the VIGRE program. The VIGRE Program at Maryland through
its Research Interaction Teams brings a significant cultural change with
increased activity, accessibility and accountability in our professional and
educational practices. &lt;br/&gt;
