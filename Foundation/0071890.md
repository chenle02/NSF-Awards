Scanlon investigates the structure of definable sets in theories of enriched
fields with an eye towards applications in diophantine and algebraic geometry.
In many theories of enriched fields, for example differential, difference and
valued D-fields, the definable sets are known to enjoy strong regularity
properties, but in most cases the determination of the full induced structure on
even one-dimensional sets has proved elusive. Scanlon seeks to determine this
structure on minimal sets in differentially closed and difference closed fields
and to resolve foundational issues for the theory of valued D-fields in
preparation to study the fine structure of their definable sets. The main
trichotomy theorem on Zariski geometries, or more exactly the locally modular
versus non-orthogonal to an infinite field dichotomy for Zariski groups, implies
finiteness and uniformity theorems for certain subgroups and subvarieties of
algebraic groups. Scanlon exploits this connection, especially by studying
extensions of the Drinfeld module analogue of the Manin-Mumford conjecture to
higher dimensional T-modules and of the Tate-Voloch conjecture in the case of
p-adically transcendental moduli. Scanlon searches for mathematically meaningful
interpretations of the triviality of certain definable sets in differential or
difference fields by concentrating on certain subsets of moduli spaces of
Shimura varieties definable in some difference closed fields. Scanlon studies
inverse problems in model theoretic algebra. Specifically, Scanlon addresses the
questions of which fields are stable and which fields are supersimple.

Scanlon undertakes this project to exhibit how the deep, though apparently
abstract, theorems of stability theory manifest themselves in concrete
mathematical practice. Some such phenomena have already been discovered. Given
the strength of these abstract theorems, a systematic search to interpret them
can only lead to strong uniformity results on the number and properties of
solutions to algebraic, differential, and difference equations not readily
perceived from an elementary perspective.
