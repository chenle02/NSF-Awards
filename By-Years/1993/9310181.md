9310181 Rusak Theoretical research is to be carried out of the vortex breakdown
phenomenon with an approach utilizing helical symmetry. With the governing
equations based on a helical coordinate system, various asymptotic and numerical
solutions will be obtained bearing on: standing helical waves, developing
stagnation regions, failure of boundary layer approximations, and conical flows
with helical symmetry. New criteria for the onset of breakdown in swirling flows
are to be developed from such solutions. Vortex breakdown occurs on aircraft and
in internal flows with swirl, such as for example combustion systems in boilers.
Its mechanisms are as yet only incompletely understood. ***
