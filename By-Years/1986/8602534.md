The use of Linear Programming (LP) is pervasive throughout government, industry
and defense. Demand for faster and more robust algorithms to solve LP's is very
high. The recent work of Karmarkar has shown considerable promise in satisfying
that demand, but there is considerable work to be done in comparison to the
Simplex Method, Extensions of the new method, and establishment of classes of
problems wherein one method is superior. Professor Todd has proposed to do this,
with special emphasis on the solving of large economic equilibrium problems.
