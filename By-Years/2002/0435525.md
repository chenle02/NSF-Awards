Modern society is becoming increasingly dependent on the Internet for instant
access to information, and the broadband access will have a strong positive im-
pact on this. This project will create new knowledge on the design, analysis,
and operation of novel broadband access network architectures, protocols, and
algo-rithms. It will specifically investigate unified scheduling and resource
allocation in broadband access networks, as well as network economics for
building ``open access networks''. In access networks, control-plane delays are
large since end users and the central office (through which users connect to the
Internet) are separated by a significant distance, typically several kilometers.
Hence, known scheduling algorithms for packet-based networks are difficult to
apply. Therefore, in this project, new knowledge will be created on hierarchical
scheduling algorithms which are ``cousin fair" (as opposed to ``sibling fair").
Remote-scheduling algorithms need to be developed which are fair, support dif-
ferent classes of service, provide guarantees on Quality of Service (QoS) and
are scalable in number of users. New knowledge will also be created on network
economics for building ``open access networks'', designed for competition among
multiple service providers.
