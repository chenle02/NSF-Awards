Given the imbalance between supply and demand of cybersecurity workforce and its
impact on national security and the economy, a team of academic institutions,
led by Whatcom Community College, will dramatically increase the contribution of
two-year colleges in this critical area. This project has two major
goals:&lt;br/&gt;(1) in three years, double the number of community colleges
holding the "National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance
2-Year Education" (CAE2Y) designation sponsored by the National Security Agency
(NSA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS); and&lt;br/&gt;(2) create
and disseminate "CSP-Cyber," a cybersecurity-themed version of the AP course
"Computer Science Principles" (CSP), which is being finalized by a team of
computer science educators organized by the College Board and
NSF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To support the first goal, the project will grow and
strengthen a strong national network of experienced, effective faculty mentors
who have successfully completed the NSA's Knowledge Units (KU) mapping and the
CAE2Y application process. These mentors will work with faculty at other
colleges to complete the CAE2Y application and will leverage the resources
offered by NSF's ATE centers for cybersecurity education, such as the National
CyberWatch Center, CyberWatch West, and the Center for Systems Security and
Information Assurance (CSSIA). To support the second goal, the project will
engage faculty at CAE2Y-designated colleges (as well as those seeking the
designation) and other computer science educators, including those who have been
involved in the development of the CSP course nationally, to develop and pilot
the planned cybersecurity-themed CSP course, train community college faculty to
teach the new course, and disseminate it nationally.
