Abscisic acid (ABA) regulates many aspects of plant growth and development, but
the chain of events between recognition and cellular response remains obscure.
Dr. Finkelstein's overall objective is to identify proteins involved in ABA
action and study their function by physiological, biochemical and molecular
genetic analysis. She is using mutants of Arabidopsis with altered sensitivity
to ABA to identify genes involved in ABA response. Dr. Finkelstein has also
isolated Arabidopsis genomic clones with homology to the maize ABA-insensitive
locus, vp1. She proposes to analyze their function by: 1) determining whether
they correspond to any of the ABI loci; 2) characterizing the developmental
specificity of their expression in both wild type and abi plants; 3) DNA
sequence analysis and 4) immunolocalization. If neither sequence cosegregates
with any abi locus, she will attempt to create a mutant phenotype using
antisense genes. %%% THe plant growth regulator abscisic acid affects many
aspects of a plants growth and development, including embryo development, seed
dormancy, water relations, cell elongation, tolerance to a variety of
environmental stresses and senescence. This study will identify some of the
genes involved in abscisic acid action.
