The development of sophisticated yet inexpensive integrated circuits and the
associated development of microprocessors have made it possible to find feasible
solutions to complex problems in multidimensional signal processing using state-
of-the-art microcomputers with specifically designed peripherals. Senior
undergraduate laboratory projects will be developed based on such microcomputers
equipped with application oriented hardware and software for signal processing
1-D and 2-D. Twenty sets of state-of-the-art, compatible microcomputers and
peripherals such as video digitizers, image acquisition and display units,
motherboard packages including development system for DSP systems that allow 1-D
signal processing and real-time parameter modification will be acquired. This
laboratory program will enable senior students to have hands-on experience in
various applications of digital signal processing, image analysis and computer
vision to complement multidimensional signal processing courses and project
laboratories. Such practical experience will provide the students with a better
background for future work in solving present problems in multidimensional
signal processing ranging from speech synthesizers to automated image matching
and analysis.
