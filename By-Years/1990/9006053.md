Lasers provide the chemist and physicist with the means of carrying out high
resolution, high sensitivity experiments using most of the infrared to ultra-
violet spectrum. If laser instrumentation is combined into a central laser
laboratory, the research of a group of top-notch investigators can be
effectively enhanced. The Department of Chemistry at Purdue University will use
this award from the Chemical Instrumentation Program to help acquire modern
laser instrumentation. The areas of research that will will be enhanced by the
acquisition include the following: 1. Transient Triplet State Depolarization
Studies of Depolar- ization Friction in Viscous Liquids and Polymer Solutions.
2. Ion Chemistry Studied in a Quadrupole Ion Trap 3. Photochemistry and
Photophysics of Doubly Charged Transition-Metal Containing Ions in the Gas Phase
4. Multiresonant Spectroscopic Probes of Structure and Dynamics in Excited
States of Triatomic Radicals 5. On the Reactivity of Binuclear Organometallic
Charge- Transfer States with CO2 6. Two-Photon Spectroscopy of Inorganic
Compounds in Fluid Solution 7. Inorganic Exciplexes and DNA Binding Studies 8.
Bioorganic and Physical-organic Photochemistry 9. The Photochemistry of Early
Transition Metal Alkyl and Related Functional Groups 10. Surface Unenhanced
Raman and Resonance Raman Spectroscopy of Electrochemical Interfaces 11. Proton
Transfer Dynamics: The Methyl Rotor as a Probe of Electronic Coupling to the
Proton Transfer State 12. Spectroscopic Probes of Proton Transfer States
