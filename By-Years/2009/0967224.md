0967224&lt;br/&gt;White&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will aid development
of the fundamental understanding necessary to determine how a turbulent flow
interacts with an eroding or ablating surface. Specifically, the coherent
structures within a turbulent boundary layer, for example, trigger and drive the
growth of non-uniform surface topography. In turn, the evolving topography
influences the coherent structures within the turbulent flow. The coupling
between the flow and solid structures can exist under either isothermal or non-
isothermal conditions involving heat transfer.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The research team includes
investigators at the University of Vermont and the University of New Hampshire.
The computational component of the research is aimed at developing a generalized
algorithm to simulate the spatially-varying ablation of an initially-smooth
surface under heated conditions. Corresponding experimentation will involve
acquisition of detailed data to validate the computational model. The model will
be based upon the direct numerical simulation methodology which is capable of
predicting the fine detail of the flow field as well as the potentially complex
surface shape evolution. Correspondingly, the experimental program will utilize,
for example, particle image velocimetry to measure the detail of the flow
structure, as well as optical methods to capture the surface shape evolution.
Both isothermal and non-isothermal conditions will be
considered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The coupled dynamics of
turbulent flow and surface erosion or ablation is important in applications
ranging from high speed flight to latent energy storage. Additional applications
include erosion and movement of sand or soil around bridge pilings, and beach
erosion. The research will involve a diverse cadre of undergraduate students
while a special topics graduate course will address the integration of
experiment and computation.
