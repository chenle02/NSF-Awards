The proposal focuses on developing statistical methods and related theory for
fast functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to sharply improve the time-
resolution of present techniques. Our objective is to improve the time-
resolution of functional magnetic resonance imaging by sampling only a small
fraction of the Fourier transform of the spin density, and using a wavelet
filter to approximately obtain, not the usual susceptibility map, but instead an
integral, representing the total activity, of the difference in susceptibility
between task and pre-task, over a prespecified region of interest in the brain
at successive time-points. This space/time trade-off thus allows us to obtain,
at high time-resolution, the total activity in a specified region of the brain,
believed to process the specific stimulus/task, to learn or verify where the
brain function takes place. An example of the use of the technique is to learn
where in the brain the "rolodex" of memory is located whereby one recognizes a
familiar face in a fraction of a second. To try to find where the rolodex is
located by a method which requires more than a second is a doubtful project;
better time-resolution is required (but high spatial resolution is not).
Although some researchers claim faster measurement capabilities they sacrifice
signal/noise.

Statistical methods and related theory will be developed to sharply improve
time-resolution for the technique of functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI). Our objective is to improve the time-resolution of fMRI by acquiring
data from only a small fraction of the MRI sampling space, to approximately
obtain the total activity of the difference in susceptibility between task and
pre-task, over a prespecified region of interest in the brain at successive
time-points. For a typical region of the brain, say describing the hippocampus,
believed to be involved in memory, our optimal choice of the sampling region
should give a ten fold speed-up compared to the usual method of sampling. An
example of the use of the technique is to learn where in the brain the "rolodex"
of memory is located whereby one recognizes a familiar face in a fraction of a
second. This fast fMRI is expected to have profound and far-reaching
consequences in the understanding of brain function, a problem of central
scientific interest at the present time.
