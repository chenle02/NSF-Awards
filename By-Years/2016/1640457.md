Title: 2016 Oregon Programming Languages Summer School (OPLSS) on Types, Logic,
Semantics, and Verification&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides student
travel and subsistence for the 2016 Oregon Programming Languages Summer School
(OPLSS). This summer school provides an important and valuable educational
opportunity for students to study theoretical topics related to programming
languages and methods/verification. The focus of this year's school is "Types,
Logics, Semantics, and Verification". The broader significance and importance
include building international community and cooperation in foundational
research areas, and enhancing education of US students, including women and
underrepresented minorities, with exposure to and interaction with leading-edge
research and researchers. By supporting US-based students, the school will thus
train the next generation of programming languages, compilers and software
engineering researchers in both industry and academia.
