This research investigates core architectural features for secure and private
communications and computations over the public Internet and wireless
infrastructures. It focuses on what instruction-set architecture (ISA) features
general-purpose processors would have, if secure information processing is the
default pervasive mode of operation, with non-secure processing the optional
mode, rather than vice versa. It proposes ISA features for very fast, flexible,
software cryptographic processing, not only for current algorithms but also to
enable algorithm designers to create new cryptographic algorithms that are more
secure and more efficient. Word-oriented, programmable processors can be
radically more effective for cryptographic functions with new instructions for
sub-word manipulations, as well as for multi-word arithmetic. Novel bit
permutation instructions are proposed for providing superior diffusion
capabilities for current and future symmetric key algorithms. Their performance,
area and latency tradeoffs, and scalability with superscalar organizations are
studied. Very fast table lookup and other ISA features are also studied for
algorithms like Rijndael, the recent Advanced Encryption Standard winner, and
for public-key algorithms like Elliptic Curve Cryptography. The research also
investigates architectural features for secure key management, and other ISA
features designed to enhance or enforce system security.
