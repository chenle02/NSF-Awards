This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on the
separation of light hydrocarbon mixtures by pervaporation. Chemically and
mechanically robust composite membranes have been made; these membranes showed
good selectivities and fluxes when tested with propylene/propane mixtures. In
the proposed project a range of related membranes will be evaluated with three
target light hydrocarbon mixtures: propylene/propane, n-butane/isobutane and
toluene/n-octane. These close-boiling mixtures are produced on a very large
scale in petrochemical plants and refineries and are expensive to separate by
distillation. Based on the Phase I membrane performance results, a preliminary
economic and technical analysis will be prepared. The most promising membrane
and application will be targeted for the focus of the Phase II project and for
commercialization activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential Commercial
Applications of the research separation of close-boiling light hydrocarbon
mixtures, such as propylene from propane, is performed on a massive scale in the
petrochemical and refining industries. Lower-cost, more energy-efficient
membrane-based separation technology would be widely adopted.
