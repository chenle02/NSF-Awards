The goal of this research is to enhance our understanding of the conditions
under which women have children at an early age, the conditions under which
women delay having children, and conditions that may enhance or inhibit a
woman's ability to access opportunities for education and employment. Data will
be gathered from an American Indian population and will provide important
additions to existing knowledge about human behavior and reproduction. There are
three specific research objectives: 1) to identify the social, economic, and
health factors that facilitate reproduction for the study population; 2) to
construct a data set of women's life histories and develop a model of the
relationship between the timing of reproduction, the availability of education
and employment opportunities, and the availability of physiological, social, and
economic resources necessary for successful childrearing; and 3) test hypotheses
about the timing of reproduction over a woman's life course. This research
explores an option for reproduction among poor women which coordinates limited
but early reproduction supported by family networks and later acquisition of
education and employment opportunities.
