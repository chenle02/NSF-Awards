0207982&lt;br/&gt;Hamburger&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EarthScope is a major earth
science research initiative that will integrate scientific information derived
from seismology (US Array), geodesy (Plate boundary Observatory), subsurface
sampling and measurement (SAFOD), remote sensing (InSAR), and complementary
geology and geophysics to understand continental scale plate deformation and
evolution. Funding for the EarthScope initiative is currently being discussed in
Congress as part of NSF's FY 2003 budget. The Division of Earth Sciences has
made FY 2002 funds available for projects that qualify as pre-EarthScope
activity, i.e. activities that will facilitate or enable the construction,
fabrication, installation or operation of EarthScope once it is funded under the
MREFC (Major Research Equipment Facilities and Construction) account. Such
activities include meetings and workshops, prototype development, site selection
or characterization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funds to support a
focused workshop on active magmatic systems. The workshop will provide a forum
for interdisciplinary discussion of magmatic systems and will result in a
detailed, integrated deployment and operations plan for the magmatic systems
component of EarthScope. Participants will be invited from a variety of
disciplines related to geological, geophysical, and geochemical study of active
magmatic systems. The meeting will be conducted in a setting of one of western
North America's active volcanic systems (e.g. Cascades, Long Valley, Alaska),
and will include a full-day field trip on active volcanic
processes.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
