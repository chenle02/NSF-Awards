Human error is the major cause of structural failure. Therefore, modeling and
control of errors are an important part of the strategy to improve the
reliability of structures. The objective of this study is to develop a practical
method to predict the likelihood of occurrence of human error in structural
engineering. This involves estimating the sensitivity of the structure to the
hazard of gross errors in design, construction and use. Human errors are
influenced by a number of conditions which constitute the human, economical,
social and political climate influencing each individual project. These climatic
conditions and their relations to errors constitutes the data of a knowledge-
based expert system (KBES). A level of risk is associated with this measure of
sensitivity. Different levels of risk and structural context call for different
strategies for risk management. Another objective is to develop a risk
management procedure in the form of a contingency plan to mitigate the risk
entailed by the gross error sensitivity. Sensitivity analysis is an effective
tool extended to control some of the predictable errors. Sensitivity analysis
would be extended to include a proper cost- benefit analysis of allocation
options. The work is based on the results of a previous study (NSF grant
MSM-8304962) and the recommendations of NSF Workshop on Modeling Human Errors
(June, 1986).
