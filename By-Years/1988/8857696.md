This research outlines a formal and unifying theory concerning (i) the process
of design, namely that it can be succinctly and simply defined to be a model of
computability, (ii) the artifacts of design as enumerated strings from a formal
design grammar, and (iii) the rules of design as formal state changes that
govern the string enumeration. The artifacts of engineering design of discrete
goods, as strings in a formal language, can be discussed in terms of solid
modeling as the kernel of a boundary based modeling system, rooted in a language
of topologically valid representations of rigid solids as connected,
2-manifolds. This 3D representation grammar includes (i) a set of face-based
Euler operators as well as (ii) their semantics. Since inclusion of both
elements provides necessary and sufficient conditions for solidity, one can
prove topological validity of the representation scheme.
