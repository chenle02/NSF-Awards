Abstract DBI 9750048 D. Scott Baskerville This action funds an NSF/Alfred P.
Sloan Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution for 1997. These
fellowships support studies involving the theoretical, comparative,
computational, and/or experimental analyses of biological patterns and processes
at the molecular level within the framework of organismic evolutionary change
and adaptation. These studies also include the use of molecular data to address
broader evolutionary questions. Each fellowship supports a research and training
plan to be carried out in a sponsmring laboratory. The research and training
plan for this fellowship is entitled "Examining the origins of enzymes." Most
chemical reactions in living systems are know to be catalyzed by protein enzymes
but a few have been shown to be catalyzed by RNA or RNA-protein enzymes. By
comparing the abilities of synthetic protein, RNA, and RNA-protein to give rise
to new enzymes, this research addresses the possibility that RNA enzymes emerged
more readily and were later supplanted by proteins during evolution.
