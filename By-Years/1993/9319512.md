9319512 Crimmins The focus of this research is the study of the effects of
substitution on the tethering chain in intramolecular enone-olefin
photocycloadditions with regard to stereochemical control. The photoproducts
will serve as precursors for the synthesis of a variety of natural product types
including taxusin, magellaninone, serratinine and lubiminol. %%% With this
renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr.
Michael T. Crimmins of the Department of Chemistry at the University of North
Carolina, Chapel Hill. Professor Crimmins will focus his work on the use of
photocycloadditons for the synthesis of a number of interesting natural
products. ***
