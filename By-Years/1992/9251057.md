A scanning electron microscope (SEM) with an energy dispersive x-ray
microanalysis system is being used to train undergraduate students in upper-
level laboratories of biology, chemistry, and geology in the use and application
of these instruments. The secondary application will be to improve the abilities
of undergraduate students to accomplish independent research on campus. In
addition, the SEM and microanalysis system will be developed in a way to
increase the attraction and retention of students interested in the science and
non-science degree programs at this four-year, undergraduate, minority
institution.
