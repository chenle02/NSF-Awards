The investigator studies two related but different aspecta of vortex dynamics
in three space dimensions. The first project concerns the global regularity of
Euler flows in three dimensions. This important outstanding problem of applied
analysis is attacked by the investigator and colleagues with the aim of showing
that, under appropriate conditions of flow topology, global regularity is
obtained. In addition an estimate of the time rate of growth of the maximum
vorticity should be accessible. The approach utilizes maximization of the growth
of vorticity and a variational construction of an artificial structure (the
"cocoon") near the vorticity maximum. The second project concerns analysis
together with numerical and physical experiments of modes of hovering in
flapping flight. An oscillating flow facility already in use provides the
starting point for investigations of the vortical flow in the vicinity of small
flapping hoverers. The investigator and the research staff of the CIMS Applied
Mathematics Laboratory develop analytical and numerical models for the study of
hovering flight, motivated by the current interest in micro-aerodynamic
vehicles.

The project deals with two related problems involving the difficult problem of
analysis of three-dimensional fields of fluid motion and the complex eddying
motions that occur in many important time-dependent flows. The first problem
that the investigator and his colleagues study is the theoretical question of
"blowup" of solutions of Euler's equations, wherein the flow develops a rough or
singular structure after a finite time. Although much effort has been devoted to
trying to find such behavior in fluid flows, the question remains open. The
contention the investigator explores is that in fact for most flows, especially
those for which the "knottedness" of the vorticity is sufficiently simple,
blowup does not occur. This regularity property of the flows can be established
in some simple cases, and methods under development by the investigator promise
to be applicable to a larger class, whose size needs to be determined. The study
has important implications for global analysis of Euler flows, and perhaps also
for the numerical computation of these flows. The second project is different in
emphasis and brings into play a combination of analysis with numerical and
physical experiments to study the hovering flight of small flapping flyers of
the kind envisioned in the context of micro-aerodynamic flight. This work aims
to understand the eddying motions produced by certain kinds of flapping
structures, and the mechanism of lift production in various cases of hovering
flight. The work has possible applications to the engineering design of
extremely small air vehicles, as well as a bearing on the understanding of
insect flight.
