GMI Engineering & Management Institute proposes to build on a pilot program
conducted in Michigan which delivers science and mathematics education to grades
4-9 in predominantly minority areas by way of interactive satellite television.
NSF Presidential Awardee teachers conduct classes with a live studio classroom
audience; these classes are simultaneously available to a number of classrooms
by interactive television. Classes are based on curricula and instructional
materials generated in NSF sponsored projects and satisfy guidelines established
by NCTM for mathematics and by Project 2061 for science. Cost-sharing, at almost
seven times the amount requested from NSF, is exceptionally high.
