FSU has been committed to building and supporting an education and research
program in Information Assurance and Security since 1997. The first Information
Assurance courses were offered in the fall 1999 and spring 2000 semesters. The
program has grown steadily since, with the addition of expanded Information
Assurance courses and a growing student population.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
collaborative effort between FSU and FAMU is intended to benefit FAMU by helping
to develop an IA program at FAMU that does not currently exist and to strengthen
the program at FSU by broadening its research effort, increasing minority
representation in its graduate program, and by enhancing its instructional
course content at the undergraduate level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
Merit&lt;br/&gt;This project is innovative in its adaptive nature and its
recognition and leverage of a vast resource pool. The knowledge and experience
gained in establishing the graduate IA program at FSU is transferred to
undergraduate programs at FSU and FAMU, where large numbers of students are
seeking such opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This
approach produces a large number of IA graduates from previously untapped
resources. Of the anticipated one hundred graduates per year, statistics show
that sixty to seventy percent of these students will be from underprivileged and
disadvantaged groups.&lt;br/&gt;
