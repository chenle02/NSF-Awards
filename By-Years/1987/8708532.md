There is an inherent degree of uncertainty involved in making perceptual
decisions. This uncertainty may come from ambiguous causes of sensory input, or
from random variation in the physical or biological processes involved in
transmitting perceptual information. Human observers are remarkably good at
making valid and reliable visual decisions despite random variation in the
image, compared to capabilities of most artificial vision systems. This project
addresses how human observers process ambiguous or "noisy" visual information.
Performance can be calculated for a theoretically "optimal" or "ideal" observer
for a visual task that has inherent uncertainty. The optimal performance assumes
ideal performance from the optics and detector elements of the system, and the
calculations are based on a branch of probability theory called statistical
decision theory. By measuring the visual performance of a human and comparing it
to the ideal benchmark, we can measure human absolute visual efficiency.
Patterns which are detected nearly optimally may reflect specialized neural
mechanisms for a particular task. Here the role of spatial arrangement, color,
texture, and motion will be studied to find out what types of images are
detected most efficiently. The limits to optimal coding of more natural images
will be quantified by measuring the predictability of various elements in
pictures. This study is an unusual combination of experimental work with very
sophisticated mathematical modelling, and will help integrate visual perception
theory with both machine vision and human performance. It should have
substantial impact on vision research.
