The investigator incorporates a partially ionized plasma state into the
'anelastic' fluid equations describing the solar convection zone, enabling a
simulation of solar supergranulation. This phenomenon, first discovered in 1964,
may have a connection with one of the ionization zones of hydrogen or helium
occurring at about 30,000 kilometers. Investigators are now testing this
hypothesis through numerical simulation, and including a variety of physical
effects in the proposed model. Their simulations of the fluid mechanics of
plasma where constituent elements may undergo ionization when heated minimize
perturbations, causing only slight deviations from the basic equilibrium
thermodynamic state. This anelastic approximation holds throughout the solar
convection zone, except very close to the photosphere. The investigators' tests
increase in complexity over the three-year program, finally extending the model
to three dimensions and pursuing large-scale simulations of turbulent, ionizing
MHD convection. Research results will reveal much about the physics of solar
supergranulation.
