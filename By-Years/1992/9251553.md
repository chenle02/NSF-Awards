The ABIL is designed to fulfill the needs of five laboratory courses (Biological
Instrumentation, Cell and Molecular Biology, Comparative Genetics, Microbial
Physiology, and an independent study course) offered within the School of
Biological Sciences. A flexible seven week modular schedule running throughout
the year provides the necessary access to the equipment for each of the courses.
The ABIL prepares students for careers in biological sciences by improving their
abilities to use biological instrumentation and to understand techniques
inherent to modern biological research. The most unique feature of these courses
is the Biological Equipment course which requires students to design, build and
analyze different circuits and instruments using prototype boards. Students
disassemble salvaged instruments to understand their design.
