Economics teaches a way of thinking, including an ability to assess alternative
choices in the face of constraints, that is fundamental to informed private and
social choice. Also, an effective introductory economics course should teach
students how to think intelligently and independently about economic issues.
Accordingly, this project develops an introductory microeconomic course that
focuses specifically on the economic decisions that individuals make over the
course of their lives. The course also integrates exercises on numeric and
computer analysis by providing an active, hands-on learning environment; and
will significantly enhance students' economic literacy, and appreciation for
cultural diversity.
