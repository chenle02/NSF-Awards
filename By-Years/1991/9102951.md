This project is concerned with several topics in the homological theory of
commutative rings and differential graded algebras. A theme of this research is
that many problems arising within the classical homological theory of rings are
most effectively treated by placing them in the broader context of differential
graded algebras. The principal investigator will also study homomorphisms of
finite flat dimension. This research is on the interface of algebraic geometry
and commutative algebra. This is currently a very active area in which an
associated commutative algebra is used to obtain refined knowlege about the
underlying geometric object.
