Birds that naturally encounter high carbon dioxide, low oxygen environments as a
consequence of nesting in underground tunnels or cavities, show blunted
ventilatory responsiveness to carbon dioxide. The altered thresholds and
sensitivities of burrow-dwelling birds clearly indicate that the set-point for
their ventilation is different from that of nonburrowers. It is not known if the
bluntered responsiveness of these birds to carbon dioxide is a genetically
determined and selected trait or if it is a phenotypic characteristic that can
be ontogenetically determined by the environment during development. The
proposed research addresses this fundamental question of what establishes
ventilatory set-points (i.e., are they inherited or acquired). In answering this
question, the PI will experimentally manipulate the gaseous environments during
embryonic and post-embryonic development of a burrower to determine if either
treatment, or both, effects adult ventilatory set-points. A parallel set of
experiments will be conducted with a nonburrowing bird. The proposed project
will significantly contribute to our understanding of respiratory control in
birds, which is to date very incomplete.
