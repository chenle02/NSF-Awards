The recipient of this FAW award is a leader in the field of Marine Chemical
Ecology. Her proposed research during the next five years will involve using
techniques of natural products chemistry to address ecological and biochemical
questions of tropical marine plant.herbivore interactions. Her focus will be on
the importance of biological and physical causes of variation in the production
of secondary metabolites by tropical seaweeds. The research is expected to
provide important information on chemical variation and its causes, the ability
of seaweeds to change their allocation of chemical defenses, the time scale for
facultative chemical changes, and ecological relationships between seaweeds and
tropical herbivores.
