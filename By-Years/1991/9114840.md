Microcellular thermoplastics are novel materials containing a large number of
closed cells, typically 106/cm3 or more, of order 10 microns in diameter. Such a
microstructure allows a significant reduction in density without compromising
the essential mechanical properties. Recently remarkable new materials have been
produced from polycarbonate and from polyethylene terephthalate (PET), using
carbon dioxide as the nucleating gas. In PET, high concentrations of carbon
dioxide have been found to crystallize PET, enabling creation of cellular
composites with an integral, crystalline skin. In polycarbonate, bubble
densities of 5 billion/cm3 or more have been achieved, allowing for creation of
microcellular foams with a wide range of properties. In this research a detailed
characterization of the CO-2 polycarbonate and CO2-PET material systems will be
carried out. The CO2-induced crystallization in PET, molecular orientation in
cell walls, and the cell morphology will be studies. Bubble nucleation phenomena
in both PET and polycarbonate will be experimentally characterized. Also the
mechanical behavior of microcellular composites will be measured and related to
the microstructure via a theoretical model.
