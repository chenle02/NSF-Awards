This project is concerned with several conjectures in commutative algebra. The
principal investigator will consider the monomial conjecture and the improved
new intersection conjecture. It is proposed to study these questions by
attempting to extend the methods which have been successful in the past as well
as using some new homological methods. This research is on the interface of
algebraic geometry and commutative algebra. This is currently a very active area
in which an associated commutative algebra is used to obtain refined knowlege
about the underlying geometric object.
