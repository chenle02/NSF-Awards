****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;This project will experimentally
investigate electronic properties of GaAs-based semiconductor nanostructures
which are driven out of their equilibrium state by microwave radiation or dc
electric fields. In particular, electrical resistance of such a device can
oscillate drastically with the applied magnetic field and even vanish under
certain conditions. By exploring similarities and differences between microwave-
and dc field-induced effects, the project will develop a method to obtain
detailed information on the correlation properties of the disorder potential,
which will have a direct impact on other fields, such as high-mobility MBE
growth. The educational component of this project rests on the development of
research-based educational resources and direct involvement of students at all
levels and from a variety of backgrounds in cutting-edge research to ready them
for careers in nanotechnology industry, government, and academe. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;****Non-Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;Understanding electronic
properties of semiconductor quantum devices becomes increasingly important as
miniaturization of modern integrated circuits approaches a point where quantum
effects come into play. This project will experimentally investigate electronic
properties of semiconductor nanostructures, which are driven out of their
equilibrium state by microwave radiation or dc electric fields. In particular,
electrical resistance of such a device can oscillate drastically with the
applied magnetic field and even vanish under certain conditions. By exploring
similarities and differences between microwave- and dc field-induced effects,
the project will develop a method to obtain detailed information on the amount
and type of impurities in the device, which will have a direct impact on other
fields, such as epitaxial growth of high-purity semiconductor nanostructures.
