The Research Experience in ALpine Meteorology (REALM) will rely on the natural
scientific laboratory, provided by the nearby Wasatch Mountains and adjacent
urban areas, to enhance student awareness of societal challenges, such as water
availability and air quality, that require understanding the influence of alpine
terrain on weather and climate processes. The Department of Atmospheric Sciences
at the University of Utah is recognized internationally for its expertise in
atmospheric studies related to mountain environments. Following the models used
by successful Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) sites, a cohesive
framework will be developed to manage a high-quality, cohort-based undergraduate
summer program. REALM will welcome and support underrepresented students from a
variety of backgrounds in a highly inclusive environment. The REU program will
include an independent evaluation to ensure the REU site is meeting the project
goals and creates a sustainable model for future REU programs.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives for REALM are the following: (1) engage
students in full-time active research; (2) provide professional development
opportunities for students and mentors; (3) motivate students towards STEM
careers by constructing an engaging, inclusive, and supportive cohort experience
that includes exposing them through site visits to employment opportunities in
the weather, water, and climate enterprise; and (4) improve students' science
literacy oral and written communication skills. Students will spend 8 weeks at
the University of Utah conducting research and gaining relevant professional
development. The REU program will utilize a multiple mentor approach to support
the student participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
