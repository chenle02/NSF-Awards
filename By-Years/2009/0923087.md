Experiments with rare isotope beams are critical for advancing our understanding
of the nuclear force and nuclear structure. Improved knowledge of nuclei will
allow questions concerning the nature of neutron stars and dense nuclear matter,
the origin of the elements in the cosmos, and the nuclear reactions that drive
stars and stellar explosions to be addressed. Studies in the unexplored domain
of extreme neutron and proton rich nuclei will provide access to the limits of
nuclear stability and allow theoretical models of nuclear structure to be
rigorously tested. Scientific measurements made with rare isotope beams contend
with two limiting factors: low beam intensities and low cross sections for the
processes of interest. For this reason, the development of detection systems
that combine the characteristics of high efficiency and large geometrical
acceptance are essential.

The Active Target Time Projection Chamber (AT-TPC), which combines time
projection and active target functionality in a single device, will allow
measurements to be made of rare and low energy nuclear processes. The AT-TPC
will detect the products of reactions induced by rare isotope beams allowing
investigations of fusion, isobaric analog states, cluster structure of light
nuclei, transfer reactions, fission, giant resonances and the density dependence
of the nuclear equation of state. The development and construction of the AT-TPC
is a collaborative effort between researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Michigan State University,
Notre Dame University, St. Mary's University (Canada) and Western Michigan
University. The AT-TPC will be operated as a user device at the National
Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory and the future Facility for Rare Isotope
Beams at Michigan State University. Graduate and undergraduate students will
play an integral role in the development and utilization of this unique device.
