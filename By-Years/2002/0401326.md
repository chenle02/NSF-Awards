In the past few decades, the topic of partially hyperbolic
dynamical&lt;br/&gt;systems has emerged as one main direction in which the
theory of&lt;br/&gt;complicated ("chaotic") dynamical systems has extended
beyond the&lt;br/&gt;classical setting of hyperbolic dynamics. This research has
been driven in&lt;br/&gt;part by the realization that many practical
applications of dynamical&lt;br/&gt;systems to experimental phenomena require a
much broader theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's research over the last decade
has focused on the fundamental&lt;br/&gt;ergodic -- that is, statistical --
properties that partially hyperbolic&lt;br/&gt;systems generically can be
expected to display. The PI's work with her&lt;br/&gt;collaborators has led
recently to a proof of a "Boltzmann Ergodic&lt;br/&gt;Hypothesis" for partially
hyperbolic systems in low dimension: the&lt;br/&gt;generic conservative
partially hyperbolic system is ergodic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
research has two aspects:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Extending the previous work of
the PI and her collaborators on the&lt;br/&gt;ergodicity of partially hyperbolic
diffeomorphisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* A study of rigidity of solvable groups
actions on manifolds, in&lt;br/&gt;particular those actions that contain
partially hyperbolic elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The material resulting from
this research proposal will be widely&lt;br/&gt;disseminated, through talks at
conferences, online preprint servers, and&lt;br/&gt;publication in scholarly
journals. A significant component of this grant&lt;br/&gt;is devoted to
graduate-student training on the Ph.D. level.&lt;br/&gt;
