It is expected that in 25 years, Americans who are 65 years or older will
account for about 20% of the whole population. As smart cities are also expected
to become a reality within the same timeframe, starting to address the needs and
concerns of such a large group becomes an essential part of the design of a
future smart city. Here we specifically address the mobility needs of the
elderly and those with limited means of transportation. We consider multiple
small vehicle options that might provide on-demand or scheduled means of door-
to-door transportation.

The NSF-EAGER project focuses on examining basic research aspects of sensing and
tracking potential sources of vehicle pedestrian collisions in densely crowded
situations and socially acceptable distance for collision avoidance. The project
will be providing input to the OSU/Columbus Global City Teams Challenge activity
SMOOTH (Smart Mobile Operation: OSU Transportation Hub) and related
demonstrations and help develop a working system.

The key innovative contributions of this EAGER project are: development of a
unifying framework for sensing and tracking in mixed traffic situations,
acceptable automated driving within pedestrian zones, and evasive road
maneuvering to avoid colliding with conventional human driven vehicles.
