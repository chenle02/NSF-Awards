With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Virginia Polytechnic Institute
and State University will upgrade a 400 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment
will enable researchers to carry out the following research: a) preparation of
organometallic complexes with unusual structure, reactivity or physical
properties (Deck); b) studies on metal complexes of polysulfonated phosphine
ligands as catalysts in biphasic reaction conditions (Hanson); c) isolation of
natural products (Kingston); d) rotaxane chemistry (Gibson); e) organic
synthesis and synthetic methodology (Carlier); and f) preparation of
polypeptides with novel three-dimensional architecture as mimics for the helix-
turn-helix motif in polypeptides (Etzkorn). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to
chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to
identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms
within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists
who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will
have an impact in a number of areas including organic, polymer and
organometallic chemistry.
