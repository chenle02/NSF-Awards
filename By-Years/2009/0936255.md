The project will use both numerical experiments and observational analyses to
investigate two unsolved questions in the field of climate dynamics: 1) what
physical mechanisms drive the tropospheric response to extratropical
stratospheric variability? and 2) through what processes do anthropogenic
emissions of carbon dioxide and ozone depleting gases drive large-scale changes
in the extratropical circulation? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the modeling
component, the investigators will examine and diagnose the simple general
circulation model response to spatially varying thermal forcings which mimic the
radiative responses to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide and stratospheric
ozone depletion/recovery. The experiments will be used to 1) assess the
circulation responses to thermal forcings at tropospheric and stratospheric
levels; 2) assess the robustness of the responses to changes in the shape and
amplitude of the forcings and to changes in the model climatology; and 3)
investigate the physical mechanisms that drive the simulated responses. In the
observational component, the investigators will conduct analyses that 1)
complement the numerical experiments, and 2) investigate the processes
associated with recent stratospheric climate change. The observational analyses
will provide a "reality-check" for the model experiments, new analyses of the
daily evolution of the heat and momentum fluxes associated with
stratosphere/troposphere coupling, and new analyses of the linkages between
tropical tropospheric heating and variability in the extratropical
flow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this work include implications
for weather forecasting (via stratosphere/troposphere coupling), for the
attribution of past climate trends, and for the prediction of future changes in
the circulation in response to anthropogenic forcing. This project will train
and support one postdoctoral researcher and two graduate students.
