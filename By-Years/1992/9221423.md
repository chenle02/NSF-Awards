Collisions and mergers seem to have played a major role in determining the
shapes and dynamics of present-day galaxies. A few mergers are still occurring
and offer valuable clues to past evolutionary processes. Dating ancient mergers
has become feasible because of the discovery of merger signatures such as
ripples, tails, X-structures, and oddly rotating cores in earlytype galaxies.
The research to be carried out in this grant will be a program of observational
research aimed at studying the process of collisions and mergers of galaxies.
The Principal Investigator is regarded as a world leader in this research area.
