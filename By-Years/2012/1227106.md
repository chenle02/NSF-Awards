The MultiTree project, started in 2006, set out to build a digital library of
up-to-date, scholarly information about language relationships and subgroupings.
This library is fully documented and transparently traceable to the scholarly
research upon which it is based; it is also overseen by a board of respected
comparative historical linguists. The existing library is freely accessible via
a user-friendly website which is adapted to different scholarly and educational
purposes. For example, it includes an interface allowing scholars to (a) compare
different subgrouping trees side by side and (b) submit and review comments on
the subgroupings.

The success of the existing website and the proven utility of the MultiTree
language relationship trees and bibliography, has led to the conclusion that the
MultiTree library should include all reputable scholarly hypotheses about
language relationships (not just the most current or well-known). Furthermore,
the MultiTree interface should display all or part of the text from which the
hypothesis was drawn, and the database should be maintained in such a way as to
be always current with ongoing research.

This project will implement a cost-effective way to bring MultiTree to a state
of completion in the next two years and keep it up-to-date thereafter; these
objectives will be achieved through (a) adding a facility to allow scholars to
contribute new hypotheses to the database and present them to the Advisory Board
for approval, and (b) through making MultiTree a focus of the LINGUIST List
summer internship program. The involvement of interns has a threefold benefit:
it will reduce the cost of completing data input; it will wed site maintenance
to an already-established program, and, as an added benefit, it will enrich the
discipline by offering promising students experience with language technologies,
digital standards, and the analysis of historical, comparative, and dialectal
language research.
