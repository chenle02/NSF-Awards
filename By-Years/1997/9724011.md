***&lt;br/&gt;9724011&lt;br/&gt;Davenport&lt;br/&gt;In this RUI proposal Prof.
Davenport requests support for participation in the FOCUS Collaboration. This is
a fixed target experiment at Fermilab which has made major contributions to the
understanding of charmed quarks. Prof. Davenport has been an important
contributor to this experiment, and has been successful in involving
undergraduates in his research program.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
