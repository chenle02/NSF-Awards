This research is to extend a newly developed statistical tomography method to
study velocity heterogeneities of different tectonic units of the crust and
upper mantle under California. This method, developed by the Principal
Investigator and collaborators, is termed Stochastic Tomography and leads to a
better depth resolution of heterogeneity of seismic velocities. The method will
be applied to seismic data of the CALNET in northern California and the SCARLET
in southern California. By means of this method, study of the crust and upper
mantle beneath the seismically active regions should refine knowledge of the
tectonic structures at levels below what has been possible in the past. This
research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
