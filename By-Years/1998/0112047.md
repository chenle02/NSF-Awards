Because auctions are among the market institutions most convincingly captured
by the kind of game theoretic analysis that dominates modern economic theory,
auction data provide important opportunities to evaluate modeling approaches and
assess the importance in practice of strategic behavior predicted by theory.
Auctions also play an increasingly important role in the allocation of public
resources, so goals of efficient allocation and revenue generation provide
strong policy motivations for understanding auctions. This project consists of
four components that contribute to this understanding through empirical studies
of auction markets and development of new statistical tools for analysis of
auctions. The first component addresses estimation of demand at auctions in
which sellers use reserve prices. By exploiting variation in the reserve prices
that results from heterogeneity in seller valuations, one can consistently
estimate the full distribution characterizing demand at standard auctions---the
model primitive needed for a wide range of policy simulations. This is done
without parametric distributional assumptions.The second component addresses
inference from bids at English auctions in which bidders may be asymmetric or
have correlated valuations. This allows also environments in which bidders, but
not the econometrician, observe a common factor shifting their private values---
a common situation in applications. The third component develops nonparametric
tests for common values at first-price auctions. Exploiting recent advancements
in the econometrics of auctions, we show how one can use variation in the number
of bidders to test for the presence of the winner's curse and, therefore, common
values. The fourth and final project studies an online auction market with many
buyers and sellers trading a homogeneous object. It addresses the effects of
auction rules, seller reputation and other auction characteristics on bidder
participation and bids. Arbitrage behavior is documented, and the prevalence and
predictors of fraudulent seller behavior are studied.
