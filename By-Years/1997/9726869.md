ABSTRACT This project will test the global hypothesis that earthworm invasion
of north temperate forests will have large consequences for nutrient retention
and uptake in these ecosystems. Furthermore, it is suggested that invasion of
new forest habitats by non-native earthworms will be an important component of
change in ecosystem processes in many northeastern forests in the coming
decades. Previous research has shown that invasion of forests by exotic
earthworms dramatically alters forest floor structure and potentially affects
key nutrient cycling processes, such as nitrification. However, it is not clear
how the dramatic physical changes in forest soil caused by earthworm invasion
relate to overall system-level nutrient uptake, fine-root production or foliar
chemistry. Four main hypotheses will increase understanding of this potentially
important process in forest ecosystems. Our predictions are that earthworm
invasion will: 1. Increase hydrologic and gaseous losses of N and decrease
retention of exogenous N. 2. Alter soil nutrient-supplying (N and P) capacity
with consequences for plant nutrient demand and foliar nutrient contents and
ratios. 3. Change the vertical distribution, production and functioning of fine
roots. 4. Produce different responses depending on the species of earthworm
invading. These hypotheses will be addressed with a two-pronged approach. The
first approach will involve controlled introductions of earthworms into
experimental forest plots. These plots will provide insight into the transition
that occurs immediately following earthworm invasion. The second approach will
involve comparing forest stands already invaded by earthworms with adjacent
stands lacking earthworms, viewing these stands as endpoints along a gradient of
earthworm invasion. To expand the generality of findings, experiments will be
conducted in forest at two different geographic locations, one in eastern and
the other in central New York. This work will document the obvious a nd expected
decline in forest floor depth and redistribution of surface organic matter in
the soil profile following earthworm invasion, will then determine how these
changes affect the ability of these forests to retain exogenous N and provide
nutrients to support plant growth. Retention of atmospheric N will be assessed
by tracing the movement of small additions of 15 N and Br' through the top 30 cm
of the soil profile. Hydrologic nutrient losses will be measured using zero-
tension lysimeters and gaseous N losses using field chambers and soil cores.
This research will provide new information on a critical but overlooked factor
in the study and management of north temperate forests. The influence of
earthworms on biogeochemistry in natural ecosystems, especially forests, has
received little attention in North America. Results will allow the determination
of whether earthworm invasion will be a factor influencing the long-term
productivity of these forests and whether earthworms will influence the response
of these forests to other factors, such as nitrogen deposition, climate change
and exotic plant invasions.
