0214355&lt;br/&gt;Johns&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports a major upgrade
to the NSF research community's Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver pool,
critical for high-precision GPS campaign measurements to support Earth sciences
related research. Thirty new generation GPS receivers will be purchased over
three years, maintaining a state-of-the-art receiver pool that ensures the
UNAVCO Facility's continued leadership in geodetic GPS technology for campaign
applications. The new GPS receivers will benefit the research community with
improved features including better data quality, reduced power consumption,
smaller size, and increased memory. The main use of the UNAVCO equipment pool
continues to be traditional millimeter-level precision crustal deformation GPS
campaigns involving data collection for several days per survey point, and 24
new receivers are dedicated to such support. An additional six receivers with
added capability will also support kinematic, rapid static, and real-time
kinematic applications that require centimeter-level precision. As new equipment
becomes available for pool use, the current pool receivers will be phased out of
the pool and into NSF funded research projects for use in permanent GPS
installations.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
