The American Society for Microbiology Conference for Undergraduate Educators
(ASMCUE) will be held November 17-19, 2023, in Phoenix, Arizona. ASMCUE is an
annual 3-day gathering of biology and microbiology educators, representing all
types of institutions of higher education. More than 300 biologists, of whom 95%
reside in the United States, attend each year to access sessions on teaching,
learning and assessment, student advising, student research, mentoring, and
professional skills development. An exhibit hall features public and private
organizations showcasing faculty resources and tools. ASMCUE has been a
signature program for building capacity for evidence-based microbiology teaching
and mentoring, generating new ideas for advancing the profession of STEM
education, and launching new initiatives for ASM-sponsored teaching resources.

This award to ASM will support first time attendee faculty from community
colleges and minority serving institutions to experience ASMCUE and engage with
other faculty to share tips and tools on pedagogy and teaching strategies.
Programming will include a peer mentoring program featuring organized structured
activities for first time participants. In addition, NSF representatives will
have a platform to present in a session focused on NSF grant opportunities and
provide information on the NSF grant application process and merit review
system. Following the NSF scheduled session, a forum will be provided to host
small group and one on one consultations during the exhibit hall hours. An
evaluation of the ASMCUE experience will be done through a survey. This award is
supported by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI) in the Directorate
for Biological Sciences (BIO) and the Division for Undergraduate Education (DUE)
in the Directorate for STEM Education (EDU).

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
