The main focus of this project is on the development of a formal automated
mechanism for the implementation of default reasoning in expert systems. The
formal structures are used to provide a deeper understanding of the default
reasoning process and of nonmonotonicity. This formal structure is developed in
the framework of the fuzzy set based theory of approximate reasoning. Goals of
this project include the representation of various types of default rules by
possibility qualified statements, the implementation of the operation
possibility qualification, the effect of multiple defaults on the reasoning
process, a comparison of probability and default reasoning systems, and the
modeling conjunction of fuzzy and default environments.
