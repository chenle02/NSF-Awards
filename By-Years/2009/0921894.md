The goal of this research project is to document and describe Miji, a Tibeto-
Burman language spoken by around 4,000 people in Arunachal Pradesh, India.
Current trends of globalization, specifically national integration and the
spread of education in Hindi and English in India, have caused Miji language
proficiency to decrease significantly within the younger generations. As a
result, older tribal members have become increasingly concerned about the future
state of their heritage language. Continuing such patterns of language use in
this community will surely result in the eventual and total extinction of the
Miji language. This reality is made even more threatening by the fact that no
written orthography has ever been developed for this language, which could allow
for the preservation of culturally and/or linguistically relevant texts.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to document this language, Mr. Daniel Wood will
spend two six-month long periods living among the Miji in their native
communities where he will attempt gain communicative proficiency in Miji.
Linguistic documentation is a collaborative effort between the linguist and the
language community. Mr. Wood will train interested members of the community in
basic linguistic documentation and analysis. This will not only allow the
community to contribute to the documentation project, but it will empower them
to spearhead their own language-based projects in the future. The linguistic
data that will be collected via audio and video recording will be the basis for
a descriptive grammar of Miji. Other expected end-products for this research
project include a trilingual Miji-English-Hindi dictionary, a collection of
transcribed texts glossed in English, and a written orthography designed in
collaboration with the Miji community. As Miji remains a drastically under-
studied and under-documented language, such publications will be the first of
their kind, benefitting both the linguistic and Miji communities.
