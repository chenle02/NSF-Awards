The goal of this project is to develop algorithms that will produce good
solutions for dynamic routing and network-topology problems in the design of
large communication networks. The study of dynamic routing will use Segall's
dynamic network model and will emphasize aspects of dynamic routing that are not
usually considered. These aspects include a new "worst-case" cost functional,
reducing the routing problem to a purely scheduling problem by restricting the
topology of the network, and considering suboptimal routing algorithms that have
low time- complexities. The principal investigator will analytically evaluate
heuristic design algorithms for the Capacitated Minimal Spanning Tree Problem as
well as other local-access-network topology design problems. He will focus on
deriving probabilistic properties of design algorithms, which should provide
valuable insights into the design problems and conditions under which the design
algorithms perform well.
