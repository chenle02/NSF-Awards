In 1990, a "U.S. Panel on Structural Control Research" was established under the
auspices of the National Science Foundation for program development and to focus
on collaboration with counterpart international groups to develop work plans for
research, dissemination, and implementation of actively controlled structural
systems. Growing world-wide interest in this emerging field and the rapid
evolution of relevant technologies make the exchange of technical information
and the synchronization of cooperative activities among multinational groups
essential for effective exploitation of this promising field. Under this
project, along with Italian and Japanese counterpart teams, the U.S. Panel will
develop and convene a U.S.-Japan-Italy Workshop on Structural Control and
Intelligent Systems to be held in Sorrento, Italy in July 1992 prior to the
meeting of the 10th World Conference on Earthquake Engineering (10WCEE) in
Madrid, Spain. A set of Proceedings on the results of the workshop will be
prepared and distributed to the earthquake engineering community to meet
research dissemination objectives set forth by the U.S. Panel.
