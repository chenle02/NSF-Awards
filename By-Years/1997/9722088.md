I propose to investigate the role of sub-nucleon degrees of freedom in low and
medium energy processes. In particular processes of very short range like
nucleon- antinucleon annihilation and subsequent hadronization, mainly into
pions, will be investigated. Microscopic models for annihilation and
hadronization are either based on nucleon degrees of freedom, or sub- nucleon
degrees of freedom, for example quarks and gluons. A large amount of accurate
data from the LEAR accelerator at CERN on very specific annihilation modes of
proton- antiproton collisions over a wide energy range, are now available. These
data allow for a detailed comparison of experimental results with predictions
from microscopic models and draw conclusions about their validity. In particular
the spin dependence of the observables promises to be a stringent test on the
models. A further test is if a consistent description of annihilation into three
as well as two mesons can be found.
