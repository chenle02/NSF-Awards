The purpose of this research is to determine the time and duration of flood
basalt volcanism in the Siberian Traps. Subaerial picrite and basalt flows and
pyroclastic rocks erupted about the time of the boundary between the Permian and
Triassic periods. Basaltic rocks will be dated precisely and accurately using
the 40Ar-39Ar. Forty basaltic samples have been supplied by Russian colleagues.
Samples come from a wide geographic area and from drill cores penetrating the
thickest section of the lava sequence. Some Triassic rocks from Wrangellia
terrane will also be analyzed. Radiometric dating will establish the age and
duration of the volcanism, and has the potential of sheding light on the causes
of the Permo-Triassic extinction.
