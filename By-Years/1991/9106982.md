Certain plants exude organic sulfides through their roots. In their pure state,
many of these sulfides have bacteriostatic, fungicidal, nematicidal, and
insecticidal properties. It is not known whether plants emit sufficient amounts
of the sulfides to have these effects in natural systems. The P.I.'s will
investigate the phylogenetic distribution of these compounds and determine
whether their production has effects on the plant community. If plants do
incorporate sulfides into their overall response repertoire, the effect could be
substantial and an understanding of the phenomenon could significantly alter
future investigations of community and ecosystem relationships.
