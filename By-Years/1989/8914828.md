This development project provides research investigators at synchrotron X-ray
beam lines withan electronic area detector system designed for collecting and
processing diffraction data from protein crystals and other biological
structures. The detector makes possible a substantial increase in the
efficiencyof data collection, the quality of the data, and the complexity of the
problems can be investigated with synchrotron sources. The structural
information revealed by these studies will be vitally important to our
understanding in the fields of enzymology, immunology, virology, protein assemby
and bioengineering. The design employs recent technological advances to provide
a compact detector system with a 115 mm diameter area, 0.1 mm resolution, a
4000:1 dynamic range, and a sustained 5 mbytes/s data acquisition rate. It
incorporates fiber optic tapers to directly couple the X-ray image converter,
image intensifier, and 1024 x 1024-pixel (or larger) CCD chip. Training will be
provided for users of this instrument at synchrotron beam lines. Assistance and
documentation will be provided to researchers and others who wish to build or
obtain copies of the detector system or any of its components.
