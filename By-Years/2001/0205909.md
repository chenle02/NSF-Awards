0205909 Diebold This award to Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia
University in the City of New York provides instrumentation to significantly
improve the geophysical survey capabilities of the research vessel Maurice
Ewing, an NSF-owned ship operated by LDEO as part of the University-National
Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. The navigation and quality
control software and other instrumentation supported here will improve survey
capabilities and upgrade reliability of R/V Ewing for conducting geophysical
research programs. These improvements will be of substantial advantage to marine
scientists using the ship in their research during 2002 and future years. ***
