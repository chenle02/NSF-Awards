Professor Casazza will conduct research on several problems in the theory of
Banach spaces. They involve (i) uniqueness of unconditional and symmetric
structures in finite dimensional spaces, (ii) various forms of the Approximation
Property, and (iii) the existence of prime Banach spaces. This award will
support research in the geometry of Banach spaces. In finite dimensions, all
vector spaces are essentially the same. But in the infinite dimensional
situation primarily of interest here, this is far from the case. Banach spaces
are infinite dimensional spaces with the additional structure introduced by
varying notions of distance between points in the space. Such spaces have wide
application in mathematics, both pure and applied.
