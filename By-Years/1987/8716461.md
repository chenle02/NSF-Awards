The record from human exploration and research in Antarctica has established
that prolonged exposure to the extreme and isolated environment is a stressful
experience, and in certain circumstances has profound implications for health
and performance of personnel in Antarctica. There is some evidence which
suggests that while winter-over personnel have short-term adjustment problems,
they have a long-term decreased risk of diseases and illnesses triggered by
stress. The objective of this study is to identify and describe the sources of
enduring adaptive response to prolonged social isolation and an extreme physical
environment. The research team will utilize an interdisciplinary approach,
incorporating both anthropological and psychological methods, for qualitative
and quantitative assessment of short-term and long-term consequences of the
antarctic winter-over experience. An ethnographic study will examine the
microculture of the antarctic research station at McMurdo Sound, the processes
of social interaction and extent of social support in coping with stress, and
the means of adjustment to the "winter-over syndrome". Epidemiologic methods
will assess baseline profiles of health, stress, and coping to prospectively
examine the effect of prolonged isolation on the effectiveness of these coping
strategies and resources in reducing subsequent stress- related illness. This
study will contribute to the understanding of isolated microsocieties and
interactions between health, environment and personality.
