The Department of Mathematics of the University of Tennessee will host the 1989
Spring Topology Conference. This is the 23rd annual conference in a series of
such conferences which have been held at various universities, many of them in
the Southeast. (The 22nd was held at the University of Florida.) Over the years,
many important areas of topology have been well-represented at these
conferences, and in recent years, dynamical systems theory has been integrated
into the conferences. There has been much interest and interaction among
participants, and in fact, several people from the traditional group have given
talks relating to dynamical systems. The conference will merge the two groups
again in 1989. It will again run for three full days in order to accommodate
additional talks. Most of the speakers will come from the traditional group.
Some survey talks by well-known researchers will be given as well as talks on
interesting new results.
