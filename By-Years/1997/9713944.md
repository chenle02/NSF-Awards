9713944 Bazant The fracture mechanics of concrete has progressed greatly, but
only for tensile fracture, which is essentially a uniaxial phenomenon. The
fracture mechanics of compression fracture, which is a triaxial phenomenon, is
essentially unavailable. The present proposal, involving both theoretical and
experimental studies, attempts to fill this gap. The theoretical program
involves: (1) energy-based mathematical model for the propagation of a band of
axial splitting crack (with internal buckling of microcracked material); (2)
asymptotic analysis of size effect and shape effect, leading to simple
`asymptotic-matching' formulas; (3) formulation of size-effect method for
deternining compression fracture characteristics; (4) generalization of the
existing microplane model for damage in compression, with consideration of the
effect of time or loading rate; and (5) application to the analysis of explosive
failure of high-strength concrete columns or walls subjected to fire. The
experimental program, designed to verify and calibrate the theory, involves: (1)
size-effect tests of double- cantilever fracture specimens with compression-
tension loading; (2) size effect tests of compression fracture of cylindrical
specimens with small or large notches; and (3) tests of the influence of rate or
time. ***
