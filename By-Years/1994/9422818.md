This project develops a theoretical framework for understanding the scope of
innovations in retailing with particular attention to competition and the
incentives to innovate and explore new service-oriented business practices. The
research includes empirical analysis that emphasizes competition between
established retailers and the new retail outlets such as warehouse stores. The
research comprises both theoretical and empirical analysis of competitive
strategies. The theory relies on a game theoretic formulation, with endogenous
consumer decisions predicated on information provided by firms. Where
information is lacking, consumers have expectations that are fulfilled in
equilibrium, i.e., are rational. The model also permits forward buying by
consumers. The empirical work consists of studying both firms' strategies and
consumer behavior. The firms' strategies include their positioning, pricing,
product assortment, service level and advertising. Consumer behavior is with
respect to their shopping behavior: choice of store, choice of product, and
inventorying. Thus, the empirical analysis is tied to the theoretical work. The
data will also match stores and consumers within the same geographic market. The
research should prove useful to both researchers and managers. Researches should
find the game theoretic foundation for the analysis of retailing useful to build
on as they tackle other aspects of retailing, and multi-product firms in
general. The empirical analysis will provide insights into how retail
innovations affect entrenched firms. Such insights are critical to understanding
market transitions, managerial effectiveness, and productivity. Managers should
find the results useful in formulating their strategies, and obtaining insights
which will prove useful as they enter new markets, for example, internationally.
