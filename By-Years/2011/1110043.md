The Oceanography Society will publish a special issue of the Journal
"Oceanography" on the topic of sea level. Understanding the causes and
consequences of sea level rise, and ultimately predicting its timing and
magnitude, as global temperatures increase is one of the most pressing
scientific problems of the day, with considerable socioeconomic impacts for
those who live in coastal and low-lying areas. The special issue of will include
articles written by scientists who use different techniques in their research:
scientific ocean drilling cores; satellite measurements; ocean observations from
floats, drifters, and moored arrays; and modeling, among others. The publication
of the special issue will be jointly supported by NSF and NOAA, NSF's share of
25K is 50% of the total cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit
&lt;br/&gt;In spite of its importance predicting future rise remains one of the
great challenges for climate science. To truly predict sea level rise a vigorous
and interdisciplinary research effort, including learning about sea level
fluctuations through Earth?s history is needed. The special issue of will bring
together authors from numerous disciplines to explore all of these aspects of
sea level rise, from the 100 m plus rises and falls of the past ice age, to
modern-day sea level rise and beyond. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts
&lt;br/&gt;Articles will be written for a broad, scientifically literate
audience so that cross-disciplinary discussions are facilitated and science is
also transmitted in a readable and professional way to managers and decision-
makers. Articles will be written by top researchers in their fields and include
references cited, and are peer reviewed. All articles are published online as
free access (no password required to retrieve an article).
