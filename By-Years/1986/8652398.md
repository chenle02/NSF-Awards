This school system/academic/AT&T partnership will establish a year long
computer science program for mathematical instruction for 46 teachers from 23
middle/junior high schools in the Ogden, Utah area. The immediate goals are to:
o assist experienced teachers develop mastery of BASIC and LOGO for mathematics
instruction under the exploration, problem solving and demonstration models; o
provide two teachers from each school with a classroom micro computer, modem and
printer donated by AT&T; o create a computer educational network between the
middle/junior high schools and Weber State College; o establish logistics for
participating teachers to become lead teachers of in-service computer workshops
for their colleagues. During an academic year and intensive six week summer
program, Weber State College in Utah will provide computer labs and teach
courses/labs for 23 teams of two teachers (from the same school) located in
three school districts. Eight academic credits will be awarded for course work
on the use of computers in middle/junior high school mathematics classes, and
the development of workshops to be taught by the participating teachers. While
taking these courses the participants will use the computers in their classes.
There will also be a hot line, computer network and classroom clinics.
