Understanding fundamentally quantum phenomena is of high interest because those
phenomena are important in applications that span from quantum information
processing to magnetic resonance imaging. This project will explore electronic
noise at the quantum scale, what environmental factors control it, and then how
to control it by design. In the larger landscape of quantum technology research,
this information will enable the design of effective quantum bits for
information processing and biomedical sensing applications. Beyond science, this
effort will build curricula focused on quantum information science and
engineering (QISE) for wide distribution and organize a local QISE-focused
workshop on understanding noise at the quantum level. The technical goal of this
project is to enable fast, efficient profiling of magnetic noise at the atomic
level. Noise at this scale is a critical challenge in the current state of
quantum computers and sensors because noise causes decoherence which destroys a
qubitâ€™s utility. To deal with said noise, technologists need to understand it:
what frequency is the noise, how loud is is, and what causes it. This project,
comprising an interdisciplinary chemistry and physics team from University of
Colorado Boulder and Colorado State University, will explore a new technique for
the efficient characterization of noise and benchmark the new method with both
solid-state qubits (like the NV center in diamond) and metal-containing
molecules through spectroscopic and theoretical methods. These studies will
extend the understanding of magnetic noise to an atomistic level beyond the
border of what it currently known.
