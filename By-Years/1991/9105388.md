This laboratory has identified a gene that appears to encode a novel class of
receptors in plants. The molecular architecture of this putative plant cell
receptor is reminiscent of the receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g. epidermal growth
factor receptor, insulin and insulin-like receptors, and platelet-derived growth
factor receptor) known in animals. It consists of a cytoplasmic domain that is
homologous to the serine/threonine-specific protein kinases. This kinase domain
is linked, via a membrane-spanning stretch of amino acids, to an extracellular
domain. This extracellular domain is related to S-locus (self-incompatibility)
glycoproteins of Brassica, which are involved in pollen recognition. The newly
isolated gene may represent a prototype of an entire class of plant cell
receptors with protein kinase activity. The proposed research will establish the
biochemical properties of the maize putative protein kinase and obtain a clear
understanding of its tissue, cellular, and subcellular distribution. All cells
bear on their surfaces molecular receptors that sense external information and
relay this information into the cell. The subject of the proposed research is a
newly identified receptor- like molecule in plants. The structure of this
molecule resembles that of some important growth factor receptors of animal
cells. The goal of this project is to study the biochemistry and distribution of
this molecule in plants. Molecules of this type could be of profound importance
in developmental and environmental responses and cell to cell signaling in
higher plants.
