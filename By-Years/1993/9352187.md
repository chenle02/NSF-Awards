The project will purchase a state-of-the-art Fourier Transform Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance Spectrometer (FT-NMR) to provide rapid characterization and
identification of compounds encountered by La Salle University chemistry
students in the course of their research and study. Chemistry majors will gain
insights into FT-NMR theory in Advanced Quantitative (Instrumental) Analysis and
Physical Chemistry. Structure elucidation methods in NMR spectroscopy
(particularly C-13 NMR) will be introduced in Organic Chemistry, and effectively
integrated into laboratories in Advanced Inorganic and Physical Chemistry. The
instrument will be used routinely in Advanced Organic Laboratory Methods. The
capacity of students to understand modern NMR methods and their improved
preparation for graduate school and for positions in industry will be evidence
of the successful outcome of this project.
