This award supports participation by graduate students and postdoctoral
researchers in the conference "Upcoming Researchers in Commutative Algebra"
(URICA-KUMUNU Jr) to be held in Lincoln, Nebraska on April 25-26th, 2020 and in
April 2021. The KUMUNU Jr conference series, of which this will be the ninth,
brings together mathematics graduate students and postdocs in the Midwest. This
meeting in commutative algebra is being hosted by the Department of Mathematics
at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will
feature thirteen talks given by early-career commutative algebraists. Building
on the success of the KUMUNU conference series, KUMUNU Jr has been a successful
way to bring together junior researchers from the Great Plains region, now
stretching from Utah to Michigan and North Dakota to Texas, to share their
research and expertise while building lasting collaborations. The Upcoming
Researchers in Commutative Algebra conference will continue to promote
interaction among a diverse group of junior researchers, graduate students, and
postdocs, while branching outside the initial triad of sponsors, the University
of Kansas, the University of Missouri, and the University of
Nebraska.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Visit

and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
