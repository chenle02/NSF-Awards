With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Bartlett will organize a very timely workshop on coupled
cluster theory. The NSF funds will specifically be used to allow graduate
students and postdoctorals to participate. This workshop will be organized so as
to encourage participation of chemists and physicists who work at the interface
of atomic physics and quantum chemistry. The impetus for the workshop is to
promote communication among the various groups who are contributing to the
development of coupled cluster theory and to identify what formal and
methodological developments are required in coupled cluster theory to make it
more applicable to essential problems. Among the topics to be discussed are
parity violation in atoms, continuum problems, and Rydberg states.
