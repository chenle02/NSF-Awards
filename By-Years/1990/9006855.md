Professor Dye will investigate the problem of convergence of products of linear
or nonlinear projections in Hilbert space. The work would generalize von
Neumann's famous result involving two orthogonal projections. The work involved
finds application in such diverse areas as the numerical solution of partial
differential equations, linear inequalities, mathematical programming, and image
recovery to name a few.
