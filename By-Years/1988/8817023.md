This award supports investigators from Augustana College and Ohio State
University in a joint vertebrate paleontologic- sedimentologic study of a new
vertebrate locality in the Beardmore Glacier region of Anarctica where a late
Early Triassic fauna, including abundant amphibians and reptiles of he
Cynognathus Zone, was found during the final days of the 1985-86 field season.
The fossils are found along the surface of an ancient stream channel, which has
been exhumed by recent erosion. Further collecting will greatly enlarge the
numbers of taxa in this fauna. The abundance of fossils and the ideal exposure
of the sediments in which they occur will permit the group to carry out
taphonomic studies, reconstruct the paleoecologic/environmental conditions for
the late Early Triassic vertebrate community, and work out stratigraphic
relations with other Gondwana continents.
