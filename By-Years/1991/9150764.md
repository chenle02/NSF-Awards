This award provides funds for the development of a multi-media simulation of
field ecology experiments to enhance the scientific process skills of students
in undergraduate biology courses. To accomplish the simulation, a computer
controlling a video disk will provide integrated real and animated images in
combination with appropriate sound. The environment chosen for the simulation
would be otherwise inaccessible to most undergraduate students because of danger
and because of significant time and financial demands. The development should be
of particular use in providing field experience to physically handicapped
students. In the simulation, the student designs experiments to test hypotheses,
collects data from images stored on the video disk, and then analyses and
interprets the data in terms of the original hypotheses.
