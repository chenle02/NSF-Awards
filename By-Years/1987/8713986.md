This action would provide funds for the Cornell Electron Storage Ring Facility:
operation of the storage ring, support services for external users and
collaborators, support of the Cornell CLEO experimental group and research and
development program for application of superconducting technology to RF particle
accelerating systems. Also provided are funds for the CESR/CLEO capital
improvement program begun in FY 1985. CESR is operated by the Floyd R. Newman
Laboratory of Nuclear Studies at Cornell University. The North region is
occupied at present by the CUSB collaboration (Columbia University and the State
University at Stony Brook). The Columbia-Stony Brook collaborators are
continuing their work with a recently improved detector augmented by bismuth
germinate. The focus of their work has been the study of photons and leptons. In
the South region a large magnetic detector, CLEO, is now being upgraded to have
the best particle tracking and photon detection possible with current
techniques. Most of what is known about the b-quark has been learned with these
detectors at CESR.
