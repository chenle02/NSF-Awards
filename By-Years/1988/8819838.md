Model systems using invertebrates have provided insightful and innovative new
information towards elucidating more complex neural events in mammals. Dr. Nagle
is using the control of egg- laying behavior in the marine mollusc Aplysia to
understand the cellular and molecular bases of neuroendocrine function. The
neurosecretory bag cells that synthesize and release a novel neuropeptide egg-
laying hormone (ELH) are model neuroendocrine cells that have been used
extensively to elucidate how neural cells function. His research program is
aimed at isolating and characterizing a membrane receptor protein which, in the
intact animal, binds the ELH and initiates a complex series of cellular and
behavioral events that culminate in egg laying and reproductive functions. The
gene that encodes this behaviorally important receptor protein will be cloned
and sequenced. With this knowledge, functional questions about how a hormonal
signal may be transduced by neural and non-neural cells can be examined. Thus,
understanding the expression of the peptide receptor in this simple behavioral
system should enhance our understanding and lead to generalities about receptor
expression in neuroendocrine functions.
