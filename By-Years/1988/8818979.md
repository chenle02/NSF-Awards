The primary goal of this research is to broaden the theoretical framework of
concurrent computing systems. In particular, a number of basic, conceptual
issues that arise in parallel and distributed computing, including fairness, the
expressiveness of indeterminate primitives, the possibility of developing a
fixed-point denotational semantics, the relationship with an operational
semantics, and identifying useful process logics will be studied. Once the basic
issues underlying concurrent systems are understood, researchers can begin to
harness the power of multi-processors more effectively. To facilitate a greater
understanding of concurrency, a new semantic model of concurrency, a fixed-
point, denotational model will be developed. This model will lead to a new
induction principles and to new insights about the role of continuity in the
mathematical semantics of concurrency. In addition, the model will help in the
classification of different types of indeterminate primitives. Ultimately, this
will lead to a greater understanding of the meaning of sequentially and
concurrency.
