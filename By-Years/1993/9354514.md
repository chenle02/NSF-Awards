9354514 Marschall This grant continues for two more years a project under which
the current investigators have been developing a series of modules for the
introductory astronomy lab since the Fall of 1992. The modules address a
pressing need for modernization in introductory astronomy laboratories: Though
astronomy is a very popular course for undergraduates, and for many their first
and only college experience in science, laboratories in introductory astronomy
have difficulty doing experiments because of the faintness of astronomical
objects, the long time scale of many phenomena and the fickleness of weather.
Most astronomy exercises currently available to astronomy instructors rely on
analysis of photographs or canned data and exemplify techniques that are
increasingly out-of-date. Students rightly regard many of these activities as
make-work. The current project, Contemporary Laboratory Experiences in Astronomy
(CLEA), is developing 8 Windows-based exercises, running on IBM-compatible
computers, that provide realistic observing experiences for introductory labs
based around simulations, digital images, and, observations with CCD cameras on
small telescopes. Each module consists of software, student guides, teachers'
manuals, and technical documentation. The Windows modules, along with 5 Mac-
based exercises and two digital imaging exercises introduced before NSF support,
have been introduced into classes at Gettysburg College and distributed widely
by ftp and by mail. CLEA software is currently in wide use. This project
continues the work for another two years, developing an additional 8 modules and
rewriting software and manuals so that the exercises can be used on Macintosh
computers with color displays. This includes documentation, distribution, and
dissemination of the modules. The new exercises improve students understanding
of astronomy and provide the means and the impetus for revitalizing introductory
astronomy laboratories around the country
