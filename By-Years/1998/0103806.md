Inventory of the Ferns and Fern Allies of Hawaii&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Hawaii
ferns and fern allies make up approximately one-sixth of the total native
vascular flora and comprise a very important element of the vegetation.
Unfortunately, there is no modern inventory of these plants. Many are poorly
known and understood, and many are rare, threatened, or endangered. The
objective of this project is to complete and publish a manual containing a
description and key to identification of the species, varieties, and hybrids of
all the ferns and fern allies of Hawaii. The manual will complement the two-
volume "Manual of the Flowering Plants of Hawaii" by W. L. Wagner (no relation),
D. R. Herbst, and S. H. Sohmer (1990). Descriptions of 70 percent of the species
have been completed with support of two previous NSF grants, but problems exist
in determining the names and relationships of many of the remaining
taxa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Field surveys in Hawaii will be made and herbarium
collections will be studied, especially at the Bishop Museum, Honolulu.
Volunteer botanists in Hawaii have already augmented our knowledge of existing
species, finding some that were thought to be extinct. Explorations by them in
seemingly inaccessible locations will contribute substantially to the completion
of the manual. Photocopies of fresh specimens collected in the&lt;br/&gt;field
will be used for illustrations in the manual. Duplicate specimens will be
distributed to herbaria throughout the world. A database for Hawaiian ferns will
be developed.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Hawaiian ferns suggests taxonomic
problems beyond the scope of the manual. The islands are geographically the most
isolated in the world, and, without land bridges to the continents, the ferns
have adapted and evolved in diverse ways. A complete manual of the ferns and
fern allies will encourage and enable botanists to study questions of their
origin and evolution. Hawaii has many naturalists and non-professional botanists
who, for years, have been asking for a manual with which to identify this
important element of the vegetation, before the invasion of exotic species and
encroaching development eliminate more of this flora. &lt;br/&gt;
