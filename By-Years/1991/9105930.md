This project will study differential delay equations and iterations of
nonexpansive maps. Main emphasis will be placed in extending current knowledge
to the cases of several delays and of delays depending on the state. In
particular, for equations depending on a small parameter and delays depending on
the state, the project will study the boundary layer phenomenon resulting in
periodic solutions when the parameter tends to zero. Analysis of nonexpansive
mappings through generalizations of properties of linear stochastic matrices
will be pursued. Models in biology, economics, physics and even other branches
of mathematics motivate the main problems to be studied. The generality of the
questions will make the results relevant to most areas of basic science.
