ANT-0914508 &lt;br/&gt;Title: Operation and Return of the Pre-HEAT Telescope on
Dome A&lt;br/&gt;PI: Dr. Christopher K. Walker, University of
Arizona&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SGER award entitled "Pre-HEAT: First
Submillimeter Site Testing and Astronomical Spectra from Dome A" was awarded to
the University of Arizona to supply a site-testing small telescope Pre-HEAT to
the Australian PLATO autonomous module. The PLATO module was then successfully
deployed at Dome A, the highest point on the Antarctic Plateau, in the 2007-08
austral summer as part of a science site-testing program jointly developed by
the Australia-Chinese team of astronomers. The objectives of this program was to
utilize Pre-HEAT as a pioneering mission which night pave the way for future
far-infrared astronomical investigations from Dome A. Pre-HEAT maps the Southern
Galactic Plane in the spectral light of 13CO J=6-5, a key measure of the warm,
dense gas that participates in star formation and stellar-interstellar feedback.
The Pre-HEAT observational program was mostly successful through austral winter
of 2008; it is now continued through 2009. This proposal seeks funding to return
these instruments back to University of Arizona. Continued reliance on students
provides a broader impact to this proposed research and firmly grounds this
effort in its educational mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
