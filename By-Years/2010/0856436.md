Recent developments in nanostructures have brought to light exceptional
electromagnetic, thermal and optical properties of a class of foam-like
nanostructures formed of disordered intertwined structural units (nanowires,
nanobelts, nanotubes). Such disordered assemblies are named turfs. Applications
include thermal switches, flat panel displays, hard discs drives, and, chemical
and biological sensors. Although the mechanical properties are usually not the
primary service characteristic of turfs, they are nevertheless of paramount
importance. Irrespective of application, the turfs are often subjected to
mechanical loads, either as service load as in thermal switches, or, as
accidental contacts. Under externally forced deformation, the nano-topology of
the turf changes, which, in turn, affects all the other effective properties:
electrical, thermal, optical, sensing and permeability. We will develop an
integrated approach to the problem: multiscale modeling, nanomechanical
experiments, and, nanostructure characterization, with the following objectives:
Understanding and quantification of the behavior of turfs as materials on the
basis of the physical and geometrical properties of the individual units and
their collective behavior in the assembly. Development of the nanoscale
characterization methods that reveal the relevant parameters of the
nanostructure. Practical technological impact of the project is that the results
will enable rational design of nanoturfs tailored for particular application in
sensors, thermal switches and other devices. The REU component of the program is
carefully structured and includes assessment methods, developed and proven at
the Center for Teaching and Learning at WSU. Our pilot student mentoring program
will provide graduate students with mentoring experience a skill that PhD
graduates need, but is sorely missing in most graduate programs.
