This project is engaging 10 undergraduate students per year in summer research
experiences at North Dakota State University in the area of STEM education. The
students are conducting research under the guidance of a faculty mentor while
learning from each other. The students are learning qualitative and quantitative
research methods, scientific communication skills, and becoming familiar with
career paths in STEM Education Research. These students are being uniquely
prepared for PhD-level training in STEM education research at this institution
and others with programs in this rapidly growing area. The institution is
building on its strengths in discipline-based education research in biochemistry
education, biology education, chemistry education, physics education and math
education. The research projects that students are engaging in are integrating
across STEM disciplines, and they include: studying how undergraduate students
learn quantitative reasoning skills, develop systems thinking, and learn
visualization skills, as well as how to close achievement gaps between various
groups in science and mathematics. This project is advancing knowledge and
understanding of effective teaching and learning in STEM while providing an
authentic research experience to undergraduates. Students from groups
underrepresented in STEM are being targeted for recruitment in this program,
including undergraduates at Sitting Bull College, a Tribal College.
