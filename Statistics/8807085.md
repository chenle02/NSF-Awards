This work will focus on three areas of theoretical statistics: (1) Bayesian
modelling and analysis of time series, including time domain and frequency
domain approaches to both long memory and short memory models, (2) other
Bayesian projects including nonlinear regression models and measurement error
models, and (3) Bayes causal networks and belief functions, including
mathematical characterization of these new models, as well as the development of
principles for model construction and computation that are required for
practical use. Dempster's work in theoretical statistics is becoming
foundational for other scientists attempting to incorporate the realities of
uncertainty into expert computer systems. In addition to extending relevant
theory, he will tackle the computational bottleneck that now blocks successful
widespread implementation of these models.
