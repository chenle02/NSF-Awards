A workshop focusing on the process for initiation, management and assessment of
significant curriculum changes within undergraduate engineering programs will be
presented. Participants will be provided with (1) lessons learned elsewhere and
(2) plans and guidance for how to implement curriculum changes in their own
schools. There have been numerous forums and workshops developing prescriptions
for curriculum changes, and a general consensus has emerged that substantial
changes are needed in many programs. However, reforming engineering curricula
has proven difficult except for occasional courses with existing programs. This
workshop is not intended to prescribe necessary changes, but to focus on how to
achieve such changes: how to insure faculty "buy- in", how to assess budgetary
impacts, how to organize committees, etc. Participation will be sought from a
broad range of engineering schools. The workshop will be held at Carnegie Mellon
University in June, 1996, and the written materials developed for the workshop
and subsequently emerging will be available in written form and via the World
Wide Web.
