This award is in the joint ENG/CISE research thrust in Intelligent Material
Handling Systems. This research effort studies mobile manipulation for material
handling, in the form of integrated control of a mobile platform and robotic
arm. Such an integrated system can offer major advances in material handling,
providing a wide range of new capabilities for such systems. This includes the
ability to function in a partially modelled environment, the ability to carry
out a diverse set of operational tasks relevant to material handling, and the
ability to carry out those tasks in real time. The highly interdisciplinary
research team brings together a wide-ranging collection of enabling technologies
including system architecture, robotic modeling, sensing, navigational planning,
reactive control, micromanipulation, and others. The involvement of Georgia
Tech's existing Materials Handling Research Center will provide an appropriate
venue for both testing of ideas and facilitation of technology transfer to
interested industrial partners.
