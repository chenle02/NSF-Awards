The PI has been provided with a unique opportunity to test a design concept
which could dramatically improve the way in which printed circuit boards are
designed. Wolfgang Schenke, Vice-President of CALAY (one of the state-of-the-art
companies in PCB rounting), and the author of CALAY's routing routine, has
offered access to his expertise and Calay's facilities for a limited time this
summer. The purpose of this effort would be to conduct an exploratory study to
determine:
