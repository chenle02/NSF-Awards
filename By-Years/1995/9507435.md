9507435 Bradley Small insects have a large surface to volume ratio. Since the
loss of body water occurs across the integument, such a ratio leads to severe
water loss in insects. A major site of water loss in all animals is the
respiratory system. Insects control this loss through the action of valves
(spiracles) on their breathing tubes (tracheae). Dr. Bradley will study the
action of the spiracles in fruit flies selected for resistance to desiccation.
His hypothesis is that the respiratory pattern in these insects will be highly
modified to conserve water. This study will be of interest to insect
physiologists and ecologists interested in the distribution and survival of
insects and in the control of insect pests by disruption of the respiratory and
water conservation systems. ***
