Research has shown that there is a critical salt concentration (CSC) and a
critical rate of change in salt concentration at which water sensitivity damage
is initiated. In the second phase of the research, the researcher elucidating
the chemical and colloidal phenomena involved in sandstone water sensitivity. In
addition to explaining the different degrees of damage produced by different
salts and solvents, he is investigating additives that will eliminate or
minimize water sensitivity in sandstone. Finally, the development of a
comprehensive chemical and physical model to predict the permeability decrease
resulting from the water sensitivity of sandstone is being continued.
