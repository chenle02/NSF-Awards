This project is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program. Its focus is the kinetics and mechanisms of main-group
inorganic reactions in aqueous solution. Stopped-flow methods (with single
wavelength, rapid scan and conductivity detection) will be used to obtain
kinetic data. The stopped-slow data will be used to obtain rate constants,
reaction rate laws and stoichiometries. Reactions to be studied include: 1)
Selected electron transfer reactions between pairs of main-group redox couples,
in order to provide stringent tests of the applicability of Marcus theory to
reactions between species of widely differing ionic radii; 2) electron transfer
reactions involving chlorine/dichloride, bromine/dibromide,
hydroxylammonium/hydroxylamine, and NO/NO- as redox couples, where the reaction
partners are substitution-inert coordination complexes, leading to standard
redox potentials and effective self-exchange rate constants for the main-group
couples; 3) dihydrogen transfer from diimide (now that methods are available to
generate and detect this species) with emphasis on reactions with dioxygen,
diiodine and hydrogen peroxide, as well as with olefins and one-electron
oxidants; 4) inner-sphere reactions in which sulfite is oxidized by
tetrachloroaurate(III) and other coordination complexes, probing the mechanistic
factors that lead to formation of the S-S bond in dithionate; 5) the reactions
of NO with dioxygen and of sulfur trioxide with water, because of their
relevance to environmental issues. %%% Reactions of molecules containing the so-
called main-group elements, such as nitrogen, sulfur, chlorine and bromine, are
of great importance in industry and in everyday life, with examples including
the purification of drinking water and the action of chlorine bleach in the home
washing machine. In addition to providing a better understanding of how many of
these common reactions occur, the results of this project may provide insight
into how to avoid detrimental side reactions, such as the formation on
carcinogens during the chlorination of sewage plant effluents.
