The research proposed here is a continuation of the previous grant, aimed at
understanding the statistical mechanics and dynamics of a variety of surfaces
and interfaces. There are various interesting and fundamental issues, relevant
to many different fields that remain to be probed. Most of these questions fall
into the following broad categories: (1) Random Manifolds, such as polymers and
membranes, obtained from embeddings in a higher dimensional space. (2) Evolving
interfaces, such as a growing crystal facet, swelling gel, or a flowing
sandpile. (3) Interfaces and Paths in Random Media are relevant to studies as
diverse as the trapping of flux lines in a dirty superconductor, to the
interference of Feynman paths in a doped semiconductor.
