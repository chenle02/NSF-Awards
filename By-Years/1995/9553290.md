A series of workshops at selected sites (4-5) will examine effective models to
effect cooperative efforts, as regards teacher preparation programs, between
faculty in the college of education and discipline and research centered faculty
in mathematics and the sciences; and between these faculty and faculty from K-12
schools. The sites will be those which already have major initiatives from the
Institute and from DUE and so have indicated a commitment to fostering such
cooperation. Science and education personnel from the Institute will conduct the
workshops within a format that will insure a report which includes the
following: an inventory of current efforts in reform of teacher preparation
programs; a description of current working groups; and a design for increasing
effective communication among the groups. Dissemination of these reports will be
encoupaged.
