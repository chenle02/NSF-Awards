The Chemistry Department is purchasing equipment to increase the analytical
experience in lower division courses. The students are using capillary column
gas chromatography (gc) in the freshman year to study intermolecular forces,
analyze environmental samples and to study reaction mechanisms. Personal
computers are being used to introduce high-field Fourier transform nuclear
magnetic resonance (ft-nmr) spectroscopy to students in the second year of the
chemistry core curriculum. Students receive fid files for their unknown samples
which they use to transform, phases, integrate and finally plot the spectra.
