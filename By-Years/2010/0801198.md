Kapranov proposes to study several infinite-dimensional algebro-geometric
objects such as schemes and ind-schemes with the view of applications to
problems originally motivated by mathematical physics. Thus, he proposes to
relate the elliptic cohomology of a complex projective variety to its derived
category of coherent sheaves. While this problem is ``finite-dimensional'' in
its nature, the main technical tool here is the infinite-dimensional ind-scheme
of formal loops introduced by Kapranov and Vasserot. He further proposes to
develop intersection theory and the theory of projective duality for ind-schemes
which would, among other things, interchange inductive and projective limits. He
proposes to study algebro-geometric models of the spaces of unparametrized paths
by using free Lie algebras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applications of mathematics in
several areas make it necessary to study infinite-dimensional spaces. For
example, the states of a vibrating medium such as a string, form an infinite-
dimensional space. In string theory in physics, such picture was proposed as
describing the fundamental interactions in nature.&lt;br/&gt;In any approach,
study of infinite-dimensional objects is highly nontrivial. The traditional
approach to the situation, using analysis, presents additional difficulties such
as problems of convergence of series etc. Kapranov proposes a geometric study of
infinite-dimensional spaces using techniques from algebra. This allows one to
concentrate on essential phenomena which in many cases can be understood using
the intuition from finite dimensions and to highlight the cases when the finite-
dimensional intuition needs to be modified.
