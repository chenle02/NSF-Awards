The Keystone Center proposes to bring together a group of influential and
productive scientists and others actively involved in science funding decisions
to engage in a scientist-to scientist advocacy colloquim on national research
goals. The dialogue will consist of a week-long series of meetings in Keystone,
Colorado, involving between 30 and 40 participants from scientific
organizations, the academic community, government agencies, and the science and
technology industry. Through structured, presentations, champions of various
points of view from various disciplines (e.g., high energy physics, molecular
biology, astrophysics, chemistry, and super conductivity) will be give the
opportunity to urge colleagues to understand and share their enthusiasm about
programs being pursued by people with visions other than their own.
