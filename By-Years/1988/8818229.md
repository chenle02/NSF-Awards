This project will continue analysis and interpretation of data obtained from
several existing riometer systems and provide funds for the construction of a
new imaging riometer (IRIS or Imaging Riometer for Ionospheric Studies)
identical to the new IRIS at South Pole. The new IRIS will be located at
Frobisher Bay, NWT, Canada, which is the magnetically conjugate point to South
Pole. IRIS is a unique instrument which images the aurora, even when the
atmosphere is sunlit by measuring the atmospheric attentuation of galactic radio
noise. The two conjugate IRIS's together will allow the simultaneous studies of
auroral morphology in conjugate regions at any time of day or year and
irrespective of weather conditions. This will be the first time that this will
be possible using any technique.
