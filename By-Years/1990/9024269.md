Dr. Kenneth A. Goldsby of Florida State University is being supported by the
Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division to
develop model compounds for proton-coupled electron transfer reactions. The
complexes will contain only one proton susceptible to transfer, thus assuring a
single reversible pH-dependent couple. The complexes synthesized will contain
ruthenium (II) and ligands such as substituted imidazoles and related
heterocyclic compounds, pyridine aldehydes, (pyrazolyl)pyridines, and diketones.
The mechanism of electron transfer will be studied using stopped-flow
spectrscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and NMR line-broadening. Also, bimetallic
complexes in which changes in the pH can trigger reversible electron transfer
between the metals will be prepared. %%% By careful design, complexes will be
"tuned" to effect electron transfer at particular values of pH and potential.
This study may have application to molecular switches and to understanding
biological electron transfer reactions which involve a proton.
