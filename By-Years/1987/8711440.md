This project will combine archaeology and ethnoarchaeology to study the role of
storing foods and goods in the development of complex societies. Specifically,
the researcher will look at household storage behavior in Mesoamerica by using
historic and ethnohistoric documents and test a resulting model on prehistoric
settlements in the Puuc region of Yucatan, Mexico. The goal of the research is
to understand the physical remains of the storage of food and objects, the
activity of storing things, and how the way people stored goods has affected the
archaeological record. Analyses will concentrate on the socioeconomic role of
storage particularly by specifying the relationships between status differences
and agricultural production. The role of household storage in the development of
complex societies has received little attention in the New World, even though
archaeologists have recognized it as an important component in the development
of social complexity. This research will begin to define the material remains of
domestic storage in traditional agricultural societies and infer behavioral and
social roles from this evidence. The storing of water, agricultural food
surpluses and goods is crucial to complex societies around the world. What is
being stored, how and where the stores are housed and who controls access to the
facilities are crucial characteristics for understanding the social and economic
aspects of class differentiation. This project should help archaeologists
understand the full labor costs of this poorly understood aspect of social
stratification in agricultural societies.
