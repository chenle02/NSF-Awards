Most therories of chemical coevolution between plants and insects assume
reciprocal genetic changes effected by the interacting species. Definitive
genetic changes, however, have rarely been examined in natural systems. In the
interaction between Depressaria pastinacella, the parsnip webworm, and Pastinaca
sativa, the wild parsnip, herbivory varies according to plant furanocoumarin
content and webworms can exert sufficient selection pressure to cause changes in
the distribution of these genetically controlled chemical traits in plant
populations. In this project, the extent to which physiological and behavioral
responses to parsnip furanocoumarins are under genetic control in parsnip worms
and whether these chemicals can exert sufficient selection pressure to change
the distribution of physiological and behavioral traits in webworm populations
will be determined. This study will therefore provide quantitative data for
evaluating not only concepts of chemically mediated coevolution but also more
general theories of host adaptation and speciation in herbivorous insects.
