This effort involves transferring the prototype interactive expert system for
packet-switched network design from its current IBM 4341 Fortran environment to
Fortran on a Cray X-MP, and assessing the limits to the size of network design
and number of performance measures calculated per design the system could
support with acceptable response times in an interactive session. This effort
will answer questions regarding the limits of growth to packet-switched networks
which are virtually unanswerable simply because our current considerably-
simplified models of such networks still increase exponentially in run-time with
the number of nodes in the network being modeled.
