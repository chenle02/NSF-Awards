This PI team has been practicing and studying the use of case study teaching in
science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines for the past
12 years and has shared the method through local workshops and an annual
conference to train faculty. As a result, case study teaching has been tested in
hundreds of classrooms and has been found to be superior to the traditional
lecture method. In addition, the PI team has created a national website to
disseminate cases and teaching notes. This project is disseminating the case
study teaching method at the national level through the proven method of
teaching via satellite workshops at college campuses, presentations at STEM
conferences, distance learning courses, and science education journals. Each of
the three years of the project the PI team runs four workshops, two in Buffalo
and two at satellite sites, accommodating 40 faculty members at each workshop.
In addition, pre-conference seminars are also being presented at a variety of
professional society meetings. Three special issues of the Journal of College
Science Teaching are being devoted solely to the case study method. Complete
courses and individual lessons are being disseminated through the project
website. Evaluation of the method is ongoing as a result of training STEM
faculty to use classroom action research.
