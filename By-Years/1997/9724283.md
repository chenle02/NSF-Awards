9724283 Mutter This award to Columbia University in the City of New York
provides funds for acquisition of a new digital multi-channel seismic reflection
streamer and acquisition electronics for use by academic researchers throughout
the United States and, collaboratively, around the world. The system will be
installed on R/V Maurice Ewing, a research vessel owned by NSF and operated by
Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. R/V Ewing is operated as
part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System. This award
provides state-of-the-art capability for marine geophysical research, including
3-D surveying, and extends the existing streamer length by 50%, allowing higher
resolution imaging of ocean crustal structure. The award includes support from
both Division of Ocean Sciences and the Major Research Instrumentation Program,
and it includes a substantial cost-share contribution from Columbia University.
