This three-year award supports U.s.-France cooperative research in mathematical
physics between Daniel Boyanovsky, University of Pittsburgh, and Hector J. de
Vega, Theoretical Physics Laboratory, University of Paris VI. The main objective
of the proposal is to investigate current topics in quantum field theory and
statistical mechanics, in particular the early stages of phase transitions,
tunneling and metastability in field theory, relationship between quantum
integrability and renormalization. These topics have applications to a broad
range of problems in cosmology (early stages of evolution of the early
universe), particle physics, condensed matter physics (superconductivity) and
statistical mechanics. The investigators bring to this collaboration their
complementary expertise on these diverse topics. Dr. Boyanovsky has been working
on problems in mathematical physics from the point of view of equilibrium and
non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and field theory. The French investigator
is well-known for his expertise in non-perturbative field theory methods and
techniques for studying physics at finite temperature.
