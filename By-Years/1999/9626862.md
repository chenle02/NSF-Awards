This project is a continuation of a multi-year effort to discover and
understand efficient data structures, combinatorial algorithms, and the
relationships between the two. The emphasis is placed on studying problems that
are fundamental, longstanding, and/or of significant practical importance.
Sought are not only specific algorithmic results, but also general principles of
design and analysis. In particular, the goals of the project include: (1) to
devise specific algorithms and data structures that result in more efficient
solutions of important combinatorial problems; (2) to study the worst-case and
typical-case performance of new and older methods, to allow prediction of the
best method for a given situation; (3) to develop general tools and principles
for design and analysis, and apply these tools and principles systematically in
the construction of new algorithms and data structures. Asymptotic efficiency is
not the only goal; methods are sought that display simplicity and even elegance
in addition to efficiency. Success is achieved when a method is found that is
both theoretically efficient and usable in practice. The objective is not only
to devise new methods, but to gain greater insights into old ones, so that all
solutions can be stripped down to their essence, achieving both greater
efficiency and greater simplicity.***
