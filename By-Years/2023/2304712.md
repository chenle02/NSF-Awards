This project will support students at U.S. institutions to attend the 2023 IEEE
International Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM) conference, May
17-20 in the New York City area. This student travel support will enable sharing
scientific information and stimulating research interests for U.S. based
graduate students in the field of communications and networking. Attending IEEE
INFOCOM will be highly valuable for graduate students. Not only will they be
exposed to the state-of-the-art in the field, but they will also have the
opportunity to interact with peers from institutions worldwide, meet with
leading researchers, and take part in discussions that are likely to shape the
future of the field.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
