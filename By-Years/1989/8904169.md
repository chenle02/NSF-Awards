This research is to develop theoretical perturbation methods towards inversion
of seismograms for 3-D earth structure. Improved realism in theoretical methods
is a field which promises to yield major new results on earth structure. An
important application will be to the dramatically improved new data sets such as
those which the NSF-supported PASSCAL instrumentation will produce. Perturbation
methods will be applied to the calculation of functional derivatives for seismic
inversion. The ultimate goal is the simultaneous inversion of both travel-time
and amplitude for velocity, attenuation and interface parameters. Because this
work will provide basic theoretical analysis techniques for a wide range of
seismic investigations including those anticipated for determination of
earthquake-related crustal structures, it is a contribution to the basic
research of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
