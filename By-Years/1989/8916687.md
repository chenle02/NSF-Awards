This award provides one-half of the funds required for the purchase of
replacement X-ray generators and tubes to be used on the X-ray diffractometer
system at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH). The AMNH is committed
to providing the remaining funds needed for this acquisition. The Department of
Mineral Sciences at AMNH carries out programs in mineralogy and petrology that
involve the use of X- ray diffraction techniques in research, educational and
museum curatorial activities. The replacement of their X-ray generators and
tubes will allow this work to go on efficiently.
