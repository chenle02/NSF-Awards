ABSTRACT The Principal Investigators propose to conduct an experimental study
of forced convective boiling flow through channels that are of millimeters in
height. The flow will be hydrodynamically and thermally developing. Heat
transfer data will be collected for single-phase flow, boiling incipience, and
conditions leading up to the critical heat flux. A liquid crystal thermograph
developed for a previous pool boiling study will be used to obtain temperature
profiles for the entire heated section of the test channel. The liquid crystal
data will provide spatiotemporal information concerning the development of the
boiling front. Based on the experimental data, correlations for heat transfer in
the different flow regimes will be developed.
