NEUROGENESIS AND THE MAKINGS OF MEMORIES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few
years ago now, it was rediscovered that the adult brain continues to produce new
neurons throughout the lifespan. A structure known as the hippocampus generates
thousands of new neurons each day, underscoring an amazing capacity for change
throughout life. Numerous studies have been undertaken to try to find out what
these new neurons do and several indicate that they may participate in the
formation of new memories. Specifically, it has been shown that animals in which
neurogenesis is prevented cannot form some types of new memories, often referred
to as trace memories, yet readily acquire other types of memories. One of the
more curious features of these new neurons is that most die within weeks of
their birth. However, it has also been shown that learning these types of memory
tasks can rescue the new neurons from death. Overall, the data suggest that new
neurons in the hippocampus are somehow involved in the formation of memories.
With funding from NSF, Dr. Shors and her laboratory will determine exactly how
new neurons are used in the formation of new memories and what it about learning
that enhances their survival. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neurogenesis has not only
captured the imagination of neuroscientists but also the public at large, many
of whom are young people now attracted to a career in science. Dr. Shors
provides public lectures on the topic and from these activities as well as her
website, publications and visits to universities and local schools, has
attracted large numbers of students interested in these studies. With the
support of NSF, Dr. Shors will continue her efforts to attract new students,
especially women and minorities as well as to distribute information about this
exciting topic and its implications for human experience. &lt;br/&gt;
