The work under this grant is in the general area of Probability Theory with
special emphasis on a number of stochastic models with interesting spatial
structure. One project, with C.D. Howard, concerns Euclidean first-passage
percolation and aims to prove the nonexistence of doubly infinite geodesics and
derive the values of two-dimensional fluctuation exponents that to date have
only been proved using exact solution methods for models with special
combinatorial structure. Other collaborative projects are on interacting
particle systems. One is with L.R. Fontes, M. Isopi and K. Ravishankar and
concerns aging, scaling limits and chaotic time dependence in such systems as
voter models with random rates. Another is with F. Camia, E. De Santis and
others and concerns local transience, recurrence and absorption issues for zero-
temperature stochastic Ising models, including those with random environments.

In the general area of probability theory, an increasingly important role is
played by systems in which random effects are observed in the spatial structure
rather than in, or in addition to, the behavior as a function of time (as in
models of equity prices). Some of these models, such as first-passage
percolation, have arisen separately in multiple contexts, such as fluid flow in
porous media (which is relevant for example to modelling of pollutant dispersion
in aquifers), polymer structure and other parts of materials science. The
research under this grant concerns the mathematical phenomena that occur in
several representative examples of such stochastic systems with interesting
spatial structure. Although the main focus is on rigorous mathematical results
for simplified models, the long term goal is to provide new understanding and
tools that will be useful for the more complex models used in applications.
