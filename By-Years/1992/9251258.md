The Bayamon University College of Inter American University of Puerto Rico has
adopted a new mission. Degrees in the fields of electrical, industrial,
mechanical and computer engineering, electronics and computer technologies,
health-related professions, and telecommunications are being created and
implemented. Highlights of the engineering curricula will include up-to-date
laboratory facilities, robotics courses, sub-specialties within each degree,
cross-disciplinary subjects, a major in manufacturing processes within each
field, and a pre-engineering curriculum common to all disciplines. A new campus
will soon be constructed to house these programs. This ILI project will provide
funds to upgrade the computer sciences program, which will play a central role
in all of the high technology curricula. These funds will be utilized to
purchase 32 microcomputers and associated peripherals to replace current
outmoded and inadequate equipment with some of the latest computer hardware and
software. Funds are also provided to place all existing computers in a network,
allowing a student to access all computer resources within campus from any
terminal. This upgrade in equipment is being accompanied by a revision in the
curriculum in which emphasis is shifted from business to scientific
applications. Several hundred students will use the facilities each year. Almost
100% of the students who will benefit from the project will be Puerto Rican.
