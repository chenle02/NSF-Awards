This project will organize an international workshop to evaluate the current
state-of-the-art on the reliability based design procedures applied to timber
structures. The project is conducted jointly with the NATO International
Scientific Exchange Programs. The workshop is planned for late fall 1991 in
Colorado. Proceedings of the workshop will be widely distributed.
