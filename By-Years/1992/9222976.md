This project involves studies of novel magneto-optically active materials. The
structures include artificially structured magnetic multilayers, thin films and
nanoscale clusters of nanocrystalline composites, and manganese-based compounds
and films with anisotropic structures. The work will focus on 1) the
relationships between magnetization reversal, domain dynamics, and
nanostructures of the films, and 2) fundamental magneto-optical properties of
novel phases synthesized to produce significant magneto-optic effects. A range
of magnetization measurements will be performed. In addition, spectroscopic
ellipsometry will be used to fully characterize the dielectric tensor properties
of the materials. In selected cases, photoemission measurements will be used to
study the electronic structure of the new compounds. The measurements will
increase the understanding of fundamental relationships between electronic
structure and magneto-optics in several new classes of transition metal
compounds. %%% Magnetic thin films and particulate magnetic materials are being
synthesized and studied to determine their megneto-optic properties -- which are
critical in determining their utility as magnetic storage media. The objective
of the research is to prepare new materials with enhanced properties and
potential for use in optical storage discs, computer hard discs, and other form
of magnetic storage device. The fundamental properties of the materials will be
investigated by magnetic and optical spectroscopy techniques.
