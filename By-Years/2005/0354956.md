The researchers will conduct a measurement of the anapole moment in francium,
the heaviest of the alkali metals, in an optical trap. The anapole moment of a
nucleus is a parity non-conserving, time reversal conserving moment that arises
from weak interactions between the nucleons. It can be detected by measuring the
change in the transition rate of an electric dipole atomic transition in the
ground state hyperfine levels in the presence of a right and left handed
coordinate systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The experiment requires trapping
francium atoms on line with an accelerator, cool and transporting them to a
second science chamber where the atoms will be placed at the anti-node of a
standing microwave cavity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The measurement of an anapole
moment is a unique probe for neutral weak interactions inside the nucleus. This
proposal combines precision measurement techniques from atomic molecular and
optical physics with the forefront understanding of low energy nuclear structure
for the elucidation of the weak interaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
will involve graduate students and postdoctoral research associates working
closely with the faculty members involved.&lt;br/&gt;
