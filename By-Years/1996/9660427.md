*** ABSTRACT 9660427 How This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
project will investigate an innovative design of planar microwave and millimeter
wave (MMW) circulators compatible with integrated circuits. Traditionally,
ferrite circulators are made using bulk materials in which holes need to be
drilled to a very small tolerance in the dielectric substrates, and, hence, the
fabrication cost are high. In addition, the need for permanent magnets further
impedes the development of circulator designs toward monolithic microwave/MMW
circuits. During Phase I, potential circuit geometries for designing practical
planar microwave/MMW circulators will be identified, proof-of-concept
experiments will be completed, and a commercialization strategy will be
outlined. During Phase II, a prototype thin-film circulator will be designed,
fabricated and tested and self-biasing circulators employing hexagonal ferrite
films will be developed. Major cost and applicability issues associated with
commercialization of the proposed circulator designs will be explored. This
research and development will seek to provide low cost production of circulators
that will facilitate their commercialization so that high performance
circulators can find direct commercial applicability in the radar and
communication industries. The results of this research effort will enhance U.S.
competitiveness by advancing the state-of-the-art in the knowledge and
understanding of microwave/MMW integrated-circuit circulators. ***
