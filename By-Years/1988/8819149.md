Signal peptidases are the key enzymes which are responsible for removing the
transient amino-terminal "signal peptides" which direct cellular proteins across
specific membrane barriers. The signal peptidase to be studied in this project
is the one which cleaves the signal peptide from nascent secretory or membrane
proteins which are directed through the rough endoplasmic reticulum membrane.
Yeast signal peptidase will be purified and characterized, and proteins
associated with signal peptidase function will be isolated. Genes encoding these
proteins will be cloned and used in functional studies in vivo. The role of the
sec11 gene product (sec 11 is one of a series of yeast mutants with impaired
secretory function) in signal peptide function will be investigated. This
research will increase our understanding of the molecular basis of intracellular
protein transport. This will lead not only to an enhanced understanding of
fundamental life processes at the cellular level, but may also have practical
applications in biotechnology, particularly in the production of genetically-
engineered fermentation products.
