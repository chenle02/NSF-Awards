9315920 McPhee The proposed work is part of an integrated research program
("Anzflux") into the oceanographic structure of upper mixed layer of the eastern
Weddell Sea. It is to be carried out from the RVIB Nathaniel B. Palmer in the
austral winter of 1994. The work proposed here is an effort to define the
vertical and horizontal thermohaline fluxes within the eastern part of the
Weddell Gyre. Specifically, instrument clusters capable of measuring the
Reynolds stress and the turbulent heat flux directly will be suspended from the
sea ice near the ship for two separate fifteen day drift periods. Also,
microconductivity sensors at three levels in the water will provide the directly
measured salinity flux, and a number of thermistor strings frozen in the ice
will measure the heat conduction within the ice and the ice mass balance. These
measurements, in conjunction with other concurrent experiments to quantify the
energy brought to the underside of the ice, will form the basis of a regional
study of the processes responsible for the relatively thick upper mixed layer
and thin ice cover. It is believed that these conditions are only marginally
stable, and are maintained by a relatively high upward heat flux, which, if
interrupted, could lead to deep vertical convection, and a significant change in
the oceanic climate. ***
