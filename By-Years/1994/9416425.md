9416425 Scawthorn This project is being funded as part of the National
Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program's investigation into the causes and effects
of the January 17, 1994 Northridge earthquake. The study will involve the
analysis of data collected by such organizations as the California Department of
Insurance on insurance losses sustained in the earthquake. Analysis of this
information will permit more accurate determination of the effects of
deductibles, and of the relation of building shake loss to other losses, such as
fire, inland marine, and workers compensation. Analyses involving statistical
and GIS techniques will include examination of such questions as: What is the
distribution of losses by geographical area, and by soil type? To what extent
did poor soils play a role in damage? What is the distribution of losses by
structural age and type? What is the relative contribution of structural damage
to overall losses, as opposed to contents damage and loss of use? How did
ultimate insurance claims compare against initial building inspector estimates
of damage? ***
