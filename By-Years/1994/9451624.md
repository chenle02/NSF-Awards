9451624 Simonis The Department of Chemistry is rejuvenating a an aging high
field FT-NMR to provide undergraduate majors with an understanding of the wide
applications of NMR spectroscopy in biochemistry and inorganic chemistry. The
main emphasis of these curricular revisions is to give undergraduates hands-on
experience in modern one- and two-dimensional homo- and non-proton heteronuclear
NMR techniques such as 13C and 31P NMR heteronuclear correlation spectroscopy
important to the structural characterization of biomolecules. In the inorganic
chemistry laboratories undergraduates are investigating the use of NMR
spectroscopy for the structural characterization of inorganic compounds with
complex spin systems.
