This project permits three researchers to present the results of an extensive
research project on the 'Methodology for Mitigation of Seismic Hazards in
Existing Unreinforced Masonry Buildings' at a conference to be held in
Charleston, South Carolina on January 28-30, 1985. This participation consists
of assistance in planning the conference, preparation of presentation materials,
conference attendance by the researchers, travel, subsistence, and assistance in
post-conference documentation. Similar presentations were made in other highly,
seismically prone regions of the country during the development of the final
recommendations and the presentations were very well received. Many of the
recommendations are being applied by practicing engineers. The presentation at
Charleston is sponsored by the Citadel as part of its program to bring recent
technical research results to the attention of the engineers in the Southeastern
part of the United States.
