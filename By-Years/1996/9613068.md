Barron 9613068 The traditional methods for alumina synthesis and fabrication are
traditional ceramic methods and sol-gel, both of which have serious
environmental impacts. The objective of this research project is to develop
environmentally-benign processing for the fabrication of alumina ceramics. The
research is focused on the following tasks: (1) design of an alternative
synthesis pathway to alumina ceramics which does not utilize toxic reagents or
solvents; (2) applying the new materials as alternatives to present technology
to prevent or reduce environmental harm; and (3) applying the new materials and
processes to the development of a cost effective method for the highly efficient
pollution prevention and resource recovery. The scope of the project includes
fundamental research into aqueous processing of alumina-precursors, their
processing into a formable slip, and the fabrication and characteristics of
solid ceramic bodies from this slip. The research is targeted to two potential
applications: (1) high-density tape-cast alumina substrates; and (2) porous
ultra- and nano-filtration membrane. These improvements have potential
applications in pollution prevention and control.
