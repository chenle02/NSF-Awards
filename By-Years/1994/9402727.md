9402727 Yang The objective of this research is to study the self-strengthening
phenomenon in multilayered brittle materials. These self strengthening
mechanisms could have a profound effect on the design and fabrication of brittle
materials. To verify the proposed mechanism, the failure of a submicron-thick
film sandwiched between two glass slides will be studied. The completion of the
proposed study should provide a theoretical model and experimental data base for
understanding the nature of constrained failure of brittle films and
multilayers. ***
