Understanding the interaction of cumulus convection with larger-scale
circulations has been and remains a problem of great importance in atmospheric
science. Currently there are two schools of thought regarding this interaction.
The first (known as CISK) holds that the tropical atmosphere is conditionally
unstable and that the large scale circulation determines where and when the
associated available potential energy is released. The second purports that
convection is in a state of quasi-equilibrium with the large-scale circulation
and is responsible for redistributing heat and moisture, but does not constitute
an energy source for those circulations. Theories to explain, among other
things, the genesis of tropical cyclones depend on understanding the nature of
the interaction between cumulus clouds and the large-scale environment. In 1991,
a field experiment known as the Tropical Experiment in Mexico (TEXMEX) was
conducted to explore tropical cyclone genesis in the eastern Pacific. The unique
data collected as part of that experiment will allow Dr. Emanuel, the PI, to
explore fundamental aspects of the genesis problem as well as to gain insights
into the broader question of cumulus and large-scale circulation interaction. In
addition, the PI will investigate the dynamics of spiral rainbands and
concentric eyewalls of tropical cyclones.
