This proposal seeks continued funding for the PI's work in his principal
research area of Approximation Algorithms. Previous NSF-funded work by the PI's
research group has successfully formulated and solved several interesting
problems for approximation including the Buy-at-Bulk Network Design, $k$-Minimum
Spanning Tree, Group Steiner Tree, and the Degree-bounded Minimum Spanning Tree
problems. Our contributions to this area include mathematical programming
relaxations of hard problems and novel ways to round such relaxations using
deterministic and randomized rounding techniques, as well as new problem
formulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this proposal is to address the
solution of computationally hard problems in the vein of approximation
algorithms by moving closer to more real-world
constraints.&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, we propose work in directions involving
incorporating integration, heterogeneity, competition, uncertainty, and hybrid
input models into classical problems. The proposal reports on preliminary
successes and ongoing investigation in each of these directions, and formulates
specific new problems and approaches. The intellectual merit of the proposal is
to push the frontiers of approximation algorithms in terms of expanding its
scope and applicability, as well as the potential for discovery of new
underlying techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is complemented with an
educational and outreach plan that continues the PI's involvement in broader
educational goals such as participation in surveys, tutorials and teaching
workshops, as well as new course and lecture note development.
The&lt;br/&gt;broader impact of the proposal include graduate student training
and placement in this research area as well as an extensive education plan aimed
at increased dissemination of the PI's research to a broader audience including
four-year college lecturers.&lt;br/&gt;
