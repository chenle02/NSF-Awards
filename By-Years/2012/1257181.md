This dissertation explores the impact of the social sciences upon the human-
built environment in the United States from 1950 to 1980; specifically, how
spaces of mass leisure, such as tourist destinations and world's fairs, were
designed. Designers of these spaces, operating in a newly professionalizing
sphere, utilized new methods such as operations research, systems analysis,
computer modeling, and the rhetorical mobilization of statistical data in their
work. These methods were themselves developed in response to the military
problems of World War II and the Cold War. Archival research and where possible
interviews with practitioners involved will be carried out with focus on the
1962 Seattle World's Fair; the un-built Miami, FL "INTERAMA" Fair; the 1964-65
New York World's Fair; the 1976 American Bicentennial; and state-wide tourism
planning efforts in Massachusetts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Findings will be
presented not just in STS and history of science and technology venues, but at
trade association conferences and journals, including those of the Travel and
Tourism Research Association, the International Association of Amusement Parks,
and the National Recreation and Park Association.
