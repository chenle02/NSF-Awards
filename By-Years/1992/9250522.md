Students apply a broad range of molecular, cytological and classical genetic
techniques to problems at the gene, chromosome, organism, and population levels.
The organizing theme is analysis of the Adh locus in Drosophila. Experiments
include a molecular analysis of Adh variants, recombination and cytological
mapping of the Adh locus, analysis of polytene chromosomes exhibiting Adh-region
rearrangements, histological analysis of the tissue, and an exploration of the
genetic basis of the response to selection for alcohol tolerance in a large
population. The equipment for this laboratory includes electrophoresis systems,
centrifuges, and specialized microscopes. The unique feature of this project is
the use of a variety of techniques to study one system at a number of levels;
from population statistics based on behavior to analysis of DNA sequences. This
multilevel approach conveys to the students the true nature of research within
the discipline.
