9604722 Emerson The fourth FASEB Summer Research Conference on "Chromatin and
Transcription," will be held on July 5-10, 1997, at the Conference Center in
Snowmass Village, Colorado. A primary objective of this meeting is to bring
together researchers who study transcription factors, chromatin structure, and
higher-order nuclear organization. The program and confirmed session
chairpersons are as follows: Session Topic Chairperson 1. Nucleosomal Regulation
of Transcription Carl Wu 2. Chromatin Structure and Transcription Factors Gary
Felsenfeld 3. Transcriptional Regulation by Chromatin Sharon Roth and non-
Histone Proteins 4. Developmental/Epigenetic Regulation Mitzi Kuroda 5. Nuclear
Organization Jasper Rine 6. DNA Replication and Silencing Barbara Wakimoto 7.
Heritable Chromatin States Sally Elgin 8. Heterochromatin and Position-Effect
Variegation Bruce Stillman 9. Chromatin Remodeling Factors Jim Kadonaga The
prevalent theme of this meeting is the role of eukaryotic chromosome structure
in the function of basic cellular processes. While the analysis of chromatin and
transcription is the central topic of this meeting, the function of
chromatin/nuclear structure extends beyond this domain. For instance, chromatin
assembly is a key step in the cell cycle, and for this reason, a session on DNA
Replication and Silencing has been included. There is also an important relation
between nuclear structure/localization and gene expression, and these topics are
represented by sessions on Developmental/Epigenetic Regulation, which includes
locus control regions and boundary elements, as well as Heterochromatin and
Position-Effect Variegation, and Nuclear Organization. Moreover, questions of
genomic stability and instability will be addressed in a session on Heritable
Chromatin States. The timing of the 1997 conference is ideal for the
presentation and discussion of data in these rapidly evolving areas. ***
