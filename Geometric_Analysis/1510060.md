The Fall 2015 meeting of the Texas Geometry and Topology Conference will be at
Rice University on November 6-8, 2015. To date the Texas Geometry and Topology
Conference has been held spring and fall since its founding in 1989, a total of
52 times. The conference has become an extremely successful semiannual event in
the Southwest. The next series of conferences will have seven primary host
universities: Rice University, Texas A&M University, The University of Texas at
Austin, University of Houston, Texas Tech University, and (jointly) Texas
Christian University and The University of Texas at Arlington. By design, the
Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has two high-impact foci. First, the
conference makes it possible for the community of geometers and topologists from
Texas and surrounding states (a huge geographic region) to meet and share
mathematics on a regular basis. In so doing, the conference is committed to
bring researchers of national and international stature to discuss their
research as well as offering a venue for regional scholars and young people.
This stimulates individual research and generates productive cooperative efforts
between schools. Second, the conference is committed to the strengthening and
enrichment of the mathematics personnel base. In order that there be no barrier
to participation, the conference is widely advertised, participation is open,
and there are no registration fees. Graduate students, junior faculty, women,
minorities, and persons with disabilities are especially encouraged to
participate and to apply for support. Furthermore the conference is partnering
with two historically black universities (Fayetteville State University and
Prairie View A&M University) on a project to foster research opportunities for
select young faculty at these institutions.

The theme of the upcoming conference at Rice University will concentrate on
"Metric and Conformal Geometry". Accelerated by the work of Gromov, metric
techniques have gained an important place in Riemannian geometry, especially in
the study of conformal structures. This development has deeply affected
understanding, particularly of Teichmuller spaces, conformal dynamics,
hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and symmetric spaces of non-positive curvature. In
recent years, some of these metric techniques have also been important in the
study of certain random conformal processes. The conference features leading
researchers in these various fields, each of which has roots in metric and
conformal geometry.
