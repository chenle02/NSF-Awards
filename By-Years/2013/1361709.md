In this award, co-funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms A
(CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry and the Energy for Sustainability
Program of the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport
Systems of the Engineering Directorate, Professor Eric Stuve of the University
of Washington and his graduate student researchers are working to develop a
better understanding of the chemical reactions that take place at the electrode
surfaces in lithium-oxygen batteries, a technologically-promising, new kind of
battery. They are investigating the elementary chemical processes that are
taking place in model systems using surface science techniques. In doing these
experiments, Prof. Stuve and his group are striving to provide researchers with
chemical insights that will allow for improved battery performance. Graduate
students working on this project will receive training in chemistry and
engineering, and Prof. Stuve will continue his efforts at educating the wider
public about energy-related research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prof. Stuve and his
research group are conducting a series of experiments on model electrode
materials, mimicking the electrode materials in lithium-oxygen batteries. Among
the areas being studied are: (1) the study of the growth and morphology of LiOx
on the electrode surface; (2) the investigation of the chemical stability of the
solvent, including reactions that consume Li and the passivation of the
electrode surface; and (3) the exploration of the reaction mechanism and
reversibility of oxygen uptake/production. The systems will be studied using a
number of sensitive surface science techniques, including Field Emission
Microscopy (FEM), Field Ionization Microscopy (FIM), Pulsed Filed Desorption
Mass Spectrometry (PFDMS) and Ramped Field Desorption (RFD). Students working on
this project will receive training that will prepare them for research positions
in academia, national Laboratories or industry.
