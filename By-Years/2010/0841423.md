Computer science is rapidly becoming crucial to most disciplines that emphasize
science, technology and mathematics, but this fact has not been communicated
clearly to the public, including the next generation of scientists, engineers
and innovators. In particular, students and teachers in primary and secondary
schools are largely unaware of the ubiquity of computing and the revolution that
it has had on different areas of science. This has led to a current shortage of
computer professionals as well as science and engineering students who
understand the need to apply computing to their fields of study.&lt;br/&gt;This
proposal incorporates computing into existing high school and middle school
courses (such as biology, physics, civics), in-school technical electives,
summer programs, and research projects for high school students. Fellows will
work in close collaboration with public school teachers and local school
districts to develop standard-based curriculum appropriate for each individual
school. This proposal is unique in that it will not introduce any new courses or
programs, nor will it focus on existing computer science courses/programs.
Instead, it will bring new content to established audiences.&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed work will enhance the communication and teaching skills of the fellows
and change the school culture for computing education. It will also change the
university culture for graduate education by emphasizing the ability to
explicate and motivate the work of the Fellows. Lastly, it is expected this
program will lead to improved communication of computing applications to the
public and an eventual increase in the number of computer
professionals.&lt;br/&gt;
