SES#: 0958190&lt;br/&gt;PI: Louise M. Roth&lt;br/&gt;University of
Arizona&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will examine the effects of medical
malpractice suits, tort laws, health insurance, and reproductive regulations on
birth practices in the United States. The research will test organizational
theories about how legal regulations and insurance practices affect practices in
health care. The study will focus specifically on cesarean sections because many
healthcare industry insiders view cesareans as a form of defensive medicine,
although the effects of malpractice and health insurance on cesareans are
unclear. The research design combines quantitative analysis of how cesarean
deliveries vary across states and over time in relation to malpractice, health
insurance, and reproductive laws, with qualitative analysis of 30-40 interviews
with important stakeholders in maternity care (providers, liability insurers,
health insurers, and malpractice attorneys). The study's broader impacts include
uncovering any non-medical influences on maternity care which may reveal ways to
reduce maternal and infant mortality and morbidity, and offering insights into
the cost of maternity care. The results will have policy implications for
improving maternity care and lowering healthcare costs.
