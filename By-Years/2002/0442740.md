Mathematical Sciences (21). The goal of this proposal is to write a cross-
disciplinary textbook to make a variety of applications of topology accessible
to undergraduate STEM students. The textbook is based on a prototype applied
topology course taught twice by the Principal Investigator at the Rochester
Institute of Technology (R.I.T.) and attended by students majoring in
mathematics, physics, engineering, computer science, and information technology.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applications of topology have enabled two great
revolutions in the 20th century; Nash equilibria in economics, and dynamical
systems and chaos in differential equations. In other fields, such as condensed
matter physics, string theory, robotics, DNA, chemistry, astronomy, and
relativity, topology is playing an important role in expanding the frontiers of
knowledge. The materials being developed close the gap between teaching of
topology and its uses in real-world phenomena, and facilitate collaboration
between topologists and scientists. The applications make topology courses more
exciting for students, putting them at the edge of research knowledge in several
applications, and they improve the pedagogy of topology by adding relevance.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The materials are being tested and reviewed at a variety
of small colleges, engineering schools, and larger universities. The
applications are disseminated nationally through articles in exposition-focused
journals, through faculty development workshops at national conferences, and as
sections in a topology textbook to be published by John Wiley and Sons Inc. The
journal articles are written so that they can be used as supplementary material
in topology courses using a traditional topology textbook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
