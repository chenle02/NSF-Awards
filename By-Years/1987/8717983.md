The objective of three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project in
surface physics between B. Gumhalter, of Zagreb University's Institute of
Physics and D. C. Langreth of Rutgers University is to study the fundamental
questions on the interaction of atomic particles and radiation with surfaces.
Studies in this area are significant because of the role of surface interactions
in matter and energy conversion. The project is particularly suitable for joint
U.S.-Yugoslav research because of the overlapping interests and expertise of the
participating scientists. This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint
Board on Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported through a joint
fund consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and Yugoslav
governments. The U.S. contribution is provided annually by the Department of
State. No NSF funds are involved. The grants are composed principally of
Yugoslav dinars and made to the principal Yugoslav institute. Grants include
travel for U.S. scientists to Yugoslavia and a modest dollar allowance for
Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in the U.S.
