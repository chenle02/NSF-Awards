Feng Hypercube and multistage interconnection network (MIN)-based architectures
are two promising classes of parallel computers that have received considerable
attention in recent years. The objective of this research is to develop
analytical evaluation techniques for predicting performance, dependability, and
performance-related dependability behavior of these two classes of
multiprocessors. The performance model is based on a three-level approach -
network level, task (job) level, and system level. The network level analysis
gives the average communication delay which can be used in finding job
completion time at the task level. Using the job completion time, system level
parameters such as throughput and response time could be computed from an
appropriate queing model. Dependability analysis would consider the degradation
of the computing elements and communication network for finding task-based
reliability or availability. The dependability model is aimed at finding a
proper subcube for the execution of a task. The analysis covers both unique-path
and multi-path MINs. Performance-related dependability models are being
developed by associating suitable performance measures with the structure states
of a multiprocessor. This project will make available a complete set of tools
for analyzing these two classes of multiprocessors that have a great promise for
different applications.
