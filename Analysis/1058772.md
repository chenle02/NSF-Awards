ABSTRACT

Quasi-conformal and related mappings form the largest class of maps that can be
studied by analytic methods. Accordingly, their theory and their applications
lie at the intersection of geometry and analysis and have connections to many
other areas of mathematics and physics. While fundamental questions at the
foundation of the theory of quasi-conformal maps remain open, recent advances in
analysis on metric spaces have enlarged the range of applicability of these
maps. Their theory may now lead to solutions of previously inaccessible problems
in other fields such as geometric group theory. The purpose of this project is
to explore current trends in the area. Specific topics of research include
quasi-symmetric uniformization, dynamics on fractal spheres, the quasi-conformal
Jacobian problem, quasi-regular maps and elliptic manifolds.

The roots of this subject can be traced back to Gauss's work on cartography and
surface geometry in the first half of the 19th century. He coined the phrase
``conformal map" and derived equations that govern the theory of planar quasi-
conformal mappings. The full importance of this theory was only realized about a
century later. By now quasi- conformal mappings have developed into one of the
major tools in contemporary Geometric Function Theory.
