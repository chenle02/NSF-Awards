The International Committee for Future Accelerators (ICFA) held an
international conference entitled "Seminar on Future Perspectives in High Energy
Physics" at Brookhaven National Laboratory on October 5-10, 1987. The purpose of
the conference was to facilitate a worldwide exchange of information and ideas
on future plans for high energy physics facilities. This award will support the
preparation, publication and distribution of the conference proceedings. The
research area is that of particle accelerators which are used primarily in the
field of elementary particle physics, in medical work and in other areas as
well. Elementary particle physics studies the basic building blocks of matter
and requires the highest possible energy accelerators to carry out the
measurements.
