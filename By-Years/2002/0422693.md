"YouthLink" immerses teens in varied and informal learning experiences using the
newest, most exciting tools for web design and production, animation, audio and
video production and post-production. This proposed expansion of the existing
"YouthLink" program that will engage a diverse cadre of 120 chronically
underrepresented teens in the San Francisco area, aged 14-18, in year-round IT
informal learning experiences. In addition, 150 parents, 60 educators, 50
companies, and 300 teenage peers will also be involved in the YouthLink program
through Family Technology Nights, community outreach activities, internships,
and the distribution of youth-made technology projects via video and the web.
"YouthLink" will reach national stakeholders through an interactive learning
curriculum for teens distributed on DVD-ROM and an online magazine for teens.
Project components include: Basic or Advanced "YouthLink" (depending upon IT
skill level at entry), SCANS skills and career preparation, self-paced
interactive learning module and "YouthLink" internships. Students will be
involved at least 220 hours per year.
