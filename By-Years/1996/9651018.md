This project will improve instruction in undergraduate chemical oceanography
laboratory through use of analytical instruments including a salinometer,
environmental data logger, fluorometer, flowmeter, optical endpoint unit for
Winkler oxygen titration, autoanalyzer for analysis of nutrients, and
spectrophotometer. The equipment will be used by the senior level field research
courses in oceanography and as part of the research required for honor students
in marine science. The laboratory equipment is used in the summer by
undergraduate students doing field research with faculty and by a high school
teacher training program.
