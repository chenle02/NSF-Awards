The research entails applications of analytic and geometric techniques to the
general area of symplectic geometry in the semi-classical limit. Techniques of
spectral asymptotic analysis relative to the geometry of singular spaces will be
investigated in this context. Further investigations into the analysis of Monge-
Ampere type equations relative to the structures of Cauchy- Riemann manifolds,
are also proposed.
