Data-driven methods have a significant role in advancing bioengineering
research. The bioengineering cyber training program equips future researchers
and practitioners with data-driven methods that can be applied to a wide-range
of engineering problems. The program supports data-driven bioengineering
education, fosters inclusivity, and benefits society through the training of
undergraduate bioengineering students and the generation and release of training
material and hands-on project data. The program ensures accessibility to a wide
audience and promotes diversity in STEM fields. It advances data-driven
bioengineering education by emphasizing team building, FAIR (Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles, and real-world
projects.

The program provides a comprehensive curriculum covering data science concepts,
workflows, visualizations, FAIR data principles, and analytics, with a specific
focus on applying these principles in the field of bioengineering. The program
includes a boot camp, a 10-week hands-on training program, and a research
symposium with a poster competition. The program emphasizes team building,
outreach to underrepresented groups, and collaboration with industry partners to
empower students and enable them to work on real-world data-driven
bioengineering projects. The 10-week training program includes three components:
an instructional component that covers the principles of data-driven
bioengineering, a hands-on guided project component that complements the
instruction part, and a team-based project component. The team-based project
component matches student groups with partners from industry and academia to
allow students the opportunity to work on real data-driven bioengineering
problems.
