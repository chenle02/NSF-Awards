The locus ceruleus is one of the most fascinating structures in the brain. Named
the "blue spot" by anatomists because it is visible to the naked eye in post
mortem material, it finally acquired a function thirty years ago when it was
discovered that all the adrenergic fibers in the brain and spinal cord originate
from in or near this spot. That makes the locus ceruleus the central component
of the sympathetic nervous system, regulating states of conscious and the body's
response to unusual challenges. This NSF award will enable 10 young scientists
to attend an interdisciplinary international conference on this structure. At
this conference scientists from many diverse disciplines whose work is relevant
to the locus ceruleus will share their findings. The results will be published
in a book that will serve as a resource for scientists unable to attend the
meeting.***//
