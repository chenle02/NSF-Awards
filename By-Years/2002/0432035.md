The research on water resources decision processes tends to be almost
exclusively organizational design or process oriented and assumes that the
information needs to decision makers can be served well by the existing science.
Research to refine analytical tools has paid little heed to the decision-making
environment in which those tools might be used.

This project is a workshop (and commissioned papers) to assess analytical
methods used to make decisions in the realm of water resources. The purpose of
the multi-disciplinary activity is to explore basic paradigmatic questions to
identify research needs related to decision methods and scientific inquiry in
the water resources area.
