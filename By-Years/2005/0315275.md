Jean'ne M. Shreeve, Department of Chemistry, University of Idaho, is supported
by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program to
synthesize and study new ionic liquids containing perfluoroalkyl or
polyfluoroalkyl ether groups. Imidazolium, triazolium and tetrazolium cations
will be treated with various strong alkylating agents to provide mono-, di- and
poly-perfluoroalkylated ionic liquids. Polydentate centers or templates,
including phosphazenes, triazines, macrocyclic amines, bipyridines and polymeric
phosphazenes and azines will also be perfluoro- or polyfluoroalkylated to give
new types of fluorinated ionic liquids. The fluorinated ionic liquids are
expected to have higher densities, higher thermal stabilities, higher oxidation
resistance and controlled viscosities than current non-fluorinated ionic
liquids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ionic liquids, or molten salts, are attractive
alternatives to volatile organic compounds as solvents. The desirable properties
of ionic liquids include a wide useful temperature range, low vapor pressure,
thermal and chemical stability with tunable viscosity and density. They are also
being explored as low/high temperature fluids, lubricants in extreme
environments and as electrolytes in fuel cells. This project will develop a new
class of fluorinated ionic liquids. Undergraduate, graduate student and
postdoctoral researchers will learn valuable technical skills and gain
experience in experimental design and application of new materials to real world
needs. This project also supports outreach efforts to two-year and four-year
college faculty.
