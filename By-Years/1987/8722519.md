The ability of the field ion microscope to routinely visualize individual atoms
on a crystal will be utilized to quantitatively characterize different aspects
of metal clusters on metal surfaces: a. Atomic Interactions and Cohesion of
Clusters From measurements of the equilibrium pair distribution function, the
interactions between two atoms will be determined on smooth planes of bcc as
well as fcc metals. Experiments on different adatoms and on different surfaces
will explore chemical and structural effects on the interactions. b. Cluster
Formation and Mobility The growth and structural transformations of metal
clusters will be examined on densely packed planes of fcc and bcc metals.
Diffusion of clusters will be studied to establish uder what conditions motion
of the cluster as a whole dominates its mobility. c. Chemical Reactivity of
Clusters If time permits, the ability of metal clusters, characterized by field
ion microscopy, to catalyze dissociative chemisorption will be tested on smooth
planes on which chemisorption is otherwise slow.//
