An interdisciplinary group of scholars at Cornell University and Carleton
University, Canada, has initiated a joint project on "Global Environmental
Change and Social Justice." The Social Science Research Council is co-sponsoring
the project, and it is administered by the Peace Studies Program at Cornell. In
a series of three workshops and a final conference scheduled for September 1993,
participants will examine in depth the ethical issues posed by global
environmental change and national and international policy choices. Issues to be
covered include the moral standing of the environment, the role of science in
framing environmental issues, the competing claims of different levels of
community, and the ethical problems posed by environmental refugees and
resettlement policies. These issues have been relatively neglected in the
general discourse on environmental change. This project will begin to elucidate
a framework for making practical ethical judgments about environmental issues
and to link that framework to discussions of the politics of global
environmental change. Selected papers from the workshops and conference will be
published in an edited book.
