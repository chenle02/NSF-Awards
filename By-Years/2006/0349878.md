This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports research by Professor Christopher A. Reed at the University of
California at Riverside to develop a new class of weakly coordinating anions
based on the icosahedral carborane. New carborane acids will be synthesized to
open new areas of acid chemistry by: (a) protonating molecules previously
considered too weakly basic to protonate such as Xe and Cr(CO)6; (b) protonating
delicate molecules that decompose in acid such as P4, S8, and fullerenes; and,
(c) allowing for the isolation of intermediates of acid catalyzed processes for
detailed study on the preparative timescale. A super-methylating reagent
consisting of a methyl cation and carborane anion will also be developed. The
chemistry of a superoxidants involving triarylaminium carboranes will be
explored. The synthetic inorganic chemistry emphasizes the isolation of pure
materials and their characterization by single crystal X-ray structure
determination. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops new super- acid,
methyl and oxidant chemistry and will involve students from traditionally under-
represented groups, particularly Hispanics, who are among the populations served
by UC Riverside to attract them to frontline chemical research and careers in
chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
