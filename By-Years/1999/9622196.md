9622196 Adams Mathematical modeling will be undertaken of the dynamic
instabilities in the sliding of two surfaces with emphasis on the effects on
these instabilities of surface roughness and surface layers. It will be
attempted to link the instabilities and the subsequently generated surface slip
waves to macroscopically observed friction and wear, as reported in the
literature. In particular, the possible relation between slip wave
destabilization and stick-slip and contact fatigue will be explored. ***
