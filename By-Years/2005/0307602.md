The researchers propose to study the impact that new display technologies in
classroom have on hearing-impaired students. They will conduct a series of
experiments using videotape and eye-tracking technology that will investigate
the extent to which visual technologies may place additional cognitive burdens
on such students in STEM classrooms. They draw on the literatures on divided
attention, interference, and the effects that utilizing competing modalities has
for integrating information. The investigators will be able to track individual
students' attention and document, for example, precisely what information they
receive when gazing at the interpreter, when they look away to view the visual
display, and what information they receive from it. The researchers can compare
these informational transcripts against those received by other students
(hearing and hearing-impaired) as well as against the complete record of
communication. They will be able to compare the efficacy with which different
students deal with these competing input-streams. They hope to identify
strategies by which learners and educators can enhance learning through the
coordination of visual technologies and interpreting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
