The Louis Stokes South Carolina Alliance for Minority Participation (LS-SCAMP)
is designed to increase the quality and quantity of underrepresented minority
students (URMs) who complete baccalaureate degrees in science, technology,
engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines and who successfully transition
to pursue advanced graduate STEM degrees. LS-SCAMP is made up of South Carolina
State University in collaboration with six Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCUs), five technical colleges and three research institutions in
South Carolina. The projects goals are to intensify recruitment initiatives to
increase STEM enrollment by 30%, to increase and sustain the STEM baccalaureate
degree production by 12% above the Phase I attainment (500 baseline to 800
degree attainment over 5 years), increase the number of LS-SCAMP students who
enter graduate school within two years of graduating by 50 percent, develop two
summer bridge programs (one academic and one research) for the successful
transition of thirty technical college students into STEM baccalaureate degree
programs in year one and 150 students over five years and increase the number of
students that participate in academic and summer research activities.
