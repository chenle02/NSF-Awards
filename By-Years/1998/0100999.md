Given geographical constraints, the ability of humans to be aware of or
establish contact with others falls off rapidly with physical distance. Indeed,
problems as diverse as the spread of disease within human populations, the
diffusion of cultural norms, migration, racial/ethnic segregation, and
susceptibility to panic or revolution have all been linked to the distance-based
structure of human relations. Yet, this spatial element of social network
formation has received little attention. This project therefore develops
mathematical network models based on physical distance, evaluates competing
network models using published data on interpersonal relations across space, and
presents measures of network structures. Using simulation methods, it identifies
the linkages between large-scale social processes, such as those described
above, and the social networks that span social groups and organizations. The
mathematical methods thus provide insights into the general structures of human
interaction that shape the more specific experiences and behaviors of
individuals in a variety of types of groups.
