The objective of this project is to characterize mechanisms of photoregulation
of chlorophyll a/b binding protein (Cab) genes of pea. These genes are located
in the nucleus, but encode proteins which form complexes with chlorophyll and
act as light harvesting antennae in chloroplasts. The experimental plan involves
measurement of the phytochrome responses of individual Cab genes, as mRNA
accumulation, in response to red light induction signals which differ by a
factor of 10,000. A similar approach will be used to study the potential
regulatory role of chlorophyll, chlorophyll precursors and postulated, but
undefined 'factors' in the expression of Cab genes. Methods will also be
developed for comparison of light effects on the transcriptional activity of
different genes in nuclei from etiolated and greening seedlings. This proposal
approaches the phenomenon of photocontrol from a different perspective than
studies of gene promoter structure, and should be complementary to such studies
in definition of the underlying molecular mechanisms.
