The aim of this collaborative project between investigators at three
universities is to develop records of past climate in northwest (NW) Greenland
and synthesize them with records of the position of ice margin to evaluate the
response of the Greenland Ice Sheet to past warm periods, such as the Holocene
Climatic Optimum (approximately 5 to 9 thousand years ago). Recent studies
suggest that rapid ice loss is expanding northwards into NW Greenland, as
demonstrated by the dramatic August, 2010 calving event from Petermann Glacier.
However, little paleoclimate and ice sheet research has been conducted in NW
Greenland, despite the proximity to a logistics center at Thule Air Base. The
proposed research integrates multiple climate proxies and glaciological modeling
experiments in the Thule region with the following research
objectives:&lt;br/&gt;1) Reconstruct Holocene climate in NW Greenland via
inferences from reconstructed local ice cap extents (North Ice Cap, Tuto Ice
Cap), ice core stable isotope and precipitation records, and data from nearby
lake sediments. &lt;br/&gt; 2) Examine the sensitivity of the NW Greenland Ice
Sheet (GIS) to Holocene climate changes by developing the history of the areal
extent of the GIS and synthesizing proxy data with glaciological modeling
experiments to examine past GIS changes and predict future GIS
retreat.&lt;br/&gt;Results from the proposed research will enable a more
accurate prediction of the NW Greenland cryospheric response to a future warmer
world and provide information directly relevant to predictions of future
sea-足level rise. The investigators propose to enhance public outreach and K-足12
science education through development of educational modules using simplified,
web-足based, climate and glaciological models. They would involve graduate and
undergraduate students in field and lab research, participate in the Dartmouth
Women足 In Science Project, and partner with the Dartmouth polar IGERT program.
