This project is purchasing a computer-controlled ion chromatograph and
autosampler for the analysis of common inorganic anions, organic acids, and
cations; an aluminum oxide ring mill vessel for rapidly crushing small, fine-
grained rock and soil samples; and a powder diffraction database, CD-ROM
computer, and x-ray diffraction (XRD) control and database search software to
enhance the current XRD instrument. The new equipment is enhancing sample
preparation and chemical analyses of natural water, rocks, soils, and other
environmental samples. This enhancement is driven by ongoing efforts, in the
Department of Geology, Civil Engineering, Chemistry, and Biology, to replace
abstract laboratory exercises with those that cover similar concepts but involve
hands-on sample collection, preparation, and analysis. The object, in addition
to teaching the skills and concepts, is to give introductory and advanced
students a better understanding of the nature of science and the purpose of
analytical research and measurement. *
