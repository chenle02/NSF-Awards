During the award period, the Arizona State University Meson
Physics&lt;br/&gt;Group will continue to study the internal quark structure of
the&lt;br/&gt;neutrons and protons (nucleons) that make up atomic nuclei. The
group&lt;br/&gt;will use high energy photons to excite these neutrons and
protons, and&lt;br/&gt;then study the ways these excited nucleons decay. In
particular, we will&lt;br/&gt;look for the emission of eta and eta-mesons during
the decay process. By&lt;br/&gt;observing various decay modes, we will provide
important data that will&lt;br/&gt;test and refine theories of how the neutrons
and protons are built up&lt;br/&gt;from quarks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The high
energy photons will be provided by the Bremsstrahlung Photon&lt;br/&gt;Tagging
Facility in Experimental Hall B at the Thomas Jefferson
National&lt;br/&gt;Accelerator Facility in Newport News, Virginia. The decay
products will&lt;br/&gt;be studied using the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer
(CLAS) in Hall&lt;br/&gt;B. Members of the ASU Meson Physics Group form part of
the CLAS&lt;br/&gt;Collaboration and, during the award period, we will provide
service work&lt;br/&gt;associated with maintaining this experimental equipment,
as well as&lt;br/&gt;support data-taking for CLAS experiments as
required.&lt;br/&gt;
