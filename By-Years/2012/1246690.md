The goal of this project is to provide a unique opportunity for students to
present their research results, learn cutting edge research, and interact with
internationally recognized researchers from both academia and industry at the
ACM SIGMOD/PODS 2013 Conference. As one of the most prestigious conferences in
data management research, ACM SIGMOD/PODS has contributed significantly to the
advance of all aspects of data management technologies and applications since
1975. Today ACM SIGMOD/PODS is a dynamic and comprehensive program for
publication, education, and interaction; and it is a leading international forum
for database researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore
cutting-edge ideas and results and to exchange techniques, tools, and
experiences. This project provides partial support for students matriculated at
U.S. institutions, especially female and minority students, to attend and
present their research work at ACM SIGMOD/PODS 2013 in New York City. Besides
meeting with researchers from academia and industry during regular program
sessions, in SIGMOD/PODS 2013 students are able to participate in the following
interactive activities as partially supported by this project: a new researcher
symposium, an undergraduate research poster competition, face-to-face meetings
with leading researchers, and a student mentoring workshop. These opportunities
will have a long lasting impact on the future career of the participants. The
broader impact is to train the future generation of leaders and workforce in the
critical field of data management. The project details are available via the
