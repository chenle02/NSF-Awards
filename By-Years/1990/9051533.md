The undergraduate program in aquatic biology is being strengthened by expanding
the scope of treatment to include microbial ecology. The innovation, which
involves the acquisition of a liquid scintillation counter, autoanalyzer,
fluorescence microscope, and lab balance, makes use of experimental ecology as
an educational vehicle to teach students about 1. important ecological processes
mediated by microorganisms; 2. the microbial groups involved with specific
processes; and 3. techniques for the assessment of microbial numbers, biomass,
and nutrient cycling. A variety of experimental exercises employing the
equipment are being integrated into the upper division courses of aquatic
biology, ecology, and limnology. The exercises are designed to provide students
with a broad coverage of microbial ecology. The university is contributing 122%
of the award.
