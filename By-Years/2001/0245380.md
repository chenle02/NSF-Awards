The PI plans to study convex bodies using the methods of
probability.&lt;br/&gt;For many problems of convex geometry, such as finding
sections of a convex&lt;br/&gt;body with certain nice properties or
approximating a convex body by another&lt;br/&gt;body having a better structure,
explicit constructions are unknown.&lt;br/&gt;In these cases random
constructions turn out to be very effective.&lt;br/&gt;It is often possible to
define a random section or approximation and&lt;br/&gt;to show that it has the
desired property with high probability.&lt;br/&gt;This approach combined with
advanced probabilistic tools, such as measure&lt;br/&gt;concentration, have led
to major discoveries in convex geometry and
functional&lt;br/&gt;analysis.&lt;br/&gt;The PI also plans to study the
combinatorial dimension&lt;br/&gt;of a set of functions. This is a new
notion&lt;br/&gt;which arises from questions in probability and computer
science.&lt;br/&gt;The PI plans to investigate the connection between the
entropy and the&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial dimension and apply the results to study
properties of&lt;br/&gt;convex bodies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
research will provide new connections between&lt;br/&gt;functional analysis,
convex geometry and probability.&lt;br/&gt;The study of combinatorial dimension
is likely to have concrete&lt;br/&gt;practical applications in machine
learning.&lt;br/&gt; The non-symmetric convex sets, which are one of the main
objects&lt;br/&gt;of the proposed research, arise naturally in a broad
class&lt;br/&gt;of optimization problems. So, better understanding of the
structure&lt;br/&gt;of such bodies will result in constructing more effective
optimization&lt;br/&gt;algorithms.
