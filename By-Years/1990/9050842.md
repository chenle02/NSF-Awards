The combination of epifluorescence microscopy, phase contrast and differential
interference contrast (DIC) optics, and high resolution video imaging have
revolutionized our understanding of cell biology; particularly in the areas of
cell motility and the cytoskeleton, intracellular trafficking, cellular
organelle behavior, intracellular signaling and protein dynamics. These
techniques are being integrated into the curriculum through the purchase of a
combination phase, DIC, and epifluorescence microscope, 5 phase contrast
conversion kits for existing brightfield microscopes, a high resolution video
system, and an inverted phase contrast microscope. Fluorescence microscopy will
be used in conjunction with immunofluorescent staining for the subcellular
localization of proteins, and fluorescent probe staining for membranes and
organelles. Inverted and upright phase contrast and DIC microscopy will be used
for observations on living cells. The video system will allow for group
observation and discussion of cellular events. The equipment will be used in
student research projects as well as the Cell Biology course. The college will
contribute an amount equal to the award.
