As a result of the International Workshop on Strong-Motion Earthquake Instrument
Arrays in Hawaii, May 2-5, 1978, and subsequent discussions, a cooperative
U.S.-India project was established to organize and install an earthquake strong
motion accelerograph array in India. In August 1983, installation of 49
accelerograph stations was completed in the epicentral region of the Great
Kangra Earthquake of 1905 in India. Since 1983, this array has been maintained
by the staff of the University of Roorkee, India. Later, another strong motion
array of 50 stations was installed in the area of Shillong, Assam, where a great
earthquake of magnitude 8.7 occurred in 1897. Arrays such as these provide
invaluable data whenever they are able to record a large earthquake, data which
is used to better understand the processes causing earthquakes, the ground
shaking resulting from large earthquakes, the effect on the stability of soil
structures at a particular construction site, the response of a building or
structure at that site, and the damage and loss of life that could result from
damage and collapse of soil structures and buildings. Since large earthquakes
are rare events, it is essential that strong motion arrays be placed in any
place in the world where strong earthquakes are expected within the next decade
or two. This action will assist in obtaining such data from these two crucial
arrays in India, one of which was installed as cooperative agreement between the
U.S. and India. The purpose of this action is to continue and to extend the
accomplishments of this effort and to archive, digitize, and publish already
available strong motion data in India, so that a complete detailed data
gathering program can be set up for future research and its applications: all
scientists and engineers involved in earthquake hazard reduction can benefit
from this effort by having a sound experimental basis for their analyses and
engineering applications.
