This research proposal, The Northern Science Education REU Site, by Dr. Sofia
Perdikaris and Dr. Thomas McGovern, builds on a previous proposal funded through
ASSP for 2000-2003. For the past three years the Northern Research and Education
Program has involved inner city undergraduates, including underrepresented
minority students and women (64% of total participants), and graduate students
in a multi-discipline, northern field school and laboratory located in Iceland.
The program includes intensive participation in archaeological field work and
environmental science in Iceland in the summer followed by workshops,
coursework, and internships at the American Museum of Natural History. The
program is an exemplary REU site giving undergraduates a full compliment of
science education and experience within which to develop their own projects and
interests in science.
