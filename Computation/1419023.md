While this is the age of big data, there is still a question of whether more
data translates to more knowledge. Particularly when generating data is
expensive or time consuming, as it is often the case with clinical trials and
biomolecular experiments, the problem of identifying information-rich data
becomes crucial for creating models that can reliably predict the outcome of
future experiments. Few results have been published on the amount of necessary
data, and currently there are no methods for generating specific data sets which
would unambiguously identify a predictive model. This research project addresses
fundamental mathematical and computational questions in data selection. The
theoretical results will advance the fields of design of experiments and network
inference through the determination of criteria for selecting data sets to
uniquely identify models. The algorithms under development will serve as a guide
for experimentalists in determining the data that are needed to identify the
structure of a network of interest. Such knowledge has the potential to
drastically reduce wasted resources that arise from too much data with too
little information. Graduate students will participate at the appropriate level
in each component of the project. Such an experience will provide possible
topics for M.S. or Ph.D. dissertations and will very likely inspire career-long
involvement of the participants in the STEM disciplines.

As a first step towards developing a complete theory, the PIs will focus on
models described by finite-valued nonlinear polynomial functions. Finite-state
multivariate polynomial functions have successfully been used to model complex
networks from discretized data; however, few results have been published on the
amount of data necessary for such models, with the majority applying to Boolean
models only. The PIs will address the issue of the minimality and specificity of
data to uniquely identify discrete polynomial models by developing the
appropriate theory, implementing the theoretical results as algorithms, and
applying the algorithms to important physical systems. The proposed work will
also increase the utility of polynomial dynamical systems as models of complex
networks by establishing the minimal amount of the data for unique model
identification.
