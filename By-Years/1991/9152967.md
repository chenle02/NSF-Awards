The goal of this project is to enhance the laboratory experiences available to
advanced biology and psychology undergraduates participating in an
interdisciplinary neuroscience program. Laboratory exercises ranging from human
electrophysiology to cellular neurochemistry will be possible with the
acquisition of preamplifier isolation units coupled to previously acquired
MacLab data acquisition systems, a micropipette puller, micromanipulators and
stimulus isolation units, chambers to hold brain slices, an electrochemical
detector coupled to a previously acquired HPLC system, and a liquid
scintillation counter. The project also has implications for involving
undergraduates in independent research.
