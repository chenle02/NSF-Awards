Carnivores can have positive as well as negative effects on populations.
Positive effects may be direct or they may involve other species in the food
web. How nutrients that affect production might interact with a carnivore's
impact on lower trophic levels has not been investigated. Experiments are
proposed in which four food webs will be exposed to up to 5 levels of nutrients
and 5 levels of predation by newts in an array of 75 outdoor mesocosms. The four
food webs will differ in the occurrence of Rana larvae and Daphnia. Community
development and production of zooplankton, phytoplankton, littoral crustaceans
and periphyton will be monitored. It is predicted that the responses of these
organisms to predation and nutrient levels will depend strongly on the structure
of food webs. This will be the first experiment to test such predictions. These
investigations should provide critical insights for understanding natural
variation in the abundance of organisms and in predicting the responses of
communities to eutrophication and changes in predation intensity.
