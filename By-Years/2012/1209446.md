This action funds Benjamin James Wright of New Mexico State University to
conduct a research project, entitled "Developing Formal Models of Dishonest
Negotiation," during the summer of 2012 at Wakayama University in Wakayama,
Japan. The host scientist is Dr. Chiaka Sakama.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is in revealing how negotiations
can be expressed in a different way and then viewed from a new perspective. A
likely outcome is a new perspective on what is possible in mutl-agent
negotiations and with multi-agent action languages, which can be used to
represent new formal models.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
