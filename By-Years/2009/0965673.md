The recent global economic crisis illustrates how financial leverage can
generate couplings between different sectors of the financial system and how
problems in the financial sector can affect the real economy. This research team
will develop new types of agent-based quantitative models to enable a deeper
understanding of the causes of extreme or systemic risks in the financial
system, focusing in particular on the roles of leverage, network structure, and
institutional rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the project include
determining optimal leverage levels; understanding the effects of network
structure on systemic risks; predicting default rates; understanding the role of
leverage in contagion between assets; understanding the role of time granularity
in risk monitoring; finding improved risk control schemes for banks; and
exploring intervention policies for preventing financial failure. The Federal
Reserve Bank of New York and the Bank of England will provide access to data for
model calibration purposes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The models developed should
provide guidance about policies that can foster stability in the financial
system. Insight into the effects of various leverage levels, repayment schedules
with less systemic impact, or a better understanding of the properties of
networks of banks and lenders might be helpful in mitigating future financial
crises.
