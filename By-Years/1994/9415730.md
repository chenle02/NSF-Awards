This research is concerned with the role that regulations and insurance can play
in reducing losses from earthquakes, hurricanes and windstorms while at the same
time alleviating the financial burden to victims from these types of disasters.
The project is timely as there is a concern by both the insurance industry and
federal agencies such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) about
these issues. The research will specifically focus on the effects of a
catastrophic loss on insurers and reinsurers. The behavior of firms in the
industry will be modeled to derive a set of testable hypotheses regarding their
future actions. A set of empirical studies will then be undertaken through case
studies, surveys, and interviews with key decision makers in insurance and
reinsurance firms. Hurricane Andrew, the single most costly natural disaster in
the insurance industry s history, offers an opportunity to examine the
hypotheses by looking at its impact on surplus, future premiums, available
coverage, and ability to obtain reinsurance coverage. The prescriptive analysis
will contrast the implications of dealing with earthquake, hurricanes, and
windstorms where private insurers and reinsurers are responsible for covering
all insured losses with a policy that incorporates some type of federal
reinsurance for covering catastrophic losses.
