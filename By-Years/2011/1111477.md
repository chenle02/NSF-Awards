Symposia on Molecular and Cellular Biology

This award will provide partial support for travel of US participants to
participate in Keystone Symposia meeting on Biofuels, to be held in Singapore,
March 1-6, 2011.

Intellectual Merit

The overarching goal of the Keystone Symposia meeting on Biofuels is to make a
meaningful contribution to reducing dependence on fossil feedstocks by creating
secure and sustainable sources for fuel, power, and products. The 2011 Keystone
biofuels symposium will serve as a venue to highlight advances in biofuels
research from three major biomass feedstocks: lignocellulosic plant material,
algae, and alternative feedstocks such as Jatropha. This symposium will bring
together plant and algae biologists engaged in biofuels research from academia,
industry and government. The long term goal is to facilitate collaborations
intended to accelerate the accumulation of basic knowledge of photosynthetic
organisms, both algae and plants, and to accelerate the deployment of new and
expanded bioenergy feedstocks.

Broader Impacts

This symposium will also provide educational benefits. Specifically, symposium
activities are designed to acquaint trainees and investigators new to the field
of bioenergy crop research with the state-of-the-art developments in this area
through oral presentations and poster sessions, and to provide these new
investigators with opportunities for feedback, networking and mentorship from
senior colleagues.
