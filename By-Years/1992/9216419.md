The objective of this research is to uncover the neural strategies utilized by
the mammalian brain for dynamic optimization and control of motor output in a
specific motor task. The investigator will study the neural computation
algorithms underlying the adaptive control of respiratory motor output in
mammals and develop neural-network based Hebbian learning algorithms for this
dynamic optimal control problem. The work will focus on the development of
neural models and algorithms to fit the extensive physiological and
neurophysiological data that characterize the respiratory system. The specific
aspects to be addressed are: 1) the neural architectures and adaptive algorithms
to use for both infinite-time and finite-time dynamic control; 2) the effects of
system uncertainties and their adaptive compensation; 3) causes for system
instabilities and methods for stabilization; and 4) neural strategies for
increasing robustness and fault tolerance, noise rejection, and precision of the
network response. This work is important since it may lead to a novel paradigm
for the design of intelligent control systems for a wide range of engineering
and robotic applications.
