This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2004.
The goal of the fellowship is to increase the participation of minority
scientists at the postdoctoral level and to prepare them for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training and research of the
highest quality to recent doctoral recipients. It is expected that Fellows
supported through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the
future workforce.

The research and training plan is entitled "Design and self-assembly of novel
materials and devices using biomolecules." This research seeks to harness the
biological and chemical properties of molecular recognition, symmetry, and self-
assembly to create novel methods for efficiently and safely engineering
inorganic nanoparticles into materials and devices. The design approach involves
both computational and experimental methods for protein engineering. The
resulting biomolecular assemblies will have general applications in
nanotechnology and biotechnology, specifically applications to electronics,
photonics, sensors, bioremediation, and drug delivery.

The primary scientific goal is to understand the principles of molecular
recognition and self-assembly in order to design novel biomaterials for use in
biotechnology and nanotechnology. This goal requires an interdisciplinary
approach spanning biology, computer science, and engineering. The Fellow will
develop additional skills in molecular modeling and simulations as well as
learning techniques for characterizing molecular structures using electron
microscopy and X-ray crystallography.
