The relatively recent development of the technique of modal analysis has made
possible the introduction of the subject of structural dynamics at the
undergraduate level to civil engineering students. The application of modal
analysis involves computer-simulation, animated-graphics models of complex
structural systems which can be observed and studied in their various modes of
vibrational response. It has been demonstrated that the student's insight into
the behavior of structural systems is greatly enhanced through his/her exposure
to this educational tool. The purpose of this program is to provide modal
analysis and testing equipment which will be used to develop a complete
undergraduate structural dynamics laboratory.
