A new experimental micromechanics measurement technique is explored to permit
accurate measurements of deformations and strains to a region of 0.1 microns. A
scanning electron microscope is used to burn an array of dots on a metallic
coating deposited on the specimen. Grid distortions after mechanical loading
give a topographic map of the strain field. Eventually it is desired to extend
the technique to domain sizes of about 0.01 microns. The properties of
interfaces are considered in this project with the aim of applying this refined
technique to understanding the stress state of interfaces.
