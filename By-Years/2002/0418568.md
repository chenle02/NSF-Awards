0418568&lt;br/&gt;Michl&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Pan-American Advanced Studies
Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by the NSF and the Department of
Energy (DOE), will take place at Villa la Angostura near San Carlos de
Bariloche, Patagonia, Argentina on March 16 - 26, 2005 on the topic of
"Bioinspired Nanoscience and Molecular Machines." Organized by Dr. Josef Michl
of the University of Colorado, the institute will involve approximately 42
advanced graduate students and 16 lecturers in the field from the U. S. and
Latin America. The purpose is to bring together two communities for idea
exchange and cross-fertilization, namely, researchers who investigate bio-
inspired or biological machinery such as motors, and those who study artificial
molecular rotors. These investigators work mostly in chemistry, physics, or
material science, some experimentally and some theoretically or computationally.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This institute will provide an opportunity for junior U.S.
participants to develop contacts in Latin America while they are exposed to this
promising field of research in nanoscience. Another positive outcome is a likely
increase in the Latin American post-docs and/or students who come to U.S.
universities and serve as role models for U.S. Hispanic undergraduates. Both the
U.S. and Latin American junior participants will be exposed to first-class
lecturers from throughout the Hemisphere.&lt;br/&gt;
