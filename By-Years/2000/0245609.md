Solution algorithms for difficult discrete optimization problems often rely on
problem-specific cutting-planes to improve the associated linear-programming
relaxations. It is standard practice to look for cutting planes that match
prescribed templates, where the templates are drawn exclusively from the set of
linear inequalities that induce facets of the convex hull of the solution set
for the problem. In the traveling salesman problem (TSP) research of Applegate,
Bixby, Chvatal, and Cook, an alternative to this template paradigm for cutting
planes was proposed. The new procedure is called local cuts and it played a
crucial role in the solution of a set of large-scale TSP instances, including a
13,509-city example and a 15,112-city example. The goal of this project is to
extend the local-cut procedure to other classes of discrete optimization
problems and to general mixed-integer programming models. The local-cut
procedure consists of selecting a family of linear mappings taking the original
solution space down to one of low dimension, and selecting a super-set of the
image that is accessible, that is, it is easy to optimize linear functions over
the super-set. Using delayed column-generation, cutting planes for the
accessible set are determined; these cuts are then mapped back to cutting planes
in the original set of variables. This project will continue the investigation
of local cuts for the TSP, but a major part of the work will be to develop the
methodology for other classes of problems, including mixed-integer programming
models, vehicle routing, steiner trees, and stable sets.

Broader Impact. Discrete optimization is used to solve practical problems that
involve choosing the best alternative from a field of possibilities; it has
broad applications in nearly every segment of the economy. The local-cut
techniques developed in the proposed project will permit the solution of larger,
more-complex problem instances, allowing users to be more aggressive in building
models to represent the details of their applications.
