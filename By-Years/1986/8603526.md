The Chilean earthquake of March 3, 1985, affected many masonry buildings.
Because much Chilean masonry design is based on U.S. building codes, studying
the earthquake performance of Chilean masonry buildings will help improve the
safety and serviceability of masonry construction in the U.S. In this research
project, the performance of a representative sample of Chilean masonry buildings
will be documented, compared with that predicted by analysis, and evaluated with
respect to U.S. building code assumptions. Based on the results of that
evaluation, design and construction procedures will be suggested to improve the
seismic resistance of U.S. masonry buildings.
