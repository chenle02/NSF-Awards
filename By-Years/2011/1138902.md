The goal of this EAGER award is to develop a new and potentially transformative
technology to enable the rapid development of secreted proteases with extended
substrate specificity. These proteases would constitute a new class of
therapeutics that could be used to treat certain diseases where overproduction
of a protein, or production of a poorly folded protein leads to the disease
state. As evidenced by the therapeutic use of botulinum toxin, the ability to
achieve precise specificity towards an arbitrary target would dramatically
reduce the production costs of biological theraputics by orders of magnitude,
when compared to therapeutic antibodies. Although a few proteases have proven to
be effective therapeutics, their use has been limited because of the inability
to engineer proteases with desired specificity. To address this need, a novel
proteases library screening technology will be developed to enable multi step
directed evolution of protease specificity. The technology will be tested in a
target application for Alzheimer's disease.
