Beginning in the middle-school years there is a significant drop in young girls'
confidence to succeed in math and science, even though girls perform as well or
better than boys. The perception females hold of their abilities in math and
science is the gatekeeper to their persistence in these academic domains. Yet,
it is not clear why young adolescent girls lose confidence in these abilities.
There is compelling recent evidence that when adult women are either directly or
subtly reminded of women's minority status in math, their subsequent math
performance is compromised and their expectations for future success in math are
lowered. This profound effect of a "stereotype threat" is found consistently
across studies of adult women. Very little is known, however, about stereotype
threat in children and when it becomes salient to young girls. Although there is
a well-established body of evidence identifying the experimental conditions
under which stereotype threat is heightened, it is not known how stereotype
threat is triggered in a natural occurring context such as the classroom.
Identifying the emergence of stereotype threat and the conditions in the
classroom under which it occurs is critical to understanding why young
adolescent girls lose confidence in their ability to succeed in math and
science. This pilot investigation will identify the conditions in the classroom
that increase girls' vulnerability to this threat, and examine whether
stereotype threat is responsible for the decline in adolescent girls' math and
science confidence.
