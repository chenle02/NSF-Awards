This starter grant award of the Chemistry Division to the University of Texas at
Austin supports the research of Professor Jason B. Shear. The theme of the
research is ultraviolet fluorescence detection of biological chromophores. The
work investigates the mechanisms and extent of multiphoton-excited degradation
of monoamine neurotransmitters excited using different numbers of photons of
different characteristic wavelengths. Comparisons are made of the
photodestruction quantum yields for three-photon excitation of neurotransmitters
using a modelocked titanium:sapphire laser in the near-infrared wavelength
range, and for two-photon excitation using a frequency doubled titanium:sapphire
laser. Sources of background in both two- and three-photon excited fluorescence
measurements are evaluated and used in combination with the photodestruction
measurements to optimize ultraviolet fluorescence detection of natively
fluorescent neurotransmitters analyzed with capillary electrophoresis. The
research will advance efforts toward quantitative measurement of neuronal
chemistry at the subcellular level. Improved detectability of a variety of
natively fluorescent neurotransmitters will provide new capabilities for
characterizing fundamental mechanisms of chemical signalling between cells.
