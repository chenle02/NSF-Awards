This award will support the construction of a new seismic sound source that,
for the first time, will allow precise measurements to be made of the structure
of the uppermost igneous crust in the deep ocean at scales of 10-100 meters. The
optimal way to carry out such an experiment is to place all of the equipment on
the seafloor. Although ocean-bottom seismometers have existed for a number of
years, there has been no ability to generate acoustic energy in deep-sea
environment. The towed, high-power, low frequency seismic source to be developed
will allow researchers to tackle problems on a scale, and with a precision, that
has previously been unapproachable. As many as 35 explosive charges can be
detonated in one lowering of the instrument package, allowing long profiles of
sea-flow features such as hydrothermal vent fields, axial volcanoes and basalt
flows. A prototype system has been developed and used previously. The present
award will allow construction of a final system.
