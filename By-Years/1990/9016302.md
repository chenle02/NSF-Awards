This renewal proposal will apply a novel technique of spray pyrolysis of
molecular precursors to the preparation of thin films of oxides and sulfides on
various substrates. The technique, developed by the Principal Investigator, will
be applied to chromium oxide, gallium oxide, and zirconium oxide, and to zinc
sulfide and zinc selinide doped with various magnetic ions. Physical
characterization of the films will include optical microscopy, electron and
x-ray diffraction and electronic resistivity measurements. Chemical
characterization will include a study of stability towards oxidation and/or
reduction, and a correlation of properties exhibited by the films and bulk
materials of corresponding compositions.
