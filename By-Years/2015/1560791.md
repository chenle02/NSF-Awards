In engineering, there is a dearth of women in the professoriate, especially
women of color. This project addresses a major impediment to broadening
participation in engineering and is closely aligned with current National
Science Foundation goals to broaden participation in STEM overall. With a
primary focus on women of color, this project involves creating a 1-day workshop
targeting underrepresented doctoral students, postdoctoral fellows, assistant
professors, and associate professors in engineering (e.g., African Americans,
Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key objective
of the effort is to provide the aforementioned groups with specific professional
development to help foster greater preparation and appreciation for the
engineering professoriate and create more opportunities for networking and
information sharing with other colleagues around the nation. Other objectives of
the workshop focus on leadership, mentoring, and work-life balance. The project
includes strong research and evaluation components that aim to generate
important information to improve recruitment and retention of women of color in
the engineering professoriate. It also includes the development of a
comprehensive website to provide information about the workshop and to promote
the results from workshop participation.
