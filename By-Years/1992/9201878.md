Fundamental research to understand basic electron-phonon interac- tions in C60
molecules(bucky balls) and related materials including fibers will be conducted.
With respect to C60 the emphasis is on understanding vibrational modes and
electron- phonon interactions utilizing femtosecond laser pulse-probe and high
magnetic field techniques. The research is of particular interest for providing
a sounder scientific basis for understanding the properties of the newly
discovered carbon molecules such as C60, and fiber analogs to C60 which can be
viewed as a single graphene (crystalline graphite) layer rolled up to form a
cylinder with each of its ends fitting perfectly to half of a bucky ball. %%%
This research is expected to provide deeper fundamental understanding of basic
properties of new carbon molecules and fibers which are potential functional
electronic/photonic materials. From an application point of view, understanding
these properties and their relationship to materials synthesis and processing is
beneficial to advanced technologies related to computing, information
processing, and telecommunications.
