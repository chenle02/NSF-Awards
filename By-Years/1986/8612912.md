This research program is on microwave production of a hot plasma in a magnetic-
mirror trap, and the application of this plasma as an x-ray or ion source. The
areas of application to be studied are x-ray lithography in solid-state circuit
production and multiply-charged ion production for ion beams. The plasma is
produced and heated by electron cyclotron resonance heating. The generation of a
non- Maxwellian electron velocity distribution by cyclotron heating will be
studied experimentally and by computer simulation. Electron cyclotron emission
will be used as a diagnostic. The average energy and flux of x-ray radiation
from the plasma will be evaluated for lithography applications. The confinement
properties and behavior of the plasma in a minimum-B magnetic field will be
correlated with its performance as an ion source.
