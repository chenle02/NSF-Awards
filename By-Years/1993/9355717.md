9355717 Witmer The SEAQL project will enhance the middle and high school science
teacher's performance in the classroom/laboratory where the standard sciences-
biology, chemistry, physics earth science and general science are taught.
Instruction monitoring and evaluation in the use of simple, yet powerful
statistical tools in the analysis of data and the use of technology is planned.
Objectives are to: Upgrade science teachers quantitative literacy knowledge and
skills through instructional vehicles-field testing, the teacher institute and
follow ups. Instruct teachers in educational pedagogy as well as technology and
statistical and probabilistic QL strands that will enhance science lessons.
Field test a refine science lessons by means of several iterations. Disseminate
information using the multiplier effect-institute participants in servicing
colleagues, through professional organizations and commercial publications.
During the 3 year project 255 science teachers throughout the United States will
participate in on going field testing and refining of lessons. Four week teacher
institutes will follow ups are planned. SEAQL will build on ASA's Quantitative
Literacy Project in mathematics. Funds of $1,919,723 are requested with cost
share of $84,770 (4.4%)
