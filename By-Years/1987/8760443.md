Currently several major free.electron laser (FEL) projects are planned or are
underway to generate short wavelength radiation in the VUV and XUV regions.
These efforts involve large storage ring or linear accelerators and magnetic
wiggler magnets several meters long. An alternative approach to these large and
expensive undertakings is to construct an FEL with low energy electron beam (< 1
MeV) and an optical pump field provided by a laser beam. The latter approach has
several technological problems associated with it which up to now have been
insurmountable. These technological problems can be overcome with an innovative
electron gun design which has already exhibited brightness values 10.4 higher
than those available for large accelerators. This gun could be used in
conjunction with commercially available excimer lasers to operate an oscillator
in the XUV and VUV wavelength regions. The first phase of this program will
analyze the FEL gain and operating parameters and identify the key issues for
the design of the oscillator cavity. The construction of a prototype instrument
and a proof.of.principle experiment at 1400 A will be the primary goal of Phase
2 with extension to XUV and soft X.ray to follow.
