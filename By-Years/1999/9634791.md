Boca Raton, Florida. The main lecturer will be Professor Luis Caffarelli,
Courant Institute, New York, who will give a series of 10 lectures on recent
developments in the theory of the Monge Ampere equation and its applications to
geometry and optimization problems. The proposer will also arrange invited
lectures by other distinguished specialists stressing applications. It is
expected that about 30 participants will receive support.
