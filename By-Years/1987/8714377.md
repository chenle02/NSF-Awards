The fabrication, formability, and performance of coated and clad materials are
to be investigated, both experimentally and theoretically, using an
interdisciplinary team, with input from industry. Although such materials are in
wide use in industry, there is little fundamental knowledge that can be used to
predict performance in advance nor to explain performance that is measured.
Special attention is planned for ceramic and polymer coated metals.
