This Presidential Faculty Fellow award will support studies to extract
information from fluorescence and reflectance spectra of multi-component,
scattering samples. Models of fluorescence will be developed and new methods to
record fluorescence spectra and spectroscopic images will be investigated. This
research has the potential to provide sensitive information about the chemical
composition of tissue in a non-invasive way. This award also will support the
teaching activities of the investigator. The activities include teaching an
undergraduate physics course and developing demonstrations to illustrate the
principles being taught. At the graduate level, the investigator will expand two
courses in optics and continue to promote faculty involvement in a graduate
research seminar.
