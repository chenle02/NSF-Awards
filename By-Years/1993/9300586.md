This award provides funds to the Department of Natural Resources at Cornell
University to initiate a nine-week Research Experiences for Undergraduates
project in the environmental sciences. Eleven students, half of whom will be
from predominantly minority institutions and half of whom will be from Cornell
will be selected to participate. To aid students in understanding the connection
between their research and real-life concerns of communities, student research
projects will be identified, the results of which have important applications to
solving environmental problems. Example research topics include Design of
Optimal Composting Systems, Microbially-Mediated Destruction of CFCs in
Anaerobic Environments, Long-term Change in a Deciduous Forest, and Genetic
Variability in Small Isolated Populations. A one-week orientation and weekly
group sessions will include discussions of the research process, how to ask
insightful questions of research mentors, and the applications of scientific
knowledge to solving problems in minority communities. Academic-year faculty
advisors will visit the students on their research assignments and will assist
the students in writing up their research for publication.
