Dimensional thinking is a mainstay of political discussion. Journalists
identify political candidates as on the left or on the right of the ideological
spectrum. Voters describe politicians as close to them or far away from them.
Politicians take sides, defend positions, move towards some groups, and move
away from others. As political events unfold, politicians, voters, and issues
are often described by using these kinds of geometric and spatial terms. Not
surprisingly, psychologists have found that most people, not just sophisticated
political analysts, often conceptualize and describe the social and political
world in spatial and geometric terms. This provides a key to understanding
voting behavior, public opinion, and many other forms of political behavior, but
to be truly useful, we must have a better understanding of what people mean when
they say that one politician is close to another or that they feel closer to one
issue position than another. This project aims to develop a better understanding
of how people think about politics by developing statistical methods for
uncovering the dimensional structure of people's choices, opinions, and
judgments. For example, the project will develop statistical methods and
computer programs for relating peoples' rankings of political candidates to
their underlying opinions and beliefs about the characteristics of these
candidates. Preliminary research has shown that peoples' choices can be
explained partly by a remarkably small number of underlying dimensions. The
methods to be developed in this research will enable a clearer interpretation of
why this small number of dimensions explains so much. These methods should make
it possible to get a clearer understanding of the major concerns which motivate
voters and other people who make political choices. In addition, since similar
methods have been widely applied to understanding economic choices, it seems
likely that the methods developed in this project will be useful in areas
outside political science.
