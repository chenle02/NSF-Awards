This dissertation investigates the consequences of state decentralization on
the expansion of civil society in two Venezuelan municipalities. Past theory has
made contradictory predictions about these effects: on the one hand, the
expansion of municipal government functions should stimulate the growth of local
civic institutions as political decisions are being made closer to people's own
experience. On the other hand, decentralization may just promote rent seeking by
local elites that would inhibit associational life. The research will compare
two municipalities with different histories of civic development. Directories
and official data will be searched to estimate the growth of civic associations.
Interviews with local leaders will ascertain how the activities and structure of
these organizations have changed since the adoption of state decentralization
