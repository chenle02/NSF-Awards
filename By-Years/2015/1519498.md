The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes 1) the targeted
problem (robustness of state estimator) is extremely critical in modern power
grids and the proposed approach can help prevent system-wide failures or
blackouts if applied, 2) the new state estimation technology is novel in
statistics and could be applied in other areas besides power engineering, 3) the
research team is formed by technical as well as marketing experts which ensures
the success of the development and sales of the products, 4) the competitive
market benefits of our products cannot be met by alternate technologies and can
attract further funding from non-SBIR sources and result in direct sales to
power industry, 5) the unique formulation/solution of our new state estimation
will lead to further innovations and bring a new era of energy management system
(EMS) to power grids, 6) the new procedure of the proposed approach based on
unique philosophy can promote teaching, training and learning in the area of
state estimation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a novel robust state estimator for power
system operations, from a revolutionary state estimation technology which was
invented in 2009 and patented at Smart Electric Grid, LLC in 2014. The research
objective is to solve the robustness problems suffered by the existing state
estimators, i.e., no convergence warranty and weakness in detecting multiple bad
data, especially topology errors. The invention consists of a new formulation of
state estimator and an efficient solving process. The novelty of the research is
in bringing together cutting-edge ideas from diverse disciplines including graph
theory, linear algebra, matrix theory and high dimensional statistics, to solve
the robustness problem of current state estimators. The anticipated technical
results include comprehensive testing on different power systems including real
systems, and a commercialization plan of the patented technology.
