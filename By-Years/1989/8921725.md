It is widely agreed that stock market values of many large American
corporations, particularly diversified ones, are substantially below their
intrinsic values. This statement typically means that when such companies are
restructured, usually but not always after being taken over, substantial
increases in stock-market values are realized. Although there is broad agreement
that restructuring is accompanied by an increase in shareholder wealth, there is
not much evidence about why this is necessarily so. The purpose of this research
is to analyze the determinants of the valuation of public corporations and the
impact of hostile takeovers on their value. An important goal of this analysis
is to distinguish between theories that suggest some companies are mismanaged
from theories that suggest that corporations are under valued relative to their
fundamental viability, and do not require any changes in management or operating
strategies. Unlike many previous studies that focus exclusively on takeover
targets, this analysis will combine a study of the targets of hostile takeovers
with a more general analysis of the valuation of public companies in the stock
market. This research is important because it will shed light on whether or not
hostile takeovers tend to be in the public interest.
