This award will support collaborative research in computational mathematics
between Dr. Richard Varga, and Dr. Per Enflo, Kent State University and
Professor Bernard Beauzamy, Institute for Mathematical Calculus, University of
Paris 7, France. An important new concept has been introduced recently by Drs.
Beauzamy and Enflo concerning the concentration of a polynomial. There are many
areas of mathematics which involve estimating polynomials, with these estimates
involving the degree of the polynomial. This occurs, for example, in harmonic
analysis, number theory and approximation theory. The aim of this project is to
obtain similar estimates of polynomials, which now depend only on the
concentration of these polynomials and not their degree. An application of this
work would be to the extension of Jensen's formula in function theory. The
project will benefit from the complementary expertise of the investigators in
Banach spaces and numerical analysis, as well as the particular theoretical
strength of the French group.
