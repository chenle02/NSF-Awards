Phase I project will develop a mid-infrared (2-5.5 micron) diode-based laser
source for atmospheric spectroscopy and remote sensing, which operates without
cryogenic cooling. The instrument is based on the frequency conversion of near
infrared radiation of III-V diode lasers further in the infrared. A novel
approach to increase the output power is described. In Phase I the instrument
will be tested with increased frequency conversion. During Phase II an optimized
source would be built, and a working prototype prepared for production. The
miniature, narrowband laser source operating at room temperature in the mid-
infrared region will be used a primarily as the radiation source for optical
trace gas sensors. Sensors based on this source will be commercially applicable
in medical diagnostics, industrial process control, and environmental
monitoring. ***
