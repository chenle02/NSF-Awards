9509836 RITZWOLLER This research is to use the normal modes of the earth at low
frequency (less than 12 mHZ) and long-wavelength (l less than 21) to study the
earth's mantle and core. Data quantity has been increased by an order of
magnitude over previous studies, and recent large deep events present normal
modes for analysis that have never before been clearly observed. Concerning the
mantle, elastic constraints will be particularly useful for estimating
structures in the transition zone and the outer lower mantle where current
mantle models differ most appreciably and in providing better information about
the variations of Vs/Vp. With respect to the core, focus will be on modes
sensitive to the anisotropic inner core and the deep outer core. ***
