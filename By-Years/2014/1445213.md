The unprecedented oil and natural gas development through hydraulic fracturing
greatly improves U.S. economy and made it the world?s biggest energy producer in
2013. However, the numerous barrels of wastewater produced every year during
fracking are considered the single greatest environmental impediment, costing
the industry $5 billion per year to dispose. Due to increasing public health and
environmental concerns about deep well injection and long distance
transportation, on site treatment and reuse of such wastewater becomes an
emerging need. This proposal aims to develop and apply a new microbial
desalination technology with energy production for produced water
management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal, the team will develop a
trailer prototype demonstration system that treats wastewater at 100 bbl/day
(4,200 gallon/day), which is industry's expectation on functioning and
investable prototypes. This system will have much lower cost per barrel water
treated, and will significantly reduce the manufacturing and monitoring cost
through the integration of low-cost 3D printing technique and microcontroller
based automation system. The system will also be adaptable to different water
conditions through the real-time monitoring and control of operational
parameters, such as retention time, loading rates, and supplemental pre/post
treatment units.
