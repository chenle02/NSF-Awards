Research will be done in the control and data structures of programming
languages, with emphasis on concurrent control and higher-type data. The work on
concurrency will study algebras of concurreny models, with partially ordered
multisets providing concrete models and closed categories providing abstract
models, while the work on type theory will focus on lambda calculus,
polymorphism, and abstract data types. At the boundary of these areas a joint
study will be made of proposed unifications of type theory with concurrency
theory.
