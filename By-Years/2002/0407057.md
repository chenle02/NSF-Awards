Infrared Spectroscopic Studies in Stellar Abundances and Galactic Chemical
Evolution&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AST 0407057
Balachandran&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Suchitra Balachandran, at the University
of Maryland, will continue a program to determine chemical abundances of stellar
atmospheres in stars in the Galactic Center. The work involves the measurement
of new different elements, and extends the previous work to fainter stars, for
the purpose of studying older stellar populations. This study will also be
extended into the Bulge of the Galaxy. Additionally, the PI will derive chemical
abundances and isotope ratios in luminous supergiant stars in the Milky Way and
in the Magellanic Clouds, for the purpose of constraining the physics of
internal mixing within stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educating students, both at
the undergraduate and graduate level, is a major broader impact of the proposed
research. The PI will continue to make a special effort to mentor young women.
Public outreach activities associated with the University of Maryland
Observatory Open Houses will be undertaken, and the PI will continue to serve
the astronomical community through service on committees related to her research
expertise. &lt;br/&gt;
