This award provides support for the Seventh U.S. National Conference on
Earthquake Engineering, 7NCEE by partially underwriting the administrative and
development costs, and to make possible increased participation in the
conference of graduate students in earthquake engineering
disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Conference is the seventh in a series of
national conferences on earthquake engineering. Previous conferences have been
held in Ann Arbor, Michigan; Stanford, California; Charleston, South Carolina;
Palm Springs, California; Chicago, Illinois, and Seattle, Washington. They are
held every four years, midway in time between the dates of the quadrennial World
Conferences on Earthquake Engineering. Each of the national conferences has been
sponsored by EERI, the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute, a non-profit
professional society devoted to earthquake engineering and earthquake loss
reduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 7NCEE will be held in Boston, Massachusetts
and will provide an opportunity for researchers and professional practitioners,
in all the disciplines in the earthquake field, to come together and exchange
research results, design practices, and organizational and policy perspectives
that influence the effectiveness of earthquake preparedness, mitigation, and
recovery. The Proceedings provide a valuable repository of information, critical
to the future advancement of earthquake engineering.&lt;br/&gt;
