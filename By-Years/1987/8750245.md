A year-long Developing Scientist Program for seniors in psychology is enriching
the scientific training of talented psychology majors. To implement the program,
the college is establishing a psychological laboratory equipped with five Apple
IIGS computers and an interfaceable biofeedback system. Research projects are
being carried out in the traditional experimental areas. The students are
receiving advanced seminar and one-on-one instruction in hypothesis formulation,
design, and execution of experiments, and in data analysis and interpretation.
They are each performing one project per semester for two semesters and will
prepare experimental reports in journal form describing the projects. The
program is enhancing the skill of the students in applying the scientific method
to contemporary research problems in psychology, leading ultimately to them
making significant contributions to the fields of psychology.
