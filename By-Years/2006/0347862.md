Prof. Dmitrii Makarov of the University of Texas is using theoretical and
computational techniques to characterize the relationship between the molecular
structure and mechanical properties of proteins. Multiscale methodologies are
being implemented in which the free energy of a single protein domain is
computed as a function of its extension. A Langevin approach is used to model
domain unfolding and force-dependent unfolding rates are computed from
transition state theory. The mechanical properties of spider capture silk is
being studied and the simulation results compared with recent AFM
experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has a broader impact in both
biology and engineering. In addition to the interdisciplinary nature of the
research itself, the PI is working to incorporate results of recent research,
especially those from computational science, into undergraduate courses he is
teaching.
