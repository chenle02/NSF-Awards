Theoretical research will be conducted on two general areas of modern condensed
matter physics: the electronic structure of correlated electron systems and the
nature of the superconductor- insulator transition in the cuprate
superconductors. In the first area, studies will be performed on the influence
of oxygen-hole copper-hole pairing on the d-wave superconductivity in the
cuprates. As temperature is lowered below the transition temperature there is
the possibility of a second phase transition signaling the onset of copper-
oxygen pairing. Also to be studied is the nature of the electron pairing in
potassium fulleride and the possibility of a special, Berry phase, electron-
phonon interaction in the fullerenes. In the second area, studies will be
performed on the possibility that the superconductor-insulator transition which
occurs with zinc doping in the cuprates represents a simultaneous localization
of Cooper pairs and partial de-pairing induced by disorder and/or magnetic
fluctuations. In a related but separate study, the effects of incipient boson
localization on the quantum tunneling of vortices when the system is close to a
field-induced superconductor-insulator transition will be investigated. %%%
Theoretical research will be conducted on fundamental problems in condensed
matter physics which can have a major impact on understanding the behavior of
the high temperature superconductors. The research will primarily focus on the
copper-oxide based superconductors. Work will be done on the nature of the
transition as the material goes from a superconducting state to an insulating
state.
