This research will focus on topics in statistical theory and will be aimed at
developing procedures in the areas of linear errors-in-variables regression
models and goodness of fit procedures. The project is in the general area of
statistics and probability. Errors-in-variables regression models describe
relationships among variables when both the explanatory and response variables
are subject to random error. Emphasis in this research will be placed on the
role of reliability of measurements in determining the performance of errors-in-
variables regression techniques. Goodness of fit procedures assess the adequacy
of distributional assumptions or of structural models. This research will
involve a study of general multinomial-based procedures for testing fit in
categorical data.
