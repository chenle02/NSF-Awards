This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
Indiana University, studying the role of voluntary organizations in the
migration decision-making of immigrants from Belize to the US. The student's
hypothesis is that migrant organizations facilitate transnational economic and
social ties more than assimilation or the reinforcement of ethnic enclaves. The
assumption is that Belizeans who are active participants in migrant
organizations have at their disposal information and economic as well as
cultural resources which influence their circulation patterns. The methodology
involves traditional ethnography as well as formal surveys in Chicago and in
Belize, the collection of life histories, in-depth interviews and participant
observation at Belizean organizational and cultural activities. The research
will take place in Belize City and Chicago. This research is important because
it will advance our understanding of the motives and constraints of migrants in
light of the actual social resources available to them. Given that migration and
transnationalism are important features of contemporary social life, the
knowledge this project will create will be a valuable addition for policy makers
and planners as well as scholars.
