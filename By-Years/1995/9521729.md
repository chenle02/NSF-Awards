9521729 Das Semiconductor quantum dots have novel optical and electronic
properties that can lead to high speed photonic and electronic devices with
superior performances. For room temperature applications, it is necessary to
restrict the dimensions of such quantum dots to below 200 A so that the energy
separation due to quantization is greater than the thermal broadening.
Conventional nanofabrication techniques of using electron beam lithography and
reactive ion techniques, where the semiconductor material is synthesized in the
size and the shape of the nanostructure, are more appropriate for such devices.
Current nanogrowth techniques suffer from the problem of large device size
distribution and lack of device periodicity. This project proposes to develop a
novel low cost nanogrowth technology for the fabrication of periodic arrays of
semiconductor quantum dots on silicon with good device size uniformity. The
technique utilizes material growth on a preformed template formed by
electrochemical etching of aluminum on silicon. The template contains a periodic
array of pores in which the semiconductor material is synthesized. The technique
is inexpensive, reliable, suitable for the fabrication of a variety of
semiconductors, VSL compatible and has the potential for integration of quantum
dot services with silicon integrated circuits. The proposed technology is also
suitable for large scale commercial production of semiconductor quantum dot
arrays. ***
