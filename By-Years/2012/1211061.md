This project will support a postdoctoral scholar and graduate student?s efforts
to develop code dealing with tidal dissipation in binary systems, with a focus
on exoplanetary systems containing hot Jupiters. The investigators plan to do ab
initio calculations of the tidal dissipation rate as a function of orbital
period, mass and spin. Results of this work will be applicable to astrophysics,
planetary science and fluid dynamics. In addition to publishing in refereed
journals, the PI will make numerical results publicly available, and train a
grad student and postdoctoral researcher, and carry out ?Math/Science Days? at a
local middle school.
