Non-technical abstract Meeting of Young Investigators is organized to provide
researchers with necessary information about NSF process, opportunities and
mechanisms related to proposal submission. A group of first-time applicants or
those who did not apply to NSF in the past will be provided helpful information
designed to improve their proposal writing skills and understand the NSF process
better. A mock proposal review activity will enable better understanding of the
merit review process. Participation of PIs from small colleges and
underrepresented groups was encouraged.

Technical Abstract Participants of the DMR Young Investigators Workshop will
receive information about the NSF process presented by current or past Program
Directors. Specifically, the participants will be trained in Merit Review
Principles, writing a successful proposal, building a strong Broader Impact
component, Conflict of Interest and Ethics rules and they will learn about
funding opportunities within NSF. Participants will write and review one-page
proposals, to be evaluated by panels, including a full panel review process,
discussion and writing panel summaries. The two-day intensive training obtained
during the Workshop is expected to be most beneficial to young PIs and increase
their chances of successful interactions with NSF.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
