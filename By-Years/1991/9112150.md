The research supported by this award will investigate an approach to a
conformal mapping theorem for non-Riemannian metrics. The principal investigator
will try to extend the method of circle packing which was used to give a proof
of the standard Riemann mapping theorem. He will also undertake a study of
infinite circle packings and try to describe the relationship between the shape
of an infinite circle packing with prescribed combinatorics and the rigidity of
such a structure. This research is an extension of the classical theorem which
says that a simply connected two dimensional domain, one without holes, is
equivalent in a very precise way to a disk, a plane or a sphere. A method of
proving this theorem involving a packing of the domain by circles was discovered
several years ago. This research involves questions raised by this new proof.
The theorem itself is used in a very crucial way in computing flow over airfoils
and the recently discovered proof opens up new possibilities for more efficient
computations of flows.
