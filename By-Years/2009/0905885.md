This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2009
under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). The
fellowship supports a research and training plan entitled "Algorithms for
changing species distributions: tracking the world's tree swallows" for Daniel
Sheldon. The host institution for this research is Oregon State University, and
the sponsoring scientist is Thomas Dietterich.

Understanding the geographical distributions of species and how they change is
critical to conservation, ecological science, and global climate change
research. This research develops computational methods to quantify patterns of
change in the distribution of the Tree Swallow (Tachycineta bicolor), a
migratory songbird that forms dense communal roosts during its eight-month non-
breeding season. The early-morning departure of birds from the roost creates a
distinctive "roost ring" pattern that is visible in NEXRAD weather radar images.
The project employs techniques from computer vision, machine learning and
probabilistic modeling to automatically detect and extract roost rings from
radar, assembles daily estimates of the distribution of Tree Swallows throughout
the United States, and then infers the patterns of migration and other events
that cause distribution changes over time, both short-term and long-term. One of
the great assets of NEXRAD radar is the ability to look fifteen years into the
past with archived data. This project addresses significant questions about the
roosting biology and population trends of swallows, advances techniques in radar
ornithology, and lays an algorithmic foundation for identifying patterns of
change in species distributions.

Training objectives include strengthening skills in computer vision, radar
ornithology, and species distribution modeling. This research engages a broad
audience of biologists, computer scientists, conservationists, and the general
public by providing a complete and accurate model of songbird distribution on a
large scale, with provisions to continuously monitor changes for the past
fifteen years and into the future.
