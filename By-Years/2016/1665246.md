The Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division supports this project
by Professor Rich G. Carter. Professor Carter and his co-investigator, Professor
Cheong, are both a faculty members in the Department of Chemistry at Oregon
State University. His group is exploring the chemistry of an exciting new series
of polyketide natural products called the mandelalides and madeirolides. The
overarching goal of this proposal is to develop innovative methods for the
construction of these natural products, which advance the field in both reaction
and strategy development. These compounds have shown promising cytotoxic and
antifungal activities. The project brings together expertise in both
experimental (Professor Carter) and computational (Professor Cheung) organic
chemistry. Professor Carter's group is well positioned to provide the highest
level of education and training for students underrepresented in science.
Professional development efforts for students participating in this project are
integrated into the program. In addition, outreach activities to engage the
broader community on the importance of chemistry are planned.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The total synthesis of complex natural products has proven
to be an important test bed for the development of new synthetic strategy as
well as for the validation of novel chemical methodologies. The proposed
syntheses of mandelalides A-B and madeirolide A push the limits of modern
organic synthesis. One new methods is the development of a reliable asymmetric
dihydroxylation of cis-alkenes to rapidly access trans diols, which is integral
to these projects. In addition, the proposed syntheses showcase silver-catalyzed
cyclizations of propargylic benzoates. The educational plan includes
professional development training for graduate students through an NSF Graduate
Research Trainingship Innovation in Graduate Education (NRT IGE) grant at Oregon
State University and community engagement through outreach activities at one or
two additional schools within the State of Oregon.
