9317298 Fraenkel This grant from the Organic Dynamics program supports the work
of Professor Gideon Fraenkel at The Ohio State University to study structural
and dynamic aspects of solvated and unsolvated clusters and ion-pairs of
organolithium compounds by a variety of NMR techniques using 13-C, 6-Li, NOE
procedures, and line shape analysis. The specific targets for study are (a)
unsolvated (RLi)n clusters, (b) interactions between RLi species (c) dilithium
compounds (d) slow dynamics of reorientation of ions with ion-pairs, (e) mapping
of ion-pairs in liquid crystal media, (f) highly alkyl substituted organo
lithium reagents, and (g) mechanisms of rotation in allyl organometallics. %%%
In this project Professor Gideon Fraenkel will explore the unique behavior of
organic compounds derived from a reaction with the metal lithium. These
organolithium substances tend to aggregate or dissociate in solution if the
solvent character is changed. Because organolithium reagents are often used to
produce valuable pharmaceuticals and naturally occuring compounds, this project
will enhance our fundamental understanding of how lithium species react and the
results will help establish utilitarian uses of organolithium reagents. ***
