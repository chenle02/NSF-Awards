This research is in the area of transcendental algebraic geometry. It will
concern research on "ampleness" and its consequences both in and out of
algebraic geometry. In particular, it will concern work on the projective
classification of projective varieties. Algebraic geometry is the study of the
geometric objects, called algebraic varieties, obtained as solutions of
polynomial equations in many variables. Projective space is a completed version
of regular space with certain points at infinity added. Classification of
algebraic varieties in projective space is one of the old fundamental problems
in algebraic geometry.
