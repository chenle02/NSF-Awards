This award provides funds to the Harvard Forest to support a site for an REU
summer program in forest ecology. The Harvard Forest is a Long-Term Ecological
Research (LTER) site involving over a dozen senior researchers from seven
institutions working collaboratively to compare the impact of historically-
important physical disturbances with recent and projected physical and chemical
disturbances on forest ecosystems in New England. The core component of the REU
program will be an independent research project conducted by each student that
will provide experience in the scientific process. Independent projects will
introduce students to hypothesis generation, project planning and data analysis
and presentation. Additional REU educational activities will include weekly
seminars on research and research methods, counseling on careers and graduate
education in ecology, lunch-time student-led research discussions, laboratory
discussion sessions, and field trips to off-site research locations. The Harvard
Forest is well equipped for an REU program, including field, laboratory, and
instructional facilities, and excellent living accommodations. Students will be
advised by the principal investigators with additional guidance from other LTER
researchers. Participants will be recruited with strong emphasis on
participation of women, minorities, and physically challenged students,
particularly those from non- research oriented colleges and universities. A
program for maintaining contact and following up on student progress will be
instituted to improve the program and to assess the value of the Harvard Forest
program in encouraging students to pursue research careers.
