The biophysical mechanism of protein translocation into mitochondria will be
studied. Most proteins imported from the cytoplasm into mitochondria contain
amino-terminal targetting sequences that direct the uptake of the proteins into
the organelle. These sequences have characteristic physical properties and
function as independent domains of the precursor proteins. The minimal sequence
necessary for targetting the beta-subunit of the yeast F1-ATPase into
mitochondria has been identified and heavily mutagenized by other workers. These
studies have identified residues that are critical for the function of this
targetting sequence. Peptides corresponding to the the wild-type sequence, and a
series of single and double point mutants that are greatly diminished in their
ability to import proteins into mithocondria in vivo, will be synthesized
chemically. The physical behavior of the peptides will be measured using
biophysical techniques and compared to the properties previously found for other
mitochondrial targetting sequences. Sensitive and quantitative fluorescence-
based assays will then be used to measure peptide binding to and import into
isolated yeast mitochondria. Effects of the mutations on interactions of the
peptides with mitochondria will identify features of a presequence that are
important for its function. The mitochondrion is the major energy transducing
unit of eukaryotic cells, containing within it the enzymatic machinery to carry
out oxidative phosphorylation (i.e., oxidative conversion of C-C bond energy to
CO2 and ATP). The organelle (like its cousin, the chloroplast) contains its own
DNA, RNA, and protein-synthetic machinery, and some of its integral proteins are
mitochondrial gene products. However (again like the chloroplast), most of the
proteins found in the mitochondria are products of nuclear genes, which are
translated by cytoplasmic ribosomes and subsequently translocated across the
mitochondrial double membrane system. This project addresses the very important
problem of the mechanism of this protein translocation process.
