The Herpetology Collection (amphibians and reptiles) of the Philadelphia
Academy of Natural Sciences is a mid-sized collection (roughly 30,000 specimens)
that contains many types and early collections from the New World. Dr. John
Cadle, Curator in charge of the collection, proposes to improve the collection
through a general inventory, reorganization, updating of identifications, and
implementation of a computer database. The database program chosen for this
project, MUSE, is in wide use in other herpetology and fish collections. The
proposed collection upgrade and computerization project will have substantial
impact both within and beyond the herpetology research community. Important
primary type specimens will be located and made accessible for systematic
research. Early collections will give ecologists and biogeographers invaluable
insight into the effects that several centuries of human occupation have had on
the region's biodiversity. The renovated collections will be a long-term asset
in research, public education, and the professional development of young
herpetologists.
