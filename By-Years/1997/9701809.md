9701809 Templeton Explaining species distributions is one of the major
challenges in biogeography. Historical and ecological factors may explain why
some species are widespread while others have restricted distributions. This
study will investigate two fruitfly species distributed through most of the dry
areas in east South America. Drosophila serido, a superspecies complex composed
of at least 5 putative species, shows remarkable variation throughout this
range. On the other hand, D. buzzatii shows no sign of diversification. How
these patterns result from present forces such as population structure and past
forces such as population history will be addressed by the analysis of DNA
sequence variation (mtDNA and nuclear) across the range of these species. The
procedure to be used is new and should differentiate historical from ecological
factors affecting distributions. The methods developed will apply to species in
general, to help understand basic forces affecting the distributions of species.
Empirical studies such as this one are needed to test the validity of the
assumptions. This study will also provide information on the distribution of dry
areas during past climate changes in South America, which is relevant to
conservation.
