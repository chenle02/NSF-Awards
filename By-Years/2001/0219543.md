Jones &lt;br/&gt;0219543&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This exploratory syudy aims to
assess the relevance of two perspectives policy dynamics and policy learning for
understanding domestic policy changes for the Arctic. Specifically, the
political science team will assess whether the construction of a Canadian
database capable of monitoring public change relevant to the Canadian North is
feasible and whether a policy learning prspective can be applied to the study
will consist of examination of the potential quantitative data sources for
Arctic policy monitoring in Canada and some field travel to gain understanding
of policy networks in the Canadian setting.
