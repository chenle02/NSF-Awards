The three-dimensional structure of the enzyme B-hydroxydecanoyl thioester
dehydrase from E. coli will be determined by X-ray crystallography. This enzyme
is essential for biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids in E. coli by
catalyzing both dehydration and double-bond isomerization reactions. The enzyme
is known for its property of suicide inhibition by thiol esters of 3-decynoic
acid. This specific, irreversible, covalent modification of the enzyme will be
exploited to provide heavy-atom labels for the crystallographic structure
determination. The crystal structure will be solved by use of anomalous
dispersion due to heavy-atoms incorporated in the inhibitor compounds. Very
strongly diffracting crystals of the subject enzyme indicate that the structure
determination can proceed to very high resolution. Accordingly, crystallographic
studies at ultra-low temperature will be pursued in order to define structural
details to the fullest extent possible. The results of the structure
determination are expected to explain the enzyme's high degree of specificity
for substrate acyl, to verify that a single active site is responsible for
catalysis of the two enzymatic reactions, to point out possible similarities to
other proteins that bind hydrophobic molecules, and to provide additional data
on atomic mobility in protein molecules.
