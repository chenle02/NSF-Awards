This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) award is to explore validation
with the objective of establishing a formal characterization of model validity
and validation methodology. Mathematical models are essential to engineering
design. There is a concern that model validity and model validation are poorly
understood. Neither the engineering design or the decision science literature
offer a basic theory addressing model validity or validation. The absence of an
accessible theory should be of considerable concern to engineers who must rely
on sophisticated models in the decision making function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In
particular, this project seeks to establish a connection between validation and
well-known results from ergodic theory.
