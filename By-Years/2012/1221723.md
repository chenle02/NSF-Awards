One of the most impressive aspects of human cognition is our ability to produce
and comprehend an infinite range of expressions, built from a finite set of
lexical items in our long-term memory. Although composition is a defining
characteristic of human language, its neurobiology is still largely
uncharacterized. Specifically, current models lack computational detail as to
the specific functions executed by various "combinatory brain regions."
Consequently, rehabilitation strategies for brain damaged individuals suffering
sentence processing problems are similarly generic, not targeting specific
computations. Second, while composition during comprehension has been studied
for decades, we know almost nothing about composition in language production,
mostly due to methodological reasons: movement artifacts during talking
compromise almost every type of brain data. With funding from the National
Science Foundation, Dr. Liina Pylkk√§nen and her research team will carry out the
first comprehensive investigation of the neurobiology of linguistic composition
that simultaneously strives both for computational specificity, assessing
specific functional hypotheses emerging from theoretical linguistics, as well as
cross-modal generality, systematically testing the same stimuli across both
comprehension and production. To overcome the methodological hurdles of studying
production, this research uses short combinatory expressions (e.g., 'grey cat'
or 'eats meat'), which can be fully planned before articulation commences. Brain
activity will be monitored millisecond by millisecond during this artifact-free
planning stage with magnetoencephalography, which offers an unparalleled
combination of spatial and temporal resolution. This project primarily uses a
very simple word-picture matching task, which is easy enough for future
application in clinical populations and children. A specific focus of this work
is the computations of the left anterior temporal lobe (LATL), a brain region
that is atrophied in semantic dementia, a degenerative disease characterized by
loss of semantic memory. The project will investigate whether the roles of the
LATL in composition on the one hand, and in semantic memory on the other, are
neurally distinct or instances of a unified process of semantic specification.
These findings could be transformative for our understanding of both composition
and semantic memory, in the healthy brain as well as in dementia.
