Among families of flowering plants, the grass family (Poaceae) is one of the
most conspicuous elements of world vegetation, and economically the most
important. The grass family is classified taxonomically into six morphologically
distinct subfamilies, among them the Pooideae, which includes the majority of
grasses of the world's cool temperate regions. Phylogenetic or evolutionary
relationships remain obscure among the 650 or so genera of the Poaceae,
including the 150 or so of subfamily Pooideae, in part because of the reduced
and streamlined nature of grass vegetative and reproductive parts. Dr. Jerrold
Davis of Cornell University is studying the phylogenetic relationships of
selected members of the Pooideae with specific attention to two of its major
subgroupings, the tribe Poeae (including fescues, bluegrasses, and wheats) and
the tribe Aveneae (including oats). Both morphological and molecular data are
being collected, the latter from intensive analyses of nucleotide mutations in
the chloroplast DNA of representative grass samples. Comparisons between
morphological and molecular patterns of diversification are being made, and
congruent patterns are being used to clarify evolutionary trends within the
grass family and determine pathways of migration and geographical distribution.
