This award is in support of the second Greenland Ice Sheet Project (GISP II).
The award supports the design, fabrication and testing of a 90 degrees laser-
light scattering instrument (LLSI) for continuous measurements of dust
stratigraphy along the GISP ice core that is being retrieved at Summit,
Greenland. This will be correlated with ECM and oxygen isotope measurements and
with reference horizons to establish the absolute chronology of the core.
