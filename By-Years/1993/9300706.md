The goal of this project is to develop a new ocean circulation model including
free-surface effects. The model will be used to understand the dynamical nature
of the oceanic general circulation, with focus on the multiple solutions of the
thermohaline circulation. One of the study's practical applications is the
prediction and interpolation of sea level changes occurring during a global
warming scenario, including effects of heat expansion and ice melting. Some
other goals of this project are the study of the energetics of the oceanic
general circulation, including the mechanical energy source due to freshwater
flux forcing, the mechanical energy balance in the quasi-steady circulation, and
the circulation seasonal cycle.
