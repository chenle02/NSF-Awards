A joint U.S.-Soviet workshop will attempt to identify, develop, and coordinate
databases on arctic flora and fauna. There is at present no coordinated system
for retrieving such data or to record new data about as yet undiscovered species
in the arctic. The ecology of the arctic regions is extremely fragile and
susceptible to stresses caused by economic development and global climate
change. The objective of this workshop is to begin laying a baseline of data
about arctic ecology for subsequent studies of biodiversity and global climate
change. The meeting is being organized by Dr. David Murray of the University of
Alaska at Fairbanks and Academician Vladimir Sokolov of the Institute of
Evolutionary Animal Morphology and Ecology of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences.
This project fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by
enabling leading researchers in the United States and the U.S.S.R. to combine
complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and
competence in the field of basic scientific research on the basis of equality,
reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
