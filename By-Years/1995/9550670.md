9550670 Morell The proposed research would focus on how to compute error flow
information for a variety of programming models, with the dual goal of reducing
the amount of information that needs to be collected to support its uses, as
well as reducing the amount of time necessary to collect the error flow
information. The objectives are (1) to develop algorithms that will
significantly decrease the time necessary to analyze the error flow of
sequential and parallel computer programs; (2) to implement and evaluate those
algorithms on a parallel machine; and (3) to evaluate the efficacy of using
error flow information in a variety of contexts. One graduate and two
undergraduate students will participate in the proposed work. ***
