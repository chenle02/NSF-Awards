With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program, the Department of Chemistry at SUNY Albany will acquire an X-ray
diffractometer with CCD detector for small molecule diffractometry. This
equipment will enhance research in a number of areas: a) investigations of
catalyst systems for efficient syndiotactic polymerization of styrene (Welch);
b) studies on the calcium affinity of coordinated polyphosphonates (Dikarev); c)
synthesis and study of acyclic and heterocyclic organic compounds of sulfur,
selenium and silicon, including natural products from garlic, onions, and
mushrooms, and the use of sulfur compounds in organic synthesis and as ligands
(Block); d) design of novel supramolecular materials (Petrukhina); e) structural
studies on the folding and unfolding of small globular proteins (Scholesz); and
f) synthesis, structural characterization and physicochemical evaluation of
metal complexes containing silylated and germylated beta-diketonates and related
ancillary ligands (Toscano).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The X-ray diffractometer
allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure
of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and it provides accurate
information about the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the
neighboring molecules. The diverse research programs that will benefit from this
diffractometer include those in inorganic, organometallic, organic, materials,
biophysical and bioorganic
chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
