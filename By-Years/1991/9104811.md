The Department of Experimental Statistics at Louisiana State University will
purchase a large capacity workstation with fast numerical computation speed
which will be dedicated to support research in applied statistics. The research
is varied, reflecting the range of research interests within the Department.
Escobar plans to investigate new experimental designs for an area of great
interest to industry, accelerated reliability testing. LaMotte plans to study
techniques for generalizing model fitting in regression analysis such that
variable selection and outlier identification proceed simultaneously. Moser
plans fundamental research into the nature of factor analysis, investigating
robust estimation and diagnostics. The equipment will be used to support other
research as CPU time permits.
