This research addresses the inverse problem in underwater acoustics and shows
how it may be solved for the case of finite oceans with depth varying index of
refraction. There are two difficulties which must be resolved. The first has to
do with the interaction of the ocean surface and bottom. Preliminary
computations and graphics show that this problem has been taken care of using
our version of the far-field function array. For more resolution we propose
using more propagating modes. The procedure will require, however, an increased
cpu time. To take into account the effects of a variable index of refraction, we
make use of transmutation, a procedure which relates solutions of complicated
differential equations to simpler ones. We have shown how, using transmutation,
we may compute the "perturbed modes", and the propagating Green's function.
Initial computations with small wave number were promising.
