With the implementation of innovative hands-on activities, access to real world
data sets and the increased ability to simulate statistical probability
distribution and random phenomena, conceptual statistical thinking in
introductory statistics courses has gone through significant development. Much
of this development is due to the exposure of students to material that show how
a statistician may think instead of the usual step-by-step procedural approach.
"Conceptual Statistics: Engaging Students in Statistical Discovery" aims to
advance the idea of conceptual statistical thinking by bridging the gap between
statistical thinking and approaching a statistical problem as a statistician
would.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of on-line self test items and
laboratory activities offer significant intellectual merit to this project. The
self-test items are designed to engage students in applying and synthesizing
lecture and text material. The laboratory activities build on the self-test
items by presenting tasks that require innovative use of conceptual statistical
thinking and methods. There is a broad range of real contexts used to illustrate
the impact statisticians have in a wide variety of areas. Activities are linked
together so that initial activities can be revisited easily later in the
course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Although primarily at mathematically inclined
students, students enrolled in secondary mathematics teacher preparation courses
and teachers of advanced preparatory course can also benefit from this
exposure.&lt;br/&gt;
