This award from the Major Research Instrumentation program will allow Brown
University to purchase a field emission scanning electron microscope. The
instrument will have new capability currently not available at Brown University.
It will provide information about chemical composition and structural
information. Furthermore, the LEO Model 1530VP Variable Pressure Scanning
Electron Microscope will enable researchers at Brown University to examine
materials used in research on such topics as liquid crystals and reactive
mesogens, biological cells, fuel cells based on microfluidics, organic crystal
growth, carbon nano-tubes, and upper mantle rocks. Furthermore, the EDS
capabilities will allow obtaining X-ray dot maps indicating chemical
composition, and this is a new capability at the institution. Through the NSF-
sponsored Materials Research Science and Engineering Center the PI's will
provide outreach programs to three Historically Black Colleges and Universities.
These colleges will have remote access to the instrument and use it in their
teaching and research. This program will be piloted through Hampton University
and then extended to two other colleges. This scope will be made available to
industrial partners and will be used it in teaching at both the undergraduate
and graduate levels.
