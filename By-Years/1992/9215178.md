The Committee on Human Factors is constituted as part of the National Research
Council of the National Academy of Sciences. The mission is to develop new
perspectives on theoretical and methodological issues and to provide guidance on
research needed to expand the scientific basis and application of human factors
to the programs of government agencies and other interested organizations. This
funding is the NSF contribution toward this effort which is also funded by
several other agencies. Under the present funding the Committee on Human Factors
will develop several reports including one on the topic of national needs in the
area of virtual environment science and technology.
