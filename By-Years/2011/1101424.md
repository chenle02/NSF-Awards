I propose to study the monodromy of Galois representations arising from
cohomology, both to prove that it is generally as large as possible, and to use
it to attack the inverse Galois problem for l-adic Lie groups. Such inverse
problems are connected with deformation theory of Galois representations, and I
propose also to investigate analogous problems in the deformation theory of
representations of discrete 1-relator groups. Such representations are
parametrized by the identity fiber of the word map associated to a given
relation, and I propose further to study the geometry of such word maps more
broadly, with applications to group theory. In a different direction, I intend
to study the inverse Galois problem for Mordell-Weil groups and related
questions in field arithmetic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Groups are the possible
types of symmetry in pure and applied mathematics. In nature, groups very often
arise in the study of "monodromy". The idea of monodromy gives one a common
framework for considering a wide range of apparently quite different questions.
For example: what happens to the solutions of a differential equation as they
are followed around singular points back to their starting points? What are the
possible symmetries of the number systems generated by coordinates of special
points on curves? What are the possible states of a quantum computer obtainable
by a sequence of machine operations? I propose to study groups, both to better
understand their internal structure and, in the case of monodromy groups, to
gain insight into the geometries and number systems which give rise to them.
