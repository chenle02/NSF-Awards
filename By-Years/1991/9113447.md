This dissertation research project supports an anthropology student from the
University of Michigan studying changes in marriage patterns in two tribal
communities in eastern Indonesia. The project will examine the effects of cash
crop production (in one group) on traditional marriage exchanges and
responsibilities within and between family groups. One group has substituted
cash exchanges for traditional goods, and the project hypothesizes that these
cash exchanges are associated with increasing social stratification. Methods
include local surveys, participant observation, and structured interviewing.
This research is important because tribal groups all over the world are becoming
increasingly monetized. Understanding how the commercial aspects of their lives
changes traditional social relations will help policy makers deal with these
usually negative aspects of economic development.
