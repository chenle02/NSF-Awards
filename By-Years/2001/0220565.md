Metabolic Engineering Conference IV is the fourth of a continuing conference
series on the interdisciplinary field of metabolic engineering, and provides a
new window into quantitative analysis and synthesis of metabolic networks. The
increasing awareness of metabolic engineering in both the academic and
industrial scene has been stimulated by some critical challenges of modern
molecular biology and recombinant DNA technology.

The two most important elements of metabolic engineering, quantitative
physiology (analysis) and metabolic design (synthesis), are aimed to address
these problems. Concepts and methodologies of metabolic engineering have
potential value in direct application of metabolic design of cellular systems
for the degradation of recalcitrant pollutants, production processes, and cell-
based and gene therapies, which could provide critical insight in many areas of
medicine. Themes to be discussed at this upcoming conference include:

1) Systems analysis in metabolic engineering 2) Metabolic engineering of cell
cultures 3) Metabolic engineering of prokaryotes 4) Inverse metabolic
engineering 5) Human metabolic systems biology 6) Metabolic engineering of
quality traits in plants 7) Metabolic engineering of primary and secondary
metabolites 8) Quantitative experimental analysis 9) Computational methods 10)
Biocatalysts 11) High-throughput analysis
