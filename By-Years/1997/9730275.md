A long-standing argument in political theory is that the use of a majoritarian
electoral system, based on single member districts, is associated with stable
government. Conversely, the use of proportional representation (PR) is
associated with fragmented policies and `weak` coalition governments. Macro-
political analyses to justify these arguments are somewhat inconclusive, because
of the wide variety of PR policies. This research addresses this question by
micro-political methods focusing on the nature of party and voter strategies in
twelve polities. For nine of these polities (Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France,
Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands) a `multinomial probit`
electoral model has been devised, based on 1979 survey and elite data. In
Israel, a conditional logit model has been constructed based on 1992 and 1996
surveys and manifesto data. These models will be extended to analyze elections
in these countries to the present day, by incorporating party responses to
electoral and economic disturbances. These data are augmented by new information
on Poland and Russia. For Poland, a combination of opinion poll data, elite
interviews and party manifestos will be used to study strategic behavior by
parties and voters, in the context of a mixed majoritarian/PR electoral system.
In Russia, elite interviews and study of party manifestos will be used to
structure the nature of the policy space of relevance to political factions.
This research focuses on the incentives for factions to coalesce in a political
situation which is highly fragmented and uncertain. The theoretical purpose of
the research is to understand the nature of the formation of factions and
parties in the context of differing electoral systems. By `endogenizing` parties
in this fashion, it is hoped that the research will lead, in the long run, to an
account of the obvious differences, in party structure and coalition behavior,
displayed by these various polities.
