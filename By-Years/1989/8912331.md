Fluid properties and fluid phase equilibria are critical to the design of
chemical and biochemical processes. During the decade of the seventies it was
realized that a communications gap had developed between academic researchers,
who often determined trends in the field, and industrial practitioners, who
depended upon the results of the academic research. The International
Conferences on Fluid Properties and Phase Equilibria for Chemical Process Design
were begun during that period to help communicate industrial needs to the
academic community. This need is no less critical today, as the constantly
changing world economic picture causes industry to continually look at new
processes, new products, and new starting materials. Past conferences have
demonstrably served to address this need, and there is every expectation that
this will also be the case at this Fifth International Conference.
