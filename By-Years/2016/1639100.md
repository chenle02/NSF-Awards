This award supports the participation of junior researchers in a workshop held
at the Joint Statistical Meetings in Chicago, Illinois in July and August 2016.
The workshop focuses on effective technical writing for new researchers in the
statistical sciences, who seek to publish their research or to present their
research plans in the form of grant proposals for federal funding. Researchers,
especially new researchers, often have difficulty disseminating their research
results not because of the quality of the research but rather because of
inappropriate choices of publication venues for the particular research and/or
because of poor presentation of technical material to the chosen audience. The
National Institute of Statistical Sciences and the American Statistical
Association will manage the Workshop. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will
open with tutorial sessions on the organization of material for a technical
article or grant application, on technical writing techniques, and on the
specific missions and audiences of key journals in the statistical sciences.
Following the introductory tutorial, each participating new researcher will work
individually with an experienced journal editor as mentor to address these
issues on an individualized basis in a draft of the new researcher's work.
Revisions following this guidance will be critiqued by the mentor to assure that
the new researcher's implementation of writing techniques has been successful
before the article or the grant proposal is submitted for review. More

jointly supported by the Infrastructure and Statistics programs in the NSF
Division of Mathematical Sciences.
