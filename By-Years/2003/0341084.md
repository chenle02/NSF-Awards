The investigators will develop a quantitative theoretical and numerical analysis
of electromagnetic plasma weak turbulence, with the aim of investigating the
basic radiation mechanism at the plasma frequency and its harmonics. Such a
mechanism, known in the literature as the plasma emission, is accepted as the
process responsible for solar type II and type III radio bursts in the corona
and interplanetary space. Despite more than 40 years of theoretical research on
this topic, however, the basic set of equations have not been quantitatively
solved to this date, owing to the enormous complexity associated with obtaining
such a solution. In this research program, the basic theory of plasma emission
will be reformulated from the most basic set of equations governing the plasma
dynamics. Once the electromagnetic effects are fully taken into account, the
numerical code will be developed to solve the final set of equations. However,
unlike the Langmuir turbulence problem where a one-dimensional approximation
reasonably describes the essential physics, the electromagnetic plasma emission
problem requires at least a two-dimensional treatment at the outset. The final
numerical result is expected to lead to a much better understanding of the
plasma emission problem, and help resolve some of the outstanding issues such as
the wave growth period, the saturated spectrum, and most importantly, the issue
associated with the relative efficiency of the standard three-wave process
versus an alternative mechanism which involves the excitation of the so-called
nonlinear beam mode. The study may have impacts on other fields, e.g., laser-
plasma interaction, microwave generation devices, beam-plasma discharge, rocket
active experiments, ionospheric microwave heating experiments, solar and
interplanetary radio wave bursts and energetic particles, bow-shock radio waves
and energetic particles, and cosmic rays.
