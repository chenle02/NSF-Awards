This two year project allows a multi-disciplinary team of authors to prepare a
text book of case studies illustrating ethical issues involved in human use of
animals. The cases will focus particularly on the use of animals in scientific
experiments, but will also include their use in numerous other settings. Cases
will involve major historical events of the last decade, and others that are
composites of important social issues. Authors include a physiologist, a
philosopher, a lawyer and a veterinarian, to provide a range of expertise and
viewpoints. Consultants will review the manuscripts, to provide oversight and
further views. Major scholarly publishing houses will be solicited for interest
in publication, and wide distribution of the book is anticipated. The cases are
intended to serve a broad range of educational purposes. Target readership
covers scientists, students, teachers and the public. Each have interest and
need to understand the value judgments and conflicts surrounding human and
animal interaction. In particular, scientists whose careers involve animal
experimentation usually receive no instruction about the ethical dimensions of
their work. But, in order to train teachers to introduce this material into
their courses, they need texts. Currently there are few suitable sources. This
project represents a fresh approach that has been used successfully in other
fields of ethics.
