Base isolation systems offer an attractive method of mitigating the effects of
earthquakes under certain conditions. Worldwide interest in the concept is at a
high level. This research project analyzes and statistically evaluates the
maximum nonlinear response of various types of seismic (base) isolation systems
for a number of earthquake time history records. The results of the proposed
research are intended to support the development of seismic design methodology
by providing the basic necessary data to judge the validity of certain
prescriptive design formulas, assess the limits of applicability for the
formulas and to modify the formulas, as appropriate, prior to incorporation into
design codes. The research project is being conducted under the Expedited Awards
for Novel Research programs.
