The objectives of this project are to develop practical tools for online
analysis and visualization of experimental video data that should be applicable
in both research and teaching laboratories. The system will have a familiar web-
based interface, promote collaborative visualization and remote access and take
advantage of distributed computing resources to attain near-realtime
performance. The system will be particularly oriented towards the seamless
acquisition and analysis of video data in order to detech transitions during the
running of experiments. Fast display techniques and spatial Karhunen-Loeve
reconstructions will be among the techniques implemented to allow
experimentalists to map out bifurcation structure as experimental parameters are
changed.
