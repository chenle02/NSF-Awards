This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at George Washington University in the
purchase of an Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS). This
equipment will be used in the following areas of research: (1) investigation of
novel high-temperature helium plasmas and new nebulization systems used in
analytical spectrometry for elemental analysis; (2) investigation of matrix-
assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry for the detection of bio-
organic trace materials; (3) determination of the current quality and quantity
of ground water in the District of Columbia, and to develop plans to contain
discharges of pollutants from point and non-point sources; (4) measurement of
the concentrations and isotopic ratios of metals in biological samples; (5)
detection of metal pollutants in samples from the aquaculture development areas
in order to find the path of metals to humans through the food fish; isotopic
ratios in near-surface samples; and (6) development of validated methodologies
for analysis of forensic samples. Inductive Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry
(ICP-MS) is a high temperature technique which uses the discharge generated by
inducing a magnet field in a flowing conducting gas to determine the elemental
composition of a material. The technique has remarkable selective and
sensitivities that allows analytical chemical determination of ground water
pollutants landfill leachates, trace metals, forensic material and biological
material.
