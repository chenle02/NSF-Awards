9417870 Nelson This award provides partial (50%) funding for a technical support
position at the isotope geochemistry laboratory in the Department of Geological
Sciences at the University of Washington. The University is committed to
providing the remaining funds required to support the position. The technician
will be in charge of operation and maintenance of the isotope geochemistry
laboratory which includes a modern thermal ionization source mass spectrometer
and associated clean-rooms for sample preparation. The technician will also
train and supervise students and visiting researchers to the laboratory. The
analytical capabilities of the laboratory include measurement of uranium-lead
ages and neodymium, strontium, and lead isotope and trace element
characteristics of rocks and minerals for the purpose of interpreting the
Earth's tectonic history. ***
