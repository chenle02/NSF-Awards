Recent modernization of the department's seismology laboratory and the addition
of a faculty member interested in research and instruction in geophysics has
permitted expansion of student research opportunities into this field. Global
Positioning System (GPS) satellite geodetic instruments are at the forefront of
science and technology. These instruments are being used by undergraduate
students to examine crustal deformation related to tectonic processes. Students
participate in faculty-sponsored research projects, including the publication of
results in professional journals. In the Introduction to Geophysics course,
students are involved in projects studying the strain and uplift of the San
Gabriel Range, measuring of deformation in connection with the San Jose and San
Andreas faults, and analyzing data related to tectonic deformation throughout
the Transverse Ranges.
