0116750&lt;br/&gt;Howe&lt;br/&gt;This award to University of Washington will
provide support for the design and prototype of a 100 kW parallel DC power
system for cabled, undersea observatories for oceanographic research. The design
is intended to support a "plate-scale" system such as the NEPTUNE network of
remote, interactive natural laboratories that is being planned for the seafloor
region called the Juan de Fuca Plate, offshore of the Pacific Northwest. NEPTUNE
is being designed to include thirty or more discrete observatory nodes, each
capable of hosting multiple observing systems, along a system involving 3000
kilometers or more of fiber optic cable for power and communications. The power
system addressed here will be designed in parallel with communications systems
presently under development at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, with
coordination provided by the NEPTUNE System Engineering Team. Wet testing is
anticipated to take place in two submarine installations, one in California and
one in Canada, in Spring 2004. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
