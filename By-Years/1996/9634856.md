Laser-induced machining is an excellent alternative to ion beams with distinct
benefits including patterning by direct writing or optical projection without
contact masks, higher etch rates, and enhanced surface integrity. This project
investigates a substitution of ion beam with an electron beam or a laser beam.
This research project will develop a fundamental understanding of laser-assisted
and liquid-induced reactive machining technique by (1) performing nanosecond
(ns)-laser chemical vapor-deposited(CVD)-diamond polishing and drilling
experiments in various liquid media, and (2) by experimental diagnosis and
theoretical modeling of laser : diamond interaction in liquid media.
