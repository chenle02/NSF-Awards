This award provides funds for a joint research project between two I/UCRC's.
The Center for Non-destructive evaluation at Iowa State University and the Ohio
State University Research Foundation. The proposed study will address both
theoretical and experimental aspects of detecting flaws through rough surface
and interfaces in thin inhomogeneous layers using ultrasonic techniques. The
proposed research will provide a significant extension of knowledge of the
impact of surface quality on the probability of detection of interior defects.
The area of ultrasonic NDE is critical to the establishment of the performance
of structural elements in buildings, airplanes, submarines, bridges etc. The IAB
of each center has approved this research and their matching funds. The Program
Director recommends a grant of $50,000 for two years be awarded to Ohio State
University.
