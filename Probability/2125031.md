Random polynomials occur naturally in various areas of physics and mathematics,
such as in quantum chaotic systems and approximation theory. The study of random
polynomials has applications in computer science and engineering. In addition,
studying roots of high-degree polynomials is an important area of mathematics
that is useful in both pure and applied sciences. The goal of this research
project is to study fundamental questions concerning the distribution of roots
of random polynomials and, more generally, random functions. This project
contains three research programs that address questions in the field of random
functions. In the first program, the investigator plans to establish local
universality for random orthogonal polynomials and derive the mean number of
real roots for general distributions. The second program aims to study the
variance and the Central Limit Theorem for the number of real roots of various
classical models of random functions. The goal of the third program is to
further the understanding of the connection between the growth of the
coefficients and the growth of the number of real roots. To approach these
questions, the investigator will develop the local universality method and build
on different tools in analysis and probability. The project will also address
several questions regarding the mixing time of Markov Chains and the phase
transition of the contact process, an important model for the spread of diseases
in communities.
