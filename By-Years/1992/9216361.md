This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of electrochemistry. During the tenure of this three-year
continuing grant, Professor Creager and his students will study electron
transfer over long distances in organized monolayers. This research will focus
specifically on the role that the local medium, particularly the bridging
structure between reactants, plays in dictating the rate and pathway for
electron transfer. Using novel ferrocene-capped rigid polyphenylene oligomers
attached to gold microelectrodes via thiol termini, the temperature dependence
of electron transfer rates on ion pairing and other local medium effects will be
investigated. The structure of these rigid monolayers will be characterized by
surface x-ray scattering experiments that will be carried out at Brookhaven
National Laboratory. %%% This research is expected to enhance the current
understanding of long range electron transfer processes that are of central
importance to many biological functions such as photosynthesis and cellular
energy transduction involving redox proteins.
