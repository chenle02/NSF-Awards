The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports T. Darrah Thomas of Oregon
State University in his continuing studies on inner-shell photoelectron
spectroscopy of small molecules. He will focus on high-resolution spectroscopy
of carbon 1s electrons, using the high-resolution electron spectrometer at the
Advanced Light Source (ALS) at Lawrence Berkeley Lab. The ultimate goals are to
develop a better understanding of the relationship between ionization energies
and reactivity and other chemical properties, to develop procedures for
assigning group electronegativities, to better understand the factors that
contribute to electronegativity and to test current theories for predicting and
understanding ionization energies. These topics are at the forefront of current
research in electron spectroscopy and have recently become extremely topical
because of the availability of third-generation synchrotron radiation sources.
While there have been many molecular systems studied at high-brightness
synchrotrons, almost all of the previously published studies of other
investigators have been demonstration studies. These studies go far beyond that.
The beauty of x-ray spectroscopy is that it can be atom-specific, even in the
`chemical site` sense of the term. For chemically important compounds, this
requires the extremely high resolution available in the synchrotron sources that
will be exploited in these studies. Photoelectron spectroscopy and Auger
spectroscopy are by far the most important and widely used techniques for
surface analysis in industry and fundamental research in these areas remains
vitally important.
