This grant is for the support of a Presidential Young Investigator. His research
will involve two primary areas. One is experimental research on the dynamics of
turbulent flows in rivers, lakes, and estuaries in the presence of thermal
stratification. The other will be the development of collaborative projects with
marine biologists on estuarine and lake ecology. The research will advance
knowledge and modeling capability in environmental dispersion, and the relation
of hydrodynamic processes and phytoplankton biomass.
