The Mathematical Association of America (MAA) will carry out an evaluation
study of the calculus reform movement in the United States. This evaluation
study will include current efforts in colleges and universities to generate a
reform movement and, in particular, will consider the NSF calculus initiative as
a model for future curriculum initiatives. Information collected will include
factual data on a wide variety of projects including all NSF funded projects. An
in-depth study of a carefully selected sample of projects will include site
visits and on-site data gathering. Key issues to be addressed will include
outcomes of individual projects, long term continuation of projects,
dissemination and integration of results and future directions. Simultaneously,
the effectiveness of NSF's program, as a factor in the reform movement, will be
studied as a model for promoting curricular reform. Regular reports will be made
to the mathematics community and to other science disciplines. Since the NSF
initiative in calculus is a large factor in the reform movement, and since this
study is of interest to NSF staff, NSF will be included as a recipient of these
regular reports. Cost sharing on this award is $17,000 or 9%.//
