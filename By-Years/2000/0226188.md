The goal of the research will be to involve science students from Saint Anselm
College, an undergraduate teaching institution, in a meaningful research project
incorporating state-of-the-art technology. All research will be conducted in the
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Biomolecular Interaction
Technologies (BITC) at the University of New Hampshire and will make extensive
use of the fluorescence detection optical system on the BITC analytical
ultracentrifuge. All data will be reported to BITC. The project will serve as a
test of the new device, and it will help develop protocols for using analytical
ultracentrifugation with whole-cell lysates.
