9601668 Sherrell Funds are provided to Rutgers University for acquisition of an
Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer (IRMS) and an Inductively-Coupled Plasma Mass
Spectrometer (ICP-MS) which will be utilized for integrated and
interdisciplinary studies of coastal biogeochemistry. The IRMS will allow the
determination of stable isotope ratios of carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen
in samples of sea water, particulate organic matter, and plant and animal
tissue. The ICP-MS will permit rapid sensitive analysis of a suite of elements
which act as important tracers of pathways within biogeochemical cycles in the
marine environment. Both mass spectrometers will be managed by faculty working
groups in user groups, and the instruments will be run on a cost per sample
basis. Rutgers University is supporting this project with $316,000, which
represents a 44% costshare. ***
