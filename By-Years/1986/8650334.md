This project will improve significantly the chemistry laboratory curriculum by
giving students relevant instruction and hands-on experience with a modern
state-of-the-art Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (FT-IR). Also
students will have a first-hand opportunity to use computer-controlled data
manipulation and collection techniques. The project will allow students to
investigate, identify, and characterize the structures of unknown compounds and
compounds which they synthesize. The computer and associated software will
permit students to control the instrument and select methods of data collection,
storage, search, and manipulation. The project will be implemented by expansion
of current experiments and development and/or incorporation of new experiments.
The FT-IR will be used in Organic Chemistry Laboratory, Techniques of Dynamics,
Chemical Instrumentation, Inorganic Synthesis and Characterization, Instrumental
Analysis, and Senior Research Experience. Enhancement of student laboratory
experience through the operation of a computer-controlled FT-IR will provide
students with a better, more relevant preparation for continued study in
graduate school and for careers in industrial laboratories.
