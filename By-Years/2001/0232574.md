This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is directed at
developing novel high-temperature membranes/MEA for PEM fuel cell system for
next generation vehicle (NGV) application. The overall objective is to operate
PEM fuel cell at 120-150C to achieve high cell performance, improve CO
tolerance, mitigate water and thermal management challenges and reduce system
cost. The technical approach is to develop high-performing MEA consisting of
membranes of high water retention capability and cathode of low polarization at
high temperatures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High-temperature PEMFC is attractive
due to its unique characteristics of simple system design. Such a clean, high-
efficiency and simple system is very attractive for NGV. The main commercial
market will be NGV passenger car and bus. Other markets will include
mobile/portable power, ship, and commercial/residential building applications..
