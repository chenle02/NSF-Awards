Enormous data sets are now available from high-quality traffic measurements for
communications networks. Analysis of this data has revealed unexpected
properties of traffic behavior which may critically affect network performance.
Unfortunately, the development of statistical and mathematical techniques for
efficiently dealing with this abundance of data and for effectively analyzing
newly-observed phenomena has not kept up with the rate at which newer and larger
data sets of traffic measurements are being captured, nor with the pace at which
networks themselves change. The planned research program responds directly to
the need for new approaches to network traffic and performance analysis in order
to effectively exploit these large data sets and to understand the impact of the
newly-observed phenomena. A postdoctoral research fellow will be appointed to
work with researchers at the Information Sciences Research Center at AT&T Labs
and the University of Wisconsin - Madison. The research associate will provide
the primary link in the planned collaborative research program. This project is
jointly supported by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and
the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS)
