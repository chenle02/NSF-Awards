Upperclassmen in the sciences need to spend both lecture and laboratory time
learning how new information is obtained and how to design and interpret
experiments. The laboratory must provide them with experience in as many major
techniques as possible, performed with modern instruments. The college is
purchasing a modern ultraviolet- visible spectrophotometer with computerized
data treatment capabilities. This versatile instrument is being used to perform
kinetics and thermodynamics experiments, determine the concentrations of a wide
variety of solutions, record spectra, and manipulate the resulting data. The
instrument is being used in courses in Instrumental Analysis, Physical
Chemistry, Biochemistry, Organic Chemistry, Genetics, and Cell Biology. In each
course, students are learning to solve at least one laboratory problem and to
use the techniques to solve other problems they will face in graduate school and
on the job. The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources.
