Under this award, the PI will investigate the physical mechanisms and
geophysical implications of melt channelization that occurs during deformation
of partially molten rocks. With experimental investigations of deformation-
driven melt channelization, the boundary and thermodynamic conditions can be
rigorously controlled and systematically varied, to study (i) the mechanism by
which deformation drives melt segregation, (ii) the time and length scales
appropriate for melt segregation to occur in nature, and (iii) the effects of
deformation-driven melt segregation on viscosity, permeability and seismic
structures. High-strain simple shear and torsional shear experiments will be
carried out on samples of specific grain sizes, melt fractions, and melt
compositions at controlled stresses and temperatures. Both the mechanical and
the microstructural state of the samples will be quantified and correlated as
they evolve with increasing strain and as functions of shear stress and
compaction length. The rheological and microstructural, states will be
quantified using a variety of proven techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
