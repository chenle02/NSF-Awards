The PI will acquire equipment to be used for characterizing the growth of
dielectric layers during chemical vapor deposition. This requested equipment
will be used in conjunction with a research CVD reactor at CSU devoted to the
study of dielectric deposition on a variety of III-V compounds and on Si. Such
low temperature insulators are of critical importance in the development of sub-
micron devices on Si and in the fabrication of high performance devices and
integrated circuits on the compound semiconductors. Such components offer
considerable potential for fulfilling next generation electronics requirements
and the requested equipment will support current research at CSU (NASA/AF-RADC)
as well as proposed research (SDIO-IST) in this area.
