This proposal from Southeastern Universities Research Association (SURA) is
requesting funds for a two day workshop for faculty and administrative leaders
from US Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) who are committed to curricular
reforms. The goal of this workshop is to enable MSI educators to bring
computational and data-enabled science and engineering topics into undergraduate
and graduate education and exchange best pedagogical
practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although some strides have been made in
integrating the computational science competencies required in this field into
the university curriculum, the pace of change has been slow resulting in a
critical shortage of sufficiently qualified students at both the baccalaureate
and graduate levels. The problems of integrating computational science into the
curriculum are particularly acute on the campuses of minority serving
institutions (MSIs). Heavy teaching loads and the lack of local resources
combined with the limited number of faculty with computational science expertise
significantly slows efforts to modify the curriculum. Some institutions may lack
the critical mass of faculty on their campuses to support this particular
curricular reform effort. This workshop will provide an opportunity for the
participating institutions to tackle curriculum reform issues and planning in a
focused uninterrupted environment with expert facilitation. The workshop is
designed to provide the participants with the tools and information necessary to
articulate a strong business case for making curriculum changes; identify the
resources and services that can be leveraged; create draft plans that can be
submitted to their faculty council, provost and other bodies and committees that
approve curriculum; and explore implementation collaborations.
