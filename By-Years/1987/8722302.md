The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will acquire a modern, computer-driven,
44-inch wide color plotter that is to be installed and maintained as a shared
use facility. The plotter will be connected to the institution's local area
computer network so investigators from all parts of the campus will have ready
access to this new capability. Large scale color plots of complex data sets,
such as three- dimensional geophysical data, have proven very useful for data
interpretation and presentation. This equipment will be maintained for use by
all investigators and will especially benefit NSF-sponsored research projects by
increasing the capabilities of the institution to support research and
engineering activities.
