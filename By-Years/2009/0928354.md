ABSTRACT HRD 0928354&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Natural Science Division of Hinds
Community College District is planning to develop and implement an initiative to
increase the number of students who complete B.S. degrees. The anticipated
strategy is to strengthen bridges that support students? articulation from high
school to community college and from community college to degree-granting
institutions in pursuit of a B.S. degree in STEM. This effort builds on an early
unfunded needs assessment including a SACS self-study. HCC is working to
identify specific components that need improvement in order to provide a high
quality undergraduate STEM education to support students? articulation from HCC
to degree-granting institutions in pursuit of a B.S. degree in STEM. Planned
activities include: data collection and analysis, consultation with area schools
and businesses, and site visits to model programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hinds
Community College (HCC), Utica Campus, is a small Historically Black Community
College located in Hinds County, Mississippi. The HCC district has more than
10,700 credit students and is more than 50 percent minority. A strong STEM
program and curriculum/professional development model can affect
underrepresented minority students district-wide and serve as a model for the
rest of the state.
