This award provides support for the purchase of a mechanical spectrometer which
will be used to measure the linear and nonlinear viscoelastic response of
polymeric fluids and solids. It forms an integral part of the research programs
of faculty and students from chemical engineering, engineering science and
mechanics, chemistry, and the forest products department at Virginia Polytechnic
Institute and State University. The principal investigator is Professor Donald
G. Baird.
