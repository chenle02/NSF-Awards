This grant provides funds for modest travel awards to graduate students in
logic in support of their participation in the Annual Meeting and the European
Summer Meeting (Logic Colloquium) of the Association for Symbolic Logic (ASL).
The NSF funds supplement ASL funds which are already being used in this way. Any
student who is at an advanced stage of a PhD program in logic will be eligible
for support; efforts will be made to encourage participation by women and
minorities. These awards are aimed at two goals: (a) to ensure that graduate
students in logic have good opportunities to participate actively in the
profession at an early moment, in order to enrich their educational experience;
(b) to strengthen the two main annual meetings of the Association for Symbolic
Logic, which are key professional meetings in the field, by increasing the
number of graduate students who are able to attend.
