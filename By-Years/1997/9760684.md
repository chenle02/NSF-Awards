*** 9760684 Vickery This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
use a large scale, validated hurricane simulation technique, coupled with
existing storm surge models to develop the first risk consistent modeling of the
combined action of direct wind and storm surge produced by hurricanes. The storm
surge analysis and resulting flood maps produced by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) were not developed in a statistically rigorous manner,
and thus the true return periods associated with the 100 year storm surge is, in
fact, not known. To assess the risk of storm damage to structures, the combined
action of wind and storm surge must be treated as they are inherently coupled,
and damage in many cases is produced by a combination of the two storm perils.
The simulation approach simultaneously determines wind speeds and storm surge
levels, using an extensively validated hurricane wind field yielding the first
consistent wind/surge design criteria thus allowing the annual joint probability
distribution of wind speed and storm surge to be determined. A primary
commercial application for this research includes a new risk consistent approach
for insurance companies to assess their true total risk. The new approach may
yield further business opportunities for insurance companies in many cases,
relieving the Federal Government of some of its risk. Other potential
applications include the utility industry, which with this research will be able
to produce more cost effective transmission and distribution system designs in
coastal areas. ***
