9604321 Abbott Today, 2.3 million couples in USA are infertile. One third of
these cases are due to ovarian-related infertility in women, and psychosocial
causes of anovulation contribute to 20-30% of these ovarian impairments.
Cooperatively breeding animals (animal societies in which more individuals than
the single breeding pair aid in raising the breeders' offspring) provide unique
models for the investigation of psychosocial control of ovulation in females.
Dr. Abbott and Saltzman are studying a species in which mature, socially
subordinate females exhibit profound suppression of ovulation and behavior. This
socially induced infertility is not due to generalized stress and can be readily
reversed, depending upon a female's social status. By employing specific
behavioral and physiological techniques, Dr. Abbott and Dr. Saltzman will
examine the neuroendocrine mechanisms by which animals reverse their ability to
reproduce. Using state-of- the-art technology in push-pull perfusion, they will
measure gonadotropin releasing-hormone from the hypothalamus to determine
whether transitory elevations in release of this important hormone mediates the
behaviorally-induced transition from the anovulatory state to the onset of
cyclicity. The results from these studies will elucidate the behavioral and
neural mechanisms underlying the psychosocial control of fertility in females.
This basic knowledge will lead to a better understanding of infertility. The
results are also important in conservation efforts to help understand problems
associated with fertility in endangered species.
