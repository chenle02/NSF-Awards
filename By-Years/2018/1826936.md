This study seeks to develop theoretical and computational methods to improve
simulations of optical properties of non-spherical particles over a broad range
of size parameters. Applications of the theoretical/computational work span many
broad areas of physics, chemistry, and engineering; with specific importance in
atmospheric and oceanic sciences, combustion science, astrophysics, bio-optics,
manufacturing diagnostics and control, and many other fields. This study will
train graduate students and post-doctoral scholars. After testing and
optimization, this research group plans to release the computational programs as
open-source codes to the research community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study
seeks to expand previous NSF-funded research to develop advanced capabilities
based on the invariant imbedding T-matrix method (II-TM) for simulating the
optical properties of non-spherical, inhomogeneous particles with small to
moderate size parameters. This study seeks to further improve the II-TM from
both theoretical and numerical perspectives. This group recently developed a
preliminary version of a physical geometric optics model (PGOM) based on either
an electromagnetic volume- or a surface-integral relation for large size
parameters. The suite of PGOM and II-TM will represent state-of-the-art light
scattering computational capabilities, with a wide range of applications in
atmospheric/oceanic radiative transfer and remote
sensing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
