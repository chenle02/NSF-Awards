Calvin College will strengthen the undergraduate physics program by the purchase
of a low-energy X- and gamma-ray solid-state spectrometer. It will enrich the
experience of juniors and seniors in their laboratory and research courses, by
making it possible for them to perform classic experiments in atomic and nuclear
physics, and also to perform individual research projects involving ionizing
radiation.
