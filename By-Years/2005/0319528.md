With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Washington and Lee University will acquire a
multinuclear gradient inverse probe, amplifier, and low temperature Dewar for
their 400 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry
out studies on a) macrocyclic polyamide complexes that are significant in
industrially important environmentally friendly catalytic oxidations; and b) the
mechanism of ruthenium-carbene based ring opening metathesis polymerization,
zirconium metallocene-catalyzed polymerizations, and polymer backbone dynamics.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific
arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
