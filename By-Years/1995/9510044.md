9510044 Paul Ecosystem Response to Catastrophic Defoliation of Poplars
Defoliation of hardwood forests by Gypsy moth caterpillars in the eastern US has
caused great concern. Defoliation kills some trees and the leafless trees are
unsightly, as well as having the potential to cause environmental pollution
because of the frass produced. Poor success of past attempts to stop
defoliation, the patchiness of Gypsy moth attacks, and the various rates of
recovery of different forests show there are numerous ecosystem responses and
controls which are little known. Better knowledge of ecosystem response and
recovery could greatly aid in coping with or overcoming catastrophic
defoliation. This project will study a well characterized research plot where
some trees will be defoliated and others protected using an organic insecticide.
Effects on nitrogen cycling, water uptake, and root mycorrhizae will be
measured. This project will provide the fundamental information which will help
better manage forests affected by this serious pest.
