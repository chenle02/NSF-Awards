CAREER: Intelligently Managing the Memory Hierarchy of Future High-Performance
Servers&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research addresses the
unique challenges facing high-performance server design in the billion-
transistor chip era. Chip multiprocessors consisting of multiple cores that
share the memory hierarchy and run many independent threads simultaneously,
represent one direction for future parallel architectures. In such
architectures, the contention for shared resources such as caches and off-chip
bandwidth can produce thrashing and degrade the server performance significantly
if not properly managed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In this research a synergistic
approach involving computer architecture, compiler, and operating systems is
advocated to tackle the problem of resource management in chip multiprocessor
based servers. An intelligent memory hierarchy is proposed (i) to provide fine-
grain inter-thread management of resources like caches, off-chip bandwidth, and
main memory (ii) to offload critical memory-bound functions from the server and
(iii) to reduce context switch overheads. &lt;br/&gt;
