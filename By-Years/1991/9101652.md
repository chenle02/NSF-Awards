Under an SGER award the process of selective transfer in certain lubricated
systems will be studied and its potential as a general wear reducing mechanism
will be evaluated. An attempt will be made to replicate results claimed in the
Russian-language literature. The mechanism of wear protection by the deposited
metal layers will be studied together with the processes of metal dissolution
and metal deposition in sliding systems.
