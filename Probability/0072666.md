An outstanding and long studied problem in statistical mechanics is to
establish the connection between the microscopic world and its macroscopic
behavior. The investigator's research concerns stochastic models associated with
the evolution of dilute gases and the formation of solids. As the first step,
one derives a partial differential equation for the macroscopic evolution of
such stochastic models. Roughly speaking, one shows that after a suitable
scaling, the particle density of a dilute gas (respectively, the boundary
surface of a solid) converges to a solution of the Boltzmann equation
(respectively, Hamilton-Jacobi equation). Probabilistically, such a convergence
is a law of large numbers and its corresponding central limit theorem provides
us with some vital information about the microscopic model under the study.
Solids form through growth processes which take place at the surface. Imagine an
already formed nucleus to which further material sticks from the ambient
atmosphere. The process of the attachment is a function of a huge variety of
growth mechanisms depending on the materials involved, their temperature,
composition, etc. Following the tradition of statistical mechanics, one studies
simplified models which nevertheless captures some of the essential physics.
Such simplified models are proved to be useful in understanding the intricate
formation of solids. It turns out that these models describe other phenomena
such as the spread of infected cells in a tissue, the effect of impurity in the
evolution of a fluid, etc. The investigator's research concerns the interplay
between the microscopic growth rules and the macroscopic shape of the surface of
a solid.
