9457376 Yennello A research program in nuclear physics will be initiated. This
will center on the ultilization of beams of exotic nuclei to investigate nuclear
reaction mechanisms. It will be possible to explore separately both isospin
equilibration and the effects on nuclear properties of the Coulomb force. ***
