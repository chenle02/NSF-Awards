The Langlands program, a central theme in contemporary number theory, comprises
several predictions that provide an approach to the analytic study of solution
sets of Diophantine equations using techniques from linear algebra to exploit
hidden symmetries in these solution sets. Geometric representation theory brings
geometric tools to bear in studying problems in linear algebra. This project
will apply methods from geometric representation theory to first reduce the
computation of certain integrals that arise in the Langlands program to a
discrete problem in combinatorial geometry, and then to study the solution of
this latter problem. The results are expected to deepen and extend understanding
in number theory and geometric representation theory, areas of mathematics with
connections to many other subjects, including cyber security and physics.

In work already completed, the investigator has succeeded in reducing the
computation of certain orbital integrals to the problem of counting rational
points of étale Hessenberg varieties over finite fields. This project will
extend and refine the earlier computation, as well as study étale Hessenberg
varieties in their own right, specifically as strata in affine Springer fibers,
and place them in a broader context of relative Springer theory.
