9526916 Smyth The proposed research is to investigate the crystal chemistry of
hydroxyl substitution in a group of representative silicates. Several mineral
structures will be refined by x-ray and/or neutron single crystal methods at
various temperatures in order to test critical aspects of an electrostatic model
for prediction of physical and chemical properties of hydroxyl-bearing
silicates. H positions determined by x-ray and neutron diffraction will be
compared to see if systematic differences are present that would allow use of
x-ray data to estimate proton positions. Electrostatic site potentials will be
computed for both x-ray and neutron h positions to see if systematic relations
exist with IR data, relative thermal expansion of various nearest neighbor
distances, 18O/18O and D/H fractionation and chemical weathering rates. These
studies will hopefully improve the predictive capability for physical and
chemical properties of hydroxyl-bearing silicates and may yield a constraint on
the H flux returning into the mantle.
