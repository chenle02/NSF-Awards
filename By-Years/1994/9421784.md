This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
supports research by Dr. Suzanne Harris of the Chemistry Department, University
of Wyoming, on hydrodesulfurization (HDS) catalysts. Approximate electronic
structure calculations (Fenske-Hall) will be used to examine both solid state
and molecular systems related to HDS. Thiophenic binding sites on the surfaces
of active HDS catalysts, such as ruthenium, rhodium and promoted molybdenum
sulfides, will be compared to those in model thiophenic molecules. Calculations
will be carried out on both adsoption of thiophene at selected surface sites on
these sulfides, and on related groups of complexes incorporating thiophenes,
benzothiophenes, and dibenzothiophenes. These calculations will make it possible
to evaluate how the nature of the transition metal center, its coordination
geometry, the other ligands bound to the metal, and the nature of the thiophenic
ligand itself affect the binding and activation of thiophenic molecules at one
or more metal centers. This is the first theoretical attempt to relate
heterogeneous hydrodesulfurization (HDS) reactions to the homogeneous chemistry
of metal thiophene complexes. HDS is used in the petroleum refining industry to
remove sulfur from thiophenic molecules in heavy crude oils and coal-derived
liquids. At high temperature and hydrogen pressure, the petroleum is passed over
a metal sulfide, and the thiophene is removed. The behavior of molecules of
metal thiophenes has been used to help understand the behavior of the real
catalyst system, but the details of the mechanism remain unknown. In this study,
the electronic structure of metal thiophene molecules will be compared to that
of the surface of the metal sulfide catalysts in order to better understand the
absorption and reactions of thiophenes in HDS catalysis.
