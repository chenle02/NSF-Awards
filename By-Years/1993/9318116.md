9318116 Plutchak The Saint Louis University Medical Center requests support to
provide NSFNET access to faculty, staff, and residents with permanent and
temporary university assignments at detached sites. Funds available through the
"Connections to NSFNET" program will be used to purchase networking hardware
necessary to connect both local facilities of the Veterans Affair Hospital, St.
Mary' Health Center, Deaconess Hospital, The Eye Institute, and The Institute of
Molecular Virology. The proposed interconnections consist of a combination of
dial-up, leased line, and direct connect equipment. Installation of a dial-up
bank of modems allow researchers to access the network from nearly anywhere they
might be: home; office or hotel. The proposed network will significantly enhance
the education and research activities of the faculty and residents from Saint
Louis University that work at these affiliated sites. ***
