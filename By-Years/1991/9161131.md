This project is funded under the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Small
Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which is designed to provide an
opportunity for small business, particularly the small high technology firm, to
participate in NSF research. Phase I of the SBIR program serves as a filter to
select promising proposals and determine if the firm can do high quality
research. Phase II is the principal research project. Phase III is the
conversion of the NSF-funded research into commercial applications and
technological innovation supported by follow-on private venture capital or other
non-federal financing. This Phase I project addresses multipath fading on radio
channels for high speed digital communications. The principal investigator is
investigating a new approach that adapts the system data rate to the time-
varying signal-to-noise ratio at the radio receiver. The objectives are to
determine the feasibility of rate changing algorithms and adaptive
synchronization; develop a measure of waiting time performance; and determine
the effects of queueing, a noisy feedback channel, rate changing overhead, and
propagation delay. The approach employs trellis coded modulation in an adaptive
scheme where the data rate varies by changing the number of bits per channel
symbol.
