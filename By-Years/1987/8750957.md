Equipment necessary to start an observational laboratory in developmental
psychology and to expand the range of student independent study projects to
include observational research, both in the field and in the laboratory has been
obtained. Recording equipment, video and audio, and hand-held data collectors
for field research are essential for demonstrating current observational
research methods for students. An eye-tracker is also an invaluable asset in the
developmental laboratory to demonstrate to students an important approach to the
study of the development of perceptual and cognitive processes in individuals.
