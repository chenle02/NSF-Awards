A computer algorithm in execution is a dynamical object. To understand how a
particular algorithm works, one has to visualize the dynamical changes that
occur to the state of the algorithm at each step of its execution. Traditional
classroom technology, such as chalk and blackboard or viewgraphs and overhead
projectors are inadequate to illustrate the dynamics of the execution of
algorithms. Therefore instructors are faced with difficulties in carrying out
simulations of algorithms in the classroom. This is a problem in almost every
course in Computer Science, since algorithms form a central part of the
discipline. The advent of relatively cheap high resolution fast graphical
workstations makes it possible to simulate the execution of an algorithm, and
display dynamically appropriate graphical representations of the state of its
execution on a screen. The result of these simulations is an interactive "movie"
of the execution of the algorithm providing students with immediate visual
feedback about the concepts being explained. This project equips a classroom and
implements curricula adjustments to take advantage of the new environment. Key
components consist of high resolution graphics workstations connected to a
special output device that permit students to view workstation displays on a
large projection screen. The award is being matched by an equal amount from the
principal investigator's institution.
