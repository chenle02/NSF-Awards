This award will establish a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site
administered through the Biology Program at Oregon State University. The program
will provide undergraduates in biological sciences with research experiences in
ecosystem studies at the Andrews Experimental Forest which is the site for
several interdisciplinary projects, including the NSF sponsored Long-Term
Ecological Research Program. Students will learn and develop skills as they
interact and work closely with scientists from several disciplines on individual
projects within the larger coordinated studies. To foster student development, a
4-phase program is planned: an overview phase which explains integrated
ecosystem studies, an apprenticeship phase to develop skills, a personal
research phase, and an evaluation and follow-up phase. According to their
interests, students will join a collaborating scientist for the second and third
phases. The Principal Investigator will coordinate the program, organize the
overview phase, field trips, and seminars, integrating the students and
collaborating scientists, facilities progress toward independent questioning,
and evaluating results. Students will be housed at the field station with other
researchers, an arrangement that encourages after-hours discussions and helps
break the barriers between disciplines. The project will place promising
students at a scenic research site with an interdisciplinary team of scientists
to produce good science and develop an enthusiasm for biological research.
