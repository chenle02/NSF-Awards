The North Texas Regional Technology Consortium combines the strengths of
regional educational institutions and business and industry partners to improve
Information Technology (IT) Programs to increase the quantity and quality of IT
resources available to the workforce. A partnership with the National Workforce
Center for Emerging Technologies (NWCET) provides access to cutting edge
information and access to successful existing curricula that can be adapted to
so that multiple IT certification options can be integrated into associate
degree bearing curricula. Articulation agreements are developed between high
schools and two-year colleges and between two and four-year colleges in the
area. The partnership with NWCET also provides access to affordable Educator-to-
Educator professional development workshops for faculty in community colleges
and high schools. A convergence laboratory at Collins County Community College
provides students with experiences with interoperability of equipment and
technologies. This laboratory is available to industry as a test bed. An
industry council provides guidance to the project as well as opportunities for
faculty and students to become acquainted with industrial practice and concerns.
A dual recruitment process with industry helps increase the number of students
from underserved populations. The project develops metrics for measuring
increase in IT enrollments and in employer satisfaction with those employees who
have participated in the program.
