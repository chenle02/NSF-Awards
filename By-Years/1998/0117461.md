Rural producers of primary commodities face increasingly unfavorable and
volatile terms of world trade, and the resulting poverty causes both social and
ecological deterioration. A growing fair trade movement offers a model of more
sustainable rural development by building alternative trade relations between
Southern producers and Northern consumers. The trade bypasses traditional
intermediaries, thus returning a larger proportion of the purchase price to
small farmers, directing capital to local development, and protecting the
environment with sustainable practices. However, the consequences of these fair
trade practices have not been studied. This project assesses the social and
environmental benefits of fair trade markets by comparing conventional and
alternative production of coffee and cocoa by peasant farmer cooperatives in
Chiapas, Mexico, and Beni, Bolivia. In making the assessment, the analysis
combines qualitative and quantitative field research at eight producer
cooperatives in these locations. The results provide information on the
consequences of economic globalization for small agricultural producers. They
also suggest how alternative trade arrangements can deal with those
consequences.
