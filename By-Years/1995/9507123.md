9507123 Sheppard The International Junior Investigator and Postdoctoral Fellows
Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four
months of research abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint
research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and
experimental conditions abroad. This award will support a twelve-month
postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Scott T. Sheppard to work with Dr. Ekkehard
Niemann at the Research Institute of Daimler Benz AG in Frankfurt, Germany. This
research project will develop silicon carbide (SiC) integrated circuit
technology for integration with SiC microsensors being developed at Daimler-
Benz. The general goal is a smart sensor technology, which is a combination of a
semiconductor microsensor (pressure, acceleration, deflection) and its
corresponding driving and readout circuit. The research will be done in three
steps: 1) Development and verification of new SPICE circuit models for SiC up to
500 degrees Celsius; 2) Implementation of new SPICE models to investigate
different types of amplifier circuits in SiC; and 3) Fabrication and
demonstration of a prototype IC amplifier suitable for integration with
microsensor tranducers and UV photodiodes. ***
