This research is concerned with developing systematic, formal techniques for
constructing VLSI systolic array architectures from machine independent
algorithm descriptions. Emphasis is on adaptive filtering and matrix algebra
algorithms since they are prevalent in modern signal processing. The research
focuses on three elements: (1) techniques for synthesizing array
interconnections and processing element operations based on the notion of
activity charts; (2) the development of efficient processing element
architectures examining the underlying kernel operations of the algorithms; and
(3) the exploration of VLSI realizations for these processing elements with an
emphasis on computation speed. The proposed research will extend and impact
scientific knowledge related to the construction of systolic arrays and DSP
(digital signal processing) architectures in several ways. Methods developed
will increase the understanding of formal design techniques and could be the
basis for a DSP systolic array compiler. Discovering the underlying rotational
framework of DSP algorithms and enhancing general understanding of these
algorithms is a potential outcome of this work. Finally, rapid computation of
elementary functions is of paramount importance to fast computers. This project
is developing VLSI architectures for fast rotation processors with
multiplication and division as a subset.
