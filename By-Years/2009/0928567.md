This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will promote understanding of
sediment dispersal in estuaries through an investigation of the Delaware River
estuary. Coordinated studies of water-column sediment flux, deposition, and
resuspension are planned and the PIs hope to establish the sediment trapping
efficiency of the estuary as a function of external forcings, including river
discharge, tides and wind. An array of instrumented moorings will be deployed to
obtain continuous time-series records of flow and suspended-sediment
concentration, and a suite of naturally occurring and anthropogenic
radionuclides measured seasonally. Specific objectives are: 1) to identify the
sources, transport pathways, and residence times of fine sediment based on
distributions of 7Be, 210Pb, and 137Cs; 2) to asses the role of channel
morphology on along- and across-estuary patterns of sediment transport and
deposition using in-situ observations of sediment flux; and 3) to elucidate the
mechanisms of sediment flux and trapping responsible for maintaining the estuary
turbidity maximum, and which transfer sediment from the axial channel to
subtidal flats.&lt;br/&gt;
