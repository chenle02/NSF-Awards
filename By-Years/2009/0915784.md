Proposal 0915784: Removing Inherent Instabilities in Communication Networks





Abstract

Since the late 60s, communication networks have experienced dramatic changes,
including: growth to unforeseen scales; operation under very dynamic and adverse
conditions; integration of storage and transfer of all media; ubiquitous
presence in all parts of our lives; etc. Going forward, these trends will
continue to increase and broaden, resulting in mounting stress on the existing
networks and, thus, growing emphasis on new network designs, often referred to
as the ?clean-slate architectures?.

Hence, in search of better designs, it is necessary to reexamine the existing
network design principles, especially those that are inherent to all networking
layers, such as the retransmission-based failure recovery. To this end, recent
work by the investigator discovers an entirely new networking phenomenon by
showing that retransmissions can cause long (-tailed) delays and instabilities
even if all traffic and network characteristics are light-tailed, e.g.
exponential or Gaussian. This finding is especially crucial for highly congested
multi-hop wireless networks that are characterized by frequent failures, e.g. ad
hoc and sensor networks. Since the retransmission-based failure recovery is at
the core of the existing networks, this new phenomenon sets the basis for many
more discoveries in this domain along the vertical (protocol stack), temporal
and spatial network dimensions. Furthermore, this research also investigates how
widely deployed fair resource sharing mechanisms come with a price since they
may be responsible for spreading the long-tailed delays to the entire network.
Finally, based on the critical study of the exiting protocols, the investigator
pursues careful redesign of network protocols that are shown to cause or spread
long delays and instabilities. The general focus is on designing algorithms that
are easy to implement, adaptive, scalable and provably near-optimal.
