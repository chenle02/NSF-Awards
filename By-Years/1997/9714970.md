Jimmie Doll from Brown University and David Freeman from University of Rhode
Island are supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry
Program to continue their research on the influence of adsorbate-adsorbate
interactions on the dynamics of interfacial hydrogen. Doll and Freeman have
developed a dynamical path integral theory for adsorbate vibrational lineshapes
and applied it to studies of Hydrogen adsorbed on various metal surfaces such as
Ni(111). Results using the embedded atom model have been used to elucidate
experimental results obtained from vibrational spectroscopy. The current
research program builds upon these results by improving upon the interaction
potentials through the use of ab initio electronic structure calculations. The
embedded cluster methods developed by Whitten and coworkers at North Carolina
State University will be employed to develop more realistic ab initio
interaction potentials for use in the dynamical path integral calculations.
Applications will include studies of Hydrogen on Ni(111), Ni(110), Cu(110) and
W(110) as well as delocalization of hydrogen adsorption on Ni, Cu and W
clusters. The calculations will be used to interpret experimental data obtained
by Peter Weber of Brown University. Hydrogen storage in metals and hydrogen
embrittlement are important technological problems. The fundamental work of Doll
and Freeman has a very good probability of providing significant theoretical
insights into a molecular based understanding of these phenomena.
