The mathematics department of Calvin College in conjunction with the
mathematics department of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, under the ILI-
LDD program is developing and maintaining a readily accessible depository for
mathematical software and related materials used in education at the two- and
four-year college and university levels.Computer programs serve several
important roles in education. They make possible visualization of mathematical
objects in a way inconceivable 30 years ago. They allow instructor and student
to generate examples quickly. They often serve as model exercises for students
to program, testing their knowledge of newly learned concepts. Many instructors
have taken advantage of this and have written software specifically to
illustrate or explore a mathematical concept. Several years ago, much of this
software was distributed through software exchanges, such as Kinko's, and the
user paid a modest fee. Internet has made distribution of software faster,
easier, and available world-wide.The Mathematics Archives, started by volunteer
efforts, are the only archives in the world totally dedicated to posting,
reviewing, and supporting software suitable for mathematics education at the
college and university level in a form that allows for downloading by anonymous
ftp. This project is expanding the services of the Archives to facilitate
locating and downloading software, reviews, Mathematica notebooks, and other
documents in electronic form. In addition, the Archive is being moved to a
dedicated site which will allow for quick expansion and maintenance of the
Archives.
