Transport of colloidal particles by phoretic mechanisms such as
diffusiophoresis, electrophoresis, and osmophoresis will be studied using both
experimental and theoretical methods. The experiments involve measurement of
particle migration by two separate phenomena: "diffusiophoresis," where a
concentration gradient of a simple electrolyte drives the motion of charged
colloids, and "ospmophoresis," where vesicles move in response to a gradient of
osmotic pressure in the surrounding fluid. The data will be used to test the
theoretical models which have been published and to show that these mechanisms
of colloidal transport are significant from an engineering, and perhaps
biological, point of view. Theoretical work is also anticipated for modeling the
influence of proximal boundaries and nearby particles on the diffusiophoretic or
electrophoretic velocity of a particle and for modeling the effects of non-
uniform surface properties on the phoretic response of particles. Attempts will
be made to develop models based on phoretic mechanisms for the locomotion (self-
propulsion using chemical energy) of biological cells.
