This project is to develop rate models of material behavior applicable to large
deformations such as occur in structures made of rubber. The objective is to
simultaneously model creep and relaxation at large deformations. An example
problem will be solved in order to evaluate the ramifications of simultaneously
considering large deformations and rate effects.
