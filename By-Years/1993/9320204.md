9320204 Crespi Taiwan is considered a classic example of a steady- state fold-
and-thrust belt in which accretion is balanced by erosions and is the basis for
current collision models. The possible presence of a syn-orogenic normal fault
therefore has more than local interest. This project will examine the Lishan
Fault which separates two belts of relatively low metamorphic (but distinctly
different) grade along the axis of the orogen. Thermal maturity of the wall
rocks will be used todetermine both fault geometry and offset. Results should
help understand the processes that contribute to the development of synorogenic
normal faults in overall compressional environments.
