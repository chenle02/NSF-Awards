This award will support collaborative research between Prof. Hugo Rossi of the
University of Utah and Prof. Allessandro Silva and Prof. Maria Welleda Baldoni-
Silva, both of the Universita Degli Studi Di Trento, in Italy. The investigators
intend to pursue work related to the representation theory of Lie groups, a
topic of considerable importance in modern day mathematics and in theoretical
physics. More specifically, previous work of Prof. Rossi and others led to
concrete representations of certain semi-simple Lie groups using generalizations
of holomorphic discrete series as singular representations. The collaborators
intend to extend these investigations to a much larger class of representations
involving discrete non-holomorphic series. The Italian researchers bring to the
collaboration expertise in analysis and geometry. On the U.S. side, Prof. Rossi
has been a leader in the discovery and investigation of the representation
theory of Lie groups. The subject is one that relates to many branches of
mathematics and physics, for example differential equations and elementary
particle physics. The investigators' approach should prove useful in increasing
our understanding of the connection between complex and harmonic analysis, the
geometry of complex manifolds, and the representation theory of Lie groups.
