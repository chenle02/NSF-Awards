Ambiguity is an inherent characteristic of natural language use. Many words,
for example, have multiple meanings, e.g., the word port can mean a wine, a
harbor, the left side of a ship, etc. Sentences can also have multiple
interpretations, e.g., who is doing the visiting in the sentence visiting
enemies can be dangerous? Despite such ambiguities in natural language, people
are able to understand one another reasonably well. How people decide among
alternative interpretations has been studied extensively and is now fairly well
understood. However, there is an additional type of ambiguity that remains
unexplored and is not well understood: the ambiguity between literal and
nonliteral interpretations of utterances. How do people choose among the several
possible interpretations of any utterance? Traditional theories of nonliteral
language use do not go beyond the notion that people will search for a
nonliteral interpretation whenever a literal interpretation does not make sense
in context. How this search is done remains a mystery. We plan to study how
people arrive at nonliteral interpretations in various contexts. We will focus
on three important types of nonliteral language: metaphor, irony and idioms. The
central question is, how do people combine the literal meanings of utterances
with the conversational context so that a speaker's intended meaning is
understood? The first step will be to determine the communicative functions of
these types of nonliteral language use. With respect to metaphors, for example,
why do speakers choose to use the metaphor form, such as my job is a jail
instead of the presumably simpler literal form, my job is like a jail? The uses
of metaphor, irony and idioms will be assessed by determining what people
understand and remember when various forms of communication are used.
Information transmission will be assessed, as well as connotations and
perceptions of speakers' intentions and attitudes. The second step will be to
identify the contextual cues that people use to understand utterances as literal
or nonliteral. We have already shown that people will arrive at nonliteral
interpretations even when literal interpretations do make sense, suggesting that
the standard literal-first theory is incomplete, at best. The overall goal of
the research program is to develop a more adequate description of how people
understand nonliteral language. This is a necessary component of the theory of
language use and comprehension. Such a theory, in turn, is necessary for
developing more effective educational methods and materials, and for developing
workable machine language recognition and comprehension devices.
