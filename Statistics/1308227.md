This research project aims to develop new statistical theory, methods and
computing algorithms to solve real world problems where the data present unique
features such as large volume, large variety and large velocity of change.
Traditional methods relying on parametric likelihood functions are no longer
feasible for high-dimensional longitudinal data. The PI and her students intend
to develop personalized classification strategies for subjects with high
heterogeneity variation, and propose to identify subgroups from longitudinal
observations through nonparametric random effects estimation. The proposed
research also intends to select and optimally combine high-dimensional moment
conditions to reduce the dimensionality of large numbers of moment conditions,
while retaining the important information from the data to achieve estimation
efficiency. In addition, a time-varying network model will be proposed to
address dynamic changes of network structures using flexible nonparametric
modeling. The proposal also seeks to develop highly efficient computational
algorithms for solving optimization problems which involve high-dimensional
parameter estimations and matrix operations. The proposed research project will
help to tackle fundamental questions in statistical science and will stimulate
interest from a large group of scientists in the fields of
longitudinal/correlated data analysis, classification, random effects modeling,
moment selection, low rank approximation, and time-varying networks for high-
dimensional correlated data.

The proposed research topics have many important applications in the biomedical
sciences, genomics, environmental sciences, and economics. For example, the
personalized classification method is applicable for personalized medicine,
where individuals with different biomarkers can receive different medical
interventions to get more effective treatment. The time-varying network model is
powerful for identifying time-evolving network associations for brain and
biological functions, social interaction, and environmental influence over time.
In addition, the moment selection method is applicable for panel data in
econometrics applications. The PI will integrate the proposed research areas
substantially into educational activities through development of new topic
courses. The research will also significantly advance undergraduate and graduate
students' learning and training.
