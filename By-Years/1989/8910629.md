The objective of this project is to carry out isotopic and trace element
studies of (1) FAMOUS area of Mid-Atlantic Ridge, (2) Gorda Ridge, Escanaba
Trough, and President Jackson Seamounts, and (3) Walvis Ridge, Rio Grande Rise
and Cameroon Line Seamounts. Principal focus is on FAMOUS area to try to
reconcile isotopic and trace element data evidence against a magma chamber with
the petrological evidence for one, and to compare trace element and isotopic
data with that from companion study being carried out on rocks from the East
Pacific Rise. %%% Much of our knowledge of magmatic diversity come from a
knowledge of the source rocks from which melts are derived, and the processes of
magmatic fractionation. This information comes largely from an understanding of
variations in trace element and isotopic composition of lavas exposed on the sea
floor. Dr. White has an excellent record for obtaining this type of data on
rocks collected from the sea floor. It is expected that this project will yield
important information on sea floor magmatic processes.
