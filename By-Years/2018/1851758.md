This research project studies social conflict and economic inequality. Economic
inequality often leads to social conflicts which in turn is destructive of the
economy. The relationship between economic inequality and social conflict is
complex; social conflict does not always rise with inequality. While economic
inequality increases the gain from conflict, it also increases the cost of such
conflict. It is not clear why inequality leads to social conflict and economic
destruction on one context and not another. This research project combines
insights from economics, psychology, and other social sciences to develop a
theory to explain the relationship between economic inequality and social
conflict. Several social and political conflicts (phenomena) can be explained
with this model. Understanding the forms social conflict can take is of
importance to academics as well as policy makers who may craft better policies
to mitigate the effects of such inequalities. By providing a robust explanation
of the sources of social conflicts and how to reduce them, this research project
will provide inputs into policies to reduce social conflicts and hence increase
economic growth and prosperity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
project extends the theory of socially dependent aspirations to the study of
economic inequality and social conflict. Social surroundings affect individual's
preferences through the setting of individual aspirations as the threshold
between achievement and failure. Individual's growth can be enhanced by
achieving their aspirations but may also be frustrated if the aspirations are
not achievable. Because aspirations are generated by social surroundings, this
leads to the interplay between the distributional character of economic
development and individual behavior. With relatively moderate inequality,
aspirations are achievable, and resources are expended to achieve them; when
inequality is high agents give up on achieving their economic aspirations and
turn to other components of their aspirations vector. The theoretical model can
explain why direct class conflict is a relatively rare phenomenon. This research
will apply this concept to the study of contemporary social conflicts and other
phenomena, such as racism and xenophobia. The results of this research project
will provide a better understanding of the sources of social conflicts and
provide inputs into policies to reduce them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
