Equipment for the study of organometallic vapor-phase epitaxy (OMVPE) of
several semiconductors, including gallium arsenide and cadmium telluride, on
such substrates as gallium arsenide or silicon, is being upgraded. The upgrade
consists of an OMPVE reactor with an ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) interface, and a new
manipulator for the existing UHV chamber. This will enable the study of surface
reactions of organometallic compounds on the crystal surfaces actually found in
the OMVPE process. The improved apparatus will be used to study surface
chemistry of II-VI compounds, heteroepitaxy of semiconductors, and OMVPE
reaction kinetics.//
