A homogeneous space is a geometric object that manifests a continuous family of
symmetries. Dynamics of flows on homogeneous spaces are related to many natural
problems in number theory and geometry. Traditionally, the homogeneous spaces of
interest in most studies have finite volume. However, it has recently been
discovered that the dynamics on homogeneous spaces of infinite volume also arise
in many natural problems such as Apollonian circle packings and in building
efficient networks. This proposal will investigate this rich topic.

The proposal deals with dynamics on infinite homogeneous spaces, which turns out
to yield quite a rich theory and has several deep and striking applications. The
proposed study involves new interactions between hyperbolic geometry, Kleinian
groups, ergodic theory, and number theory. Investigating this new territory
requires many new ideas both from geometry and dynamics, and opens up new
interactions between these fields.
