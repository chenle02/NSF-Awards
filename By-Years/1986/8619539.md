This proposal requests funds for the purchase of shared instrumentation for an
immunology group, consisting of nine faculty members, nine postdoctoral fellows,
eighteen predoctoral trainees, and eleven research assistants. The
instrumentation will be used for research on the cellular and molecular events
involved in the differentiation and activation of T and B cells. The approaches
will include the analysis of precursor cells, molecular mechanisms of receptor
gene rearrangement, the structural basis of receptor specificity and its
regulation, and the activation of lymphocytes.
