9311881 Henderson The purpose of this research is to analyze the impact of air
quality regulation between 1970 and 1987 on (1) urban location and productivity
for a variety of manufacturing industries, and on (2) air quality across
metropolitan areas and between central cities and suburbs. Equations for 1987
concerning location, employment growth, and productivity will be estimated
directly, based upon current and historical industrial environments and
regulation, accounting for issues of simultaneity, censoring, and selectivity.
While regulation in non-attainment areas may have resulted in a reallocation of
industrial activity across metropolitan areas, with corresponding productivity
gains and losses, improved environmental quality in non-attainment areas has
positive impact for industry through lower wages. Hedonic wage functions
capturing the link between air quality and wages will be estimated, accounting
for issues of simultaneity and joint wage-land rent determination. This project
is important because it will shed new light on the economic effects and impact
on urban air quality of air pollution regulations. ***
