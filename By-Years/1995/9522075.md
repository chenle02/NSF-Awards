ABSTRACT 9522075 This work focuses on the coupling between the thermodynamic
cycle of a reciprocating kinematic engine and its mechanism section using the
newly-available techniques of finite time thermodynamics. The goal is a global
understanding of the entire thermodynamic process and its limitations, rather
than a detailed geometry-specific description of the performance of the engine.
