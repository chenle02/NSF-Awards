The University of Alabama @ Huntsville will initiate a three-week, residential
Young Scholars project in Engineering which will offer science enrichment
activities for 30 precollege students entering grades 10 and 11. The program is
entitled "Adventures in Engineering" and will offer a broad exposure to
electrical, civil and chemical/mechanical engineering. The first two weeks
consist of career exploration activities, engineering ethics, the engineering
method, intensive coverage of course material (normally taught at the college
sophomore level) and a variety of hands-on laboratory experiences. The third
week consists of additional career opportunity exploration, industrial tours and
an intensive engineering design experience in one of the three stressed areas of
engineering, culminating in an oral presentation by each student on his design.
