This research will explore the degree to which the basic cognitive functions of
memory and categorization are adapted to the structure of the environment. It is
based on the hypotheses that human memory functions to make most available that
information which is most likely to be needed in the current context and that we
form categories of objects to maximize our ability to make predictions about new
objects. In the case of memory, the research will explore how the need for
information varies with the pattern of past use of that information and the cues
available in the environment. The environments to be explored will be both
linguistic environments such as newspapers and biological environments as
recorded in animal counts. Experiments will determine whether availability of
information in memory varies in the same way as need for that information varies
in the environment. In the case of categorization, the research will explore how
features cluster across objects in our environment. The environments to be
explored will be various data sets that have been gathered in the machine
learning research on categorization. Experiments will determine if human
predictions of object features show sensitivity to the same variables that are
predictive in these environments. The theory to be developed will tie the two
domains of memory and categorization together as two manifestations of
cognition's effort to come up with accurate models of its environment. This
research, with its adaptive focus, should allow us to better understanding
function and disfunction of human memory.
