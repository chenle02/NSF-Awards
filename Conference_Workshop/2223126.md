The 2022-2024 BLAST conferences will be the 12th through 14th in a series of
yearly international meetings devoted to the foundations of mathematics, with
the BLAST 2022 meeting being held from August 8 to 12 at Chapman University in
Orange, California. The BLAST conference series features talks and tutorials on
current advances in foundations, with focus on Boolean algebra, lattice theory,
algebraic logic, general algebra, set theory, and set-theoretic topology. The
University of North Carolina will host the 2023 meeting and the University of
North Texas will host the 2024 meeting.

The BLAST conferences are a forum for mathematicians interested in the
foundations of mathematics to disseminate their latest results, to collaborate
and exchange ideas from different areas, and to develop new lines of research.
BLAST provides an opportunity for graduate students and young researchers to
learn about new developments in several related areas of the foundations of
mathematics, to interact with leading national and international researchers,
and to showcase their own work. This grant will support the participation of
speakers, graduate students, and recent Ph.D. recipients in the three 2022-2024
meetings. Participation of members of groups underrepresented in mathematics is
actively sought and encouraged.
