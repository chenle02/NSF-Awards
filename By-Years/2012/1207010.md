In this project, techniques will be developed and tested to analyze data from
advanced gravitational wave (GW) detectors including the Laser Interferometric
Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) to search for GWs from astrophysical
objects. There are two main targets of this project: rapidly rotating neutron
stars (extremely dense objects more massive than the Sun and the size of a city,
spinning tens to hundreds of times every second), and binary systems of black
holes and/or neutron stars in the last seconds of the breakdown of their orbits
due to GW emission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gravitational waves (GWs), distortions
of the geometry and space and time predicted by Einstein's General Theory of
Relativity, provide a new window on the universe, allowing us to supplement the
range of information available from different parts of the electromagnetic
spectrum and from cosmic ray and neutrino observations. A modern generation of
detectors including LIGO has been built and recently completed several years of
observations which have resulted in limits on the strength and frequency of GW
signals. These detectors are currently being upgraded to their advanced
configuration, with an increased sensitivity which should provide the first
direct GW detection in the near future. This project will involve faculty and
students of the Rochester Institute of Technology in laying the groundwork for
that first detection and the resulting groundbreaking expansion of our knowledge
of the universe. In addition to the search for GWs, visualizations will be
produced of gravitational-wave propagation and detection which will aid the
general public's understanding of the science done by LIGO.
