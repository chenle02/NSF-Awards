The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project focuses on
developing tools for the biomedical research community, in particular the
discovery of proteins that are altered during the normal or abnormal functioning
of cells, tissues and organisms. The term for this protein discovery field is
proteomics. Hundreds of thousands of proteomics samples are analyzed around the
world annually. These innovations will significantly benefit the biomedical
research community. These tools will allow scientists to understand complex
processes such as how the microbiome affects behavior, how development is
affected by genetic mutations, and how cancer cells change their behavior upon
chemotherapy. The number of questions these tools can help address is limitless.
All major research institutions have proteomics facilities that serve dozens to
hundreds of researchers. These tools will be used both by individual research
labs and proteomics core facilities, as well as contract research facilities and
pharma companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project addresses
technological needs in the field of proteomics. A very large fraction of
proteomics samples involve separating complex mixtures of different proteins
into individual protein species by a process called gel electrophoresis, where
electric currents are used to separate proteins by size and charge in thin slabs
of gel material. This work concentrates on two key unmet needs. First is
improving the detection sensitivity of proteins within electrophoresis gels.
Convention detection instruments can detect proteins over a 1,000-fold
concentration range, but proteins normally exist in cells over a million-fold
range. The device developed here is capable of detecting proteins over a
million-fold concentration range. The next unmet need is to efficiently transfer
proteins from gels to a mass spectrometer, which is used to chemically
characterize proteins. The method under development here will greatly increase
the throughput of this process.
