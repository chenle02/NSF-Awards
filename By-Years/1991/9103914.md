Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will be concerned with the
mathematical structure of conformal quantum field theories, and with topological
aspects of quantum chromodynamics. The work on conformal theories will help us
to achieve an understanding of the force of gravity. That on quantum
chromodynamics (which is the theory of the nuclear force) will shed light on
phenomena where the nuclear force is very strong.
