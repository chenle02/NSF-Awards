An award is made to Grinnell College to support biology research and education
with a major research instrument for diverse studies of physiology. The
instrument, the LI-6400XT, will have an immediate impact on active research by
faculty and their advanced undergraduate students, and it well help biology
students in several courses learn by research, the most effective kind of
science education. Grinnell College has a deep commitment to providing quality
science education and research training to all students, including those
traditionally underrepresented in the sciences. This instrument will support
Grinnell's commitment, beginning with the incoming-student lab experiences of
the nationally recognized Grinnell Science Project, and weaving through every
level of our biology curriculum. This research instrument will enrich student
learning, facilitating authentic research experiences that generate high-quality
outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Representing the foremost technology available
for real-time analysis of photosynthesis (i.e., carbon dioxide uptake) and
respiration (i.e., carbon dioxide output), the LI-6400XT will find immediate use
in research projects in plant physiology, plant ecology, fungal biology, and
biogeochemistry. Portable, flexible, and allowing control of light, temperature,
and humidity, the instrument enables measurements in a wide range of living
systems and settings, from prokaryotes and fungi, to plants, animals, and soils;
and from laboratories to remote field sites. The multiple functions of the
LI-6400XT will provide new means to investigate significant questions about what
controls: (1) plant acclimation to temperature stress; (2) plant adaptation to
drought; (3) decomposition by prokaryotes and fungi in drylands; and (4) how the
carbon cycle operates in river floodplains.
