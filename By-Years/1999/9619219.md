9619219 The goal of the project is to advance the state of the art in static
analysis of programs that perform destructive updating on heap-allocated
storage. The work will address problems that can be looked at --- depending on
one's point of view --- as pointer- analysis problems, alias-analysis problems,
sharing-analysis problems, storage-analysis problems (also known as shape-
analysis problems), or type-checking problems. The information obtained is
useful for generating efficient sequential and parallel code. It is also useful
in certain kinds of software-engineering tools. The project aims to make
contributions in the following areas: (1) Develop further the theoretical
foundations of shape abstractions and their use in abstract interpretation. (2)
Develop a tool for creating a shape-analysis algorithm from a specification of a
shape abstraction. (3) Extend the range of applications for shape-analysis
techniques, for example, by (i) generalizing them so that questions can be
answered of the form "Can accesses through the structure that x points to at
program point p ever reach any of the elements of the structure that y points to
at program point q?", and (ii) combining shape-analysis with array-subscript
analysis. (4) Create, experiment with, and evaluate shape-analysis
implementations. ***
