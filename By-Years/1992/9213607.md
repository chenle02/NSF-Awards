Partial support is provided to assist in travel expenses for American
participants in an international symposium. The symposium is: "Eddy Structure
Identification in Free Turbulent Shear Flows", to be held October 12-14, 1992 in
Poitiers, France. An additional limited number of participants, primarily
younger researchers, will be able to participate in this conference devoted to a
central issue in turbulence research: the identification and tracking of
organized, coherent structures in turbulent flows. Advances in the ability to
identify and characterize these structures is an essential element in developing
better predictive methods for turbulent flows, which arise in a wide range of
applications in engineering systems.
