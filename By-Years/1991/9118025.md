This research is to continue gravity monitoring as part of an earthquake
hazards program in the Beijing region of China. Gravity is monitored by means of
eight Geodynamics TRG-1 tidal gravimeters installed at semi-permanent sites, and
at a number of stations visited periodically with three LaCoste-Romberg Model G
gravimeters. The monitoring program was begun in 1981 as part of the U.S./PRC
Protocol on Earthquake Studies and has continued to the present, thus forming a
valuable continuous record exceeding ten years. Gravity is related to elevation
changes and subcrustal mass movements that have been proposed to be a part of
the process of preparation for earthquakes. This region surrounding Beijing is
designated by the PRC earthquake hazard program as one of high probability for
the next major earthquake in China. This research is a component of the National
Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program and the U.S./PRC Earthquake Studies
Protocol.
