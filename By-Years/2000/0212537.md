All habitats rely on the bacterial fixation of atmospheric nitrogen or on the
synthetic production of nitrogen fertilizers for providing a supply of fixed
nitrogen. Some plants have established symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria,
and therefore can obtain much of their nitrogen from the atmosphere. One prime
example of this relationship is the alfalfa/Sinorhizobium meliloti
symbiosis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is increasingly evident that
exopolysaccharides produced by S. meliloti play specific roles in the
development of the root nodule symbiosis between the bacteria and legumes,
particularly at the level of nodule invasion. The structural specificity and the
small amounts of exogenous exopolysaccharide necessary to successfully rescue
the invasion deficiency of S. meliloti exopolysaccharide mutants, suggest that
low molecular weight exopolysaccharides act as signaling molecules during the
invasion process. This work aims to understand the signaling mechanisms that
lead to the plant's response to exopolysaccharides, and the identification and
characterization of the putative plant receptors that detect or recognize the
presence of the exopolysaccharide signals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The answers to
these and related questions will lead to a greater understanding of the
signaling mechanisms between symbiotic partners and may also provide insights
into the possible uses of oligosaccharides as signaling molecules in other
biological systems.&lt;br/&gt;
