This research is directed toward the development of cell permeable
metallochromic indicators for free magnesium ion. Preliminary data suggest that
tropolone derivatives possess both the necessary selectivity for magnesium and
against other ions and adequate absorbance spectra for this use. Current goals
are to synthesize additional derivatives of the tropolone compounds already
prepared to enhance their absorbance and binding properties. Potential magnesium
sensitive dyes will be tested in three cell systems chosen because of their
specific magnesium-related properties: (1) Ehrlich ascites cells, for which the
intracellular free magnesium concentration has been determined, (2) Murine S49
lymphoma cells which have a hormone-sensitive magnesium influx (but not efflux)
system, and thus exhibit a hormone- sensitive change in cell magnesium content,
and (3) synchronized cultures of Schizosaccharomyces pombe which exhibit a 5 to
10-fold change in total cell magnesium content over a short, specific period in
the cell cycle. Magnesium ion activates or inhibits a numer of important enzyme
systems, and magnesium transport appears to be regulated by a variety of
hormones. Detailed studies of the possible role of free intracellular magnesium
in regulation of cellular functions have been severely hampered, however, by the
lack of a relatively simple, easily applied method to determine the free
intracellular magnesium ion concentration on a physiologically relevant time
scale. This research, if successful, will provide much needed probes for studies
of the role of magnesium ion in cellular physiology.
