The Committee on Geological and Geotechnical Engineering (COGGE) is the focal
point within the Board on Earth Sciences and Resources at the National Academies
for scientific, technical, and public-policy issues pertaining to the
engineering applications of Earth Sciences. The committee's scope encompasses
Earth processes and materials, including the mechanics of rock and soil, and
focuses on safe and responsible human development, risk assessment, and
mitigation of natural anthropogenic hazards. The committee organizes and
oversees studies: 1) to identify, investigate, and report on questions relating
to geological and geotechnical engineering to government, industry, academia,
and the public; 2) to provide scientific and technical information to inform
public policy on geological and geotechnical engineering issues; 3) to identify
new technologies and potential applications; and, 4) to promote the acquisition
and dissemination of knowledge. In addition, the committee provides a forum for
discussion among academic and professional groups, government agencies, and
private industry to enhance national and international cooperation and exchange
of information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COGGE is the only intellectual organization
within the Washington, DC area dedicated to increasing awareness of the
importance of geological and geotechnical engineering in addressing societal
needs, and to developing and overseeing unbiased, peer reviewed consensus
studies conducted by ad hoc committees of the National Academies of Sciences,
Engineering, and Medicine on topics relevant to the geological and geotechnical
engineering communities. Through public meetings, webinars, and those consensus
studies, COGGE (1) enhances research and education infrastructure by identifying
strategies for collaboration among geotechnical and other and other engineering
and scientific communities (including the social sciences); (2) promotes
capacity building through interaction with academics, researchers,
practitioners, and policymakers; (3) improves scientific and technological
understanding through reviewed reports for broad dissemination; (4) benefits
society by providing the best science and engineering information to COGGE
sponsors, the broader geotechnical engineering community, decision makers in the
private and public sectors, and the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
