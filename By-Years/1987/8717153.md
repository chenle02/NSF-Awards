The main purpose of this travel grant is to attend the Pacific Conference on
Earthquake Engineering in New Zealand and present a paper on "Confined Concrete
Columns." The paper is the result of the research conducted with the support of
the National science Foundation. In addition, the trip will provide the
opportunity to interact with researchers in the Pacific region who would usually
not attend meetings in this country. Visits are planned to universities which
have produced high quality research work in the field. These are the University
of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand and the University of New South Wales
in Australia. Visits will be made to Professors R Park and T. Paulay in
Christchurch and Professor V. Rangan in Australia.
