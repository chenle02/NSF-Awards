Professor Harry Tom of the University of California Riverside is supported by
the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to use terahertz spectroscopy to
study hydrogen bonded liquids and the solid/liquid interface. Time-domain
terahertz spectroscopy will be improved by extending the range to as low as
0.002 THz using instrumental and data analysis advances. Secondly the low
frequency features will be analyzed using memory kernal formalism to extract
collective molecular orientation, angular velocity, and potentially also cross-
coupling strengths. These methods will be used to study ionic solutions as well
as solutions of increasingly complex molecules leading up to biomolecules such
as DNA. Lastly, THz pump and time-resolved second harmonic generation will be
developed for the study of solid/liquid interfaces (namely, phenol derivatives
adsorbed at the water/silica interface). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terahertz
spectroscopy has only recently come on the scene as a new method for probing
very low frequency motions, and this new information promises to be of
importance in understanding condensed liquids, interfaces, as well as biological
media.
