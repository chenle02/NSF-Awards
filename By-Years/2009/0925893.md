The goal of this project is to conduct robust scientific analysis of large
amounts of incoherent scatter radar (ISR) observations of the terrestrial
ionosphere within the framework of a new educational curriculum for
undergraduate and graduate students. The ISR data, which have been acquired from
multiple facilities over the past several decades, are historically under-
utilized, and this project addresses several targeted areas of upper atmospheric
research to be pursued by students under the mentorship of the principal
investigator. These research topics - assessment of long term trends, response
to changes in solar activity, and characterizing the midnight temperature
maximum - represent long-standing areas of significant importance to geospace
science goals. The project will focus on specific research questions within
these areas, which are both well suited for individual student projects as well
as scientifically justified based on pilot studies and a thorough consideration
of existing literature.
