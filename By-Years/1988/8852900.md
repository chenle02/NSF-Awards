A state-of-the-art atomic absorption spectrophotometer is being incorporated
into several chemistry courses. It is being used in an instrumental analysis
course, an inorganic course, a physical chemistry course, and for student
research. Students are getting hands-on experience in the operation of the AA,
which employs microprocessor controlled operation and a self-contained
microcomputer. Data is displayed on a CRT and can be printed or plotted if
desired. Students from local high schools also spend a day at the university
working with the instruments and observing. One of the projects of interest to
the students is the investigation of the concentration of metals in the
groundwater of Humphreys County, Tennessee. The grantee is matching the award
from non-Federal sources.
