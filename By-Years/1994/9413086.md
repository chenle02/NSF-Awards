9413086 Malmborg Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) has teamed with Digital
Equipment Corporation, Martin Marrietta, Shuttleworth, and Thomson Publishing to
enhance an existing master's program in Manufacturing Systems Engineering. The
project will develop a software-based teaching factory emulation facility using
manufacturing experts and RPI faculty, create a case library of actual industry
problems, and have students work in project teams for laboratory and case
projects. RPI is a pioneer in linking management, engineering, and industry to
work on manufacturing problems.
