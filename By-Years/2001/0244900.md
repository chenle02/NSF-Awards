The proposed research involves various topics that are at the cutting edge of
the fields of string/M-theory, field theory and cosmology. The focus is on
cosmological consequences of string theories. Investigations will be made on
Ekpyrotic cosmology in the Horava-Witten theory. Models of string cosmology such
as the Godel universe of M-theory as well as addressing the problem of the
impossibility of realizing de Sitter space in string theory will be
investigated. The decay of space-time as a result of tachyon condensation will
also be investigated. Based on my recent discovery that universality classes of
Fermi liquids are classified by K-theory, which is reminiscent of D-branes, I
intend to analyze nonrelativistic aspects of string theory.
