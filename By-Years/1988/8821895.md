The Duke University Marine Laboratory will acquire several items of
oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared use equipment.
This equipment is maintained for use on or in association with the R/V CAPE
HATTERAS, a research vessel owned by the NSF and operated by Duke University. A
substantial part of the ship's operating schedule during 1989 is in support of
NSF-sponsored research projects. The instrumentation will also increase the
capabilities of the ship and of the institution to support research and
engineering activities. The instrumentation includes: -Box corer for collecting
undisturbed sediment samples from the seafloor, -Computer and other hardware
upgrades for the SAIL shipboard data logging system, -Spectrophometer for
measuring light levels and other optical properties in the water column,
-Optical disk drive system and for increasing shared-use computing capabilities
at sea, -Parts for a Conductivity, Temperature and Depth profiling device,
-Enhancements to the single-channel digital seismic system, -Radio Direction
Finder Antenna for locating floating instrumentation at sea. The instrumentation
described above will increase the capability of the organization to support NSF-
sponsored research and engineering projects.
