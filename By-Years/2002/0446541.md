EAR-0446541&lt;br/&gt;Chamberlain&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stanford and the U.S.
Geological Survey jointly operate an ion microprobe laboratory located at
Stanford University. This facility serves as a key component of the earth
science community efforts in geochronology because of its unique ability to
determine radiometric ages at a high spatial resolution. Conventional U-Th-Pb
and U-Th geochronology of zircon, monazite and sphene have been core research
activities in the laboratory. We will continue to try to meet the growing demand
for ion probe geochronology from our colleagues at Stanford, USGS and in the
external research community. To meet user demand within our department and from
visiting NSF-funded users, we will use the funds from this NSF grant to fund
three years of 50% salary support for a Ph.D. level research scientist. The
School of Earth Sciences and Department of Geological and Environmental Sciences
have agreed to cost share this proposal (50%) to provide a competitive salary
for a qualified technical person. This proposal represents Phase I of the
technical support position at Stanford. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
