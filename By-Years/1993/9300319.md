The objective of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates program in
Environmental Science and Engineering at Florida International University is to
stimulate and promote interest, curiosity, creative and critical thinking of
undergraduate students in environmental science and engineering during their
early ears in the undergraduate program. This work will involve the students in
a comprehensive research program relative to movement and dispersion of
contaminants and treatment of contaminated media to minimize potential damage to
the environment. This research program will engage students in different areas
of research relative to movement and treatment of contaminants. The research
will be conducted in the following areas: environmental sciences (environmental
biology, environmental physics, and environmental chemistry; environmental
engineering (environmental modeling and process design); environmental ethics.
