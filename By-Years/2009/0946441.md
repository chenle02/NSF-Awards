This proposal will be awarded using funds made available by the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).

This project will operate a small experimental GPU cluster configured for
application physicists and applied mathematicians working in Lattice Field
Theory (LFT) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The research goal is to
develop new algorithms and programming strategies to fully realize the potential
of emerging many-core technologies,as well as to implement these algorithms in
production application codes on Graphical Processing Units. With Nvidias CUDA
framework and the widely-supported OpenCL standard, such architectures appear
eminently suited for parallel scientific applications. The project will focus on
rethinking the underlying algorithms to properly map them to the hardware, with
an emphasis on employing many GPUs in parallel.
