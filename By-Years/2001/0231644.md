The proposed project is designed to develop and test a model to build evaluation
capacity in agencies, organizations and programs focused on increasing the
diversity of the STEM workforce. Specifically project goals are to improve the
funding agency's ability to assess the effectiveness of their efforts, to
identify effective innovations, to develop a replicable model to facilitate
capacity building and to disseminate the model widely. Objectives are focused on
strengthening/improving the data collection process and testing the resulting
model in several agencies (NSF, NIH, GE Foundation) that fund efforts to
increase the diversity of the STEM workforce. Activities include document
review, the development of an evaluation template and preparation of technical
manuals to guide agency efforts.
