This is a unit of DOE/NSF/USDA Collaborative Research in Plant Biology Program.
The research training group focuses its research theme on molecular evolution of
plants. The long-range goal of the program is to encourage greater interaction
and cooperation among faculty members in plant molecular genetics, population
genetics, systematics, plant anatomy, and evolutionary biology, and to develop
plant biologists who have the capacity to conceive, design and implement
research that integrates the concepts and techniques of multiple facets of plant
molecular evolution. The program involves faculty members, postdocs, graduate
students and undergraduate students. The group will focus their research efforts
on studies of: (1) genome evolution: the genetic architecture of plant genomes,
(2) genome genealogies within and among plant species, and (3) evolutionary
interpretation of plant structure and genome organization.
