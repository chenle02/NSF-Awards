9612136 Accurate prediction of ground movements due to tunnels and deep
excavations is not only an important part in the design of lateral earth
retention systems, but is also essential for estimating the risk of damage to
surrounding facilities. Deformation prediction is an integral part of the
design-construction process, and provides a framework for interpretation of
instrumentation measurements during construction and for extrapolating limited
measurements made at early construction stages to assess the impact of
construction activities. This research project is directed toward improving the
quality of numerical predictions of ground movements and structural requirements
associated with deep excavations and tunneling in soils, and to further develop
the use of numerical analysis as a design tool. A new advanced effective stress
constitutive model will be implemented which unifies the modeling of clays,
sands and silts into a finite element code able to perform coupled flow and soil
deformation analysis. A fundamental but "realistic" evaluation of major factors
controlling the performance of deep excavations and tunnel will be completed.
The capabilities of the model will be validated through comparison with
performance using a well documented study of a tunnel and cut-and-cover section
in San Francisco Bay mud, a process which will include a) extensive field
instrumentation, b) complete characterization of the soil profile, and c) a well
documented history of the construction sequence and relevant events which occur
during the project. ***
