9224795 Hayden The purpose of this work is to prepare and study photorefractive
polymeric waveguides. Photoconducting properties such as, carrier drift mobility
and generation efficiency, will be determined through time of flight and
xerographic studies. Dielectric relaxation studies will be performed and
recombination coefficients will also be determined. Two beam coupling, a clear
indicator of the photorefractive effect, will be studied in novel guided wave
structures. ***
