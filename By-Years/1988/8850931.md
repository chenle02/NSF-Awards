This two-year project seeks to improve the teaching of Advanced Placement
Calculus in high school. Each summer, 16 teachers will participate in a four-
week workshop on the BC Calculus syllabus that includes review of mathematics
content, discussion of teaching strategies, and exploration of the role of
computers and calculators in the teaching of calculus. The workshop will be
jointly taught by an Albion College faculty member and an outstanding high
school mathematics teacher. Follow-up activities include visits by project staff
to participants'schools. A total of 32 teachers from Michigan and surrounding
states will participate in the project. In addition to contributions from the
participants'school systems, Albion College is contributing an amount equal to
7% of the NSF award.
