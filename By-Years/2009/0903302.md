The project develops several web-based and several traditional instructors'
manuals in the course areas of industrial safety, precision measurement,
computer-aided design, fluid systems, introduction to thermal/electrical
principles, introduction to computer integrated manufacturing (CIM), materials
and processes, and quality control concepts. These courses are part of the core
requirements for the new associate degree in applied technology. The manuals
strengthen the program by providing teaching uniformity which is of special
benefit to adjuncts teaching these courses. Adding the on-line component
strengthens outreach and is especially beneficial to incumbent workers.
