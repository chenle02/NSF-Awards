This research is to study the Andean foreland of northwestern Argentina by
means of reprocessing and interpretation of reflection seismic data collected by
the State Oil Company (YPF) of Argentina. The reprocessing will improve the
quality of the reflection data at depths below those of primary interest in
routine industry work. These results will be combined with earthquake studies
done using a portable seismic network installed for 9 months by Memphis State
University. The study is currently in a compressional regime that has
reactivated preexisting faults formed in extension. The combination of the two
data sets will bear on the understanding of tectonics of the Andean foreland,
mountain building and earthquake hazard of the region. This research is a
component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
