Wisconsin Semantic Disks (WISE)

Abstract

In the Wisconsin Semantic disks project (WiSe Disks), we will develop the core
technology required to build semantically smart disk systems. Semantically smart
disk systems will impact storage systems and information technology in two
fundamental ways. First, by developing their storage innovations within a
semantically smart disk, researchers will readily transfer next-generation
storage technology into industry. Second, by deploying semantically smart disks,
industry will compete on enhanced functionality within their storage products,
and not simply cost-per-byte and performance.

Within this proposal, we focus on three core areas of research in semantically
smart disk systems. First, we will develop the fundamental software technology
required to automate information discovery within a smart disk. Second, we will
study the hardware support that is required. Third, we will demonstrate via case
study the power of placing semantic intelligence within a disk system, by
increasing the availability, security, and performance of storage beyond
traditional approaches.

As storage becomes more central to the lives of everyday people, in the form of
their digital photographs, home movies, and digital music, it becomes
increasingly important to improve the availability, security, and performance of
storage. For years, researchers in file systems have created new technologies,
and yet many of these ideas have not been deployed in the real world.
Semantically smart storage technology enables the widespread deployment of these
innovations, thus allowing the everyday storage user to directly benefit from
the wealth of previous and on-going storage systems research.
