Lo The problem of mapping parallel algorithms to parallel architectures involves
the assignment of tasks in the parallel computation to processors and the
routing of messages through the interconnection network. This research utilizes
information about the regularity present in both the computation and the
interconnection network for efficient mapping. It focuses on the design,
implementation, and testing of mapping algorithms for three target
architectures: the mesh, hypercube, and deBruijn network. In addition, it
develops a graph description language and an underlying graph theoretic model to
support mapping. The model captures information about the static and temporal
structure of the computation, while the language enables the user to express
this information in a natural and compact notation. This research represents a
step in the evolution toward automatic mapping. It paves the way for the
compiler to play an increasing important role as a source of information for the
mapper.
