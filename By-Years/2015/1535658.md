This project will develop foundations for novel design of low-power and high-
resolution image sensors, beyond the state-of-the-art. The potential outcome of
this research is two orders of magnitude power reduction and ability to achieve
real-time image reconstruction. The research activities have the potential to
make significant impact on number of different industries. Image sensors have
been used in extremely wide range of applications to directly enhance the
quality of human life, including communication, entertainment, security, medical
diagnosis and many others. The PI's will involve a number of graduate and
undergraduate students from under-represented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will systematically investigate the optimal designs of all major blocks
used in image sensors. The project aims to develop novel design ideas for
compressive sensing, resulting in potential order-of-magnitude improvements in
trade-offs between energy use and performance. The research will be conducted
within the I/UCRC Center for Embedded Systems and the project has Center's
strong support, and active participation from its member companies, which will
pave the way for the transition of the project outcomes into commercial products
that will benefit society at large.
