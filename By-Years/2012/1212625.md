With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division
of Chemistry, Professor Patrick Limbach and his group at University of
Cincinnati are developing instrumental approaches based on mass spectrometry for
the identification, sequencing and analysis of an important class of
biomolecules, namely transfer ribonucleic acids (tRNAs). Because tRNAs are
involved in the fundamental process of protein translation, it is important that
new tools and approaches be developed that enable the sensitive and accurate
determination of tRNA population and extent of modifications to the original
tRNA sequence. This research will significantly advance the field of tRNA
characterization by establishing the techniques required for multiplexed
characterizations of tRNA populations. The advantage of multiplexed
characterization is that significantly more information on tRNA identity and
sequence modification can be obtained in a shorter time period and from less
sample, as compared to current methods that analyze one tRNA at a time.

This research project is multidisciplinary, involving the areas of chemistry,
biochemistry and molecular biology, thus undergraduates and graduate students
working on this project will gain key instruction and insights into the field of
modern biological mass spectrometry. These activities continue a long-standing
emphasis of Professor Limbach on expanding the number of engaged
underrepresented minorities in science, in general, and mass spectrometry, in
particular.
