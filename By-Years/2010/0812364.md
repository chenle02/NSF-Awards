This project will develop new approaches for recovering the three-dimensional
(3D) shape and pose of the human body in images and video sequences. The methods
will use a detailed 3D body model learned from laser range scans of over 2000
people. The approach will model the shape variation across people as well as the
non-rigid shape variation due to changes in pose. The project will develop and
test methods for robustly recovering the body shape in surveillance video
sequences, in scenes with strong lighting, from collections of snapshots and in
unconstrained television/film sequences. The recovered body model will be used
to produce a variety of biometric measurements.

The majority of images and video sequences are of humans and recognizing people
and their actions is a core problem in computer vision. The problem is
challenging however because the human body is a complex, non-rigid, and
articulated structure that can vary dramatically in pose, shape and appearance.
Current methods focus on estimating human pose and typically ignore the problem
of human shape estimation. This project will treat these problems together
resulting in more robust solutions which will have a wide ranging impact in
multiple disciplines. Human pose estimation is currently used in areas such as
gait analysis, special effects, game development, human factors, and sports
training to name a few. Robust video-based systems like the one developed here
will extend the range of applications to home entertainment, elder care,
autonomous vehicles and animal movement analysis. By extending previous methods
to also estimate the three-dimensional shape of the human body in images and
video sequences this project will enable additional applications in video
forensics, surveillance, preventative medicine and special effects. More
generally, methods like those developed here, that robustly recover the shape
and pose of people in complex images and video streams, will be applicable to a
wider range of problems in object recognition and tracking.
