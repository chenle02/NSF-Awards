This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at the University of California at Berkeley acquire an
upgrade of a 250 MHz NMR spectrometer which will be used in research
investigations in the following areas of chemistry: 1) studies in the shikimate-
chorismate pathway, 2) design and synthesis of peptide mimics, 3) the chemical
enzymatic synthesis of natural products and cell-surface glycoconjugates, 4)
total synthesis of natural products and the development of organic synthesis
methodology and 5) catalytic antibodies. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
Spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to the chemist for the
elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to
study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out
frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in areas such
as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
