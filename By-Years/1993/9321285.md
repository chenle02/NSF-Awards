9321285 Wolf Wolf will continue his research on Lie groups, harmonic analysis
and representation theory, with applications to complex analysis, riemannian
geometry, numerical analysis and control theory. He will continue his work on
infinite dimensional Lie groups that are direct limits of finite dimensional
groups, and will investigate questions in control theory that are essentially
questions of representation theory. The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of
the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in
twentieth century mathematics. As the mathematical vehicle for exploiting the
symmetries inherent in a system, the representation theory of Lie groups has had
a profound impact upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number
theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum mechanics and
elementary particle physics. ***
