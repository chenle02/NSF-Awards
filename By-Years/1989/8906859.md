An integrated gas chromatography/mass spectrometer system is being acquired.
This will be used to assist research in tribology, kinetics, and catalysis. Some
specific areas under study include lubricant degradation, oxidstion of hazardous
wastes in supercritical water, reactions on bimetallic catalysts, and reactions
in microgravity. //
