This proposal envisions a model partner-based system that provides lead teachers
both school-based workshops and a summer institute for science content. The
model has three components: a science pedagogy part provided by science
education faculty, a science content component provided by active research
scientists and a classroom teaching component.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific
goals are to deepen teachers understanding of content, scientific inquiry and
pedagogy, including curriculum and assessment strategies; to develop a group of
sixty teacher leaders and to provide teachers access to effective applications
of educational technology.&lt;br/&gt;
