The project will examine the spin-averaged flux integrated flux and the phase
space density of energetic electrons in Earth's radiation belts. Data from GOES
satellites along with data from Los Alamos satellites will be used. The project
will remove the variations associated with the first adiabatic invarient in
order to exmine the variations that are associated with the particle bound
motion and the drift motion. The data come from a full solar cycle of
observations by the GOES and LANL saltellites and will examine the climatology
of the variation in the radiation belts.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project will
generate a multi-satellite data set of adiabatically-scaled particle fluxes over
an entire solar cycle, and that database will be made available to the
scientific community. The project has the potential to be very useful for space
weather specifications and predictions of radiation belt fluxes during magnetic
storms.
