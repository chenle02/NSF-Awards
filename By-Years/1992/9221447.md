Internet communication will benefit the LMF Medical Library, the NMR research
group and the photomedicine group. The Library which supports 300 physicians,
will benefit from electronic interlibrary loans, access to on line catalogues,
and email. The NMR and photomedicine group will use the connection for transfer
of image clusters and access to various databases. The technical approach for
connecting to the Internet is very sound and cost effective. Do not fund $5,000
in salary.
