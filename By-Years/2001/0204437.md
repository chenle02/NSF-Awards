This research is to study various aspects of inverse scattering
&lt;br/&gt;problems arising in wave propagation and in quantum mechanics
&lt;br/&gt;and their applications. These include wave propagation in a
&lt;br/&gt;nonhomogeneous and absorptive medium and the determination
of&lt;br/&gt;the nonhomogeneities and absorptivity of the medium, X-ray
&lt;br/&gt;reflectometry and the determination of material properties
of&lt;br/&gt;stratified thin films by probing them with X-rays, focusing of
&lt;br/&gt;waves at target locations and the determination medium
properties&lt;br/&gt;by using wave focusing, developing exact quadratures to
analytically &lt;br/&gt;continue a reflection coefficient from an interval to
larger &lt;br/&gt;domains and their numerical implementation, and solving
inverse&lt;br/&gt;scattering problems in order to recover functions with slower
&lt;br/&gt;decay conditions at infinity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The inverse
scattering problems investigated have important applications in
many&lt;br/&gt;areas such as materials science, nondestructive testing, acoustic
&lt;br/&gt;imaging, and remote sensing. The principal aim is to
determine&lt;br/&gt;properties of a target in a remote fashion: send a wave onto
the&lt;br/&gt;target, analyze the scattered wave, and infer the properties of
the&lt;br/&gt;target from the scattering data. In addition to its practical
&lt;br/&gt;importance in physical sciences, engineering, and other applied
&lt;br/&gt;areas, the research will contribute mathematical techniques to
&lt;br/&gt;various areas of mathematics and it will also help to train
&lt;br/&gt;some graduate and undergraduate students in applied
mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;
