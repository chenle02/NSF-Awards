This project is a four summer program to provide inservice education, in the
areas of cellular and molecular biology and biotechnology, for 192 (48 per year)
general and advanced level high school biology teachers from Arizona and
surrounding states. Special attention will be given to the recruitment of
teachers of minority students and to the needs of minority students. Emphasis
will also be placed on giving biology teachers the competency and confidence to
emphasize modern biotechnology in the classroom, incorporating laboratory
investigations to their fullest, and also to the use of computer and media
technology in biology education. The program is based upon several years of
pilot study and includes a three week summer institute at Northern Arizona
University and academic year follow-up. Highly qualified, experienced,
precollege teachers will provide a significant portion of the institute
instruction. Participants will be required to share activities with fellow
teachers via local inservice activities. Cost sharing equals 9.3% of the NSF
award.
