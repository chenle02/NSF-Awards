9708020 Burdea Body rehabilitation is a very repetitive activity. Virtual
Reality (VR) is a novel technology that can change the quality and cost of
rehabilitation treatment. Computer hardware and virtual exercises will be
modeled after standard procedures for the hand, elbow and knee, with real- time
transparent data gathering into a patients' database. The system will then be
tested clinically at Stanford Medical School, on two groups, a control group
(performing standard rehabilitation exercises) and an experimental group.
Experimental data will be analyzed in order to quantify the efficiency of VR-
based rehabilitation and used to improve the system. Remote monitoring of the
rehabilitation process will be performed from the CAIP Center at Rutgers
University. ***
