A large scale adaptation, refinement, and implementation project is invigorating
teaching and learning calculus for science and engineering students. Innovations
being adapted have been tested at each of the two participating institutions and
at Iowa State University, New Mexico State University, and Cornell University.
The three year effort is taking advantage of both modern supercalculator and
microcomputer technology and incorporates group learning through team projects.
The project will affect some 20,000 students over five years.
