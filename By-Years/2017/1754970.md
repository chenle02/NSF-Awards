This workshop will highlight and address the structural challenges faced by STS
scholars and their scholarship from, on, and about the continent of Africa. The
conference will contribute to increasing knowledge in the field by bringing
together the disparate communities of scholarship on African STS, integrating
insights from studying Biomedicine, the Environment and Information and
Communication Technologies. By increasing participation of uniquely African
perspectives in the creation of STS knowledge about the continent, the workshop
will deepen our insights on various processes of science, technology and
innovation on the African continent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core question of
the workshop is this: What are the boundaries of Science and Technology in
Africa and how should we recognize and address both the uniqueness of African
knowledge production and innovation on the one hand, and the potential that STS
work in Africa has to offer to the field as a whole on the other? By bringing
together a diverse group of STS scholars who work in and on the African
continent before the Society for Social Studies of Science (4S) meeting, the
workshop will create the institutional pressure for the society to more fully
engage with African STS scholarship. The workshop will also affect the field as
a whole by generating new scholarly agendas to expand the visibility of STS
research in and on Africa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
