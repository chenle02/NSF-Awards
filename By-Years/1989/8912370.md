The objective of this research is to characterize the nature of cluster
formation in supersaturated molybdate solutions, principally those solutions
used to prepare molybdate catalysts. The study is concerned with the effects of
concentration, pH and impurities on the degree to which molybdate clusters form
and on the size which they achieve. Raman spectroscopy and light scattering
techniques will be refined and developed to obtain clustering information. In
addition, the analyses of concentration gradients which develop in
supersaturated solutions subjected to a force field will also be used to
characterize cluster formation. The results of this research will contribute to
a better understanding of crystal nucleation and growth from solution as well as
contribute to the understanding of the effect of solution conditions on the
effectiveness of molybdate catalysts produced from such solutions.
