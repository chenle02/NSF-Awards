Dr. Norman H. Packard is an outstanding, young physicist who is interested in
the study of complex dynamics, both theoretically and experimentally. He
proposes to study two areas: (1) the onset to global chaos and (2) adaptive
dynamical systems. He plans to investigate the relationship between these two
areas by using abstract models, physical models and experiments on the onset to
global chaos in two-fluid systems. Dr. Packard has been honored with a
Presidential Young Investigator Award. He is a promising, young scientist, who
uses computers to simulate the dynamics of complex systems. In particular, he
proposes to study the relationship between the onset to global chaos and
adaptive dynamical systems, using both computer simulations and experiments with
two-fluid systems. This is truly forefront research involving the use of
computers.
