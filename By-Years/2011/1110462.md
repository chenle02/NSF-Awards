How do new species arise? A central goal of evolutionary biology is to
understand how new species form and the processes that maintain boundaries
between species. This research will investigate whether selection to strengthen
reproductive barriers between species may, as a consequence, also initiate
reproductive isolation within species. The specific goal of this project is to
dissect the genetic basis of female mate preference in the fly Drosophila
subquinaria, a species where some females display increased behavioral
discrimination both against males of a closely related species as well as
against certain males of their own species. Using crossing experiments and
genome sequencing technologies, the experiments will ask whether the same
genetic regions confer increased mate discrimination within and between species.
In addition to advancing our understanding of the genetic basis of behavioral
isolation and speciation, this research will also involve the development of
genetic resources for the quinaria group of Drosophila, a group that has
undergone a recent radiation and has considerable potential as model system for
evolutionary, ecological, and behavior genetic studies. This funding will also
provide research training in the areas of behavior, genetics, and bioinformatics
for a female graduate student as well as for undergraduate and high school
students from diverse backgrounds.
