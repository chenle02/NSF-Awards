This award will support collaborative research in electrical engineering and
computer science between two US and French groups. The US researchers are: Drs.
Allan Willsky and Sanjoy Mitter, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Dr.
Bernard Levy, University of California at Davis. The French researchers are:
Drs. A. Benveniste, R. Nikoukhah and M. Basseville, French National Institute
for Computer Science and Automation (INRIA). The research will focus on five
topics: 1) multi-resolution statistical signal and image processing, including
the development of novel multi-scale stochastic models for efficient and highly
parallel algorithms 2) discrete event systems, including the blending of
concepts from computer science and control in order to develop an effective
methodology for the monitoring and control of complex systems 3) noncausal
system models and efficient parallel algorithms for optimal estimation 4)
distributed parameter systems, including a complete treatment of infinite
dimensional systems and 5) system and estimation-theoretic approaches to
computer vision. The project will benefit from the history of previous and
successful collaboration between these two groups and the extensive and
complementary expertise of the US and French investigators.
