A large percentage of protein products from genetically engineered cells exist
in scrambled forms and are biologically nonfunctional. First, unfolding and then
refolding these inactive products into active proteins is one of the most
important problems of the new biotechnology. Hardly any bioprocess engineering
research has ever been done in this area and, in fact, most engineers have not
been aware of such difficulties until recently. This study will examine several
related approaches to refold a model protein, xylose isomerase, after first
unfolding. The objective is the development of bioprocessing techniques that
will allow improved percentage yield of active products from scrambled proteins.
