This proposal seeks to acquire a fast particulate spectrometer that can measure
the particle size distribution of automotive exhaust in real time. The
instrument will be used for four primary research activities. First, it will be
used to develop decision tree algorithms for real time detection of high
particle Number (PN) concentration thresholds in gasoline and diesel engine
exhaust. Second, the proposed instrument will be used to develop a new hybrid
modeling method that combines the robustness of dimensional models and the
accuracy of empirical models for PN emission predictions. Third, the proposed
instrument will used to study particle size distributions resulting from
biofuels and from different combustion strategies in small engines that are not
electronically controlled and do not use high injection pressures, exhaust gas
recirculation or particulate filters. Such engines can be found in gardening
equipment, residential generators and two-wheelers around the world. Fourth, the
proposed instrument will be used to understand secondary aerosol formation in
the atmosphere, understand the effect of lubricant additives on the toxicity of
PN emissions, and used for the development of surrogate jet fuels to create
chemical kinetic sub-models within a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
framework to aid gas turbine combustor design, through collaborative projects
with the Chemical Engineering Department and the Chemistry Department,
respectively.
