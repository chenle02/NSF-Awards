9451556 Morstad A Mathematics Computer laboratory is being developed for use
with all sections of the calculus sequence. The three main goals are: 1. To help
students construct mathematical concepts through active exploration in a
computer laboratory setting. 2. To motivate students to think and communicate
about mathematics by stimulating discussion in the laboratory setting and by
requiring students to write about their results. 3. To model effective teaching
methods for Secondary Education Mathematics majors and provide them with
experience in teaching mathematics in a controlled laboratory setting.
