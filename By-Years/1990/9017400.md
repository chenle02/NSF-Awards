Observations suggest that deep overpressured sediments in the U.S. Gulf Coast
Sedimentary Basin are expelling porewaters vertically near the flanks of some
salt domes. The project will numerically model flow fields, brine plumes and
thermal anomalies that may result around generic salt domes by this process. The
numerical modeling will incorporate the effect of dewatering a thick
overpressured sedimentary section deeper than 3 to 4 km, with fluid expulsion
preferentially upward near the flanks of the domes. The modeling will also
incorporate the effect of instabilities induced by porewater density gradients
due to salinity and temperature variations. In parallel, subsurface salinities,
temperatures and pressures will be mapped in vertical cross-sections across
eight salt domes in the U.S. Gulf Coast, using borehole logs to determine
whether basin dewatering is manifested by brine plumes and thermal anomalies.
The proposed work may help explain the origin of 1)heavy metal sulfide deposits
and diagenetic minerals precipitated above or on the flanks of salt domes, at
temperatures tens of degrees above that of host sediments, and 2)perched brine
plumes above the salt domes, gravitationally unstable by virtue of their high
density. The work proposed here may also shed some light on mechanisms for
hydrocarbon migration because hydrocarbons often occur on the flanks of salt
domes above overpressed sediments.
