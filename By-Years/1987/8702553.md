The PI has previously developed a cubic systolic array for matrix
multiplication. Answers are now being sought for the following pair of questions
concerning such arrays: Can they be used in conjunction with a general purpose
processor to create a "matrix computer" in the same way that a "vector
processor" is used in a "vector computer"? Could such a computer be used to
efficiently solve various other linear algebra problems? Cubic systolic arrays
allow matrix multiplication in time sublinear in the matrix size. Designs are
sought for further systolic devices that will solve further algebra problems in
time sublinear in the matrix size. This research is directed toward adaptation
of known parallel solutions of computational problems for efficient execution on
more readily implementable parallel computers. The significance of this research
is in the additional insight it is expected to provide into aspects of parallel
computation.
