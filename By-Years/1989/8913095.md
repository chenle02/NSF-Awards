The research focuses on two general topics in theoretical condensed matter
physics and chemical physics. The first problem is the mathematical description
of electron transport in low temperature disordered solids and, in particular,
the description of the metal-insulator transition in interacting disordered
Fermi liquids. The second research topic is on the glassy state as a liquid is
cooled or quenched. Of particular concern is the understanding of the dramatic
increase in the viscosity in the glass transition region.
