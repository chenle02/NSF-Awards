The Summer Institute in Economic Geography will bring together 40 advanced
graduate students and early career scholars from around the world with a small
group of internationally renowned faculty to advance scholarship, understanding
and knowledge creation in the field of economic geography. The intensive nature
of the meeting will enable the participants to assess state-of-the-art
developments in the field, to identify major questions and challenges, and to
collectively shape the future research agenda for the next generation of
scholars and educators. This project takes place at a time of widespread
uncertainty about the current state and future prospects of the global economy
and the place of the United States within it. In bringing together an extended
network of junior scholars and internationally renowned faculty the depth and
rigor of the discussions will further the development of collaborative research
designed to better understand the dynamics of the global economy, inform policy
making in local, national and international contexts and inform our knowledge
and understanding of the volatility that is the hallmark of the contemporary
global economy.

The event involves a unique blend of professional development and scholarly
inquiry, with an orientation to breaking issues in the field. Topics to be
addressed include: assessments of the implications of financial innovation and
volatility; the evolving relationship between global economic growth and the
environment; making academic work relevant to policy and policy-making; research
ethics, funding strategies, and new developments in methodological practice;
planning for research-intensive careers; strategies for publication and
dissemination; and the effective linkage of academic research to teaching,
service, and education. The event will provide training and professional
preparation for a distinguished, international group of early-career scholars
and educators, providing foundations for the deepening of professional networks
and for new collaborations in research and teaching. At a time of significant
challenges in the economic policymaking environment and the continued
intensification of international competition, the Summer Institute in Economic
Geography is focused on building the shared and individual capacities of a new
generation of researchers, who experience shows will themselves become leaders
in the field over the coming decade.
