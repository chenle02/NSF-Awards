Broad social-psychological analyses of intergroup relations incorporate theory
from many diverse substantive domains within the field. This research takes one
of these theoretical segments and attempts to develop further its application to
group relations. Specifically, it examines the effects of factors that regulate
the salience of the category to which members of interacting groups belong. It
assesses the effects of social category salience on various measures of bias,
hostility, and social acceptance. It assumes that negative affect and prejudice,
when directed toward members of social categories, are dysfunctional to group
productivity and contribute to intergroup conflict. The research builds on a
theoretical model concerned with social category salience and intergroup
relations and an experimental laboratory paradigm for studying its effects when
members of two or more groups work cooperatively to solve a group problem. Some
studies will create two artificial groups from a set of strangers brought into
the laboratory. To integrate their outcomes with "real-world" situations, other
studies will conceptually replicate them with members of natural social
categories -- e.g. racial ethnic groups, commuter students versus fraternity row
students. Non- voluntary facial electromyographic responses and other
psychophysiological measurement procedures that minimize the intrusion of self
presentational concerns will be examined in studies coordinated with the
intergroup experiments. The studies employ multiple dependent measures to
illuminate underlying process better, but also in response to the fact that
theoretical models differ in their predictions for different response systems.
Additionally, the studies consider theoretical issues raised in recent
conceptual analyses of intergroup relations. Practical applications of the
variables stressed as important by the theoretical model do not require that
highly trained personnel maintain direct interaction with the individuals in a
workteam over the course of time in order to improve intergroup relations.
Instead, they translate into simple rules concerning procedures for forming and
instructing workteams.
