Many populations, communities, and ecosystems persist in environments where some
or all life stages disperse in media with a strong directional bias. Examples
include plants with windborn seeds, aquatic organisms in streams, rivers and
estuaries, and marine organisms with larval dispersal influenced by ocean
currents. The overall objective of this research is to develop a modeling
framework describing consumer-resource interactions in such systems. The
approach is to study a suite of mathematical models of increasing complexity and
ecological specificity. Although many of the results will have wider
application, the primary emphasis is on mechanisms that are important in stream
ecology.
