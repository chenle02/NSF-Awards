The proposer is going to study a number of interconnected combinatorial problems
related, on the one hand, to exact or asymptotic enumeration of branched
coverings of one surface by another and, on the other hand, to exact or
asymptotic evaluation of various sums over partitions. These problems arise both
from enumerative geometry of the moduli spaces of curves (and related moduli
spaces) and from connection with random matrices. If solved, these problems will
lead to important applications to algebraic geometry, ergodic theory, and other
fields, and will also substantially further our present understanding of the
interaction between geometry of the moduli spaces and combinatorics of random
matrices and partitions.
