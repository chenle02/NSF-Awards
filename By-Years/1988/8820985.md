As part of the National Research Council (NRC) initiative on biotechnology, the
Board on Biology will conduct a study for the Biotechnology Science Coordinating
Committee (BSCC) of the Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering
and Technology to establish what properties of microorganisms and plants and the
environments into which they will be introduced should be considered in
determining levels of possible environmental risk. The proposed study is
intended to provide guidance to both investigators and regulators in evaluating
planned introductions of microorganisms and plants.
