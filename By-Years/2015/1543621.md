This request is for partial support of a workshop that be held in Phoenix,
Arizona, during May 17-19, 2015. The workshop will bring together an
international group of about 50 isotope geochemists and biomedical researchers
to explore the use of high precision isotope analysis, particularly of the heavy
metals or metallomics, as disease biomarkers. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;It is known
that disruptions in the metabolism of inorganic elements can be the cause or
result from some diseases, such as Alzheimer, osteoporosis, and cancer. The aim
of the workshop is to identify medical questions where sophisticated
technologies, methodologies, and concepts that have been used in the geological
and environmental sciences can be applied to combat disease. Results of the
workshop will be published in a report that will serve as the founding document
of the new field of isotope metallomic biomarkers and will be available to
researchers and the public.
