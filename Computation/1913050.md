An axisymmetric problem is a problem defined on a three-dimensional (3D) domain
that is symmetric with respect to an axis. These problems arise in various
applications in the field of biomedical engineering, electromagnetism, and
optics. An axisymmetric problem can be reduced to a sequence of two-dimensional
(2D) problems by using cylindrical coordinates and a Fourier series
decomposition. A discrete problem corresponding to a 2D problem is significantly
smaller than a discrete problem corresponding to a 3D one, so such dimension
reduction is an attractive feature considering computation time. The resulting
2D problem, however, is posed in weighted function spaces and is mathematically
quite different from the analogous "standard" 2D problems, so special care is
required when developing numerical methods that are well-fit for these weighted
2D problems. In this project, we will study efficient numerical techniques with
solid mathematical support that can be applied to axisymmetric problems
including those that arise in the treatment of various cancer treatments. The
first goal of this project is to perform multigrid analysis for axisymmetric
H(curl) and H(div) problems with general data including the axisymmetric time
harmonic Maxwell equations. Multigrid for axisymmetric H(curl) and H(div)
problems have been studied previously under the assumption that the data is
independent of the rotational variable, which is not the case for most
applications. Therefore, this project will bring new results for general
axisymmetric problems with meaningful applications in Hepatic Microwave
Ablation, an alternate treatment to liver, breast, bone, and lung cancer.
Undergraduate students will be a part of evaluating the performance of multigrid
in designing efficient antennas that can be used for these cancer treatments.
Furthermore, this project will provide new mathematical tools to study
axisymmetric problems with general data as well. The second goal of this project
is to study axisymmetric state-constrained elliptic optimal control problems
with axisymmetric data by using P1 finite element methods. There are very few
studies done on axisymmetric optimal control problems, so this will be new and
significant. The PI will also run a "Numerical Analysis Day" for local high
school students with her undergraduate students from the James Madison
University Association for Women in Mathematics Student Chapter.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
