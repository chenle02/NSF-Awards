The proposed work is part of an integrated research program into the
oceanographic structure of the western Weddell Sea. It is to be carried out from
an ice camp jointly occupied by U.S. and USSR scientists from February to June
1992. This project concerns the regional-scale circulation and the variability
of the Weddell SEa boundary current. Five moorings consisting of two current
meters each will be suspended from the ice at 50 kilometer intervals in a line
normal to the mean direction of the current. The upper current meters will
within Polar Surface Water, while the lower meters will be within the warmer
Weddell Warm Water. This array will complement a series of taut wire moorings to
be emplaced by the German Antarctic Program in the central Weddell Sea.
