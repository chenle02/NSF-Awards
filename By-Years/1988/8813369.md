Nonadiabatic couplings among states of a colliding pair of atoms or molecules
have an essential role in determining state- specific cross-sections for a wide
range of elastic and inelastic collision processes. These include nonradiative
electronic transitions such as quenching or fine-structure transitions,
coherence transfer and collisional depolarization, and rotational and
vibrational energy transfer. Nonadiabatic effects are also important in
photofragmentation processes such as photodissociation, photoionization, or
collisional redistribution of light. Experimental studies of effects of
nonadiabatic couplings on the dynamics of optical collisions between alkali
(sodium and lithium) and rare gas atoms will be carried out. Both fine-structure
branching and the production of Zeeman multipoles will be investigated, along
with the recently observed nonlinear laser intensity dependence of the fine-
structure branching. An investigation of the LiHe and NaHe molecular Rydberg
spectrum, which should exhibit significant rotational nonadiabaticity through
the core rotation and vibration, will also be pursued.
