9350909 Elakovich The project will purchase a Fourier Transform NMR for use in
seven courses of increasing level impacting over 300 students per year in
addition to those students pursuing undergraduate research. The 1H and 13C nmr
capabilities will be used to confirm the structure of synthesis products,
identify unknowns, correlate empirical calculations with actual chemical shifts
to identify unknown compounds, examine the temperature dependence of chemical
shifts, explore the effects of pulse width, rate, and number on the collected
spectrum, determine thermodynamic quantities, and study enzyme activity. The
project will augment current efforts to encourage minorities and women, who make
up a significant portion of the student population as well as the population in
the state, to pursue science education. An outreach program to local high
schools will also be introduced. In addition, students and faculty of five area
historically Black colleges will have access to the instrument. This project
should have a very positive effect on the number of women and Blacks who choose
to study chemistry. ***
