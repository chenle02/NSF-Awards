This ITR project is aimed at developing the foundations of a modern systems
science that is simultaneously computational and physical; it remarries time,
concurrency, robustness, continuums, and resource management to computation.
This project, because of its focus on foundations, will provide a fundamentally
new paradigm, based on hybrid systems, for modeling and analysis of many complex
phenomena that occur in the physical and biological sciences on both microscopic
and macroscopic levels. These outcomes of the project are prerequisites for the
deployment of embedded, autonomous computing in many safety-critical
applications, from medical devices to transportation to national security needs
in avionics. The attention to a new education model will create a new generation
of engineers who will be able to master the design of complex, heterogeneous
systems that will be the backbone of the future IT
industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed ITR has four focus areas of
research. (a) Hybrid systems theory. The focus here is on scaling up pioneering
approaches that integrate physical modeling with computational systems. (b)
Model-based design. The main effort here is to develop a set of models with
solid mathematical foundations that allow for the systematic integration of
diverse efforts in system specification, design, synthesis, analysis and
validation, execution, and design evolution (c) Advanced tool architectures. The
deliverables from this project will be a set of reusable, inter-operating
software modules, freely distributed as open-source software. (d) Experimental
research. The program will leverage existing system-building efforts involving
avionics, anti-terrorism technologies, vehicle electronics, and autonomous
robots. In addition we will apply our methods to networks of embedded systems
for applications such as environment monitoring, building protection, and
emergency response. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of this change on teaching
and research is profound, and will not be confined to the graduate level. Based
on the ongoing, groundbreaking effort at UCB, we propose to deliberately re-
architect and retool undergraduate teaching at the participating institutions,
and to engage in course development at a set of California community colleges
with which UCB has established relationships and which have a high enrollment of
Hispanic and African American students. Faculty and graduate student researchers
from minority and other institutions will be recruited each summer to
participate in a program called SIPHER (Summer Internship Program in Hybrid and
Embedded Software Research).&lt;br/&gt;
