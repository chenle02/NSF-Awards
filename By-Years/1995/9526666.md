Abstract ATM-9526666 Richard N. Mower Central Michigan University UNIDATA:
Networked Workstations for an Undergraduate Meteorology Laboratory. Funds will
expand the capabilities of the undergraduate meteorology laboratory through the
acquisition of five networked workstations. The proposed expansion will enable
the program to make the transition to UNIX from a single OS/2 workstation and
will allow access to a wider range of products available through UNIDATA via
Internet Data Distribution (IDD).
