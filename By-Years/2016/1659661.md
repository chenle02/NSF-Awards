Professors Edwin Hilinski, Mykhailo Shatruk, and colleagues at Florida State
University (FSU) host the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site:
Sunshine Institute for the Interaction of Light with Matter. This site is funded
by the REU Site Programs of the Division of Chemistry and the Division of
Materials Research, both in the NSF Directorate of Mathematical and Physical
Sciences. Ten students are supported for ten weeks each summer. Research
opportunities emphasize photochemistry, photophysics, and spectroscopy. The
program recruitment efforts are primarily directed at underrepresented groups
from institutions, especially those where research opportunities are limited,
that are located in Florida and other states in the Southeastern United States.
This site also targets the recruitment of student veterans via established
interactions with the FSU Veterans Center and Tyndall Air Force Base. Students
in the program are encouraged to pursue research careers in STEM
fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The students participate in research that is of
great interest to modern science and technology. In particular, the research
projects designed specifically for this program advance knowledge relevant to
solar-energy conversion, photochemical reactions, ultrafast photophysical
events, and photomagnetic effects. Participants also receive training in
synthetic chemistry, a variety of analytical techniques, and theoretical
methods. Training in chemical safety, scientific ethics, and scientific
communication is included. A professional development program includes workshops
on applying to graduate programs, preparing for the Graduate Record Examination,
and selecting a graduate school. Continued post-program mentoring is provided to
the REU participants after they return to their home institutions.
