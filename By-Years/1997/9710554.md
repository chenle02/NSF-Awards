The Lucile B. Kaufman Scholars program is designed to encourage undergraduate
women in engineering to pursue graduate degrees in engineering. The program will
include 20 nominees and 8 alternates with junior status in engineering. The
program builds on two components: professional development and community
building. The professional development component includes an 8 - week summer
research experience, culminating in a formal research symposia. The community
building component includes mentoring and networking events designed to create a
supportive community environment for participants. Mentors will also participate
in diversity training workshops. Students completing academic year activities in
the program are awarded the title Lucile B. Kaufman Scholar," receive a $500.00
scholarship, and participate in the summer research experience, for which they
receive a $1500 stipend. Participant scholars achievements will be compared to a
comparative cadre of non-participant, but similarly motivated students
