This award supports the research in combinatorics of Professor Ira Gessel of
Brandeis University. Dr. Gessel plans to study the applications of symmetric
functions and orthogonal polynomials to problems in enumerative combinatorics.
Among the topics involved are coefficient extraction for symmetric functions,
permutation and sequence enumeration, Lagrange inversion, Polya frequency
sequences, rook polynomials, combinatorial interpretations of integrals
involving orthogonal polynomials, and orthogonal polynomials associated with
Genocchi numbers. This research falls in the broad category of combinatorics,
which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics. Fundamentally,
combinatorics represents a systematization of the very first of all mathematical
activities, counting. In its modern development, however, combinatorics has gone
beyond just counting to make use of a wide variety of advanced mathematical
techniques, and although its roots go back several centuries, the field has had
an explosive development in the past few decades because of its importance in
communications and information technology.
