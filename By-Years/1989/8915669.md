The fish family Liparididae is a widely distributed, benthic taxon in temperate
and cold waters of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Recent studies show
that there may be as many species in the Southern Ocean as in the Bering Sea,
previously considered an area of highest species diversity and primary center of
distribution. Liparidids are probably the most species-rich family in the
Southern Ocean, contrary to the traditional view giving this position to the
endemic southern family Nototheniidae. The most species-rich liparidid genus is
Careproctus, which has the broadest depth range of 50 to 7200 m. It includes
about 18 undescribed Antarctic species and is the only group of the Southern
Ocean liparidids not recently reviewed taxonomically. The immediate goals of the
proposed research are the identification, description and redescription of
Careproctus species occurring in the Southern Ocean. Standard taxonomic methods
will be used, but emphasis will be on a search for previously unused distintive
characters in the liparidid genus. The identification and description of all
Antarctic liparidids will permit studies leading to better understanding of the
zoogeography and history of the Antarctic ichthyofauna, comparison of the
Antaractic liparidid fauna with that of the Bering Sea, and may help explain why
and how the family achieved its bi-polar distribution and high species
diversity. Accurate species descriptions will be of great assistance in studying
the changes which occur during adaptation to deep-sea life, the ecology of the
Southern Ocean and adjacent waters, and the distribution and zoogeography of
Antarctic fishes.
