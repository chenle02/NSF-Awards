9320081 Granger In the past decade policy makers have become increasingly
concerned with the environmental and atmospheric consequences of the
deforestation of the world's tropical forests. Unfortunately, high level
decision-makers have had very little hard data with which to form their policies
regarding the utilization of forest resources. This project intends to use a
newly available economic and ecological dataset for the Amazon region in Brazil
to analyze the long-run economic and environmental consequences of various
forestry-related activities under a variety of regimes. On of the major issues
to be analyzed is how the presence of roads or the existence of land tenure
programs may influence the long-run effects that forestry activities have on the
economy and ecology of a region. By providing a better understanding of how many
factors interact over time to affect both the environment and the economy, this
study would provide policy makers with valuable information and contribute to
the effort to balance human economic need with environmental concerns. ***
