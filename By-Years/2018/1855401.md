In 2016, the National Science Foundation (NSF) unveiled a set of 'Big Ideas,' 10
bold, long-term research and process ideas that identify areas for future
investment at the frontiers of science and engineering. The Big Ideas represent
unique opportunities to position our Nation at the cutting edge of global
science and engineering leadership by bringing together diverse disciplinary
perspectives to support convergence research. This proposal responds to that
vision and describes an Ideas Lab on 'Synthetic and Artificial Cells.' Ideas
Labs are intensive workshops focused on finding innovative solutions to grand
challenge problems. The ultimate aim of this Ideas Lab is to facilitate the
generation and execution of innovative research projects aimed at designing,
fabricating, and validating synthetic cells. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability
to design and manufacture synthetic cells has significant implications for the
scientific and economic enterprise of the United States. The synthesis of viable
cells from non-living molecules and materials can open the door to the
production of functional biomaterials and improved biofuels, large scale
chemical synthesis, non-silicon-based computing, novel soil engineering, and
medical and pharmaceutical advances, to name just a few possibilities. The study
of synthetic cells, and of the processes used in their creation, can also
provide a window on the origin and evolution of life on Earth and, potentially,
provide insight into extraterrestrial life. The aspiration is that mixing
researchers who have diverse scientific backgrounds will engender original
thinking and innovative approaches that will transform our understanding of
cellular processes, the molecular mechanisms that underscore the building and
function of systems that reproduce life traits, the self-assembly of life-like
systems, soft condensed matter, and the physics and chemistry of life that are
needed to design and build cellular components, cells and multicell
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
