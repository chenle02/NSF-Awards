It is proposed to fabricate thin films of heavy-fermion materials and study
their transport properties when subjected to strong magnetic fields; compounds
of cerium and of uranium will be examined. Heavy-fermion materials show
extraordinary electronic properties, some exhibit superconductivity.
Measurements on thin films should give valuable insights into the behavior of
these highly unusual materials.
