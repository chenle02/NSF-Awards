The principal investigator will utilize sulfur isotopes and the laser microprobe
to evaluate the effect of metamorphism on the degree of re-equilibration of
sulfur isotope thermometers. By studying sixteen different volcanogenic massive
sulfide deposits ranging in metamorphic grade from zeolite to amphibolite
facies, he will also determine whether temperature information is preserved in
such deposits.
