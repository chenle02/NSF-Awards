A combination of analytical and computational techniques for the efficient
numerical simulation of multiphase systems, including acoustic and electrical
fields, will be developed. Several innovations are proposed to include the
lubrication force, polidispersivity in the size of bubbles or particles,
multiparticle interactions and wave propagation. The work has scientific
relevance in multiphase flow and processing, and may lead to an efficient use of
high performance computers.
