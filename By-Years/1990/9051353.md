A plan is currently under way to restructure the internal combustion engine
curriculum for Mechanical Engineering at the University of Missouri-Rolla. The
goal of the project is to modernize the course by introducing both lecture topic
and laboratory experiences pertaining to current innovations and motivating
factors in the engine industry including modern air and fuel induction systems,
emission formation and emission testing and requirements. A modern spark
ignition engine test facility will be developed for a state-of-the-art engine
donated by industry. The test facility will be sufficiently automated to allow
the students to focus on the data being taken during the testing and not on the
control of the engine. The needed equipment includes a dynamometer control
system, a PC base data acquisition system and some engine instrumentation. The
dynamometer control system will hold the engine torque and speed set points
without requiring continual adjustment and provide safe, rapid change of set
points. The students will collect engine information that is crucial to current
designs including engine load and speed, combustion chamber pressure profiles,
fuel injection characteristics and exhaust emissions using the high speed data
acquisition system. It is anticipated that this project will generate more
student interest in the area of internal combustion engines and produce students
that are better able to serve the needs of industry.
