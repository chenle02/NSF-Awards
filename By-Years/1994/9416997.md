9416997 Yeh The first international workshop on long-wave runup was held in the
Marine Science Center of the University of Southern California at Catalina
Island, CA, on 15-17 August 1990. The primary application of the research
discussed was in tsunami runup and flooding and tsunami hazard mitigation. The
workshop resulted in a renewed interest in research on long-wave runup, and
significantly facilitated international research collaboration in this area.
During 1992, 1993 and 1994 four major tsunamis occurred causing significant
property damage and many fatalities: the Nicaraguan tsunami in September 1992,
the Flores Island (the Philippines) tsunami in December 1992, the Hokkaido
tsunami in July 1993, and the Java tsunami in June 1994. This workshop is to be
held in September 1995 at the Friday Harbor Laboratory of the University of
Washington. This laboratory is in the San Juan Islands, approximately 70 miles
north of Seattle. The objectives of this workshop are to: (1) Review and update
knowledge on long-wave runup, and the experience gained through field surveys of
the recent major tsunamis, (2) Compare analytical and numerical model
predictions with experimental data for benchmark problems, and (3) Discuss
future research directions in terms of tsunami hazard mitigation. ***
