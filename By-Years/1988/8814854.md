Funds will support the microstructural characterization effort within the
Departments of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and
Physics. The growing need for materials characterization, resulting from the
creation of the Centers for Space Processing of Engineering Materials, Materials
Tribology, and Atomic and Molecular Physics at Surfaces as well as demands
within the Materials and Electrical Engineering Departments, justifies the
acquisition of a modern analytical electron microscope for the Vanderbilt
research community.
