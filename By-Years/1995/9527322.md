Elser 9527322 How does elemental composition ("stoichiometry") of animals vary
among species? How might differences in body elemental composition affect how
food webs function? This project will test the hypothesis that differences among
species in body stoichiometry of the nutrients nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)
reflect differences among species in specific growth rate. It is predicted that
rapidly growing organisms must have high ribosome concentrations in their
bodies. Ribosomes are P-rich (low N:P) cellular structures responsible for
protein synthesis and thus growth. Therefore, rapidly growing organisms are
predicted to have lower N:P ratios in their bodies that slower growing species.
We will test this hypothesis by studying elemental and biochemical composition
and body growth rates of zooplankton species at high latitudes vs. mid-
latitudes. Natural selection along latitudinal gradients is hypothesized to
select for differing growth rates among similar planktonic species. We will
study ecological and evolutionary determinants of a parameter, animal N:P
stoichiometry, that is likely to be a key factor influencing food webs of lake
and ocean ecosystems.
