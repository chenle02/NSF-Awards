This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,
focusses on the electrochemical synthesis and characterization of complex mixed
metal oxide superconductor materials that exhibit novel properties. These
materials will be prepared from varying ratios of barium, potassium, bismuth,
and oxygen by Professor Michael Norton and his students in the Department of
Chemistry at Marshall University. This group first developed these methods for
electrochemically preparing these materials which have reduced defects that
impart superior superconductor properties. Vibrational spectroscopy and optical
and scanning tunnelling microscopies will be used to characterize these
superconductor materials. Materials that function as superconductors at high
temperatures exhibit novel electronic and magnetic properties that hold promise
for applications in a wide range of electronic devices. Procedures for preparing
defect free superconducting materials are necessary before these applications
can be realized. Professor Michael Norton and his students in the Department of
Chemistry at Marshall University have developed a new electrochemical method for
preparing superconductor materials composed of barium, potassium, bismuth, and
oxygen. This project will focus on further developing this unique approach to
the reliable preparation of high temperature superconductor materials.
