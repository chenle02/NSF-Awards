This project will combine existing technologies in an attempt to make the
testing of students' achievement in biology and the life sciences precise and
efficient. The technologies involved include microcomputer, interactive
videodisc, CD-ROM containing data bases of questions and instructional
materials, graphics, shared disks and printers, and adaptive testing. The tools
developed under the project are expected to ease the administration and
bookkeeping burdens associated with the creation, administration and scoring of
high school science assessment and diagnostic tests and to provide test results
with prescriptions to text-based curricula for remediation and enrichment.
Diagnostic tests with automated routing to high quality videodisc-based
instruction will also be provided. The prototype to be developed and tested
focuses on biology and life sciences in grade 7-12. Once the concept is proven,
WICAT is in a position to readily extend the system to high school courses in
physics, chemistry and general science. The main objective of this project is to
test the validity of the adaptive testing approach in science to determine if it
can yield time improvements of 50% to 70% as obtained in mathematics. The
independent evaluation is expected to show, in addition to decreased testing
time, improved teacher-made tests and improved student attitudes toward science.
Results will be disseminated through publications and at regional and national
conferences of science teachers and school board members.
