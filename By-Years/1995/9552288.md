This project provides funding to equip the School of Engineering and Technology
Manufacturing Laboratory with a versatile rapid prototyping facility to allow
undergraduate students from the departments of electrical engineering,
mechanical engineering, and technology to gain hands-on experience with modern
Computer Integrated Manufacturing processes, including Simulation based Design,
Design for Manufacture and Assembly, and Agile and Concurrent engineering
strategies. By using the rapid prototyping equipment, our engineering and
technology graduates can be better prepared for the rapidly changing
manufacturing job market. Faculty teaching design, systems engineering, and
manufacturing courses will be able to demonstrate in real-time concepts crucial
to improving product designs. Therefore, the new equipment significantly
enhances the manufacturing education at the university and further improves its
excellent record of educating and training students.
