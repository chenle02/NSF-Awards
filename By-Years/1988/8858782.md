Research consists of two major parts. The first seeks to develop more tools that
handle chip-interface design, based on the timing diagram methodology, covering
all steps through testing and documentation. The second part seeks to develop
tools that give system designers a spreadsheet-like way of evaluating
architectural and system-timing decisions at the level of data- path diagrams.
