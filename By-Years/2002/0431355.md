This grant funds a pilot study of two closely related problems that have arisen
as a result of the offshoring/outsourcing of engineering work. Specifically,
have the complex processes of economic and political development, motivated by
globalization, enhanced electronic communication capabilities and recessions in
the advanced industrial countries resulted in substantially increased worldwide
competition for engineering jobs and engineering talent? If so, then: 1)
Engineering educators must confront the issue of ensuring that graduates will
continue to bring value to a market place in which their salary demands are
three or four times greater than their international competitors; and 2) US
companies must redefine the roles and assignments given to US based engineers,
especially those in the early stages of their careers so that they receive that
value. Faculty from the University of Pittsburgh School of Engineering will
conduct this project in conjunction with colleagues from three diverse US
corporations with operations in the Pacific Rim (HJ Heinz, Kennametal and Sima
Products Corporation). It will take advantage of a unique opportunity to study
key Pacific Rim countries first hand in combination with US science and
engineering students and faculty as part of the Summer 2004 Semester at Sea
Program. As part of this program, faculty and students will visit firms in
Korea, Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Japan and Vietnam, meeting with production
managers, corporate officers, engineers, and shop floor workers. They will also
meet with university colleagues in each of these countries. By focusing on
manufacturing, a sector that has progressively moved offshore over the past
three decades, a better understanding as to where engineering practice and, as a
result, education might be headed will be obtained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If
successfully completed, this study will provide a first-person, in-depth
overview of the impact of outsourcing in a series of US and multinational
companies' facilities in at least six Pacific Rim countries. The comprehensive,
rigorous fieldwork will ensure should result in a clear, concise picture of the
issues facing US manufacturers in general and their engineering personnel
requirements in particular. This timely study is not only relevant to
engineering, but to any profession in which knowledge can be transmitted
electronically to highly skilled, but lower cost, personnel anywhere on the
globe.
