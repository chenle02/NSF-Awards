&lt;br/&gt;This goal of this program by Florida State University and the Leon
County School District is to increase the number of science professionals who
are prepared and willing to make meaningful contributions to science and
mathematics activities in grades K-8. Graduate fellows engage in extensive
learning to prepare them to become valuable classroom resources for K-12
teachers and students. Topics of study include an overview of child development,
assessment techniques, state and national science standards, and how students
learn. Following this preparation, Fellows will co-teach with selected K-8
teachers. Fellows also participate in district summer school enrichment classes
and summer science camp activities. This project is receiving partial support
from the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences&lt;br/&gt;
