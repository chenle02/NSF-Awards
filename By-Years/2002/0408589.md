This project aims for greater understanding of basic phenomena related to
interface energetics and molecular levels for carrier transport and doping of
organic based electronic/photonic device structures. The approach is to link
detailed measurements of interface electronic levels, injection processes,
morphology and chemistry with transport data, and to develop an energy level-
based rationale for choosing and evaluating materials combinations and
structures for devices. &lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses basic
research issues in a topical area of materials science having high technological
relevance. The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a
fundamental level to new understanding and capabilities in electronic/photonic
devices. An important feature of the program is the integration of research and
education through the training of students in a fundamentally and
technologically significant area. The project is collaborative in nature and
includes teaching of organic-related issues at the undergraduate, graduate and
professional levels. Collaborations are established with chemists and
theoreticians which will expose all parties involved, especially students, to
multiple facets of the physics, chemistry and technology of organic films. The
PI's research group includes graduate and undergraduate students with strong
representation of minorities. In addition, the PI is instrumental in introducing
and promoting the field of organic films and interfaces at meetings such as the
AVS, the Science and Technology Society. The impact on education of the AVS
scientific community is considerable. The PI is also heavily involved with
outreach programs at Princeton University. In general, understanding
material/molecular interfaces has broad and practical implications for device
design and modeling, an area that industry has great need for at present.
