A course with associated laboratory is being developed by the Department of
Engineering that will offer to first- and second- year students at Swarthmore
College an exposure to basic scientific and engineering principles through an
exploration of the acoustics of musical instruments as well as the acoustics of
the human voice, structures, and the environment. The intended audience is
predominantly non-majors in the sciences and engineering, although attraction of
students to these fields is an objective of the course. Emphasis is placed on
hands-on analysis by students of phenomena already within their experience: how
musical instruments (including electric and electronic ones and the human voice)
produce their characteristic sounds, how acoustic waves travel through solids,
liquids, and gases and are reflected, refracted, and absorbed, and how sound and
its impact on the environment (including humans) is measured and quantified.
Associated laboratories allow students to explore phenomena on their own in a
creative manner, working in groups of 4-5 students. Laboratories are designed to
teach basic principles such as resonance, superposition, time and frequency
domain representations of signals, wave motion in one, two, and three
dimensions, and the mechanics of the human ear.
