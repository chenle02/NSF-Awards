Abstract

This Focused Research Group brings together researchers from the University of
Michigan's Departments of Mathematics, Physics and Chemical Engineering to
address important problems of modeling, simulation and analysis for dynamical
processes where underlying discreteness plays a non-negligible role in large
scale descriptions via deterministic continuum systems (generally systems of
ordinary and partial differential equations). This Focused Research Group
combines the investigators' expertise in theory, modeling, analysis and
scientific computation to study a suite of problems from materials physics,
chemical kinetics and the life sciences to elucidate the fundamental scientific
issues and develop appropriate quantitative tools to analyze them. The specific
problems to be studied are: (1) Mesoscopic mathematical models of wound healing
with cell proliferation and migration, and including the biologically important
effect of cell-cell adhesion; (2) The application of new and improved simulation
techniques, direct solutions of the Becker-Doering equations, and simulation and
analysis of stochastic models to investigate the role of microscopic
correlations in Ostwald ripening; (3) The development of analytic asymptotic
methods for accurate reduced descriptions of slow stochastic variables properly
incorporating residual fluctuation effects with applications to (bio)chemical
reaction networks possessing a wide spectrum of reaction rates; (4) An extension
of modeling, analysis and simulation methods developed for simple systems to
increasingly complex stochastic models in population biology and epidemiology
including epidemics in structured populations and extinction of competing
species; (5) Spatial inhomogeneities and reaction-rate variations in the
stochastic Fisher-Kolmogorov equation, a fundamental paradigm of front
propagation and pattern formation.

Results from this project will lead to the development of effective
mathematical descriptions and efficient computational schemes for problems of
increasing importance for small-scale physical and chemical processes in
materials science and nano-technology, and for quantitative modeling in the life
sciences. With regard to the even broader impact of this project, it contributes
to the development of the scientific workforce by providing advanced training
for postdoctoral researchers and doctoral students in the natural, engineering
and applied mathematical sciences.
