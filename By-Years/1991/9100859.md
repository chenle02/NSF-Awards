SAGE (Summer of Applied Geophysical Experience) is a university-level research
experience focused on modern geophysical exploration. The emphasis is on hands-
on, research- scale, advanced learning. The SAGE field area in the Rio Grande
rift near Santa Fe, New Mexico provides a stimulating tectonic research
environment as well as an opportunity to study occurrences of groundwater and
hydrocarbons. SAGE students participate in every phase of the field research
from the collection and processing of data to its interpretation culminating
with both an oral and written report. NSF supported REU students first complete
the three-week field segment of SAGE. They then return to their home campuses
where research continues on data that they have collected. SAGE is sponsored by
the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) Branch of the Institute of Geophysics
and Planetary Physics of the University of California and five universities who
furnish faculty and over $2,000,000 worth of geophysical equipment.
