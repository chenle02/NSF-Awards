This project is about the understanding of complex-valued functions. Complex
numbers and functions of complex variables have become, since the nineteenth
century, indispensable tools in many areas of mathematics and its applications
to other areas of science and engineering. The solutions of many problems in the
applied sciences could ultimately depend on improvements in these complex
analytic tools and in a deeper understanding of their basic properties. This
project provides research training for graduate students, and the principal
investigator will continue mentoring postdocs and organizing conferences on
several complex variables and complex geometry, bringing together mathematicians
to discuss their research and teaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal
investigator will work on several fundamental problems in complex analysis of
several variables that are closely related to research in differential geometry,
subelliptic analysis and classical dynamics. More specifically, he plans to
continue his research on the equivalence problem and the rigidity problem in
several complex variables, to carry further his work on the complex structure of
the holomorphic hull of a real submanifold in a complex space, and to
investigate various boundary CR invariants, including the famous Bloom
conjecture in any dimension.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
