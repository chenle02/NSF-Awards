The goal of this project is to develop and analyze interior- point algorithms
for solving large-scale linear programs (LP), quadratic programs (QP), linear
complementarity problems (LCP). This research is a continuation of previous work
and is motivated by the desire to resolve several theoretical and practical
issues concerning interior-point algorithms: (1) Algorithm Termination: to
develop efficient termination techniques to "purify" an approximate optimal
solution to an (exact) optimal solution, and to improve the complexity result
for a class of optimization problems. (2) Average Complexity: to analyze the
complexity of interior-point algorithms for solving random problems, and to
probabilisticly explain the excellent practical behavior of interior-point
algorithms. (3) Asymptotic Convergence: to develop and analyze superlinearly
convergent interior-point algorithms, and to improve the algorithms' global and
asymptotic complexity results. (4) Decomposition and Column Generation: to
develop various decomposition and column generation schemes for solving large-
scale practical problems using interior-point algorithms. This project will
strengthen some of the results from prior NSF research and explore new
techniques and tools for analyzing and improving interior-point algorithms. It
will also include developing computer routines for solving application problems
arisen in production scheduling and resource allocation.
