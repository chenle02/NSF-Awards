Rader This award supports the work of Professor Cary Rader in the general field
of Number Theory, in particular the Langland's program. Professor Rader is
attempting to develop a local harmonic analysis along the lines of Rallis and
Jacquet. This will provide additional tools to the study of automorphic forms.
Number Theory is the study of the properties of the whole numbers and is the
oldest branch of mathematics. From the beginning problems in number theory have
furnished the driving force to creation of new mathematics in almost all parts
of the discipline. The Langland's program is a general philosophy that connects
number theory with calculus. Modern number theory is very technical and deep,
but it has had astonishing applications in areas like theoretical computer
science and coding theory. ***
