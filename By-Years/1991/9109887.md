This is a Research Initiation Award dealing with implementation of a power
system dynamic security index. The index is the mean first passage time (MFPT)
required for a system to reach dynamic security limits when affected by a
contingency. The project will include a study of the relationship between MFPT
and the contingency selection problem.
