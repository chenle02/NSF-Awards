The objective of this research is to evaluate the static and dynamic interface
strengths of the soil-geomembrane- geotextile interfaces found in typical liner
systems. This objective will be accomplished by performing extensive torsional
ring shear tests on the various liner interfaces. A ring shear apparatus will be
used instead of a direct shear or pullout apparatus to allow for large
continuous shear deformation in one direction, constant cross- sectional area
during the test, thinner soil specimens permitting faster drainage and a
residual strength in better agreement with field case histories.
