Nervous systems encode and transmit information in the form of electrical
signals. At a cellular level, electrical impulses are generated and modulated by
a class of proteins that form ion channels. One class of ion channel proteins
that form calcium- activated potassium channels, will be studied. The PI has
cloned the gene, slowpoke, that codes for these channels in the fruit fly. A
number of different mRNA transcripts that code for slightly different proteins
are coded for by this gene. Using molecular techniques, a high resolution map of
the tissue and developmental expression of each of the gene products of slowpoke
in the nervous system of the fruit fly will be generated. This will be
correlated with the biophysical properties of the channels produced. In
addition, mutations in slowpoke which result in a unique 'sticky feet'
phenotypic behavior will be used to develop genetic screens to identify other
genes that control slowpoke gene expression. These studies promise to provide
important information on the molecular signals controlling expression of
proteins that form ion channels in nerve cells. Such information will be
relevant to understanding development and function in the nervous systems of
both invertebrates and vertebrates, including human.
