Dr. T. Douglas Price, with a team of American and Danish collaborators, will
conduct two years of preliminary archaeological research to set the groundwork
for a major, long term project. The team will undertake archaeological survey
and limited excavation in the Saltbaek Vig region of eastern Denmark. This area,
typical of southern Scandinavia, is known to contain sites from the "Mesolithic"
(terminal hunting and gathering) and "Neolithic" (early farming) periods. It has
excellent preservation of archaeological remains. During two field seasons, the
team will initiate an archaeological survey to locate and identify unknown
prehistoric sites. They will also record museum and amateur collections to
define and characterize assemblages that are already known, and they will
conduct paleoenvironmental studies in the area. These investigations will
constitute the first systematic survey for Stone Age sites in Denmark, help to
document changes in sea level, temperature and vegetation, and establish the
chronology and distribution of known sites, as the baseline for further
investigation. Approximately 5,000 years ago, Neolithic farmers appear suddenly
in southern Denmark, and they rapidly replace the Mesolithic hunter-gatherer
occupants. While this fact is clear, the mechanisms involved in this transition
are little understood. It is not known to what extent resident hunters and
gatherers were replaced by new populations or whether these groups rapidly
changed their subsistence practices when new techniques, plants, and animals
were made available to them. It seems that domestic plants and animals were slow
in coming to Denmark, but once they appeared, a rapid transition ensued. Dr.
Price and his colleagues will examine this change and try to understand the
mechanisms involved. The transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture
constitutes perhaps the single most important advance in human prehistory.
Within very short periods of time, many populations were exposed to a new mode
of subsistence and underwent rapid social transformation. By understanding this
process, anthropologists can gain new insight into the plasticity of human
social organization and the mechanisms involved in rapid social change. This
research will provide insight into societies in isolated parts of the world who
today are undergoing this same transformation.
