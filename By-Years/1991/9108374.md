The project involves planning activities for the design, synthesis, and study of
novel multimetallic complexes withdesirable light absorbing and electrochemical
properties. Mixed-metal multimetallic complexes of the platinum group metals
(Rh, Ir, Os, Ru) which incorporate polypyridyl bridging ligands will be
synthesized. These systems are expected to have very complex electronic spectra
and electrochemistry due to their multicomponent nature. The electronic spectra
will contain transitions well into the visible region of the spectrum, due
primarily to low energy metal-to-ligand charge transfer transitions. In
addition, intense pi-pi star transitions will be evident in the ultraviolet
region for all polypridyl ligands contained in the system. The electrochemistry
of these systems is expected to be dominated by metal-based oxidations and
bridging and nonbridging ligand- based reductions. For systems containing
rhodium or iridium, metal-based reductions are also expected at relatively low
potentials. Through the systematic variation of the metals as well as bridging
and non-bridging ligands, it will be possible to gain insight into the nature of
the photochemical and electrochemical processes. %%% Research Planning Grants
enable women who have not had prior independent Federal research support to
develop a competitive research proposal. This project involves the study of the
photochemical and electrochemical properties of metal complexes containing more
than one metal center. The knowledge gained in this study will enable better
design and preparation of mixed-metal complexes with specific light-absorbing
properties.
