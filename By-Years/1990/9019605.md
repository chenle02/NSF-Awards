This planning grant proposal is designed to evaluate the accuracy and precision
of a non-destructive sampling technique that would enable researchers to acquire
data on N partitioning and remobilization by periodically excising leaf discs
from the same leaves of individual plants. This could substantially reduce the
cost of time-course 15N experiments in terms of space and labor, while greatly
facilitating the acquisition of information to help assess the role of N in
plant strategies which result in increased productivity and resistance to
stressful environments. The proposed method would promote research in this area
and could be used simultaneously with 14C to enable study of C and N
partitioning and remobilization in diverse environments, genotypes and species.
The technique would be usable in field and controlled environments and could
prove to be a valuable screening tool useful with plant breeding if N
partitioning and remobilization are found to be one of the strategies which
provide adaptation to moisture stress either universally or in environments that
experience a specific type of drought.
