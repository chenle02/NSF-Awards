The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to alleviate
the pain and suffering to patients and the cost to the healthcare system caused
by pressure ulcers, or more commonly known as bedsores. Costs associated with
treating pressure ulcers have increased significantly in recent decades.
Individuals with a pressure ulcer are also at an increased risk of developing an
infection at the site of the wound. Notably, hospital-acquired advanced ulcers
are reportable to healthcare agencies and thus non-reimbursable, leaving
clinical entities absorbing all treatment and legal costs, in addition to a
decrease of their healthcare quality ratings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps
project will evaluate the commercial viability of a disposable, adhesive sensor
that provides nurses with actionable data about the status of their patients'
skin, thus eliminating the need for constant visual inspection. The device uses
optical sensing technology to monitor structural and functional changes that
occur both superficially and under a patient's skin to detect the earliest signs
of a pressure ulcer before they become visible to the human eye. In addition to
exploring marketability, this project will collect valuable information that
will guide potential product development in preparation to clinical validation.
