This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the
scientific and technical feasibility of introducing optical processing into
conventional scanning electron microscopes (SEM). The addition of localized and
site specific high photon flux offers the opportunity to enable a variety of
novel patterned materials processing options in these tools, including enhanced
deposition and etch processes at the nanometer scale.

The broader impact of this project opens up a broad array of new applications in
areas such as biology, medicine and nanotechnology.
