HRD-9703600 Parker The New York City Alliance for Minority Participation will
consist of seventeen campuses within The City University of New York (CUNY),
comprising both two-year and four-year colleges, and a university graduate
school, working together with private colleges, members of the business
community and national laboratories. The principal NYC AMP activities will
involve undergraduate and graduate science, mathematics, engineering,
technology, social/behavioral science, and educational initiatives that focus on
points in students; undergraduate and graduate experiences which are most
likely, without intervention, to precipitate a decision to drop out of the SMET
pipeline. Transitions from high school to college, from two-year college to
four-year college and into graduate school, as well as from graduate school into
research, teaching and industry will be addressed. Alliance activities will
include the initiation of new programs; institutionalization and expansion of
Phase I programs proven effective in one or more units of the university;
collaboration with related activities funded by state, private and other federal
sources; a significantly greater degree of coordination among the CUNY partners;
and greater involvement of outside partners. As a direct consequence of the NYC
AMP we expect to double the number of underrepresented students successfully
completing baccalaureate and graduate degrees in SMET, teacher preparation, and
social/behavioral science; conducting undergraduate and graduate research; as
well as obtaining positions in SMET K-12 and college teaching, research
institutions, and industry. The four main areas that will influence the increase
of underrepresented students through all points of the NYC AMP Network Pipeline
(se Appendix A) are TRANSITIONS, TEACHING, RESEARCH, and INTERDISCIPLINARY.
Broad and permanent institutional change is expected to come about as a result
of the focus on these four areas. The minority SMET e nrollment and degree
numbers reached at the end of Phase I of the New York City Alliance will serve
as the baseline figures for Phase II. Items listed in CUNY AMP's (Phase I)
Institutionalization Policy (see pages 2-3) will be adhered to. Furthermore, the
CUNY AMP (Phase II) budget will include the funds for a project administrator, a
senior administrative assistant, an administrative assistant, a student office
assistant, a newsletter editor, and an evaluation coordinator, as well as
seventeen CUNY graduate students who will serve as individual campus activity
coordinators. Approximately 74% of the NSF funds for NYC AMP (Phase II) will be
used for participant support costs.
