The objective of this research is to investigate a novel class of optical
tweezers which can trap and manipulate liquid droplets with large force. The
approach, termed optofluidic tweezers (OFT), is based on the photomechanical
conversion of light into 3-dimensionally confined thermocapillary microvortices
which align a droplet on the axis of a focused
laser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. OFT relies on capillary forces,
a mechanism fundamentally different from traditional optical tweezers. It can
attain forces in the ÂµN range, which is 100,000X larger than optical tweezers
and 1,000X larger than optoelectronic tweezers. This unique feature makes OFT a
potentially transformative approach for liquid manipulation over a wide range of
length scales. This research will build a fundamental understanding of the
energy transduction and trapping mechanism through the systematic study of flow
fields, temperature profiles, holding forces, geometric scaling, and material
properties. It will also create a prototype system for OFT-based
manipulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. Optical manipulation tools
are broadly used in biology, physics, and engineering, typically at the micro
and nanoscale. Due to its large force, OFT can extend these capabilities to the
millimeter scale, enabling new applications in electronics manufacturing and
lab-on-a-chip systems. This highly interdisciplinary project combines optics,
fluid dynamics, and interfacial phenomena, providing a unique platform for
training graduate and undergraduate students. The PI will leverage Wayne State
University?s established channels for recruiting underrepresented minorities.
The PI will also develop a ?jello microfluidics? module for Detroit Science
Center Nanodays, an NSF-sponsored program for nanoscale science education
targeted to K-12 students.
