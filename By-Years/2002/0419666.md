This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop an automated method for fabricating and analyzing microarrays without
the use of a robotic spotter. The method involves the use of a PDMS (poly-
dimethylsiloxane) microfluidic tool for depositing and interrogating linear
protein arrays with an interface to 96 well plates.

The commercial application of this project will be in the area of protein
microarrays for use in biological and pharmaceutical research.
