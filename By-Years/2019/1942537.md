Software pervades almost every aspect of the modern world, making software
reliability a large and growing societal concern. Automated program-analysis and
-verification technology aims to increase reliability, with minimal developer
effort, by providing software developers with tools to answer questions about
the behavior of their code. Since nearly all such questions are undecidable,
progress in program-analysis technology over the last fifty years has been
driven by heuristic reasoning techniques. These heuristics are often effective
in practice, but they can be brittle and exhibit counter-intuitive behavior,
making program analyzers to difficult to use. This project investigates the
question: how can program-analysis tools be defined whose behavior can be
understood and altered by software developers?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
builds foundations for usable program-analysis tools in order to deliver
behavioral and performance guarantees that software developers may rely upon. It
revisits three core program-analysis tasks -- numerical-invariant generation,
termination analysis, and shape analysis -- and develops dependable reasoning
principles to replace heuristics. The project contributes new program-analysis
algorithms and new automated theorem-proving technology to support these
analyses. By improving usability, the project aims to increase the scope and
impact of program analysis, with the ultimate goal of creating better, more
reliable software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
