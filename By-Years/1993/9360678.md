9360678 Cooper This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
will test and evaluate the use of interactive media: computer, textual, and
hands-on materials that illustrate professional activities in an engaging
"adventure" format in order to stimulate awareness and interest in science and
math-based careers and to inform students about professions in science and
engineering. The project pays special attention to underrepresented minorities
and girls in grades 3 to 5, including appropriate role-models and special
program information. Specifically, a CD-ROM computer program will use
interactive graphics, animation, sound effects, voice, and other techniques to
allow young people to assume the role of scientists and engineers, conducting
simple experiments and designing systems interactively, supplemented by hands-on
activity. Students will be shown how their school subjects relate to
professional activities. The educational product of this project will be a
computer-based motivational and instructional tool for commercial sale to school
districts, to be used in science and mathematics curricula. ***
