The primary objective of this research is to apply combined biomarker
molecular.structural/compound.specific isotopic analyses to study of a suite of
particulate samples and surface sediments from the Black Sea and the Sargasso
Sea. This project is aimed at demonstrating that compound.specific carbon
isotope compositions of particulate organic matter provide substantially more
information on the sources and processing of particulate matter in the water
column that can be obtained by bulk carbon isotopic measurements and lipid
biomarker distributions alone. New insight will be gained into the behavior of
particulate organic matter in two markedly different oceanic regimes: an
oxygenated oligotrophic water column (the Sargasso Sea) and a marine anoxic
basin (the Black Sea). These two sites are chosen because sample suites for
lipid biomarker and isotopic analyses are presently on hand. Particles from
these two locations will also have very different lipid distributions and should
likewise have different isotopic compositions. Thus, this study will not only be
determining the biomarker/isotope signatures of particles in a depth profile
from some location in the ocean but will also be comparing organism matter
processing in the very different environments.
