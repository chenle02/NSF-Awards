Viral communities of the Papua New Guinea avifauna

Migratory birds spreading avian flu, bats serving as SARS reservoirs, and the
spread of West Nile virus have highlighted the importance of epidemic disease in
today's globalized world. Understanding the processes that facilitate disease
spread in wildlife is crucial for conservation and human health. Using new and
previously collected samples from Papua New Guinea, the evolution and
distribution of viruses will be described. High throughput, metagenomic
sequencing will be conducted using blood samples and cloacal swabs collected
from hundreds of birds across 20 islands. The resulting data will be used to
assemble virus genomes and classify viruses. This information along with
information on island characteristics (i.e., size, isolation, human disturbance,
avian community) will be used to test hypotheses regarding the factors
underlying viral evolution and biogeography.

This work will provide critical insights into the importance of variation in
geography, human influence, and host species to the spread and distribution of
pathogens, and a basis for improving models of disease emergence. In conducting
this research, the Fellow will develop new quantitative, computational, and
laboratory skills, which will enhance her ability to develop, lead and carry out
a multi-faceted, cross-disciplinary research program on wildlife disease
ecology. In addition to conducting research, the Fellow will mentor
undergraduates through the California Academy of Sciences (CAS) Summer
Systematics Institute, and develop skills in teaching the public about science
through CAS's museum programs. This project will also provide excellent
opportunities for both minority undergraduate students in the Bay Area and Papua
New Guinea locals to learn to conduct research, allowing the Fellow to continue
to work towards her goal of broadening participation of minorities and women in
science.
