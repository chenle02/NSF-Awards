ABSTRACT JAMES LIBURDY CLEMSON UNIVERSITY CTS - 9500209 The proposal is to fund
the purchase of laboratory equipment under the Research Equipment Grant (REG)
program, and will provide an enhanced complementary holographic particle imagery
velocimetry (HPIV) and holographic interferometry (HI) facility for measuring
three-dimensional flows and thermal fields in systems of practical interest.
Particular applications will initially be to gas turbine film cooling and to
pulse combustors. The system will be in the Mechanical Engineering Department at
Clemson University.
