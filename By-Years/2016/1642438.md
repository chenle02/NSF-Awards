This award provides support for a CAREER proposal writing workshop that will be
held concurrent with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers annual design
conference. Approximately 200 young faculty will attend the workshop, which will
last a full day. The workshop will enable young faculty to better frame their
research and to write higher quality proposals. This will lead to better
research, more effective teaching and more effective use of NSF funds.

This workshop will be conducted on August 23, 2016, in Charlotte, North
Carolina. The workshop agenda includes a session on proposal writing best
practices, presentations by previous CAREER awardees, and a session of framing
research hypotheses and broader impacts.
