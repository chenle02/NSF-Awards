Abstract

Award: DMS-0805525 Principal Investigator: David Dumas

The principal investigator will explore complex projective structures on
surfaces and their applications to Teichmuller theory, Kleinian groups, and
hyperbolic 3-manifolds. The space of all complex projective structures on a
fixed surface is a contractible manifold which has two natural but very
different coordinate systems: A classical analytic approach uses the Schwarzian
derivative to identify the moduli space with a holomorphic vector bundle over
Teichmuller space, while a more recent geometric approach builds each projective
structure from hyperbolic and Euclidean pieces in a process known as grafting.
The major goals of this project are to understand the relation between these two
coordinate systems (both theoretically and using computer experiments), and to
use that understanding to study Teichmuller spaces and deformations of Kleinian
groups. The PI will also explore ways in which the techniques used to study
complex projective structures could be adapted to other low-dimensional
geometric structures, such as real projective structures.

The study of the shapes and configurations of geometric objects has applications
to diverse areas of science and engineering, from understanding the folding of
proteins or the formation of galaxies to programming autonomous robots that must
navigate complex terrain. In a mathematical abstraction of this type of problem,
one studies the space of all possible shapes, or "moduli space", of a geometric
object. This project focuses on the moduli space of complex projective Riemann
surfaces, a class of geometric objects that encode information about
3-dimensional spaces (hyperbolic manifolds) in 2-dimensional form. Through both
theoretical study and computational experiments, the PI will develop new tools
for analyzing these structures, enhance the connections between 2- and
3-dimensional geometry, and expand applications of these structures in related
fields. The project will also produce computer images of the moduli space,
displaying its rich structure and complexity in a way that can be appreciated by
scientists and non-scientists alike.
