A laboratory in Automated Data Collection and Identification (ADC&amp;I) is
being developed to provide students with experience in barcode, radio frequency,
magnetic stripe, machine vision, and voice recognition technologies and their
integration into industrial systems. Students gain familiarity with symbology
standards, print quality analysis methods, design of ADC&amp;I databases, design
of systems to track work-in-progress, and evaluation procedures for selecting
different ADC&amp;I technologies. This laboratory supports courses in CAD, CAM,
and Production &amp; Inventory Control. A separate course in Automated
Identification is planned for addition into the undergraduate engineering
curriculum.
