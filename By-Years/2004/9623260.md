9623260 W. B. Johnson and G. Pisier The proposers will investigate problems in
the theories of Banach spaces and operator spaces. The problems to be considered
involve: local theories of operator spaces and of spaces of measurable
functions, polynomially bounded operators, bounded homomorphisms on C* algebras,
infinite dimensional linear and nonlinear geometry of Banach spaces. Banach
space theory forms the natural framework for studying geometries which are not
Euclidean, while the theory of C* algebras is the standard framework for quantum
mechanics. Operator spaces are the quantization (in the sense of quantum
mechanics) of Banach spaces. This very new theory has already (e.g., in work of
Junge and Pisier) had an impact on C* algebras, and part of this work involves
approaching other classical problems in C* algebras/operator theory through
operator spaces. The nonlinear geometry of Banach spaces is also in a neophyte
stage, but work of Bourgain, Gorelik, Johnson-Lindenstrauss-Schechtman, and
others suggest that this subject is ready to take-off. There is reason to hope
that the nonlinear theory of Banach spaces will have applications in classical
nonlinear analysis comparable to the many applications of the linear theory to
classical linear analysis.
