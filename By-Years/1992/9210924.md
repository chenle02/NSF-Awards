This grant supports a search for 0> >> decay using large volume semiconductor
detectors fabricated from Ge which has been isotopically enriched to 86% in
76Ge. The detectors are designed to have ultra-low backgrounds from their
constituents and are to be operated in low backgorund underground laboratories.
The effort supported by this grant is that of a University of South Carolina
professor and his graduate students, working in collaboration (IGEX) with
scientists from the University of Minnesota, University of Zaragoza (Spain), The
Moscow Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics (ITEP), and The Baksan
Neutrino Observatory (Armenia), and the Pacific Northwest Laboratory.
