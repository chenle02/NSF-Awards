The principal investigator will work on the boundary lines of probability
theory and classical analysis. The process of interest is Doob's h process. It
is a conditional Brownian motion starting at a point in a domain and conditioned
to exit the domain at a given point or to hit a given point before exiting the
domain. The h processes have close connections to a number of non-probabilistic
quantities in several areas of analysis. Thus the study of h processes
simultaneously sheds more light on the probabilistic behavior of the conditional
Brownian motion and provides a vehicle to apply probabilistic results to various
area in analysis. The specific topics of study include martingale transforms,
connections between the Cranston-McConnell theorem and the first eigenvalue, and
the integrability of the first eigenfunction on unbounded domains.
