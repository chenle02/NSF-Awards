Doctoral student: Sarah W. Tracy; Dissertation Title: "The Medicalization of
Alcoholism in America, 1870-1919." Under the direction of Dr. Charles Rosenberg,
Ms Tracy is undertaking a socio-historical study of the late 19th and early 20th
century attempt to "medicalize" alcohol abuse and alcoholism, what was then
called inebriety. She is examining a random sample of patient records from the
Massachusetts Hospital for Dipsomaniacs and Inebriates at the Massachusetts
State Archives, newspaper accounts of the hospital found in The Foxborough
Reporter contained in the Foxborough Town Library, and the incompetency hearings
of inebriates from the New York County Court of Common Pleas contained in the
Division of Old Records at the New York County Clerk's Office in New York City.
These sources provide crucial insight into 1) the manner in which the medical
understanding of inebriety altered legal practice and social welfare policy; 2)
the validity of the social control hypothesis as a guiding principle in the
institutional treatment of inebriates; 3) the currency of the disease concept of
inebriety within urban judicial and social welfare systems; 4) the influence of
such variables as gender, ethnicity, and socio-economic status on the
classification and treatment of inebriates in a court of law and an institution
specifically for the management of people with alcohol problems. This study
promises significant contributions to the history of science and to our
understanding of social control processes and the interaction of law and
medicine. The data collected in this study will be placed in a social science
archive within one calendar year of the completion of this award.
