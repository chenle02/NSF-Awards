The four specific objectives to be defined are: (1) the role of melting and
subcloud layer evaporation in the creation of lower tropospheric inverted
troughs, (2) the effects of surface fluxes, melting, and lower tropospheric
evaporation on the structure, circulation, and amplification of a vortex-bearing
mesoscale convective system, (3) the differences between the large scale
environment of regions that experience numerous mesoscale convective complexes
(MCCs) and the environment of other convectively-active regions where MCCs
rarely occur, and (4) the global characteristics of MCCs and their contribution
to the global hydrologic cycle. The PIs expect to provide understanding of how
mesoscale cloud and precipitation processes interact with, contribute to, and
change their large scale environment.//
