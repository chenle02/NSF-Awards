The Washington State University will hold a planning grant meeting to become a
member of the multi-university Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
for Reinforcing Buildings and Bridges with Composites. The research team at
Washington State University has considerable experience in managing large
research teams. This will help to insure technical advances and industrial
successes in the research program of this proposed center. The unique
combination of materials development, codes and standards experience, and
structural expertise will benefit the interdisciplinary needs of the industry.
