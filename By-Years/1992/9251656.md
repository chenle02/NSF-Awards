This project intends to reshape the laboratory component of the Computer
Organization course and provide a model for such laboratories at other small
colleges. Instead of directing attention to programming a microprocessor the lab
will focus on the structure of computer components and the ways in which this
structure shapes the programming process. Through simulation students will
experiment with the construction of individual components, the interconnection
of those components, and the manner in which this affects the process of mapping
software into hardware. In order to support this means of educational
experimentation the project will acquire ten PC-level computers, printer, system
software, and a particular software package upon which to base the lab
experiments.
