The Computer Numerical Control (CNC) Technology Project is designed to address
the curricular need for providing undergraduate machining students and area
industry technicians with the opportunity to study advanced (up-todate) CNC
conversational programming applications. The specific project objectives are (1)
to implement up-to-date CNC conversational programming applications
incorporating additional CNC curriculum materials/courses into drafting and
design, general engineering, and machining programs and (2) to increase the
number of industries served and the number of area employees trained through the
efforts of the college's Center for Business and Industry and participation in
the Manufacturing Technology Consortium (MTC). The college seeks to implement
the curriculum reforms and industry training through the acquisition of a Mazak
Vertical Machining Center with Mazatrol M-Plus Control, a Mazak Quick Turn 10
Universal Lathe with Mazatrol T-Plus Control, and Mazatrol software for off-line
programming. The target audience for this project is community college students
enrolled in industrial/manufacturing technology programs and returning adult
students seeking to upgrade their skills in CNC programming applications. The
college is collaborating with four other area colleges and regional industries
through the MTC. This project broadens the base of both the college and the MTC
to provide advanced technological education to students in credit and noncredit
programs across a 17-county region of southwestern Virginia. *
