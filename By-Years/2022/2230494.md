As one of the most vexing problems of the century, we are witnessing the
escalating speed, scale, and level of sophistication of online deception (spear
phishing and catfishing scams, personal information hunting schemes, fake
content, impersonation, and disinformation on social media) that have severe
consequences (ransomware attack, financial loss, and breach of private
information). The most vulnerable demographic is older adults, who are
disproportionately targeted for online exploitation, manipulation, and fraud
resulting in significant financial loss and emotional distress. Deception
Awareness and Resilience Training (DART) aims to equip older adults with the
tools they need to recognize various forms of online deception and help others
in their social circle avoid or mitigate harm. Designed by experts in education,
psychology, communication, cybersecurity, and media studies, the DART curriculum
contains high-quality and timely synthetic contents and real-world scenarios.
The DART project team includes experts in psychology, communications and media,
economics, cybersecurity, computer science, game design, synthetic media, and
aging studies. DART deliverables will be developed by a professional development
team and tested with older adults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DART system consists
of two complementary components: (1) DART Learn: a web-based structured,
dynamic, and self-paced learning program on online deceptions. (2) DART
Practice: an interactive social media simulation that provides a safe and
realistic platform for the users to practice what they learned about online
deception. (3) DART Play: a set of simple, fun mobile Games on mobile platforms
(iOS and Android) designed to familiarize older adults with common
deceptions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
