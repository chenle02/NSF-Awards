A program is proposed to evaluate the feasibility of preparing ultrapure,
nanophase, monodispersed, spherical particles of silicon carbide in a combustion
synthesis process. In this process acetylene and silane are the "fuel" and
"oxidizer" in a flame for which the products are silicon carbide powder and
hydrogen gas. Once the flame is ignited, eg by an electric spark, it continues
to burn producing product. The product is collected in a liquid dispersant to
minimize agglomeration and to prevent oxidation of the very active newly formed
surfaces. The challenge is to produce a pure material with a negligible quantity
of free carbon or free silicon which are formed in excess acetylene or excess
silane mixtures, respectively.
