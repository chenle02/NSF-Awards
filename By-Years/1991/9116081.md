The Creede vein district is a world-class epithermal base metal sulfide deposit
associated with a large Tertiary caldera cluster in Colorado. Because the
sedimentary, diagenetic and hydrothermal history of the volcaniclastic sediments
filling the Creede caldera moat is critical to understanding the cycling of
fluids, sulfur and metals into the district vein mineralization, we propose a
comprehensive investigation of fine-scale (&lt;30 um) sulfur isotopic
systematics in the moat sediments using the SHRIMP ion microprobe. Microbeam
techniques of stable isotope analysis offer great insight into mineralizing
processes, because minerals contain more information concerning their origins
and subsequent modifications than can be obtained by conventional bulk isotopic
sampling and analytical techniques. The principal investigators will apply their
experience in resolving fine-scale sulfur isotopic variations in lacustrine and
volcanic environments to the Creede moat sediments, in cooperation with bulk
isotopic studies proposed by other Creede project scientists. In particular,
they will focus on microscopic sulfur isotope variations that record critical
sedimentary and diagenetic events, as well as any contribute towards an improved
Creede model, and will advance our understanding of the timing and interplay of
sedimentary, diagenetic and hydrothermal ore-forming processes in shallow
crustal environments.
