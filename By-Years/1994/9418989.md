Island arc/continental arc collisions are commonly invoked to explain orogenic
deformations in ancient mountain belts, but this type of collision is not well
represented in the modern oceans. This collaborative project between workers at
Yale University and Union College, will examine a well-exposed suture (thrust)
between an inboard convergent continental arc and an exotic late cretaceous
island arc (Olyutorsky terrane) to help resolve the kinematics expected in such
situations, later deformations of this suture appears minimal. Results should
provide a relatively clear data set that can be used to test several models for
the evolution of plates in the north Pacific during the late Cretaceous as well
as providing a relatively modern example of a continental arc/island arc
collision.
