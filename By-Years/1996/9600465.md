SBR-9707450 Michael F. Goodchild University of California, Santa Barbara This
award supports research-agenda-building, research-coordination, and
dissemination activities of one site of the National Center for Geographic
Information and Analysis for a three-year period. Substantively, activity will
focus on three scientific areas, each of substantial importance to geography and
the ability to analyze geographic data. The first, cognitive models of
geographic space, entails a set of research efforts to advance our understanding
of how people conceptualize geographic spaces. Such research is critical if we
are to optimize the utility of computer technologies to represent and manipulate
geographic data. The second area, computational implementations of geographic
concepts, aims to allow researchers to build computational models of geographic
spaces and of the social and environmental processes which operate in them. The
third research area is called geographies of the information society, and
entails conceptualization and investigation of the effects of emerging
information and communications technologies on the geography (location and
interaction) individuals, organizations, and societies. Activities will center
on the development of targeted research topics, calling of specialist meetings,
solicitation of proposals for very small seed grants for the development of
larger research proposals, and dissemination of agendas, results, and
educational materials. The Center will remain a focal point for research and
curricular development in geographic analysis.
