97-22915 Kende The work is based on physiological/ biochemical analysis of the
interplay between different plant growth regulators, ethylene, ABA, GA, in the
regulation of growth. The objectives of the continuing research include the
analysis of gene expression changes in response to GA, the primary mediator
stimulating growth. Included is an analysis of the role of expansins in the
elongation of deepwater rice internodes, and analysis of the action of ethylene
which stimulates elongation growth by promoting the turnover of ABA which would
otherwise inhibit growth. Finally, transformation of rice is being done to test
the function of the isolated genes, GA-induced, in transgenic rice.
