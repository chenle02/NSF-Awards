The project aims to study a number of well-known open problems in graph theory,
as well as new problems suggested by them. The proposed questions are all
related to the study of graphs with certain forbidden substructures. The line of
inquiry that guides the research is: what is the global difference between
general graphs and graphs that do not contain a particular substructure? These
problems have been open for a while, but the PI and her collaborators have
recently made progress on most of them. It is only now that a global picture is
coming to light, and it seems likely that methods used for some of the problems
can carry over to others. Exploring this crossover of ideas will undoubtedly
lead to the development of new methods and approaches that were too far out of
reach before, and are likely to allow further exciting developments.

The focus of the project is on the influence of excluding an induced subgraph
(or a family of them) on the structure of a graph. Specifically the PI and her
collaborators plan to explore the following aspects to this question: the
connections between the clique number and the chromatic number, the complexity
of the graph coloring problem, the structure of minimal obstructions to
colorability, the presence in a graph of large tightly structured subgraphs (the
Erdos-Hajnal conjecture and its variants), and more.
