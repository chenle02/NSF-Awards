A major challenge in cell biological research today is to understand how numbers
of component biological molecules interact within complex systems to carry out
fundamental cellular functions. Frequently these systems correspond to large,
nonsymmetrical structural assemblies, extending from thousands to tens of
thousands of angstroms within the cell, whose function is intimately related to
their underlying structural architecture, Newly developed techniques of electron
microscopy tomography and light microscopy optical sectioning are capable of
providing detailed 3-dimensional reconstructions of such assemblies at
overlapping resolution. This grant is for the acquisition of a light microscopy
optical sectioning workstation to complete an image analysis facility capable of
carrying out 3-dimensional reconstructions at both the light and electron
microscopy resolution level. The light microscopy station described will allow
3-dimensional structure determination within living cells and tissues. These
capabilities represent a vital resource to the research programs of the
facility's users. This research is focused on large-scale chromosome structure
and nuclear organization, the role of cytoskeleton and function in modulating
key events in Drosophila embryonic development (major users), the specific
structural coupling between the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton and
its regulatory role in cell growth, differentiation, and migration, and mapping
of neural networks (minor users).
