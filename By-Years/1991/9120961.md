Neurotransmitters and hormones are synthesized in specialized tissues and are
secreted from the cells of those tissues in response to environmental stimuli.
When secreted, these molecules provide signals to other cells which enable these
cells to adapt to the physiological conditions. The requirements of the cell for
increased or decreased amounts of transmitter or hormone changes with the
environmental status of the organism. The synthesis of neurotransmitters and
hormones is catalyzed by enzymes which are present only in those cells destined
to secrete the neurotransmitter or hormone. The focus of this study is to
understand the mechanism of biosynthesis of the enzyme which catalyzes the
synthesis of norepinephrine, a hormone and neurotransmitter which is important
for cardiovascular function and adaptation to stress. This enzyme, dopamine
beta-hydroxylase, is localized to the cellular secretory granule, which is the
compartment which stores the neurotransmitter. Within this compartment, the
enzyme is in two forms; one form is in the soluble contents of this granule,
while the other form is attached to the membrane which forms the boundary of the
granule. This research project will study the biochemical differences between
these two forms which are important for the different localizations. An antisera
will be prepared which specifically recognizes amino acid residue, which may be
present in the membrane-bound, but not the soluble portion of the protein. This
antisera will be used to monitor the presence of this segment on two forms of
the protein. The results of these experiments may uncover a novel mechanism of
protein biogenesis.
