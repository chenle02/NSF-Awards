This student travel grant supports graduate/undergraduate students enrolled in
US institutions to attend ACM Multimedia 2014 conference. ACM Multimedia is the
worldwide premier conference in the multimedia field, covering latest technical
papers, technical demos, grand challenge competition, open source software
competition, doctoral symposium. It is extremely valuable for US students to
take advantage of the unique research and education programs provided by this
conference. Participation in such event allows students to learn/experience
innovative research, develop professional networks, and interact with industry
and academia leaders involved in practical applications and technology transfer.

ACM Multimedia conference offers various activities which particularly benefit
students who are involved in research in this area. First, it hosts a Doctoral
Symposium which will provide PhD students to present their ongoing work and
receive feedback from established researchers. This also aims to establish a
supportive worldwide community, and build professional networks for PhD
students. Second, Multimedia Grand Challenges presents a set of problems and
issues from industry leaders, geared to engage the Multimedia research community
in solving relevant, interesting and challenging questions about the industry's
3-5 year vision for multimedia. Third, the ACM Multimedia Open-Source Software
Competition is designed to promote the contribution of freely available
resources, which advance the field by providing a common set of tools for
building and improving multimedia research prototypes. Finally, the large
Technical Demonstration session is intended as real, practical, and interactive
proof of the presenters' research ideas and scientific or engineering
contributions. This session allows students to demonstrate their own novel
research prototypes, and also to view and interact first hand with live evidence
of innovative solutions and ideas in the field of multimedia.
