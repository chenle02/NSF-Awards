This Research Planning Grant is part of the Research Opportunities for Women
program. The investigator, a cultural anthropologist from Shippensburg
University of Pennsylvania, will conduct pilot research on demographic processes
in the Greek Island of Chios. The basic problem is to understand variations in
population growth, as most areas of the developed world have dropped from high
to low growth. This island represents a good natural laboratory for this
research because there are several immigrant groups with different social and
economic histories. Methods will include analysis of birth and death records and
in- depth interviews with household members on their family plans as well as
surveys of economic and agricultural activities. The purpose of the grant is to
help young female investigators establish their research projects so that they
can write competitive major research grants.
