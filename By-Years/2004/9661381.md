This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a non-
destructive inspection (NDI) method for remote diagnostics of critical
structural components such as mechanical fasteners (bolts, welds, rivets, etc.)
or advanced materials (composites). Utilizing an impedance based approach,
damage in critical structural components or advanced materials can be detected
by periodic remote inspection without removing the structural component or
making costly visual inspection. By attaching small piezoceramic transducer
materials (such as PZT wafers) to the components of interest, damage can be
detected by changes in the structural impedance. Impedance monitoring is
especially facilitated by the use of the PZT wafers which can simultaneously
activate and sense structural response. PZT wafers respond mechanically to
electric signals, producing a small deformation in themselves and the structure
to which they are attached (host structure). The electrical impedance
(voltage/current) of the PZT wafer therefore has a direct correlation to the
mechanical impedance of the component. Should the components mechanical
impedance change from damage or variations of the properties, the periodic
remote inspection of the PZT electrical impedance will manifest the variation.
The impedance method for remote NDI of critical structural components will have
value as an inexpensive and labor-saving inspection method for critical bolts
and other fasteners in aerospace and civil infrastructure applications. A family
of fasteners for off-the-shelf application in such structures will also be
developed with the NDI sensors in-place to provide a means for designers to
include readily inspectable parts into structural designs.
