Computers (Apple IIsi) and software (both simulations such as Bioquest material
and scientific writing software such as CA- Cricket, Superpaint and Microsoft
Works) are used to supplement hands-on laboratories with appropriate computer
simulations and to give students greater flexibility in graphing, analyzing and
presenting their laboratory results. Student independently formulate and solve a
scientific problem, critically evaluate their data and report their experiments
in a journal format. The equipment is used in four courses; Cell Physiology,
Animal Physiology, Genetics, and Cell and Molecular Biology. The computers will
supplement HPLC and spectroscopy equipment obtained through an earlier ILI
grant.
