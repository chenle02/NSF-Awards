Abstract - Ydstie - 9726115 Distributed Processing Units (DPU's) pick up
information as needed to perform control calculations, local optimization, data
reconciliation, filtering and/or dynamic simulation. Processing speed and
reliability are high due to parallelism and redundancy - a distributed system
can continue to function even if a "stable" DPU goes down. Distributed
computation makes it easy to update hardware and software. Members of an
engineering team can change process equipment and modify control algorithms in
sequence or parallel without loosing stability. Control systems in industry are
distributed for reasons of computational efficiency, safety and cost. The PI's
plan to develop systematic procedures and computational tools for the synthesis
of distributed control systems. The research will address the following
problems: (1) how to design distributed control systems; (2) how to perform
dynamic simulation in a distributed network of computers; and (3) how to address
the interaction between design and control. The broader aim is to develop a
theoretically consistent and workable theory for chemical process control which
takes into account the process physics in an effective manner.
