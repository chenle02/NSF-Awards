This project is in the general field of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of ion beam/solid surface interactions. A new instrumental
technique will be developed from time of flight analysis of scattered and
recoiled neutral and/or ionic species from a solid surface bombarded with ions
of 0.1 - 5.0 kiloelectron volt energies. This technique will permit
determination of surface atomic structure and electron density distributions in
a single experiment. Systems to be investigated include clean and adsorbate
covered surfaces of metals, semiconductors, and inorganic salts and oxides. This
new surface analytical technique is 100 to 1000 times more sensitive than
conventional ion scattering spectrometries, is highly surface sensitive (two
atomic layers) and can detect light elements such as hydrogen. It will markedly
extend current knowledge of the chemistry and physics of surfaces.
