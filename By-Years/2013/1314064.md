In this Award from the NSF Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability
Fellows (SEES Fellows Program), Dr. Chinmay Soman from the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will investigate how the soil microbiome is
influenced by different kinds of agricultural practices. This award has support
from: the Directorate for Biological Sciences, the Directorate for Geological
Sciences, and the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will combine modern genetic
measurements of the soil microbiomes of agricultural land subject to a variety
of agricultural practices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of studies like that
proposed in this work is to help inform efforts to develop methods for
sustainable agriculture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Soman will be working with
collaborators Prof. Angela Kent of the Department of Natural Resources and
Environmental Sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as well
as Prof. Zhili He, Associate Director of the Institute for Environmental
Genomics at the University of Oklahoma. The work will also include the efforts
of: Prof. Amy Ando with the Department of Agricultural and Consumer Economics;
Prof. Richard Mulvaney with the Department of Natural Resources and
Environmental Sciences; and Prof. Luis Rodriguez with the Department of
Agricultural and Biological Engineering, all at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported under the NSF
Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability Fellows (SEES Fellows)
program, with the goal of helping to enable discoveries needed to inform actions
that lead to environmental, energy and societal sustainability while creating
the necessary workforce to address these challenges. With SEES Fellows support,
this project will enable a promising early career researcher to establish
themselves in an independent research career related to sustainability.
