Cells use growth factors to communicate with each other and to instruct many
different cellular behaviors during animal development. These growth factors
must be tightly controlled over space and time to ensure that their instructions
reach the appropriate target cells but are not given to inappropriate cells;
otherwise, abnormal development will result. This project tests the hypothesis
that lipocalins are direct modulators of growth factor signaling. Lipocalins are
a large family of proteins found throughout the animal kingdom and implicated in
small molecule transport, but their functions are poorly understood. Preliminary
studies in the simple invertebrate organism Caenorhabditis elegans suggest that
the lipocalin LPR-1 facilitates growth factor signaling during organ
development, and may help retain this growth factor near its appropriate target
cell. To understand the mechanisms underlying this regulation, the experimental
aims are to: 1) Test if LPR-1 directly binds to any or all forms of the growth
factor, using a combination of biochemical and transgenic studies; 2) Identify
which parts of the LPR-1 protein are important for function, using transgenic
studies; and 3) Identify other potential partners of LPR-1, using genetic
screens. If LPR-1 acts as proposed, it should bind to the growth factor, and
loss of the relevant binding domain should eliminate function. LPR-1 may also
bind to other partners that help anchor it in place. These studies will provide
significant new insights into how lipocalins function and uncover a novel
mechanism of growth factor regulation that may be broadly relevant to other
systems. The experiments will establish a new scientific collaboration and the
project will provide training activities for a postdoctoral fellow and for
multiple undergraduate students interested in scientific careers.
