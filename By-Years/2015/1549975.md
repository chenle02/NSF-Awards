This project was submitted in response to the Dear Colleague Letter for Hispanic
Serving Institutions "Stimulating Research on Effective Strategies in
Undergraduate STEM Education at Two-Year Hispanic Serving Institutions,"
NSF15-078. It is implementing a suite of educational approaches for rising STEM
majors at Miami-Dade College InterAmerican Campus in partnership with Fairchild
Tropical Botanic Garden. These experiences are built around two evidence-based
teaching modalities applied to introductory STEM courses and authentic 8-week
research experiences in biology. The impact of this combination of approaches on
improving the retention of Hispanic students in STEM fields is largely untested
in a Hispanic Serving community college environment. Such colleges are
particularly important to the high education of Hispanic students. The teaching
modalities are Peer Led Team Learning (PLTL) and Process-oriented Guided Inquiry
Learning (POGIL). The project will provide early research immersion in plant
biology/environmental science alongside supportive services such as peer
tutoring, faculty mentoring, science lectures, research presentations, and other
activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will determine the impact of these
high-impact educational approaches and redesigned science curricula to engage
and motivate students to persist and achieve in STEM fields.
