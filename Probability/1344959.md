This proposal is to support participation of mathematicians based in the United
States to the quarter program "Random Walks and the Asymptotic Geometry of
Groups" to be held at Institut Henri Poincare (IHP) in Paris, France, from
January 3rd to April 6th, 2014. This program is concerned with the theory of
random walks on groups and its relations and interactions with combinatorial and
geometric group theory. The aim of the program is to provide an introduction to
this area of research and its most recent developments, to review and
disseminate recent progress and to stimulate the emergence of new ideas and
directions of research. Some of the activities are aimed specifically at
researchers at the beginning of their career and at people who have no prior
specific knowledge of this area of research. Other activities are aimed at
specialists. Most of the activities will focus on recent developments and new
directions of research. The program's website is available at
