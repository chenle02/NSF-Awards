The electrochemical actuation method based on water electrolysis is used to
achieve three novel functionalities; one-point self-calibration (zero-point),
extension of linear detection range, and increase in sensitivity. Two kinds of
oxygen microenvironments (oxygen-depletion and constant oxygen) can be
established by using an integrated electrochemical actuation system around the
glucose microsensor. The effect of these two microenvironments on the enzymatic
reaction kinetics (oxygen dependency of glucose oxidase reaction) is expected to
provide the novel functionalities. The amperometric glucose microsensors are
fabricated on a flexible polyimide substrate (Kapton or Upilex ) using
integrated circuit technology. The specific objectives are (1) optimization of
device structure (geometries of microsensor and microactuator) and actuation
signals (magnitude and duration of electrochemical current) to obtain the novel
functionalities, (2) development of a smart calibrator based on the stochastic
algorithm, and (3) implementation of array to improve
reliability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI has a joint appointment in the
Departments of Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering and Biological Sciences at
the University of Missouri-Rolla (UMR). The primary responsibility of the PI is
to bridge the gap between the two disciplines through interdisciplinary research
activities and education of the students from both departments. The on-campus
Minority Engineering Program (MEP) includes offering of freshman/transfer
scholarship, hosting seminars on career and educational opportunities, and
sponsoring minority engineering student organizations. UMR runs Women in
Engineering and Science Program (WIES) and supports a female engineering student
organization to increase the number of female graduates entering our nation's
technical workforces.&lt;br/&gt;
