This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes the development
of novel near-infrared coherent light sources. The approach consists of the use
of novel means to convert the power of a continuous- wave (CW) multi-watt pump,
such as derived from an erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA), or ytterbium- doped
fiber amplifier (YDFA), to a wavelength range where high CW powers are currently
not available. The output power will be available via an optical fiber. The
wavelength conversion will have high efficiency, of the order of tens of
percents. Output power will initially reach several Watts, with possible
extension up to several hundred Watts. By this approach, we could in principle
make powerful coherent light sources in many wavelength ranges where none have
been previously available, in the broad range of 800 to 1800 nm. Each source
will be tunable over several hundred nanometers. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;These
light sources should find applications wherever high-power CW coherent sources
are &lt;br/&gt;Needed. Possible areas of application are: laser surgery,
photodynamic therapy, heat treatment, and laser machining, remote sensing,
spectroscopy, etc. &lt;br/&gt;
