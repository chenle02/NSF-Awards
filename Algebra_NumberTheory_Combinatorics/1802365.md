This award provides partial participants support for a conference to be held at
Harvard University on June 4-8, 2018. While the central focus will be on the
recent developments in number theory, the conference will also promote dialogue
and interaction between number theory and other disciplines.

The conference will feature research-level talks from a range of distinguished
mathematicians, mostly (but not entirely) working in various areas of number
theory, including the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, Galois representations
and modularity, Iwasawa theory, and Diophantine equations (just to name some of
them), and the talks at the conference will present the latest developments in
many of these fields. More details can be found at the conference website:
http://www.math.harvard.edu/conferences/mazur18.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
