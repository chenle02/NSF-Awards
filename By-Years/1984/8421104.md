The research problems in this computer-related study fall into three main
subjects: unidirectional error codes, asymmetric error codes, and totally self-
checking circuits. Specific topics to be explored include: systematic
t-unidirectional error detecting codes; burst unidirectional error detecting
codes; burst asymmetric error detecting codes; t-error correcting and
d(d>t)-unidirectional error detecting codes; totally self-checking (TSC)
circuits; and other related problems.
