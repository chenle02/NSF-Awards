RFB is undertaking a program that will upgrade its capacity to meet the
increasing demand by its blind borrowers, particularly at the pre- college
level, for taped books in mathematics, science and technology. To accomplish its
program RFB has entered into a partnership with the American Association for the
Advancement of Science for the purpose of finding scientists who will record
these books as volunteers in our 29 studios across the country. RFB will also
establish a new studio to specialize in recording these books. And it has
selected several of its established studios to put more emphasis in recording
such books. The staff of RFB studios will be increased and trained to handle the
additional work involved.
