The intended three-year project will produce a robust Professional Development
package for school districts to support the implementation of the middle school
curriculum, "Constructing Ideas in Physical Science (CIPS)." The package will
include a program to engage teachers in 120 hours of substantive professional
development over a period of two years. The materials will consist of a weeklong
"getting started" workshop to introduce teachers to CIPS, materials for seven
follow-up workshops, a CIPS user's site and two CIPS discussion forums. The
follow-up workshops address teachers' emergent needs during the first two years
of teaching CIPS and introduce and support the use of the users site and forums.
The latter will support web-based discussions about science teaching, student
learning and physical science. The package will be developed by an experienced
team of university physical science education researchers, middle school science
teachers and other experts, and will be piloted and field tested at three large
school systems throughout the United States. Project evaluation will include
classroom observations for the purpose of monitoring teacher practice and
student learning.
