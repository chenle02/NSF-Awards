The focus of robotics research has shifted to the development of a unified
operating environment for coordinating several hardware and shofware components
for a variety of tasks. Two problems are revealed from this shift of focus:
reconfiguration of the control system architecture and reprogramming the control
system for new functionalities and new applications. A similar shift has
occurred in communication network protocol design from one designing controllers
that implement a single protocol to one controllers that can support a variety
of protocols. The aim of this activity is to achieve advances in control system
reconfiguration and reprogramming through a cross-fertilization of ideas from
robotics control and communication protocol research. This will be achieved by
bringing closer together the robotics and communication network research groups
at Berkeley and LAAS, Toulouse.
