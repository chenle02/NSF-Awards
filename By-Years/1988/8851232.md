This award will provide funds to revitalize a teaching laboratory in the
Department of Psychology which was initiated a decade ago to improve the breadth
and scope of its undergraduate curriculum. The lab offers eight undergraduate
laboratory courses to its 900 majors in a shared microcomputer-based teaching
facility. Funds will be used to replace its once state of the art, but now worn
out microcomputer with powerful and flexible modern equipment. While the
instructional programs currently in use in all eight courses can be quickly
migrated to execute on the new equipment, the focus of the effort will be on the
Laboratory in Cognition, which served as the prototype for the other courses. In
this effort, the Project Director will incorporate the major enhancements to the
curriculum that he is completing for CONDUIT (but cannot be implemented on
current equipment) and will endeavor to push the field ahead by using new
technology to devise laboratory experiences that were not previously feasible.
After appropriate evaluation and testing, these new instructional materials will
be widely disseminated. The grantee institution is matching this NSF award with
funds from non-Federal sources.
