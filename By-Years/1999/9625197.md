ABSTRACT EEC-9625197 In order to provide the advantages of electronic meeting
technology to the 55 I/UCRCs, the Industry/University Cooperative Research
Center for Information Management has embarked on a project to install Group
Systems software at the 55 Centers. The Center for information Management
envisions that the future Industrial Advisory Board meetings may take advantage
of video, audio, and data links, supported through Group Systems technology, to
enable participation by Board members without the need for travel from their
regular business. Board members from their desktops, will take full part in
meetings using these tools. Future Center Director's meetings might also be able
to take advantage of this technology to enable Center Directors with competing
commitments to scamlessly attend and fully participate.
