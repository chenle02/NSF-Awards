The fine-scale structure of currents and internal wave field will be measured
in the upper 200 m of the Pacific Ocean along a North- South transect (Line
P-13) as part of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE). The measurements
will be made with a newly developed coherent Doppler current profiler and a very
accurate navigation system. This study will provide an exciting snapshot of the
upper 300 m showing the importance of wind-driven currents, mesoscale eddies,
internal and inertial waves relative to the mean circulation. This novel
approach could change the way we view variability in the upper ocean on a basin-
wide scale.
