After the spectral theorem it is difficult to think of a theorem that has had a
more profound effect on the development of operator theory and its many
applications to mathematics and science than the Sz.-Nagy Dilation Theorem. The
idea of representing a general operator in a specified class of operators as a
part of a nice operator in the class has had many successes and we seek to
develop this point of view with a primary focus on unsolved problems in matrix
theory, operator theory, the theories of functions in one and several complex
variables, and the development of holomorphic function theory on analytic
varieties. One group of problems that we propose to investigate involve the
generalizations to several complex variables of classical moment and
interpolation problems on the unit disc such as the interpolation theorem of
Nevanlinna and Pick, and the moment theorems of Caratheodory and Herglotz.
Another group involves extending the Caratheodory-Julia Theory to several
variables with a long term goal of building a geometric approach to the boundary
regularity of holomorphic mappings. Research intrinsic to operator theory that
we will undertake includes issues involving model theory in one variable on non-
simply connected domains in the plane and in several variables on domains other
than the bidisc as well as the generalization to several variables of the work
of Loewner on operator monotone functions.

Operator Theory, the particular type of mathematics that we are proposing to
investigate, has direct and concrete benefits for a number of areas of human
endeavor. For example, the model theory aspects of our proposal all involve the
generalization of the Commutant Lifting Structure which leads to an efficient
algorithm for the discovery of oil from acoustical data taken on the surface of
the earth. Other aspects would add to the theory of Linear Matrix Inequalities
and Quadratic Programming. Linear Matrix Inequalities and Quadratic Programming,
are a far reaching extension of Linear Programming, which has made large scale
resource allocation and economic prediction possible. In addition, to being a
powerful tool in engineering, they have been used to develop state of the art
algorithms for global positioning with incomplete sensor location data .
Finally, the particular brand of function theory we propose to study, forms the
mathematical core of the H-infinity control theory, which has been used to
design control systems for fusion reactions inside Tokamaks and feedback
stabilization systems for the space shuttle.
