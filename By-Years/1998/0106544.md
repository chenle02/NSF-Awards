Abstract for proposal EAR0106544 (PH # 50x)

Title: Structure and Dynamics of Earth's Core and Lowermost Mantle

PI's: Xiaodong Song, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

This proposal is to conduct research in the following related areas concerning
the structure and dynamics of Earth's core and lowermost mantle. (1) The study
will seek to constrain the inner core rotation using differential PKP travel-
time measurements and joint inversion of inner core rotation and fine lateral
structure of inner core and lower mantle. This study will also address
uncertainties in determining inner core rotation, in particular the possibility
of systematic biases from event mislocation. (2) This study will seek to
constrain fine structure of the inner core by modeling of detailed waveforms and
increasing lateral samples of various depths of the inner core. (3) This study
will seek to constrain the structure of lowermost mantle by using differential
travel times and waveforms of seismic core phases, which remove or reduce biases
from upper mantle heterogeneities and source uncertainties
