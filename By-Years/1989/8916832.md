The PI will concentrate on three problems across the broad spectrum of
questions awaiting to be addressed by paleointensity studies: (1) to examine the
question of long-term intensity variations in the Mesozoic, in particular the
recent independent suggestions of persistent low intensity from 180 to 120 Ma
and of unusually high intensity during the Cretaceous Normal Superchron; (2) to
determine the paleointensity before, during, and after the Matuyama-Brunhes
polarity reversal using samples of lavas from Maui that have provided us with a
detailed directional record; (3) to test modifications to Thellier's method
intended to increase the reliability and speed of paleointensity determination
with a new paleointensity apparatus that we have designed and are currently
building.
