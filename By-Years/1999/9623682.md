w:\awards\awards96\*.doc 96-23682 Ketterson External dynamic probes with
frequencies of the order of the energy gap will be used to study the excitation
spectrum of the unconventional superfluids Helium-3 and UPt3. The probes will be
microwaves and ultrasound for UPt3, and an oscillating magnetic field and
ultrasound for Helium-3. The temperature dependence of the microwave impedance
of Upt3 will be studied using a recently developed variable-frequency,
cryogenic, microwave spectrometer. This will allow determination of the
temperature-dependent energy gap and will enable a search for collective modes
in this material. Helium-3 shear waves and their interaction with collective
modes will be investigated using a unique variable- path-length sound cell
developed in this laboratory. Finally, a search will be performed for evidence
of interaction between an oscillating magnetic field and various collective
modes in Helium- 3. %%% Superconductivity is finding on increasing number of
applications, including high-field magnets, sensitive magnetic- field detectors
and high-speed computers. Most of the present interest surrounds the high-
temperature superconductors. These materials, which may be referred to as
unconventional superconductors, are thought to derive their properties from
mechanisms that differ from those found in conventional superconductors. Two
other classes of materials also show unconventional behavior: the rare isotope
of helium (Helium-3) and a uranium-platinum compound (UPt3). These materials are
of unique scientific interest as well as being testing grounds for developing an
understanding of other non-conventional superconductors (including the high-Tc
materials). This project will employ high-frequency probes, including microwaves
and ultrasound, to study excitation phenomena in these mat erials and thence
derive an understanding of the unconventional nature of their superconductivity
