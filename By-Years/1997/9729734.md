9729734 Schaefer This project involves the combination of solid-state, magic-
angle spinning, dipolar-recoupling NMR experiments, with generalized Langevin
dynamics simulations, for the characterization of the chain motion of a new
generation of engineering polymers. The polymers are based on polycarbonate-like
structures that have enhanced mechanical or optical properties. The NMR is used
to measure interchain distances that act as constraints on the molecular
dynamics simulations. This combination of experiment and theory should lead to a
better understanding of the connection between microscopic chain motion and
macroscopic polymer properties. The specific systems whose chain dynamics will
be investigated are: (i) polycarbonates with specifically fluorinated phenyl
rings; (ii) high-Tg polycarbonate-polyester block copolymers; (iii) non-linear
hyperbranched polycarbonates; and (iv) polycarbonates with main and side-chain
cyclohexyl rings. %%% The polymers that will be characterized by solid-state NMR
and molecular dynamics simulations in this proposal are of current interest to
industry. A tough, cheap replacement for polycarbonate that has a lower
birefringence to enable more information to be packed on compact disks is a
commercial goal for a number of industries.. The ability to combine theory and
experiment in fundamental work on problems that also are of great practical
interest guarantees an efficient transfer to the American materials industry of
the basic polymer science and technology developed at Washington University
under NSF sponsorship. ***
