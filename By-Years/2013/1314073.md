In this Award from the NSF Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability
Fellows (SEES Fellows Program) Dr. Robby Q. Cuthrell from the University of
California - Berkeley will explore how Traditional Resource and Environmental
Management (TREM) practices can be re-implemented to manage lands more
sustainably. This award has support from: the Directorate for Biological
Sciences, the Directorate for Geosciences and the Directorate for Social,
Behavioral and Economic Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will:
(1) incorporate archaeological biological data into the "Predictive Biosystems
Informatics Engine," an integrative database that synthesizes ecological
modeling, ecosystems dynamics and human-environmental interactions; (2) conduct
integrative historical ecological research on indigenous resource use and TREM
practices in California; and (3) bring together multiple stakeholders (public
agencies, researchers and descendent communities) to develop, implement, and
evaluate the sustainability implications of TREM-based management of California
public lands. The work concentrates on the land in the greater San Francisco Bay
Area of California.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of studies like that supported
in this award is to develop sustainable land management
methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Cuthrell will be working with collaborators
Prof. Kent Lightfoot of the Department of Anthropology, at the University of
California - Berkeley and Dr. Joshua Collins at the San Francisco Estuary
Institute, and additional collaborators at the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum, the
Berkeley Initiative in Global Change Biology, the State of California's
Department of Parks and Recreation and the Amah Mutshun Tribal Band.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported under the NSF Science,
Engineering and Education for Sustainability Fellows (SEES Fellows) program,
with the goal of helping to enable discoveries needed to inform actions that
lead to environmental, energy and societal sustainability while creating the
necessary workforce to address these challenges. With SEES Fellows support, this
project will enable a promising early career researcher to establish themselves
in an independent research career related to sustainability.
