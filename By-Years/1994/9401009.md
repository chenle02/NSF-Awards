9401009 Berkson The investigations seek to develop a broad abstract operator
theory which expands the role of harmonic analysis in the structures of general
analysis. In this program, the powerful methods of harmonic analysis will be
harnessed to operator theory by expanding the theory and scope of transference
methods. These investigations constitute a fertile ongoing program of
fundamental research which has been successfully applied to numerous disciplines
in recent years. The directions and themes will include the following mainstream
topics: multiplier theory and transference of maximal estimates for Fourier
multipliers; wavelet decompositions for Fourier multipliers; interpolation
methods and transference; ergodic theory; abstract spectral decompositions. The
planned research will seek a wide unified overview of mathematical applications.
Historically such an approach is crucial to disciplines such as quantum physics,
which rely for their explication on broad abstract principles of mathematics.
