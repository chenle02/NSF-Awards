Shvydkoy&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1210896&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The most pressing
mathematical issues arising in fluid dynamics are becoming increasingly
intertwined with the statistical theory of turbulence. The Navier-Stokes and
Euler equations have served as the primary tools for numerical modelling, yet
the very basic question of whether they can actually produce solutions
satisfying laws of turbulence has not been settled. In recent years, with the
advances of topological methods and better understanding of the nonlinear
structure of the equations, this problem, commonly known as the Onsager
conjecture, has come within our reach. The underlying theme of this project is
to develop an analytical approach for studying statistical properties of
deterministic solutions. The focus is on finding stationary energy dissipative
weak solutions of the Euler and active scalar equations in the Onsager-critical
regularity class, developing rigorous fractal analysis of the empirical concept
of intermittency as a volumetric measure of non-uniformity of the Richardson
cascade, excluding extreme deviations from the classical Kolmogorov laws as
shown by the vast experimental data, and establishing links between
intermittency and the global regularity problem. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Turbulence is a complex chaotic process of fluid motion that commonly happens
when a stirring force, like heat from the sun or an airplane cutting fast
through air, injects a lot of energy into the system. This motion gets so
complicated and rough that a part of the kinetic energy gets lost, creating what
is known as anomalous dissipation. In our lives we can see this dissipation
responsible, for example, for creation of additional drag in the turbulent wake
of an airplane or our cars. In order to improve energy efficiency it is
therefore essential to understand the mechanisms behind the process of anomalous
energy loss and the reasons why it arises. In this project the investigator
develops mathematical foundations of this aspect of turbulence based directly on
the governing equations of fluid motion. A particular emphasis is given to
studying non-uniformity of energy dissipation, which allows identifying regions
where it occurs the most. An integral part of the project is developing the
analytical and computational skills of graduate and undergraduate students.
