This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will digitize
and provide internet access to over 2000 Alaska Native language interview tapes-
recorded under the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act and another 2000
plus recordings selected from the 5000 held by the Alaska Native Language
Archive. Represented in the collection are all of the Alaska Native languages
and because most of the collection was recorded in the 1960?s and 1970?s with
some as early as the 1940?s, the tapes represent the languages spoken prior to
subsequent erosion or language shift to English. No other collection represents
this diversity of language, nor the diversity of speech of Alaskan Native
languages that these two collections capture. Because the recordings are on
analog tapes, they are at serious risk of deterioration and loss. Digitizing the
collection will not only preserve it but the project also will increase access,
especially for speech communities and heritage learners, to the language
materials - which are presently accessible only by traveling to Anchorage or
Fairbanks and listening to them in their current archive storage facilities.
