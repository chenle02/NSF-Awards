This project explores the membranes of the thermoacidophilic archaebacteria and
the acidophilic thiobacilli. These bacteria live in harsh environments including
low pH (2-4) and high temperature (50-70C). Due to the unusual aspects of such
environments it is hypothesized that they will have unusual membranes which
allow them to survive at extremes of pH and temperature. In fact, it is known
that the archaebacteria as a group do not have normal ester lipids but rather
tetraether lipids. The foundation of the proposal is that the unusual nature of
the membranes of these bacteria will provide lipids and ion transport proteins
distinct from those in eukaryotic membranes. These differences will be
informative in understanding both the cell biology of these bacteria and the
function of eukaryotic lipids and ion transport proteins. This project proposes
to use the expertise in two laboratories to study the lipids and proteins in the
membranes of these bacteria. This project comprises two sub-projects, one on ion
transport proteins in Dr. Smith's laboratory and the other on lipids and lipid
protein interactions in Dr. Chong's laboratory as outlined below. Sub-project 1:
Identification and characterization the membrane ATPases associated with
transmembrane ion transport in acidophilic thiobacilli and thermoacidophilic
archaebacteria. The goals of this sub- project are to: 1. Screen the membranes
of various strains of archaebacteria and acidophilic thiobacilli for ion
translocating ATPases using immunologic and enzymatic assays. 2. Characterize
the ATPase activities found in specific aim 1, with regard to inhibitor
specificity, pH optima, cation transport and kinetic properties. 3. Purify of
some of the proteins associated with the ATPase activities described in specific
aims 1 and 2. Particular emphasis will be placed on P-type ATPases. Sub-project
2: Characterization of the physical properties of membranes comprised of
tetraether lipids isolated from thermoacidophilic archaebacteria. In this sub-
project: 1. Steady-state and dynamic fluorometry will be employed to investigate
the lateral motion of pyrene-labeled lipids and the rotational motion of
diphenylhexatriene (DPH) and perylene in tetraether lipid membranes. 2. The
lateral and rotational motions of small molecules in tetraether lipid membranes
as a function of pressure will be studied using high pressure fluorometry. 3.
Fluorometry and conventional biochemical methods will be used to study the
topology of archaebacterial (Na+,K+)- type ATPase in tetraether lipid membranes.
