This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project will determine
computational feasibility of a novel biologically grounded model of supervisory
control. The model, called virtual neuronal network, is based on the available
data on supervisor cognitive behavior in complex systems, and applies recent
theories of neuronal processes to account for the differences in expert and
novice performance. The objective of the project is to develop a neuro-
controller capable of approximating expert performance in multi-objective, time-
constrained tasks. Though some aspects of the model have been validated earlier
in different applications, feasibility of the integrated model still needs to be
established. Phase I will develop and integrate parts of the virtual neuronal
network, and will investigate network performance in sample control problems of
realistic size and complexity. Phase II will design and build an efficient
neuro-controller for complex systems.
