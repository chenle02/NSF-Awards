This EAGER proposal is potentially a high risk high payoff effort as it
involves a transformative, new approach to reduce non-specific protein-membrane
surface interactions. Recently the PI discovered that membrane surface chirality
influences filtration with protein solutions. A molecule is considered chiral if
there exists another molecule that is of identical composition, but which is
arranged in a non-superposable mirror image, i.e. similar to human hands. Non-
specific protein adhesion or protein fouling occurs with synthetic membrane
filtration in bioprocessing, with marine structures and with medical devices.
This undesired adhesion of proteins is a major technical and economic challenge.
Reducing these limitations with chiral surfaces would be significant and have
broad impact.

The PI proposes that the surface should have the same chirality as a protein
(the chiral hypothesis). The goals of the research are to (i) confirm, expand
and investigate the role of chirality with respect to protein resistance, and
(ii) determine if chiral membranes can fractionate enantiomers for small
molecules. This radically different approach to possibly reducing protein
fouling is in its early stages and is potentially transformative for
bioprocessing.
