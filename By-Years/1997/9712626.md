9712626 Si This is a grant to conduct theoretical research on the physics of
metallic non-Fermi liquids in strongly correlated electron systems. Projects
will include: non-Fermi liquid solutions to an extended Hubbard model;
elucidation of the elementary excitations in non-Fermi liquid metals close to
quantum phase transitions; and, a collaboration with an experimental program to
study the electron-spin diffusion in the normal state of high temperature
superconductors. %%% The theoretical research will study the behavior of
electrons in metals in which the electrons are strongly interacting. In this
case, the very concepts on which normal electrons behave in solids and the usual
methods of analysis are called into question. This research will attempt to
resolve some questions related to this very important problem which is of
fundamental and practical interest. ***
