Production codes on supercomputers are struggling to remain scalable each time
the processor core count increases by a factor of 10, even though they run
efficiently at smaller scale. But root cause diagnosis fails at petascale since
(1) symptoms of performance problems can be subtle, (2) only few metrics can be
efficiently collected and (3) tools can only feasibly record a small subset of
even these metrics.

This work addresses these problems by creating a framework that allows
application developers to focus on data analysis that drives customized data
extraction combined with on-the-fly analysis specifically geared to their
individual problems. This is accomplished by combining trace analysis and in-
situ data analysis techniques at runtime, thereby lifting data reduction to a
new level where it IS analysis. With this approach, modular measurement and
analysis components are combined to selectively extract representative data from
production codes in a problem-specific manner, which enables root cause
analysis.

The work demonstrates the feasibility of customized data extraction and analysis
at scale for root cause analysis on current and forthcoming multi-petascale
supercomputers. It thus contributes to sustain scalable scientific computing
into the future up to the largest scales. Results of this work will be
contributed as open-source code to the research community and beyond as done,
allowing other groups to not only build tools on top of our framework but also
contribute their own components.
