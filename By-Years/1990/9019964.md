Dr. Pieper, and his collaborator Dr. Holliday, will undertake a two-year
program to develop the new instrumentation that will allow the ocean science
community to test hypotheses about how changes in physical oceanographic
parameters at a variety of spatial and temporal scales will result in
complementary changes in the composition and abundance of zooplankton and
micronekton communities. This research will be part of the Global Ocean
Ecosystems Dynamics program of the US Global Change Program. These investigators
will develop arrays for six moorings which will include current meters,
thermistors, and several kinds of sensors designed to acoustically estimate
zooplankton and micronekton biomass and size at one-half hour intervals. These
systems will include automated data acquisition and real-time telemetry to
facilitate analysis and provide opportunities for opportunistic sampling of
transient events.
