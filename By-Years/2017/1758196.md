The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to advance
the paradigm and constructability of building automation systems that improve
earthquake-resilience of high-rise structures. The project can potentially
improve citizen's safety by standardizing a smart seismic-controlling system for
new high-rise developments to be placed in growing dense cities within highly-
active seismic zones. By constructing buildings with modular seismic technology,
the current expenses and risks of the real estate developer associated with the
design and construction of these special structures in these locations can also
be eliminated. Furthermore, expenses linked to catastrophic structural failures
and on-going structural and non-structural repair can be prevented because of
the autonomous and responsive nature of this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
I-Corps project frames a building automation system that control hazardous
oscillations in high-rise buildings by mimicking the human FAP-behavior to
manage its body postural balance after its quiet stance is disturbed. The
proposed resilient performance of autonomous seismic control allows a
minimization of structural and non-structural damage to the susceptible
architecture by counteracting the loads in real-time. Our previous experiments
with human participants subjected to lateral loads, and our past research on
earthquake-resilient robotic structures for buildings has proven reliability of
the technology to minimize the fundamental period of free vibration of a high-
rise building threatened by major seismic motion. This I-Corps project can move
the construction industry forward by challenging the motionless-based structural
performance of current buildings.
