Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectroscopy is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This award, co-supported by
the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program and the Research Improvement in
Minority Institutions (RIMI) Program, will help the Department of Chemistry of
the University of New Mexico to acquire a low-field NMR spectrometer. The
spectrometer will afford modern instrumentation for a student body that contains
a considerable minority component (largely Hispanic). The areas of research that
will be enhanced by the acquisition include: 1) Solution structural studies of
organometallic and main group cluster and ring compounds 2) NMR studies of the
cytochrome C peroxidase-cytochrome C redox complex 3) Synthetic organic
chemistry in the elucidation of sterol metabolism.
