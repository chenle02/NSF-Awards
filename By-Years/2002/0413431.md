Women are rarely viewed as active participants in warfare and are, instead, most
often viewed either as the passive prizes of manly warriors or as "natural
peacemakers." This study examines cattle raiding among Samburu herders in
northern Kenya in order to understand how and why women shape collective
violence. Like many African herding societies, Samburu young men have long
engaged in cattle raiding and warfare, and these activities remain central to
the formation of masculine identity. However, even though men are the direct
participants in raiding, women and girls exert significant indirect influence on
raiding patterns as a means to pursue their material and social interests. The
project design includes a team of a female and male anthropologist who will work
with members of their own gender in collecting an array of qualitative data that
will be analyzed to determine the influence of women on raiding, and the
relation of any such influence to sexuality and gender relations. The project
will address this process both as a longstanding phenomenon, and as one
influenced by contemporary transformations, particularly the recent
proliferation of military style small arms in northern Kenya. In doing so, the
project will aim to enhance more generalizable theoretical understandings of how
gender interactions influence collective violence.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact
of these findings should have importance in understanding other forms of
collective violence, such as gang violence, paramilitaries, vigilantes, etc. The
study will provide insights into changing patterns of violence in Africa and
elsewhere, specifically in regard to the impact of the global proliferation of
military style small arms. A micro-sociological understanding of women's role in
conflict, including in obtaining weaponry, should provide insights to policy
makers concerned with the impact of the global spread of military style fire
arms.&lt;br/&gt;
