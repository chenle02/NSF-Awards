Building panels made of glass fiber reinforced concrete are increasingly used as
exterior cladding for buildings which are being renovated and also for new
construction. Field experience has indicated that these panels have exhibited
reduced tensile strength and a loss of ductility with time. The reduced strength
may be accounted for in the initial design of the panels, but the ductility
aspects are not known sufficiently to be included in the design calculations.
This project will determine the long-term behavior of the glass fiber panels to
account for it properly in the initial stages of design. Several parameters will
be investigated such as: types of fiber, additions of polymer latex and
pozzolans and curing conditions.
