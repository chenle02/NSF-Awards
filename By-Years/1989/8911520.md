Copepods of the genus Calanus and its near relatives are the most abundant
zooplankters in mid-latitude oceans. Their life cycles characteristically
include prolonged resting phases in the last developmental stage, the fifth
copepodite (C5). These dormant periods are spent at considerable depths in mid-
water. Feeding and developmental progress both stop, while activity is sharply
limited. Rest phases in the life history are very common among animals, and for
many groups, such as the insects, the biological details of the resting phases
are very well known. In Calanus this is not the case. An experimental analyses
of the factors influencing the onset of dormancy and arousal will be initiated.
Dormant C5 will be collected in dark-maintaining containers from waters off
Maine in autumn, and will be exposed to three treatments: 1) constant darkness;
2) near-surface intensity and daylength; and 3) 500 m intensity and daylength.
Results should reveal whether the mechanism that triggers arousal is endogenous
(an internal timer) or exogenous (a response to photoperiod).
