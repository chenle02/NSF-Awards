This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program
entitled "Interdisciplinary Undergraduate Program in Nanotechnology (IUPN)", at
Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) is under the direction of Dr. Michael
Bockstaller, Center for Nano-Enabled Device and Energy Technologies, in
collaboration with faculty from the departments of Physics, Chemistry, Materials
Science and Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Civil and
Environmental Engineering and Philosophy. The primary goal of IUPN is to
establish an integrated training program for undergraduate students in
nanotechnology building on four existing courses and innovative mini-courses
that will attract and engage talented students from multiple departments to the
study of nanoscience and engineering. The proposed program will deliver a model
for future undergraduate education in nanotechnology in which the focus is on
the relevance of the connections among the traditional disciplines and a
holistic view of 'sustainable nanotechnology' by integrating ethical and social
science into the nanotechnology curriculum.
