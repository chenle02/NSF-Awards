The ever expanding role of window based human-computer interfaces, while
leading to dramatic improvements for users with normal vision, is in fact
detrimental, and often highly so, to the millions of users who are visually
impaired but not blind. Indeed, current trends threaten to widen rather than
close the gap between normal and visually impaired users, to the extend that the
latter group may soon literally find themselves locked out of the community of
users almost entirely. The goal in this research is to prevent this from
happening, by developing concepts and implementing a prototype for an
alternative to the window-based interfaces of today which will allow the
visually handicapped to become first-class computer users.
