The PI proposes several research projects in number theory which involve the
trace formula at the core of proof. Largely the projects can be divided into
three parts. First, the PI proposes to study the cohomology of Shimura varieties
with a view towards the classical and mod p/p-adic Langlands program. Second,
the PI is concerned with arithmetic statistics for in finite families of
automorphic representations and their L-functions. Third, the PI is involved in
a joint project to classify the automorphic representations of unitary groups
with arithmetic applications in mind. Some projects will be carried out in
collaboratiton with Kaletha, Minguez, Scholze, Templier and White.

The proposed projects stem from basic questions that ancient Greeks were trying
to answer, such as studying properties of prime numbers and finding systematic
solutions to polynomial equations in integers or rational numbers. The trace
formula may be viewed as a twentieth century invention to tackle such
fundamental problems effectively. Automorphic forms and the Langlands program
become increasingly important in theoretical physics and would possibly shed
light on our understanding of the universe. Developments in number theory are
particularly important in the new era making extensive use of internet and
electronic devices in view of its wide applications to cryptography, error-
correcting codes and internet security, just to name a few.
