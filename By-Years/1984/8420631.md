The objective of this research is to model scattering theories and to validate
the models. Numerical simulation studies are being conducted and indicate that a
wavelength filtering concept applies only in the low-to medium-frequency region
and that a two-scale concept is not generally valid. More analysis of random
surface scattering properties is planned, which should extend the range of
validity of surface scattering theories.
