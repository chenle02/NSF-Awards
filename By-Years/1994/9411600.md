This is a project to perform laboratory measurements and modeling to determine
the predissociation rate of the c'(0)-x(0) transition in molecular nitrogen. The
results will be used with a model to determine the temperature dependence of
absorption oscillator strength, A-factors for radiative branching into the
vibrational levels of ground state molecular nitrogen, and fractional
predissociation. These data will facilitate an unambiguous identification of the
rotationally resolved emission spectra of nitrogen and provide a basis for
calculating, comparing and analyzing the absolute photoexcitation,
photodissociation, electron impact excitation, and electron impact dissociation
cross sections of nitrogen. This information will be useful in the
interpretation of spectroscopic measurements of the upper atmosphere.
