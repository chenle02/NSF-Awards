The investigator studies generalized additive partially linear models (GAPLM)
with the aim of developing efficient and flexible estimation and inference
methods, variable selection procedures,model specification tests, and model
structure checks, and studies applications of these methods for biomedical
research. Specifically speaking, he (a) is developing a genuine method that is
able to select important parametric and nonparametric components that are
numerically stable , even when the numbers of the nonparametric and parametric
components diverge; (b) is developing model specification tests for GAPLM; (c)
studies model structure determination for GAPLM; (d) studies marginal GAPLM for
correlated data; and (e) applies the advanced models and proposed methods to
analyze gene data for study of the relationship between certain diseases and
genes, including the identification of signature gene expression profiles of
cancer cells in response to different drug treatments, the prediction of genetic
risks through integrating knowledge from genetic variations in the genome and
genomic markers, and validation of epigenetic codes from data collected through
next generation sequencing platforms.

The proposed models and methods are motivated by the investigator's study of
gene and other potentially useful biomarkers in cancer clinical trials. The
results of this project can help identify important gene expression profiles and
cancer cells and trace the disease progression in cancer research. The theoretic
results contribute to the advancement of the statistical theory on variable
selections and semi-parametric inference with high-dimensional covariates.
