The objectives of the proposed research are to design and verify a technique for
modeling dynamic consolidation using a centrifuge, and to investigate the
densification pattern resulting from single and multiple impacts in dry,
granular soils. The research is expected to generate significant insight into
the phenomenon of dynamic consolidation, and provide specific information to
practicing engineers involved in design of dynamic consolidation oriented work.
