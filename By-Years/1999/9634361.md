IBN: 9634361 PI: Baras Timbre is the percept that allows one to distinguish
between musical instruments playing the same note, or between different vowels
spoken in the same voice pitch. Only complex sounds composed of many tones have
distinct timbres or sound qualities. The most important physical correlate of
this percept is the distribution of energy in these tones. This energy profile
resembles intuitively the distribution of light in an image. The question
addressed in this research is how the acoustic profile (or image) is extracted
in the auditory system and how is it represented in the brain. Specifically, we
seek to clarify what features of this acoustic image are important in forming
the timbre of the sound, and which features are redundant and can be ignored.The
results obtained from such a study can potentially lead to a better
understanding of how speech and musical sounds are preceived. This in turn has
immediate applications in the development of effective automatic speech
recognition systems, in speech and music synthesis, in robust communication
channels, and in prosthetic devices for the deaf.
