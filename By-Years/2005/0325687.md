We propose to develop a system to automate the design, implementation, and
optimization of digital signal processing (DSP) applications for software (SW),
hardware (HW), and SW/HW platforms with respect to multiple, possibly
conflicting, performance metrics including speed, accuracy, area, and power.
Ours is a new system of intelligent design and optimization tools that
incorporate domainspecific knowledge of the mathematical structure of DSP
computations and use this knowledge for automatic optimization and exploration
of the design space, controlled by search and feedback optimization techniques.
By including the 'high' mathematical level into the design automation, we
achieve the following two main goals. The project will (1) overcome the known
limitations of current optimizing compilers and synthesis tools that do not have
access to high level structural information and are thus restricted to
mechanical source code level manipulations, and will provide the framework to
conquer for automation that step in the design flow that has traditionally been
reserved to human ingenuity: intelligent algorithm manipulation and
implementation to optimize desired performance metrics under given
constraints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
