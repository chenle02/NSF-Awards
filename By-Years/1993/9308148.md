9308148 Perepezko This research explores kinetics of heterogeneous nucleation in
undercooled liquid metal alloys. The approach to the kinetics evaluation follows
two directions: experimental measurement and computer simulation. Droplet
samples from the tin-antimony alloy system are emulsified in a stable carrier
fluid and undercooled. Nucleation events during undercooling are followed by
calorimetry and the droplet size distribution and volume phase fraction
determined by quantitative image analysis. Kinetic and thermodynamic results are
related to the microstructure and composition of the solidified droplets by
employing scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, and
X-ray diffraction. Computer simulation employs the Kinetic Monte Carlo method
and addresses critical nucleus size, shape factors, and nucleation at moving
boundaries as a function of time. %%% Nucleation is a physical phenomena of
broad occurrence, playing an important role in metallic, ceramic, organic,
biological, and aqueous systems. New insights should result from this research
applicable to these systems. ***
