The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project
is to model physicians' and patients' cognitive and behavioral interactions with
health information technology (IT) as these individuals deal with two costly
chronic diseases - diabetes and hypertension. The researcher will model these
interactions using methods from applied psychology, visualization, and computer
science. Using these models, the researcher will assess the quality of
physicians' and patients' cognitive and behavioral interactions across existing
commercial health IT systems, and will design new computer interfaces that
improve how physicians and patients interact with health IT.

By providing guidance for the effective design of health IT, this research will
directly support current government initiatives aimed at stimulating the
adoption of health IT. There is overwhelming evidence that health IT failures
often result from a faulty understanding of how individuals use information
while completing tasks and making decisions. This research aims to increase
physicians' and patients' adoption of health IT by making it easier for them to
find and use the right information at the right time. As chronic disease
management poses a significant burden on the healthcare system, the specific
design guidance identified via the proposed research has the potential to
improve clinical outcomes and reduce the costs of managing these patients.
Through this research, PhD students will be able to work closely with healthcare
provider mentors and participate in interdisciplinary research teams with
physicians, nurses, and computer scientists. Additionally, the researcher will
develop realistic case studies to expose undergraduate and graduate students to
the growing field of health systems engineering.
