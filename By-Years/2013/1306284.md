With the support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Bowling of University of Wisconsin-
Stevens Point and Professor Bosch of Missouri State University conduct
collaborative research to study the spatial and electronic requirements for
intramolecular halogen bonding in solution and the solid state, respectively.
Specially, the research team investigates the ability of pyridine-halogen
attractions to serve as surrogates for alkynes in dehydroannulene-type materials
and the feasibility of extending this strategy to more complex macromolecular
species. This research aims to develop strategies for incorporating halogen
bonding as a tool for conformation control in conjugated molecules.

Conjugated organic molecules are important constituents of functional materials
in many useful applications. This research contributes both to increasing our
fundamental knowledge and the development of alternative synthetic routes to
complex structures with potential applications as functional materials. In
addition, this project provides research opportunities to undergraduate
students, preparing them for industrial positions and graduate studies.
