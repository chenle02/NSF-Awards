Sedimentary and low-grade metamorphic pelitic rocks record the occurrence,
timing and magnitude of interaction with crustal fluids, but radiogenic isotopic
studies of such rocks and events lead to ambiguous results due to heterogeneity
of source of the key minerals, especially clay minerals. The project will
combine radiogenic isotopic studies (Rb-Sr and K-Ar) with detailed
characterization by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) in order to
provide a firm basis of interpretation of the isotopic data. The proposal is
based on a successful "pilot project" development of methods for Rb-Sr analysis
of Gulf Coast shales that have verified "episodic" diagenesis by tectonically-
induced fluid flow. This research will expand the studies to the full range of
diagenesis - low-grade metamorphism with further studies of Gulf Coast shales,
and analyses of continuous sequences across northern New York and in Wales that
span the range from late diagenesis to greenschist facies metamorphism.
