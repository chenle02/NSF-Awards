9520835 FEENER Biological invasions provide excellent opportunities to study
the organization of natural communities. This research uses Argentine ant
invasions in northern California to test hypotheses concerning the causes of
these invasions. The first objective is to quantify how different biotic and
abiotic factors control the rate of invasions by conducting a natural trajectory
experiment at 20 independent invasion fronts. These factors can be examined with
unusual clarity because the invasion fronts of Argentine ants are well
delineated and advance slowly. Of particular importance is determining if
features of native ant communities govern the rate of spread of Argentine ants.
The second objective is to determine the competitive mechanisms whereby
Argentine ants displace native ants. Short-term introductions of Argentine ants
at baits controlled by native ants will be used to examine mechanisms used by
Argentine ants to supplant other species. In addition, the repellency of
chemical defenses of the Argentine ants will be tested in laboratory
experiments. Biological invasions are a common feature of most ecological
communities. This study of invasion by Argentine ants should reveal competitive
mechanisms that are common to other successful invaders, as well as some of the
features governing invasion success in other natural communities.
