9724552 Grimshaw, Andrew University of Virginia Development of a 25 Gigaflop
Machine for Computational and Computer Science Research The University of
Virginia is proposing to construct a 25 gigaflop multicomputer using off-the-
shelf Pentium Pro multiprocessors connected in a 2D Torus using Myrinet
switches. This machine, named Centurion, will act as a large-scale test-bed for
computationally challenging sciences and engineering problems and for systems-
oriented computer science research. Centurion will support the mission of the
University's Institute for Parallel Computation to foster interaction between
domain scientists and computer scientists working in the area of high-
performance computing. Applications will be drawn from biochemistry, chemical
engineering, computer science, electrical engineering, engineering physics,
environmental science, materials science, and radio astronomy. Centurion will be
constructed primarily by undergraduate students and will be used by
undergraduate researchers under the supervision of faculty in computer science,
electrical engineering, and other disciplines. Centurion will also be used by
graduate students and post-doctorate personnel in computer science, electrical
engineering, environmental science, materials science, and biochemistry.
