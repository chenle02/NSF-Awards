A new method for on-line chemical analysis is under development. Particles
entering the source region of a mass spectromter scatter light form a helium-
neon laser beam. The scattered light triggers an excimer laser cousing one-step
desorption and ionization of the particle. Low laser irradiances preferentially
vaporize the particle surface; higher irradiances vaporize a larger fraction of
the particle. A complete mass spectrum of the ionized material is subsequently
recoreded with a time-of-flight mass analyzer. The method will be used to stduy
surface-active organic and inorganic coatings on micron-size particles that are
relevant to atmospheric aerosols. The ability of laser desorption to distinguish
molecular species on the surface of n airosol particle from those in the total
volume will be tested as a means of distringuishing surface and total
concentrations of ammonium salt in layered particles. Laser desorption will be
used to detect fractional crystallization on the surface of a particle during
drying. The ultimate goal of this research is the development of a method for
rapid on-line chemical analysis of atmospheric aerosol particles.
