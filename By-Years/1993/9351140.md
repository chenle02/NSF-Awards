9351140 Runquist To improve laboratory instruction in the sciences (Biology,
Chemistry, Mathematics, and Physics), Hamline University will add high-end
workstations with capacity for graphics to support on- going curriculum reform
across the sciences. These systems will be introduced into both introductory and
advanced laboratory courses and undergraduate research programs of all four
science departments. Hamline University has initiated a three-stage plan for
introducing high performance computing (HPC) into the undergraduate science
curriculum. During Stage 1, which is underway and financed entirely by Hamline
University, eight Sun workstations and one server were purchased and connected
to Internet, a science faculty training program was initiated, and HPC teaching
modules are being developed. During Stage 2, hardware and software holdings will
be expanded, teaching modules will be introduced, tested, refined and expanded,
cooperative faculty and student HPC-supported research programs with remote
institutions will be developed, an HPC-focused science curriculum will be
designed, and course content and teaching methodologies will be further modified
to incorporate HPC. This proposal requests funds to support Stage 2. During
Stage 3, a new science building with an HPC-focused curriculum as its
architectural theme will be designed and constructed, and HPC use will be
expanded into social science fields. Experiences gained from this program will
enable Hamline to serve as a regional HPC/science curriculum resource center.
