1511045 - Anderson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed effort is one of the first
of its kind to pursue using a novel nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging
technique to study multiphase heat transfer systems that are common in
industrial applications. The result can impact and improve understanding and
design of systems. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in
the proposed effort. The PIs will focus on recruiting woman and Native American
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed effort will use novel NMR imaging
experiments to measure velocity and temperature profiles in multiphase porous
media systems, including micro-encapsulated PCMs (phase change materials). The
approach is novel and offers the potential to extend the capabilities of NMR
applied to the fundamental study of thermo-fluid systems. The high spatial
resolution of NMR is first calibrated with well know PCM materials and will
provide data to study and quantify transport at the micro-scale (pore size) in
porous media systems. The work will also incorporate CFD modeling and analysis
that captures the complexity of the experiment that will produce new information
to allow for a finer level of examination of the models used to relate micro-
scale physical processes to macro-scale heat transfer.
