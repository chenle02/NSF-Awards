The purpose of this project is to develop probabilistic language models that
efficiently integrate denotational semantic information into syntactic and
phonological stages of recognition for use in spoken language interfaces to
sensor or robotic agents. This integration is intended to allow information
about the meanings or denotations of words in the agent's current environmental
context to influence the probability estimates it assigns to hypothesized
analyses of its input, before any recognition decisions have been made, so that
the interfaced agent can favor in its search those analyses that "make sense" in
its representation of the current state of the world. Since these models can be
trained on the same kinds of examples that may be used to establish word
meanings in the agent's lexicon, it is expected that they will be easier to
adapt to changing domains than those relying exclusively on word co-occurrence
statistics in fixed corpora.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A recognizer based on this
model will eventually serve as a testbed for evaluating spoken language
interfaces to networked scout robots in search and rescue applications and
mobile manipulation robots in home care tasks or materials handling applications
in joint projects with other members of the Artificial Intelligence Robotics and
Vision Lab, as well as in applications that require navigating digital road maps
or other geographic data in joint projects with members of the Spatial Databases
group at the University of Minnesota. This model will also be adapted as a
framework for teaching natural language processing concepts, providing students
with a broader context in which various processing components may fit together,
and inviting students to consider innovative solutions to natural language
processing problems that cross the boundaries among traditional components.
