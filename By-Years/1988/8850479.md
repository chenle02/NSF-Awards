This is a pilot project designed to stimulate greater student interest in
history and science in the middle schools by introducing them to major
developments in the history of science and technology in their social studies
courses. The project will focus on the world history course at grade seven and
the United States history course at grade eight. Teachers from four school
districts in northern California will take part in this project. To provide the
teachers with the necessary knowledge about the history of science and
technology, the project will organize summer institutes and school-year
workshops. To help them integrate this knowledge into the existing history
courses, the project will develop and field test a teachers guide consisting of
lesson plans for teaching about the history of science and technology. The four
participating school district will provide teachers to help develop the teachers
guide, participants for the institutes and workshops, classrooms for field
testing the teachers guides, and will adopt the lessons on the history of
science and technology as part of their regular curriculum. The teacher lesson
plans and videotapes of teachers using the new lessons will be made available to
other school districts. The University of California at Berkeley is contributing
in cost-sharing an amount that is equal to 25% of the NSF award.
