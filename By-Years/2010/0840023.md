The project centers around the author's proposed visit to Palmer Station, which
will serve as the location for obtaining the raw material to produce a series of
poems--called Natural Curiosities--the purpose of which is to bring to readers a
sense of the continent and its creatures as well as to represent and consider
the mind at work on what it sees, in the acts of exploration and passionate
thinking related to Antarctica.

The writer considers Palmer Station, with its remote and dramatic geographical
setting, the length and nature of the journey required to get there, the
richness of its animal life, and the nature of the research being conducted
there, to be an ideal venue for the project.

The artist?s goal is to explore and to reveal the sense in which science, like
all artifacts of culture and intelligence, is a fundamentally human endeavor,
driven by the humanity and passion of its practitioners.

The author also hopes to contribute to the increase of scientific literacy by
bringing the wonders of Antarctica and Palmer Long-term Ecologial Research
project site there to as wide a public as possible, including especially the
literary public, which generally that may see science and its practice as
somehow alienating or off-limits.
