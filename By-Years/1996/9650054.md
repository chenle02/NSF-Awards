This project is expanding the laboratory component of an introductory physical
science course for "non-science" majors, including education majors. It creates
a laboratory that allows "non-science" majors to experience hands-on the methods
and purposes of physical science. The project is providing instruments for
computer acquisition, graphing, and analysis of experimental data and for
computer acquisition and analysis of video recordings of experiments. It also
allows students to spend more time planning, executing, and reporting an
independent investigation of a self-selected topic in physical science. The
project is allowing more students to graduate from college with an
understanding, based on personal experience, of the methods and purposes of
physical science.
