The University of Washington, together with the Research+Practice Collaboratory,
proposes a RAPID project to engage state teams from the Expanding Computer
Education Pathways (ECEP) Alliance with education researchers. The project will
test engagement strategies within an existing workshop to be held in conjunction
with the upcoming ECEP Alliance Summit scheduled for October 28-29, 2016, to be
held at the White House old executive building in Washington DC. The proposed
engagement will test strategies for working with Computer Science for All
(CS4All) implementation teams and communities to build an understanding of the
value of research-practice partnerships in supporting equity-oriented,
sustainable CS education improvement efforts. Towards this end, workshop
activities will include presentations by learning scientists with deep
experience in research-practice partnerships that focus on equity in computer
science, digital learning, and/or STEM learning. The ECEP state teams will then
meet with researchers to identify research questions that address their concerns
about supporting and scaling local initiatives, and the kinds of external
research expertise and partnerships that would be needed to advance the specific
ECEP state projects. The goal is to provide a broad model for building
collaborations between CSforAll practitioners and the education research
community.
