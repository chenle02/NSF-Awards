EIA- 0107686&lt;br/&gt;Purdue University&lt;br/&gt;Jose
Fortes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: SGER: Exploratory Research on Transnational
Digital Government&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will support a preliminary
study of the uses of information technologies to support multilateral
collaborations between two South American countries in the topic area of drug
abuse and trafficking. Important topics to be surmounted include the many
differences in infrastructure and processes related to data gathering, and the
differing legal and security regimes in place. There will be an element of
multi-lingualism to be explored also. The collaboration will begin with the
support and approval of the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission of the
Organization of American States (OAS). The Commission has developed a process
and procedures for multilateral government evaluation of various drug abuse
parameters, which will serve as the context in which to evaluate collaboration
technologies research. Researchers from several US universities and the OAS will
participate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
