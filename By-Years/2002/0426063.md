AST 0098665&lt;br/&gt;Campins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Humberto Campins will
lead a systematic three-year study of Centaurs, Transneptunian Objects (TNOs),
and inactive nuclei of Jupiter-family (JF) comets. He will obtain near-infrared
spectra as a function of rotational phase for members of these three groups. The
proper study of the spectral variability with rotational phase in a significant
number of Centaurs, TNOs, and JF comets is essential if we are to understand the
evolutionary links between these three populations of primitive Solar System
objects. Dr. Campins will observe with the new 6.5- meter MMT facility in
Arizona, which will allow detailed observations of enough members of each
population for a proper comparison of their properties. He has already
demonstrated that one of these objects (8405 Asbolus) has a dramatic spectral
variation as a function of rotational phase.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
