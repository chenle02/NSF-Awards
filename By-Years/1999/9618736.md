This combined program will conduct a detailed geophysical and geochemical study
of the Northern Chile Ridge and Valdivia Fracture Zone intra-transform spreading
centers. A 40-day field program will use SeaBeam 2000, magnetics, and gravity to
map the detailed geomorphology of the axial region out to the Brunhes-Matuyama
magnetic reversal boundary. The neo-volcanic zone will be sampled at ~125 sites
by dredging and wax coring; lavas recovered will be analyzed by electron
microprobe, ICP-MS, DCP, and mass spectrometry for major element, trace element,
and Pb-Nd-Sr isotopic characteristics. The combined data set for the Northern
Chile Ridge will be used to investigate the relationship of axial depth, crustal
structure and lava composition with thermal effects associated with large-
offset transform faults. The Valdivia F.Z. data set will be used to further
investigate the extent and variability of anomalous geochemical features of the
Southeast Pacific discovered in previous studies of the Southern Chile Ridge
(i.e., DUPAL isotopic signatures and MORB with subduction zone trace element
characteristics) and to extend on-going studies of relationships between Pacific
mid-ocean ridge basalt chemistry and axial depth to deeper ridge segments.
