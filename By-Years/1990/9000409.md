Dr. Kyte (UCLA) has been awarded funds to work with co-investigator Dr. Leinen
(URI) to build upon earlier research funded by NSF. This previous work has
demonstrated that non-fossiliferous pelagic clays may contain important but
often overlooked geologic and paleoceanographic information. To date, the
authors have conducted neutron activation analyses on 325 samples spanning 70 Ma
of sediment in core LL4-GPC3 from the central N Pacific. They developed an
inverse modeling technique that juggles the 39 elements analyzed in this core to
match 8 end-member sediment components. From this is emerging a history of
eolian, volcanic, hydrothermal, hydrogenous and biologic contribution to the
Pacific ocean basin. With the present award, Drs. Kyte and Leinen will extend
these analyses and modeling techniques to another long record (DSDP Site 576 in
the western N Pacific) and will incorporate parallel mineralogic (XRD) analyses
on surface sediments from throughout the N Pacific. The goal is to refine their
understanding of the chemical and mineralogical controls on the distribution of
major, minor + trace elements in N Pacific sediments, and continue to develop
this technique as a new approach in paleoenvironmental interpretation.
