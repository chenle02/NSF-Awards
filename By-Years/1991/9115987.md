This project addresses the growth and processing of metastable ultrathin
epitaxial films and layered structures of transition metals. Stuctural
metastability is achieved by epitaxial growth on selected single-crystal
substrates, and on designed buffer-layer films created by epitaxial growth of
metals on semiconductors. The resesarch employs low-energy electron diffraction
(LEED), angle resolved photoelectron diffraction, photoelectron holography with
synchrotron radiation. The magnetic properties of the films will be
characterized by in-situ magnetoresistance measurements and by the surface
magnetooptical Kerr effect. The research will address fundamental aspects of the
photoelectron diffraction phenomena as well as practical applications of these
techniques to determine the structures of the films.
