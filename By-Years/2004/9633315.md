Kunze 9633315 The characteristics of the internal waves and turbulence field in
Monterey Submarine Canyon will be measured with a suite of vertical fine-scale
and microstructure profilers and shipboard instruments to test the hypothesis
the energy flux of up-canyon propagating semi-diurnal internal waves is lost to
turbulent dissipation and mixing. Also of interest are the shape, level
heterogeneity and anisotropy of the vertical wavenumber spectrum on the fine-
scale (wavelength 10-50 m) as compared to that found in the open ocean. Finally,
the turbulence measurements will be used to assess the importance of canyons to
mixing at boundaries.
