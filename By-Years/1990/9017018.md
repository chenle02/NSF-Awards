With this award the Office of Special Projects of the Chemistry Division and the
Undergraduate Science, Engineering and Mathematics Education Division are
supporting a symposium designed to focus attention on the critical need for
curricular revision of the general chemistry programs at U.S. colleges and
universities. The symposium will be held in conjunction with the 200th National
Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Washington, D.C. on August 26, 1990.
The symposium, sponsored jointly by the Committee on Professional Training of
the American Chemical Society, the National Science Foundation, and the American
Chemical Society Education Division, will examine the feasibility and vitality
of non-traditional approaches to teaching introductory chemistry. The outcome of
the event is anticipated to be a heightened awareness of the advantages of new
approaches and stimulation for curriculum development. Publication of the
proceedings of the meeting will reach those colleges and universities that
graduate more than 90% of the nation's chemistry bachelors degrees.
