Biological museums and herbaria are estimated to contain three billion animal
and plant specimens that document the temporal and spatial distribution of life
on earth. Four hundred years of biological survey, species description and
archiving in museums and herbaria have produced a massive, globally distributed
knowledge resource documenting the planet's biological diversity. The Specify
Software Project supports the computerization of biological collections data.
Support and development of Specify, a biological collections database
application, is provided free of charge at http://www.usobi.org/specify. Specify
is currently used by 55 collections. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project,
Specify's core data management will be enhanced and the usability of the
interface will be improved and extended so that users can customize the web
components considered. Further, there will be full integration with the Species
Analyst Network. A help desk and technical support are provided to collections.
Overall, the Specify Project will enable the capture and integration of millions
of specimen records into computing architectures that will enable cross-domain
research and education in environmental
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
