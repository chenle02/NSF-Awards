This is a Career Advancement Award under the sponsorship of Research
Opportunities for Women. Professor Hughes is an established, solid researcher in
operator theory and partial differential equations. The goal of the present
project is to apply the methods of functional analysis and operator theory to
analyze non-selfadjoint and non-spectral operators that arise in the equations
of transport theory. The proposed research would result in new, physically
relevant applications of semigroups of unbounded operators to the applied
mathematics and mathematical physics associated with transport phenomena; for
example, neutron transport theory. Professor Hughes will broaden her knowledge
of these applications by communication with the researchers at the Center for
Transport Phenomena at VPI.
