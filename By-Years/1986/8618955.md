This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports
Professor David R. Williams' broad research to explore new synthetic
methodology, with advantageous development of advances in acyclic stereocontrol.
A specific goal is to allow introduction of nitrogen as a surrogate amine.
Overall, these strategies will focus on selective ring forming processes with
efficient assembly of stereochemically complex amino-alcohols. The project will
investigate the fundamental chemistry of medium-sized cyclic amines and amides
as well as the character of 1-azaÄ±5.3.0!bicyclodecanes.
