Two goals of this proposal are to extend some known results for the uniform
random mapping model to other interesting random mapping models, and to initiate
new research on probabilistic optimization problems. The work on random mapping
models is a continuation of work already completed by the principal
investigator. In particular, the principal investigator is interested in
determining new central limit theorems and functional limit theorem for certain
random mapping models. The investigation of probabilistic optimization problems
is related to the study of random mapping models, as both rely, in various ways,
on the theory of random graphs. Since the second topic of this proposal is a new
area of research for the investigator, the planning activities that will be
carried out are primarily intended to prepare the proposer to work independently
in this field.
