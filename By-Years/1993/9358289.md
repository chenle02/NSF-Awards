9358289 Kovacs This NYI award will support two projects. The first project is
the continued development of a micromachined heavy metal ion sensor for
detecting contamination in groundwater. This work should have considerable
impact in the monitoring of drinking water and process chemicals, as well as
providing "early warning" signals to prevent irreversible environmental damage.
Preliminary work has shown sensitivities as high as one part per billion, but
considerable work remains to be done to improve the capabilities of the devices
and to integrate control circuitry. The second project is the development of
process technology for implantable, micromachined neural prostheses. Using
preliminary devices, neural signals have been recorded at extended periods after
implantation in mammalian and amphibian nerves. Further work would allow the
designs to be refined, and amplifier circuits to be incorporated into the
implants themselves. The ultimate goals of this work are to provide a direct
interface between an amputee's limb stump and a prosthesis, and to provide a new
tool for the study of signal encoding in peripheral nerves. ***
