9316350 Carr The purpose of the proposed work is to discover new physical
constraints that will lead to a better understanding of arc volcanoes. We
propose two projects. The first is to quantify the spatial distribution of arc
volcanism, with special emphasis on measuring the sizes of volcanoes. The second
project is to examine the morphologies of arc volcanoes to determine if they can
be related to chemical or other physical parameters. The significance of the
proposed work is that volcanism is the observable surface result of the managing
processes at convergent margins. Highly sophisticated geochemical models exist
for arc volcanism and several attempts have been made to link geochemical
parameters to tectonic and volcanological features. We propose to quantify
volcano distribution and morphology, focussing for the most part on Central
America. We will then determine what correlations exist between the new physical
data and existing geochemical data and use the results to try to eliminate some
of the several competing models of melt generation and migration.
