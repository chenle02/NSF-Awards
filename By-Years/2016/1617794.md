Imaging is a core technology that feeds into intelligent sensing and reasoning
about the world. This project advances the frontiers of imaging by supporting
development of a broad, new space of "4D lens" designs with fundamentally
superior performance. The research team develops technologies to record and
process richer data about light flowing through the lens, enabling computational
enhancement over the optical image quality. The research team also redesigns the
lens itself, lowering the optical requirements and pushing to unprecedented
performance in figures of merit such as brightness, size, weight, zoom and cost.
This project extends the frontier of what is possible in diverse imaging
applications, including 3D imaging, photography, scientific imaging, projection,
lithography, and headsets for virtual and augmented reality, microscopy,
security and defense. This research develops the theory, algorithms and tools
for designing and optimizing the described 4D lenses. The enabling technical
shift is the assumption that the new lenses can be used in the emerging class of
computational imaging systems that work with the full 4D light field (set of all
rays), rather than simply a 2D image. This project addresses several
intellectual challenges theoretically and algorithmically. First, the research
establishes a new formulation of the long-standing lens design problem,
considering not just 2D optical image quality, but rather the computed image
quality after end-to-end 4D imaging and processing. The new formulation
significantly increases the complexity of evaluating and optimizing lens
designs. Secondly, the research explores and maps the new frontier of lens
design space that this approach opens up, to understand its growth
characteristics and ultimate limits. The new design approach has potential for
fundamental disruption of imaging capability, because it enables lens technology
to improve continuously with technology for pixels and processing, which grow
exponentially.
