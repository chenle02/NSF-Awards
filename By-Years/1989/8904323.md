Photophysical techniques, including photostationary and transient fluorescence
and transient fluorescence depolarization, are the new tools to study polymer
chain structure in three classes of multicomponent polymer systems. Polymer
blends containing a crystallizable component will be examined with particular
attention to the influence of constraints imposed by lamellar boundaries on
structure in the amorphous regions. Hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic and
stereotactic interactions will be characterized in complexes formed in aqueous
and non-aqueous solution. Micelles formed by block copolymers in mixed selective
solvents will be studied with particular attention to the structure of the core.
Dyamic light scattering will be used as a complementary tool to characterize
structure in both the complex and micelle studies.
