Abstract ATM-9705676 D'Arrigo, Rosanne D. Columbia University Title: Development
of Tree-Ring Chronologies from Indonesia and Thailand for Dendroclimatic Studies
This award supports the continuation of efforts to develop a spatially-
comprehensive network of high-resolution, precisely-dated tree-ring chronologies
from Indonesia and Thailand for dendroclimatic analysis. These regions are key
to studies of monsoon and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability. Yet,
Southeast asia is one of the most data-sparse regions on the globe for coverage
of tree-ring and other sources of paleoclimate data. The strategy will be to
collect (through nondestructive means) wood samples of selected tropical tree
species from sites in Indonesia and Thailand with pronounced rainfall
seasonality. The samples will be rigorously cross-dated and developed into final
chronologies. These chronologies will then be employed in dendroclimatic
modeling and reconstruction of Southeast Asian climate over recent centuries.
