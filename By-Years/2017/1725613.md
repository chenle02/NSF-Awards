This award provides support for a workshop designed to enable US based
institutions to work with their international counterparts to expand a unique
partnership to address resiliency issues. The EPIC-N model partners colleges and
universities paired with local communities in an effort to help make cities
sustainable. Presently, approximately 30 US-based universities are implementing
this model for connecting students and faculty to real-world projects that
address the pressing needs of local municipalities and communities as they
contend with real-life challenges of becoming more sustainable and resilient.
The workshop will provide an opportunity for these institutions to develop
partnerships with their international counterparts and to further develop the
framework for universities and local communities to work together on real-world
challenges and opportunities.

The EPIC-N model is designed to advance the knowledge of both academicians and
local community practitioners. The partnership that forms the basis of the model
is designed to address the broad spectrum of sustainability-related needs of
local communities by strategically matching community needs with university
capacity to provide research, creative designs and solutions in ways that
benefit all parties, with lasting benefits and implications for all involved.
Most importantly, students gain experience working on real issues confronting
local communities and at the same time, local communities gain access to
valuable data that can better inform critical decisions.
