Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing humanity today. The
solutions to climate change will involve changing how people think about and
behave in relation to their environment. The proposed work is to plan for the
creation of an interdisciplinary center that would bring together researchers
from a variety of disciplines, including psychology, sociology, and
environmental science, to study the social and behavioral aspects of climate
change. The work will focus on issues such as how people receive, process, and
remember information about climate change; the factors that influence pro-
environmental beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors; and how cultural values shape
people’s understanding of climate change. The center’s findings will contribute
to the development of more effective ways to communicate about climate change
and encourage people to take action to address this crisis.

The planning process will involve several meetings of experts from each of the
constituent disciplines. The team will consider the use of a variety of
different methods to shed light on the behavioral, cognitive, and social
dimensions of climate change. These methods include large-scale Internet studies
of the relationship between personality and the effects of local climate
experiences, experiments with a variety of participants that will reveal whether
and when people are resistant or receptive to information about climate change,
and studies of how maps and other visual representations affect people’s
understanding of climate change. The planning process will result in the
development of plans for a future center that will develop more effective ways
to communicate about climate change and encourage people to take action to
address this challenge.
