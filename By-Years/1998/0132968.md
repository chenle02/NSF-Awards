This will support a special focus workshop at the Human Language Technology
Conference in the area of Language Processing of Biological Data. The purpose of
this special focus within HLT 2002 context is to bring to the attention of a
wide audience of researchers across all aspects of human language technology the
research opportunites and recent research breakthroughs in this newly emerging
area. This support is also intended to further promote cross-disciplinary
approaches to the new field of bioinformatics.
