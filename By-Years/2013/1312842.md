This work carries out a physics program focused on testing whether the newly
discovered Higgs boson shows any deviations from Standard Model expectations as
well as searching for new particles, particularly those predicted by
supersymmetric theories. To that end, the Notre Dame group will continue to
maintain and operate the CMS electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, the CMS
trigger, while expanding its efforts in upgrades of the CMS detector. This work
is aimed at contributing to our understanding of the mechanism for electroweak
symmetry breaking and the identity of dark matter. Although the proposed
research activities already have a broad impact through their potential to
transform our understanding of the fundamental laws of physics, the broader
impacts of this proposal are further enhanced through a variety of educational
and outreach activities that continue to build on Notre Dame's strength in those
areas.
