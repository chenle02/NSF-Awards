IBN-9512315 Garofalo, Robert S. The hormone, insulin, exerts its effects on
cells by binding to a cell surface protein called the insulin receptor. This
binding causes the receptor to transmit signals into the interior of the cell
which result in glucose uptake and other metabolic changes. While a great deal
about the structure of the insulin receptor is known, there is limited
information about the nature of the signals transmitted within the cell or the
components of the signaling pathway. The studies proposed by Dr. Garofalo use an
excellent model system to study the mechanism of action of the insulin receptor.
The model offers advantages over other experimental systems, notably the ability
to easily generate and characterize mutations, and to study the effects of
mutations on the function of the insulin receptor in a complex organism. Using
this system, the function of the insulin receptor in the development of the
nervous system and muscles, and in the regulation of growth will be examined.
The proposed studies will also identify novel cellular components involved in
the function of the receptor. The elucidation of these components in this model
system is simplified by its ability to be modified genetically and characterized
biochemically. The identification of components in the insulin receptor
signaling pathway is significant for our understanding of the pathogenesis and
treatment of diseases, such as diabetes and cancer, and may suggest novel
targets for intervention.
