Space science has long sought the answer to the cause for different types of
auroral structures and their occurrence at different times within the global
magnetic activity. The research scientists in this program have in the past
attempted to trace the effects of currents from the ionosphere near quiet time
auroral structures into the magnetosphere using quiet time magnetic field
models. This new project will use a more disturbed model of the magnetosphere to
investigate more dynamic structures associated with the auroral substorm, such
as auroral loops, poleward surges and omega bands. In addition, this new model
will allow study of mapping effects produced by the diversion of cross-tail
current to the ionosphere. These studies of the coupling between electron and
ion currents in the inner magnetotail may help to unravel some of the physical
processes that take place during the auroral substorm onset.
