9423291 Cole This is a three-year supplementary grant proposed by Drs. Peter
Cole and Gabriella Hermon, University of Delaware and Dr. James Huang,
University of California at Irvine. The purpose of this study is to expand a
current research project (SBR-9410740) supported by SBER on long distance
reflexives to add an international component to include, Malaysia and Singapore.
The principal investigators propose to collaborate with three researchers in
Singapore and Malaysia to collect field research data on reflexives in language
in SE Asia. Dr. Cole and his collaborators are specialists in this linguistics
area and are experts in languages of East and Southeast Asia which are known to
be of direct relevance to the theoretical issues under study. Three U.S.
graduate students will be involved in the analysis of the data gathered in the
course of the research and will use the data for their graduate studies. This is
a mutually beneficial project, the U.S. scientists will have access for
important field data in linguistics while the foreign collaborating scientists
will work directly on a project at the cutting edge of current linguistic
theory.
