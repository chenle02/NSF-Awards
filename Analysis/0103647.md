Professor Jonathan Rosenberg will study the topology and geometry of manifolds
and manifold-like spaces, as well as C*-algebraic index theory. By this we mean
a combination of C*-algebra theory, index theory of elliptic operators,
K-theory, geometry, and topology. One main focus of the proposal will be the use
of invariants coming from C*-algebras (especially Kasparov's KK-theory) to study
the geometry and topology of manifolds. For example, KK-classes coming from the
classical elliptic operators (the Euler characteristic operator, the signature
operator, and the Dolbeault operator) will be intensively studied. Attention
will also be paid to the equivariant case, where a finite group acts on the
manifold in question. These studies will deepen the link between topological and
analytic approaches to manifold theory. In addition, Professor Rosenberg will
study the classification of manifolds via their Yamabe invariants, and the
classification of metrics of positive scalar curvature, problems which involve a
quite subtle blend of differential topology, differential geometry, and
analysis. He will also study the applications of K-theory to the study of
C*-algebras, and various related problems on algebraic K-theory, especially on
algebras of operators or on algebras coming from quantization of geometrical
systems.

The context of this project is the use of new methods in analysis, based on
noncommutative operator algebras, for attacking problems in geometry and
topology. On the one hand, these methods are useful as a new source of tools for
studying geometry, especially in high dimensions. And on the other hand, the
methods are motivated (and more or less forced) by the quantization of classical
physical systems. The study of the scalar curvature properties of manifolds is
also motivated by problems in gravitation. Professor Rosenberg will continue to
train graduate students in analysis, geometry, and topology, and will also work
toward integration of mathematical software into the undergraduate mathematics
curriculum.
