The objective of this program is to demonstrate broadband wavelength conversion
across the near- and mid-infrared wavelength regions in chalcogenide waveguides.
Chalcogenide glasses are important waveguide core materials because of their
broad transparency range, high refractive index and high optical nonlinearity
relative to silica. Their high nonlinearity can enable efficient four wave
mixing (FWM) for a variety of nonlinear signal processing applications including
wavelength conversion and parametric amplification. The intellectual merit is in
the first demonstration of broadband, chip-scale FWM for near- to mid-infrared
wavelength conversion and parametric amplifiers. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts
are new source and amplifier options spanning the near- to mid-infrared and
providing hands-on fabrication experience and broadening the educational scope
of undergraduate and graduate electrical engineering students, including
underrepresented groups. . Applications include high resolution molecular
spectroscopy, greenhouse gas monitoring, combustion gas detection (e.g. methane
and sulfur dioxide), industrial gas sensing, and liquid and solid phase infrared
analysis based on attenuated total reflectance (ATR), typically used with
Fourier transform infrared spectrometers (FTIRs), on a chip. Society will
benefit through advancements in optical chip-scale processing as well as optical
sensing for environmental monitoring, medical diagnostics and homeland security.
