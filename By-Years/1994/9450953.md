9450953 Lovelock The University of Arizona is creating a Special Purpose
Computer Aided Classroom devoted exclusively to students taking Ordinary
Differential Equation and Linear Algebra sequences for sophomores, juniors, and
seniors. The emphasis in these courses is now less on methods and more on
thinking, understanding, and experimenting. This Special Purpose Classroom
contains 32 DOS machines with the IBM Personal Science Laboratory (PSL)
available on 8 machines. The PSL is being used to gather and display
experimental data in real time. During class time, the computers is being used
to enhance thinking, understanding, and problem solving, and encourage
supervised experimentation. The design of this classroom is particularly
conducive to interactive classes, cooperative learning, and working in groups.
This project impact about 1250 students per year. Typically, they are
prospective scientists, engineers, teachers of high school mathematics, and
mathematicians. One particular benefit is that future teachers are being taught
in ways that it is hoped they will later teach.
