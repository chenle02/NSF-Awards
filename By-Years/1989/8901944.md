Among other mechanisms that have been proposed to control microbial cell
division cycles (CDC), autonomous biological oscillators, ranging from those of
the relaxation type to those having limit cycle dynamics, provide a possible
means of integrating the disparate concepts of cell cycle transit, exit and
arrest. The long-range goal of this research is to determine the nature of the
oscillator(s) presumed to couple to the CDC and to generate periodicity of
division and other CDC "landmarks" (as well as to underlie circadian rhythmicity
in general). As a working hypothesis, based in part on recent findings in the
algal flagellate, Euglena gracilis, it has been proposed that NAD+, the
mitochondrial calcium transport system, calcium-calmodulin, NADP+ phosphatase
and NAD+ kinase, and, perhaps, cAMP together could constitute a light-
entrainable, self-sustaining circadian oscillator. These elements would comprise
"gears" of the clock underlying the overt rhythm of cell division (and other
variables, or "hands") in eukaryotic microorganisms. The approach initiated
during earlier work on this project will be continued. First, it will be
ascertained whether each successive element of this proposed control loop
exhibits circadian rhythmicity in cultures of wild-type Euglena and of an
achlorophyllous mutant maintained under free-running conditions (both in the
presence and absence of the well documented rhythm of cell division). Then, in
order to determine whether each element represents a "gear" of the clock, pulses
of various drugs and chemicals which are known to affect these elements will be
applied. Direct activation as well as inhibition should each generate phase
shifts in the biochemical rhythms and in the division rhythm. Particular
emphasis will be given to NAD+ kinase, calcium, and cAMP--putative clock
elements that have already been explored in some detail. Ultimately, the goal
will be to delineate the coupling links between the oscillator and the CDC
regulated by it. The goal of this research is to delineate the biochemical steps
proposed to be the components of a circadian oscillator that may underlie the
rhythm of the cell division cycle in the green alga, Euglena.
