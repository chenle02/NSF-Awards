The focus of this research is the use of yeast strains to express enzymes of
general utility in organic synthesis. The specific oxidative enzymes to be
studied include cyclohexanone monooxygenase, flavin monooxygenase and cytochrome
P-450's. These enzymes will not require cofactors and will be the equivalent of
a chiral m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid in a form that will be as easy to use as the
achiral reagent itself. They will be applicable to carry out such
transformations as olefin epoxidations, thioether oxidations (to chiral
sulfoxides) and Baeyer-Villiger reactions. With this award the Synthetic Organic
Program is supporting the research of Dr. Jon D. Stewart of the Department of
Chemistry of the University of Florida. Professor Stewart will focus his work on
yeast-expressed enzymes designed to carry out enantioselective reactions in
organic synthesis. Besides formation of optically active products which are
useful for the preparation of stereochemically complex systems that have
important biological properties, these enzymes all use molecular oxygen, rather
than an organic oxidant, which makes them attractive from both an economic and
environmental standpoint
