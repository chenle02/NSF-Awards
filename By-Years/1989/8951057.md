This project will provide upper division students of Electrical Engineering and
Physics with laboratory experience in fiberoptics and optical coatings. A new
one credit course has been designed to include eight experiments in fiberoptics
and two experiments in the fabrication of optical coatings. The course will
build upon an existing comprehensive optics course which includes a well
equipped laboratory. The equipment purchased consists of the apparatus necessary
to demonstrate the salient features of fiberoptics including lasers, power
meters, beam splitters, signal multiplexers, and auxiliary items. A lock in
amplifier and beam chopper will also be purchased to augment existing optical
coating chambers. The project draws upon existing optics programs developed at
other universities under the auspices of NSF. The university will match the
award with an equal amount of funds.
