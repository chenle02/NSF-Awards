Funds are requested to carry out the final stages of a 3-year NSF-funded project
to establish and disseminate research priorities in tropical biology. In 2000,
The Association for Tropical Biology (ATB), in collaboration with other
organizations, implemented a process to articulate and prioritize research in
tropical biology. The goals of the process are to review recent developments in
tropical biology and to define priorities for future research. The audiences for
the products include tropical biologists, other scientists, decision-makers, and
the general public. The first workshop in the series was held during the ATB
Annual Meeting in Bangalore, India, in 2000. An planning retreat for ATB
Officers and Councilors and associated scientists was held in Washington DC in
February 2002. In July 2002, a larger workshop was held within the venue of a
major international conference, the annual meeting of the ATB, which was
attended by natural and social scientists and policy makers.

This grant will support the second ATB retreat, during which the participants
will craft a draft report for the third workshop in partnership with the British
Ecological Society. This will be held in conjunction with the annual meeting of
the ATB in Aberdeen, Scotland in July 2003. The requested support will enable 15
U.S. scientists, including graduate students, to travel to attend the workshop
in Aberdeen. The participation of U.S. scientists will benefit US scientists and
those from tropical countries to promote scientific collaboration in the short-
and long-term. Funds will also be used to disseminate the results of the full
3-year effort through traditional and electronic media to the projected
audiences.
