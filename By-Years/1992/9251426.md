This project adds a laboratory component to an undergraduate genetics course
taken by majors in biology and majors in secondary school life science
education. Equipment purchased includes: a centrifuge (Beckman J2-21),
microcentrifuge (Beckman), a chromatography refrigerator, a shaker (Orbit), a
sterile transfer hood (Labconco), and 5 compound (Laboval) and 5 dissecting
(Meiji) microscopes. Laboratories to be added include exercises in both
classical and modern genetics with emphasis on integrating results from both.
Experiments to be implemented include: analysis of crosses, gene mapping, gene
interactions, gene regulation, mutagenesis, cytogenetics and recombinant DNA.
