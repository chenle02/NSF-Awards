This Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) project will
establish a resource center for electron microscopy. The center will serve
several local colleges and universities in the Atlanta area including Morehouse
College, Spelman College, Morris Brown College, the Morehouse School of
Medicine, and Clark-Atlanta University. These institutions need adequate
professional technical staff support to enhance the research infrastructure and
maintain the existing microscopy facilities. Special activities in the center
will include summer and academic year workshops on advanced electron microcopy
and a research colloquium series. This project will further enhance the posture
of meritorious research in the Clark-Atlanta University Center and will
strengthen the research productivity of promising investigators. Students will
benefit significantly by increased exposure to research. The principal
investigators are well trained and have published in refereed journals.
