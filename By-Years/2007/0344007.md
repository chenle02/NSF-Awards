This project seeks to learn more about how proteins are expressed from genes in
plants. After DNA is transcribed into RNA, the RNA molecules are often further
processed before they form messenger RNA, the molecule that specifies the
protein that will be synthesized from the instructions that were coded in a
gene. One type of RNA processing is RNA editing. In plant chloroplasts, the
organelle in plant cells that is responsible for photosynthesis, RNAs
transcribed from chloroplast genes are altered by the modifying of one
nucleotide ("C") into another ("U"). The change from C to U alters the amino
acid encoded by the RNA, and changes the composition of the protein that is
made. In chloroplasts, RNA editing is a way to correct mistakes in the genes
that would prevent production of functional chloroplast proteins. Plants without
proper RNA editing would fail to thrive. RNA editing also occurs in
microrganisms and animals, where the process is essential for synthesis of
important proteins. Maize chloroplasts are known to undergo 28 different C-to-U
editing events. However, none of the enzymes or proteins that carry out
chloroplast RNA editing have yet been identified. Furthermore, it is not known
why one C is selected for conversion to U, while most Cs remain unaltered. Maize
extracts capable of carrying out editing when provided with chloroplast RNAs
will be used to study the features of the RNA that are essential for recognition
of the proper C target of editing. The maize extracts will also be fractionated
in order to learn more about the molecules involved in converting C to U. These
studies will take advantage of databases containing maize nuclear and
chloroplast genome sequences, maize chloroplast protein sequence data, and maize
mutant collections which were generated through projects supported by the NSF.
Development of the in vitro editing extract will have a broad impact on the
editing community. The project will provide training opportunities at several
levels and include participation by underrepresented minorities.
