9508165 Xue This project entails the study of air-sea interaction processes
along the Gulf Stream front off the North Carolina coast using a three-
dimensional ocean model and a two-dimensional (vertical slice) coupled
atmosphere-ocean model. The work focuses on the following specific objectives:
(1) an investigation of the evolution of the atmospheric and oceanic boundary
layers associated with passing winter cyclones; (2) to determine the
relationship between atmospherically induced oceanic motions and the regional
oceanic features, with emphasis on the Gulf Stream meanders; (3) to demonstrate
the air-sea coupling process during cold air outbreaks; and, (4) to quantify the
feedback effects on the mesoscale and synoptic scale motions in the atmosphere
and ocean.
