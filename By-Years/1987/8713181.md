This is a Minority Research Initiative Planning Grant proposal. Professor Gill
works in the area of operator theory on Banach spaces with applications to
mathematical physics. In recent years, Professor Gill has been working on an
analytic approach to the Feynman Dyson calculus, a conceptual operator theoretic
approach to problems that arose in quantum electrodynamics. The efforts of
Professor Gill apply to linear evolutions on reflexive Banach spaces, and he
proposes to remove the reflexivity restriction, allow for minimal domain
considerations, and to extend the theory to nonlinear evolutions. He plans to
consult with experts on these scientific matters, thereby enhancing his research
program and elevating its level of effectiveness for further funding support.
