The specific objectives of this project are (1) to characterizethe cytochrome
bc1 complex of a photosynthetic purple non-sulfur bacterium by resonance Raman
spectroscopy and to characterize the binding sites on the complex for quinone,
cytochrome c2 and the inhibitor antimycin A and (2) to compare the cytochrome
bc1 complex and its soluble cytochrome c electron acceptor in apurple sulfur
bacterium with those of purple non-sulfur bacteria. Also to compare the
spectroscopic properties of these cytochrome bc1 complexes with the functionally
analogous chloroplast cytochrome b6f complex. Emphasis is placed on unique
aspects of bioenergetics in these bacteria or on the simplicity of processes in
these bacteria compared to the analogous one in mitochondrial respiration. A
number of spectroscopic (e.g., resonance Raman and electron paramagnetic
resonance spectroscopy), biochemical (e.g., chemical modification of specific
amino acids and photoaffinity labeling) and genetic techniques will be utilized
in an attempt to provide details at the molecular level about these electron
transfer reactions that are central to energy transduction in photosynthetic
bacteria. %%% The energy needed for cell metabolism is generated through several
different mechanisms. In this study, electron transport linked to an
electrochemical gradient will be studied in a photosynthetic bacterium. This is
a convenient experimental system because electron transfer can be started and
stopped by turning light on or off.
