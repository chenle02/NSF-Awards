The above-referenced proposal asks for support to conduct heat flow and
electrical resistivity/transient EM measurements of sections of the so-called
TAG (Trans-Atlantic Geotraverse) hydrothermal field associated with the north-
central Mid-Atlantic mid-ocean spreading ridge. Proposed work could result in
significant augmentation of ALVIN geophysical measurement capabilities, as well
as provide geophysical characterization of the extent and nature of the
hydrothermal deposits at the TAG site, a candidate for future drilling in the
1994-1995 time-frame.
