Pre-service teacher preparation activities are developed by a team of faculty
members at the University of Tulsa and Tulsa Junior College. These activities
focus on three principal areas: preparation of parateachers; implementation and
planning for summer academies designed to recruit and improve the preparation of
future teachers; and an evaluation of the science and mathematics curriculum
needs for teacher preparation in the State of Oklahoma. A curriculum for
elementary level parateachers is developed, implemented, and evaluated, and a
formulation of a curriculum for secondary school parateachers is completed. A
high school summer academy is implemented and detailed planning activities for
elementary and middle school summer academies is conducted. The evaluation of
mathematics and science curriculum needs is done to identify common goals and
foster closer cooperation among institutions providing pre-service teacher
preparation in Oklahoma.
