A computer controlled high performance liquid chromatograph with a multiple
wavelength uv-visible detector (HPLC/UV) is being introduced into the biology
and chemistry curricula. Instruction in the use of chromatographic
instrumentation for environmental and forensic applications is emphasized. This
instrumentation is used in introductory chemistry courses, upper-level biology
and chemistry courses, and undergraduate research projects. Students conduct
environmental investigations analyzing water, soil, sediments, and biota for
agricultural chemicals. These and other investigations provide an opportunity to
compare and contrast HPLC/UV instrumentation with other techniques as part of
the chemistry course on instrumental methods.
