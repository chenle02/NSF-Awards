This proposal contains ten problems related to various statistical topics which
the investigator wishes to study during the period for which this funding is
sought. A dominant topic in this proposal is resampling, i.e., bootstrap,
jackknife, etc, an area which has been the author's main focus of research.
Other areas of statistics covered here include: data depth and multivariate
analysis, confidence regions and bands, directional data analysis survival
analysis, robustness, ANOVA and experimental designs. The proposal includes some
proposed notions and procedures yet to be explored, mathematically and
numerically. The proposed research mainly focuses on a relatively new topic in
statistics named the bootstrap. This new methodology in statistics is computer
intensive, it is often more accurate and accessible to more users, since it
replaces mathematical labor by computer work. One of the thrusts of this
research is to investigate how well this methodology can evaluate its own
accuracy. Among other topics of research proposed here, is the development of a
very general approach in the field of survival analysis, which is a key tool in
pharmaceutical researches. The research will also include new concepts of
statistical robustness, an area pertaining to the lack of sensitivity (which is
desired) of data-conclusions to a relatively few unrepresentative data values.
