This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) project provides
funding for 10-week summer research experiences in physical-layer security at
the University of Coimbra in Portugal. Over the three-year project duration, the
three yearly unifying topics of student projects will be network protocols for
secrecy, intentional jamming techniques for secrecy, and novel error-correcting
codes for secrecy in wireless networks. Students will implement projects on a
software radio platform where appropriate. The disseminated results will aid
system designers in adding a completely new layer of security at the physical-
layer of modern networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will increase the
understanding of physical-layer security for communications in real-world sensor
networks. Over the three-year grant period, fifteen students (including at least
twelve undergraduates) will conduct research in Coimbra, Portugal. The
Portuguese research mentors are experts in physical-layer security and coding
theory. Stronger collaborations between the universities will develop, leading
to advanced results in physical-layer security. The research results may alter
secure system design across many platforms to produce modern data security
solutions. Recruitment of student participants will be performed at several
diverse institutions throughout Southern Colorado, and will allow the
development of effective mechanisms for attracting underrepresented groups to
STEM research.
