Kristin Krantzman is supported by a Research Planning Grant from the Special
Projects Program in the Chemistry Division to perform theoretical studies of the
Eley-Rideal mechanism for reactions between atomic hydrogen and adsorbates on
silicon surfaces. The Eley-Rideal mechanism, which involves a direct reaction
between an incoming gas atom and an equilibrated adsorbate, is quite distinct
from the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, in which a reaction occurs between
equilibrated adsorbates. Krantzman will attempt to elucidate the mechanism using
a combination of classical trajectory simulations and density functional theory.
The specific objectives of her research are: 1) to perform molecular dynamics
simulations related to the Eley-Rideal mechanism; 2) to use density functional
theory to calculate energies of configurations important to elucidation the
mechanism; and 3) to use density functional theory to generate accurate
potential energy surfaces for further simulations. Recently the goal of surface
chemistry has advanced beyond traditional heterogeneous catalysis toward
microengineering on the atomic scale. For example, in the microelectronics
industry, integrated circuits are fabricated by the deposition of epitaxial
silicon films and etching them with plasmas. In order to make our dream of
building materials atom by atom a reality, a picture of the mechanisms
underlying these gas-surface processes is essential. A fundamental atomic level
understanding of the Eley-Rideal mechanism will help to achieve this goal for
processes which require low substrate temperatures so that side reactions with
the surface are minimized.
