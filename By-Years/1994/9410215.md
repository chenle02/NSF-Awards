9410215 DiMilla The overall objective of this project is to apply a radial-flow
chamber and SPR microscopy to identify the effect of variations in the molecular
adhesive properties of a supporting substratum, the receptor/ligand interaction,
and the extent of cell spreading during attachment on the strength of adhesion
and the mechanism of detachment of mammalian cells from model organic surfaces.
Molecular-level insight into receptor/ligand-mediated cell adhesion phenomenon
is necessary for optimizing many current biotechnologies, including cell
affinity chromatography, for developing novel biomaterials for use as supports
for tissue culture and artificial organs, and for implementing new clinical
therapies for treating diseases involving pathological adhesive behavior. ***
