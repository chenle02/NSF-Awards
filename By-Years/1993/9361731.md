9361731 Anderson This Small Business Innovation Research Proposal (SBIR) Phase I
proposal is in the general area of electrochemical synthesis. The objective of
the research is to replace hypochlorite with ecologically-compatible hydrogen
peroxide prepared on site. Presently the only available on-site technology is
the electrochemical production of caustic (pH 14) peroxide. The high pH and high
costs associated with the use of sodium hydroxide limits the environmental
applications of peroxide prepare in this way. In this feasibility study, an on-
site peroxide generator requiring no reagents other than water and power will be
developed based on an electrochemical technique employing anion exchange
membranes. The cathodic reduction of oxygen to peroxide in base is highly
efficient. The incorporation of anion exchange membranes in a fuel cell
arrangement will utilize this chemistry but will eliminate the necessity for
free flowing caustic, producing only neutral peroxide. %%% The availability of
low cost, on-site generated neutral hydrogen peroxide would find immediate
applications in municipal water purification, bioremediation, and waste disposal
and have an favorable environmental impact in the various applications where
environmentally hazardous oxidizers are currently used. ***
