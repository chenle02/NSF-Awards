Increased research on marine fungi has shown that this group is widespread and
ecologically important. Apparently, marine fungi have evolved along parallel
lines from a diversity of ancestors, but their origins are unclear. The recent
discovery of Koralionastetaceae, a fungal family associated with corals and
sponges, may contribute to our understanding of the origin of marine fungi. The
most intriguing aspect is that the genus occurs not only in Caribbean but also
in Australian coral reefs. Because of the peculiarity of the habitat and the
geographic barriers, no genetic exchange between these populations could have
been possible in recent times. It is, therefore, hypothesized that they have
developed before the close of the Isthmus of Panama in the Pliocene, but most
likely earlier. The primary objective of the proposed research is to clarify the
life histories of described and new members of Koralionastes and to prepare
detailed descriptions and illustrations. Examinations will include morphological
studies and experiments with live material. A second major objective is the
preparation of a revised, illustrated and annotated key to the filamentous
higher marine fungi, to be used by taxonomists and non-taxonomists in the course
of their work or in the classroom. The last comprehensive key, published in
1979, is in urgent need of a revision because the number of described species
has increased by 36% and many name changes have been made.
