9610530 Klaiber In the past several years, there have been many successful
bridge workshops and conferences through which were developed excellent
communication and cooperation in the U. S. "bridge community". Such
communication and cooperation is equally valuable on the international scene as
well. In July, the Seventh International Structural Faults and Repair Conference
will be held in Edinburgh, Scotland. This conference will provide an excellent
opportunity for international communication. It is therefore, important that a
group of U. S. engineers participate in this conference. The participants will
be selected by a Steering Community based on submitted abstracts to the
Conference. Following the Conference, the U. S. team will participate in a one-
day technical tour developed in consultation with the Conference organizer. ***
