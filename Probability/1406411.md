This research is in the area of Probability and Statistical Physics. Statistical
physicists and probabilists often try to understand the macroscopic behavior of
systems consisting of many microscopic random inputs, which can give rise to
interfaces between two phases at a critical temperature, such as water and ice
at zero degree Celsius. This can be modeled via the scaling limit behavior
(macroscopic behavior) of discrete lattice models (microscopic inputs) in
critical cases. Oded Schramm's SLE (Stochastic Loewner Evolution) processes have
led mathematicians and physicists to a clean and novel understanding of the
scaling limits of the interfaces in discrete models in two dimensions. And CLE
(Conformal Loop Ensemble) is the generalization of SLE which is predicted to be
the scaling limit of the collection of all interfaces in discrete models. This
research focuses on CLE and its relation between Gaussian Free Field, Liouville
Quantum Gravity, and Random Maps.

Precisely, the research considers the following two problems. (1) The
conformally invariant metric on CLE. Since the introduction of SLE and CLE,
CLE(4) has been proved to be the scaling limit of the collection of level lines
of discrete Gaussian Free Field. In the previous work of the principal
investigator, a time parameter is constructed for CLE(4) loop configurations,
and a coupling between Gaussian Free Field and CLE(4) with time parameter is
given. The research aims to show that the time parameter defined on CLE(4) is in
fact a deterministic function of the loop configuration. This result would
deepen understanding of the relation between Gaussian Free Field and CLE. (2)
CLE-decorated Liouville Quantum Gravity. Liouville Quantum Gravity is
conjectured to be the scaling limit of random maps. The research project first
aims to understand CLE-decorated Liouville Quantum Gravity and then to explore
the relation between CLE-decorated Liouville Quantum Gravity and loop-decorated
random maps.
