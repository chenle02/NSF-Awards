This research program investigates the theory and pragmatics of naming and
sharing data and computation threads, using principles of optimal evaluation and
linear logic. These tools explicitly highlight the operations of copying and
discarding that are essential in procedure calling
protocols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project analyzes the algorithmics of optimal
evaluation, the complexity of box management, and the evaluation pragmatics for
languages with explicit control. Also included in the research agenda are
intensional full abstraction theorems, where the meaning of a term includes
operational information about how computations are shared, and the use of
context semantics as a flow analysis tool, where the so-called "geometry of
interaction" can give information about how procedures access their arguments. A
further investigation of ``superposition'' phenomena that occur in high-level
sharing is planned. The final component seeks a refined explanation of the bus
system of graph reduction in terms of linear logic, in the hope of giving a new
categorical rendition of the incremental computation that characterizes optimal
evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
