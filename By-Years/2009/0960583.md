The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is awarded a grant to advance the
understanding of the evolution of complex traits, such as the development of
multi-cellular body plans or an organism's social behavior. The PI will use the
analysis of brain plasticity and social behavior as test-bed questions to build
and test quantitative genomic models for the evolution of complex traits. Brain
plasticity refers to the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new
neural connections as a result of experience. The project will test the
hypothesis that genetic pathways that mediate brain plasticity are enriched in
conserved gene regulatory modules in brain tissues across species, by developing
novel analytical models and computational tools for modeling the evolution of
gene regulatory modules. The first model is an evolutionary model for genetic
modules, which can be applied to identify conserved as well as species-specific
genetic modules using and gene expression data in multiple species and
phylogenetic distances. The second model can be applied to analyze the
transcription networks implemented in related species with a conserved
phenotype. The regulatory relationships between an orthologous set of TFs and
target genes will be simultaneously modeled and identified in all the species
under consideration. Both sequence data and gene expression data, when
available, will be modeled. This project will deliver two software tools for
integrated comparative analysis of genome and transcriptome data. by These
software tools will be hosted on a dedicated server
(http://sysbio.bioen.uiuc.edu/grn.htm) and made available to the entire research
community through user-friendly web applications. The project will include the
participation of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students, and the
software will be used in a hands-on course taught by the investigator at a
bioinformatics camp for young women.
