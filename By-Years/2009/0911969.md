This collaborative project between the University of Denver (DU) and the
University of the District of Columbia (UDC) seeks to develop faculty expertise
and curricula at UDC so that UDC may seek the Center of Academic Excellence in
Information Assurance Education (CAEIAE) designation from the National Security
Agency. DU is assuming the role institutional mentor and is assisting UDC in the
development of courses, curriculum and research programs that are necessary for
UDC's application for CAEIAE designation. The project makes use of DU extensive
on-line and distance learning capabilities through which UDC students can take
night classes from DU that transfer for credit to UDC. The project also enhances
the quality of the information assurance education at DU through collaborative
teaching and research experiences. Graduates from UDC are given special
consideration for graduate work at DU. This project increases the number of
highly talented and highly qualified female and African-American graduates in
the information assurance field, thus addressing a need of documented national
importance.
