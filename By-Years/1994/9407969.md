Kirkpatrick 9407969 This project will investigate the mechanisms for the
diversification of mating displays and mating preferences between closely
related species. These traits are known to diversify at a very high rate and
therefore represent a model system for studies of the factors responsible for
behavioral differences both within and between the species. The investigators
will use mathematical models that describe genetic change in mating displays,
mating preferences, and other traits that are genetically coupled to them.
Research will focus on three mechanisms: (1) direct survival effects of mating
preferences (the "direct selection" hypothesis), (2) genetic coupling between
traits that increase survival and mating preferences (the "good genes"
hypothesis), and (3) mate choice copying. Recent experimental data show that all
three mechanisms influence preferences and displays, but have not evaluated
their relative importance. Mathematical models developed in this research
program will use data to produce the first quantitative estimates of the
relative impacts of these mechanisms. Results will produce insights into the
causes of behavioral variation and the processes of speciation.
