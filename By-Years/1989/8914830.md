An isotope ratio mass spectrometer will be acquired to support a series of
ecological and plant physiological projects at the University of Utah. Specific
projects include: 1) water use, productivity and interactions among desert
plants, 2) parasitic interactions among higher plants, 3) water relations and
dioecy, 4) variation in water relations of juveniles, 5) carbon isotope rations
and productivity of dry beans, 6) scaling from leaf to canopies, 7) isotopic
composition of paleosol carbonates and organic matter as paleoecologic and
paleodimatic indicators, 8) hydraulic left and water exploitation in semiarid
vegetation, and 9) ecophysiology of sunlight utilization by plants.
