This award funds programs for research and education with special emphasis in
algebraic geometry and nonabelian Hodge theory. The investigator plans to study
the actions of homotopy groups and homology groups on homotopy types of
varieties using developments in nonabelian Hodge theory as introduced by C.
Simpson. The investigator hopes to shed light on the interplay between the
geometric structure of algebraic varieties and the representation theory of
their fundamental groups. In addition to his research, the investigator proposes
a number of broadly based activities for the promotion of education at all
levels. This includes the mentoring of high school students through the
Mathematical Circles initiative, which brings these students to campus for
tutoring and help in competitive exams. Moreover, the investigator intends to
enhance opportunities for graduate students and postdoctural fellows at Irvine
by organization of research workshops in algebraic geometry.

The National Science Foundation strongly encourages the early development of
academic faculty as both educators and researchers. The Faculty Early Career
Development (CAREER) Program is a Foundation-wide program that provides for the
support of junior faculty within the context of their overall career
development. It combines in a single program the support of quality research and
education in the broadest sense and the full participation of those
traditionally underrepresented in sciences and engineering. This program
enhances and emphasizes the importance the Foundation places on the development
of full, balanced academic careers.
