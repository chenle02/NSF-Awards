Professor Paul Dubin of Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis is
supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to study the molecular
basis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)-protein interactions. GAGs are strongly
anionic polysaccharides that constitute the major components of proteoglycans,
and they are important in the diverse functions of this class of proteins. Some
of the important functions are wound repair and tumor formation. The approach is
to use Frontal analysis continuous caplliary electrophoresis (FACCE). The major
challenge is the heterogeneity of GAGs, thus the study pushes the limits of
separation and characterization techniques. The work provides interdisciplinary
training to students in the areas of analytical chemistry, cell biology,
biophysical chemistry and computational chemistry. The PI collaborates with J.
Dage from Eli Lilly Research Central Research for the use of MS-TOF
instruments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A better understanding of structure/function
relationships of gylcosaminoglycan-protein interactions will improve the design
and efficacy of heparin-based drugs, which belong to one of the most prescribed
drug categories (anticoagulants and antithrombotics).&lt;br/&gt;
