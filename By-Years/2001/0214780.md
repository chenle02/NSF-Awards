This project will install a nitrate sensor and a set of optical sensors on two
moorings that will be deployed along the Chukchi shelf during the Shelf-Basins
Interactions (SBI) field program in 2002. The currently funded SBI mooring
program does not include any biochemical or optical sensors in its
instrumentation array and the SBI Scientific Steering Committee has strongly
recommended that such types of sensors be added to provide a better
understanding of the variability of physical and biological processes that
influence the exchange of energy and material between the shelf and the deep
basin. The SBI mooring PI's have agreed to accommodate these instruments on
their array. This project will attempt to increase the operational time and
capability of these instruments and will provide a record of a primary nutrient
and the optical properties of the upper water column during the first year of
the SBI field program.
