In the last thirty years there have been two dramatic breakthroughs in analytic
number theory: the use of automorphic forms on higher rank groups, and the
introduction of multiple Dirichlet series. A conference focusing on recent
advances around these two breakthroughs will be held at Perrotis College,
Thessaloniki, Greece, July 14-18, 2014. The conference will feature lectures by
twenty leaders in the field. One of the main aims of this conference is to
introduce young researchers to this exciting new frontier by suggesting open
problems and new research directions. This award supports the participation of
US-based postdocs, graduate students, and researchers without other sources of
support.

The conference "Analytic Number Theory and its Applications" is centered on
research by Jeff Hoffstein and his collaborators and students. Topics to be
discussed include the construction of Weyl group multiple Dirichlet series
associated to any finite or affine reduced root system, convexity breaking, non
vanishing results of L-functions, the description of Fourier-Whittaker
coefficients of metaplectic Eisenstein series in terms of crystal graphs,
asymptotics of integral moments of L-functions, and surprising relationships
between theta functions and multiple Dirichlet series. The meeting provides an
international audience with opportunities for cross-pollination of ideas between
classical problems in analytic number theory and recent breakthroughs in
automorphic forms and multiple Dirichlet series.
