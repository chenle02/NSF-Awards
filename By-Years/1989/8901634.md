This project consists of a series of three workshops to be held in successive
summers for approximately twenty women researchers in statistics and probability
who have received their doctorate degree within the five years prior to the
workshop year. The first workshop is scheduled for August 4-5, 1989 and would
immediately precede the 52nd Annual Meeting of the Institute of Mathematical
Statistics to be held in conjunction with the American Statistical Association
and regions of the Biometric Society from August 6-10, 1989 in Washington, D.C.
The second workshop would likely be scheduled for August 4-5, 1990 and would
precede the Annual American Statistical Association meeting from August 6-9,
1990 in Anaheim, California. The third workshop is tentatively scheduled for
August 18-19, 1991 and would be held prior to the 54th Annual Meeting of the
Institute of Mathematical Statistics and regions of the Biometric Society from
August 19-22, 1991 in Atlanta, Georgia. The director of the project is Professor
Lynne Billard of the University of Georgia. The purpose of the workshops will be
to increase and foster the research activity of the participants. It is hoped
that the participants will use the workshop and the resulting professional
contacts to enhance their research and decrease their isolation.
