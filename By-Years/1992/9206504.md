This award provides two-thirds of the funding needed to upgrade and modernize
the electron microprobe in the Department of Mineral Sciences at the American
Museum of Natural History (AMNH) in New York City. AMNH is committed to
providing the remaining funds required. The upgrade consists of a computer
automation system and the installation of a new synthetic light-element crystal
that will allow quantitative analysis of the elements oxygen and nitrogen and
improve the detection limits for fluorine. The staff of the Department of
Mineral Sciences at AMNH are involved in research projects and curatorial
activities for the museum's valuable collection which require the quantitative
chemical micro-analytical capabilities of a modern electron microprobe system.
