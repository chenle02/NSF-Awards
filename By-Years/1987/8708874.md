This project studies relavent reaction parameters in the development of silicon
carbide fibers through a novel low temperature metallurgical process that
converts carbon into silicon carbide. A copper silicon eutectic system is used
to carry out the reaction at lower temperature. The research program is designed
to study the reactivity of various types of precursor carbon, the effect of
porosity, and the wetting characteristics of small radius filaments by molten
metals. Silicon carbide fibers are increasingly used for high temperature
composites. However, the commercial processes used have the following
limitations: 1. high processing costs 2. presence of impurities 3. inability to
produce long fibers. This project addresses some of the weaknesses of the
current processes and proposes an improved method of processing silicon carbide
fibers.
