This program is designed to attract undergraduate, particularly women and
minorities, into lasers and optics research, with emphasis on lightwave
technology as an emerging technology. Many recent studies, including the
National of Academies recent report on Photonics, identify this as one of the
key technical growth areas of the future. Inspiration for these students to
continue into graduate school will come from participating in research projects
within the interdisciplinary Center for Laser Studies. This research
organization is unusual for its large percentage of women and minorities, both
on its staff and in its graduate student population. In 1989 the Center received
REU site funding and developed a very successful program which included three
Chicanos, two females and one black student. This gives the Center a chance to
better recruit minority and women undergraduates and to provide more opportunity
to participate in research, inspiring them to continue in graduate students. The
projects include noise properties of semiconductor arrays, characterization of
nonlinear services, fabrication and characterization of heterojunction lasers,
solid stat lasers, fiber- optics power-by-light headset, and thermal transport
in thin films.
