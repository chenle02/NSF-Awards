This award will provide 45% of the funds required to purchase a noble-gas mass
spectrometer and construct a low-blank gas extraction system. Lehigh University
will provide the remaining 55% and is pledged to supporting the necessary
laboratory renovations in their Department of Geological Sciences where the
system will be housed and operated. Planned research for the next several years
includes theoretical studies aimed at providing a better understanding of the
argon 40/39 technique for dating rocks and minerals as well as applied research
to exploit the technique to rock masses that have undergone complex thermal
histories.
