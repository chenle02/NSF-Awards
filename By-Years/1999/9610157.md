DMS 9610157 WORKSHOP ON STOCHASTIC MODEL BUILDING AND VARIABLE SELECTION
ABSTRACT As statistical analysis and modeling of larger and more complex data
sets is becoming more common, new and better computer based tools for guiding
the initial specification of the main features of statistical models are being
developed. Recently, a new generation of stochastic algorithms has been emerging
as an important augmentation to traditional deterministic strategies. Examples
include stochastic search methods for variable selection, graphical models,
selection of variable transformations and interactions, wavelet thresholding,
ARMA modeling, CART, MARS, neural networks and more. A workshop on stochastic
model building and variable selection that blends methodology and case studies
will significantly advance this field of statistical research and will encourage
dissemination of an important class of modeling techniques to practitioners. The
workshop is organized in coordination with the NBER/NSF Time Series Seminar and
with the Workshop on Wavelets in Statistics. The common research themes between
stochastic model building, wavelets analysis and times series analysis will be
exploited to create both a synergy at the research level and savings in travel
expenses and arrangements. Funds from this grant will be used for domestic
travel expenses for participants based in the U.S.A, particularly junior
researchers, and others from underrepresented groups.
