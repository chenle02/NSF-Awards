9418035 Roe This is a proposal by three faculty and three research scientists at
the University of Michigan to continue their participation in the L3
collaboration at the LEP collider at CERN. In the last year the group has been
instrumental in installing new electronics for the hadron calorimeter and has
been actively participated in the analyses of Z decays which were presented at
the 27th International Conference on High Energy Physics at Glasgow in July of
1994. Their ACP computer farm is particularly valuable in the production of
Monte Carlo events to measure the acceptance of the detector. In the course of
the next grant period they expect the energy of LEP to be raised above 160 GeV
where it will be possible to measure the mass of the W. In addition they expect
to gain new information on the triple boson coupling and to set better limits on
a low mass Higgs boson. ***
