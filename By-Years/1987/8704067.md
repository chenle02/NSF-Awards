Dr. Pipher at the University of Rochester will use an infrared array camera
which she helped develop to obtain images of regions of star formation in our
Galaxy and in starburst galaxies. The objective of the program is to study the
interactions of stars and of central energy sources of galaxies with the
surrounding gas and dust. With the infrared array camera, Dr. Pipher has the
unprecedented ability to resolve structure in these cosmic sources, which should
unfold new phenomena and elucidate their physical characteristics. The infrared
region of the spectrum is only now being exploited with a shift from an
instrumental development phase to one of addressing astrophysical problems.
Infrared detector arrays now provide high quality images of sources. Regions of
star formation and the nuclei of other galaxies have become initial targets for
observation at infrared wavelengths because the dust which characterizes these
regions prevents any visible radiation from escaping the cloud and revealing
activity within. Thus, new cosmic phenomena are being explored in ways never
before possible.
