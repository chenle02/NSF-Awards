This research will explore the applicability of object-oriented data
abstractions and data-flow control methods to mechanical CAD/CAM. The
integration of mechanical process and product design will be studied and, in
particular, the area of Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining and
mechanical design. Design and manufacturing can be throught of as a series of
mapplings, going from concepts to drawings to models to manufacturable models
and so on. It has been practiced as a sequential series of steps. This work is
an important start in moving towards Computer-Integrated Manufacturing by
exploring concurrent process and product design and can be expected to identify
some of the advantages and limitations of using object-oriented programming for
integrating CAD and CAM.
