This project is research in mathematical physics. Professor Herbst will
investigate certain problems connected with Schroedinger operators. (These
operators encode the dynamics of quantum mechanical systems. The spectrum of the
Schroedinger operator is the set of possible energy levels of the system.)
Determining which potentials for the Schroedinger operator in the N-body problem
give eigenvalues embedded in the continuous spectrum, and showing that normal
exponential decay is generic in this setting are two lines of investigation to
be pursued. In addition Professor Herbst hopes to prove a correlation inequality
involving Gaussian probabilities and to investigate the question of when a
stopping time is a hitting time in the Brownian motion process.
