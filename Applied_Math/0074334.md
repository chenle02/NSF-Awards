Temam 0074334 The investigator and his colleagues study nonlinear problems from
meteorology, oceanography, and fluid mechanics, using the mathematical tools
offered by analysis, the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations,
dynamical systems theory, and computation. The part of this project related to
meteorology and oceanography focuses on the following areas: (1) Open boundary
conditions for limited domain simulations and well posedness issues for
meteorology and oceanography problems. (2) Balanced and unbalanced models in
atmosphere sciences. (3) Well-posedness and stability problems in oceanography.
The fluid mechanics topics focus on several aspects of turbulence theory,
including the connection between the conventional theory of turbulence, the
dynamical systems approach, and the Navier-Stokes equations. The investigators
intend also to complete a research monograph on some of these aspects of
turbulence. Central problems in meteorology and oceanography are concerned with
understanding and predicting the behavior of the atmosphere and the ocean --- in
what patterns do these fluids, air and water, move? The mathematical equations
that describe the motions are difficult to analyze, and computations are also
difficult because the physical phenomena are complex and nonlinear. In fluid
mechanics, understanding fluid flows generally and turbulence in particular, and
developing efficient numerical methods to compute these flows, are major themes.
The investigators study several problems related to the behavior of atmosphere
and ocean fluid flows and to their effective computation. They also study and
develop computational methods for turbulent fluid flows of importance for
industrial processes.
