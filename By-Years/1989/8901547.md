The principal investigator will study several questions arising from the
analogues in several complex variables of the problem: can you hear the shape of
a drum? One question is whether there is an analogue of the Riemann-Roch Theorem
for CR manifolds. Another concerns the small-time off-diagonal behavior of the
heat kernel on CR manifolds. Investigations of normal forms for rigid
hypersurfaces will continue. And she will search for an algebra of
pseudodifferential operators which contains a parametrix for the Kohn Laplacian
on CR manifolds of finite type. Can you hear the shape of a drum? Was it
circular or square? This question was first addressed in a mathematical context
by V. Kac and continues to inspire intense study. Ramifications to signal
processing theory are manifold. The principal investigator will continue her
study of the complex analogues to this question, a field of study in which she
already is the foremost authority.
