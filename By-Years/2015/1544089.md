The activity will support travel for up to 20 students and 20 participants to
attend and present at a workshop on Radio Frequency Spectrum Management, which
will take place at the University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez, Puerto Rico. The
meeting will take place in August 2015. The grants will provide partial support
for travel, housing, and conference attendance. The topic of this conference is
of great relevance to the NSF's interests in spectrum management for research
applications, particularly radio astronomy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop
will have duration of 5 days, including one day for a presentation on the radio
interference issues at NSF's Arecibo Observatory. The goal of the workshop is to
recruit under-represented minorities in this important area, which is at the
convergence of science, engineering and economic development. The workshop will
have introductory and advanced topics, including Spectrum Management
fundamentals, Strategic Planning, Spectrum Management for Satellite Systems,
Scientific Research and Maritime Commercial Uses.
