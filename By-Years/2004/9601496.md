9601496 Falcone A sub-picosecond x-ray scattering facility will be developed at
a synchrotron beamline at the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory. This is a collaborative effort between the University of California
at Berkeley, the University of Michigan, and Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. The
facility incorporates an ultrafast x-ray streak camera on the x-ray beamline.
This fast detector will then be used to study rapidly evolving x-ray diffraction
patterns from ordered materials that are impulsively perturbed by energy from an
ultrashort pulse laser. The dynamics of melting and other structural phase
transitions will be probed in this way. %%% The research will result in a unique
facility for ultrafast studies of structural phase transitions by x-ray
scattering. The facility fills a current need at synchrotron sources of
techniques for carrying out real-time studies in a short time scale. The x-ray
streak camera development has potential for transferring the technology to the
commercial sector. ***
