A seventh grade multimedia science curriculum, using a constructivist pedagogy,
a thematic approach and a multidisciplinary organization of science has already
been developed by the proposers under other funding. In this project compatible
sixth and eighth grade curricula will develop which integrate material from
earth science, life science and physical science, using four different themes at
each grade level. The large ideas of science and science as a method of knowing
are stressed. Each unit includes teacher lessons; student activities and
bibliographic resources stored in software; a learning resource management tool,
compatible with either IBM or MacIntosh computers, which allows teachers to
choose, write and edit lessons, assign student activities, access videodiscs and
review supplemental material; four videodiscs; eight hands-on activities; and
pre- and in-service teacher models. Evaluation and teacher enhancement will be
done in cooperation with nearby universities.
