Objective:&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to explore a new class of
mid-infrared (IR) photodetectors based on the interband cascade (IC) structures,
which can cover a wide infrared spectral range from 3 to 12 microns by merely
adjusting quantum well layer thickness. Our goal is to achieve high performance
and low noise IC photodetectors (focus on 4-7 microns) at room temperature or
thermoelectric (TE) cooler temperatures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
Merit:&lt;br/&gt;IC photodetectors are based on a new operation principle
combining advantages of very fast intersubband relaxation and interband
tunneling for carrier transport and relatively slow interband transitions. This
research will advance the understanding of physical processes such as carrier
transport and photon absorption in IC photodetectors. Unlike photodetectors
based on intersubband transitions, IC photodetectors are sensitive to normal
incidence radiation. Furthermore, carrier transport/collection in the IC
photodetector is immune from background doping and material quality variations
in contrast to conventional semiconductor and type-II superlattice detectors.
Hence, this research will provide opportunity to investigate new phenomena
associated with underlying physics in interband cascade structures and devices,
and lead to high performance mid-IR photodetectors that can operate at or near
room temperature. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;This
research will generate new knowledge in the design and understanding of quantum
semiconductor structures and devices. The realization of high-performance mid-IR
photodetectors will have significant impacts on medical, industrial, defense and
homeland security applications. This work will provide students unique
opportunities to have education, training and research through the inherent
multidisciplinary topics. &lt;br/&gt;
