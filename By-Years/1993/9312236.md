9312236 Parker This is an award to provide renewed support for the operation of
the National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, National
Research Council's Water Science Technology Board. This Board provides a focal
point for studies related to environmental engineering aspects of water
management. The Board's objective is to improve the scientific and technological
basis for resolving important questions and issues relating to management of
water resources. This award is jointly supported by the Environmental
Engineering segment of the Environmental and Ocean Systems Program in the
Engineering Directorate and by the Hydrologic Sciences Program in the
Directorate for Geosciences. An important function of the Water Science
Technology Board is to conduct studies and to sponsor workshops and conferences
that can be utilized for program planning purposes. The Board also functions as
an appropriate means for coordination of research plans with other Federal
agencies including FEMA, USGS, EPA, DOE, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
