Estimates of public sector union wage differentials are typically smaller than
estimates of private sector union wage differentials. This study investigates
the extent to which this reflects the differences in legal environments which
govern bargaining in each sector. Public sector unions in many states must
bargain with fewer legal rights than their private sector counterparts. In the
extreme, public sector bargaining is prohibited by law. The estimation procedure
takes into account the possible endogeneity of the bargaining law variables in a
way which differs from previous studies. Random effects models are estimated and
Hausman tests carried out to test for correlation between the state-specific
error component and the independent variables. Preliminary analysis on data
taken from the l977 May Current Population Survey indicates that the legal
environment is not a key factor in explaining the small public sector union wage
differentials.
