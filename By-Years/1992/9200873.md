The principal investigator will conduct research in three related areas of
dynamical systems. The first area concerns the minimal interval exchange with
two or more discontinuities and asks whether it is prime. The second area of
research involves the Teichmuller geodesic flow and the third area concerns the
moduli space of flat Riemannian surfaces with fixed cone singularities. This
award will support research in the general area of dynamical systems. A process
which is very simple and easy to understand locally can become extremely
complicated, nonlinear, and difficult to analyze globally. Dynamical systems is
the study of this local to global relationship. Many physical systems can best
be modeled using this area of mathematics including fluid flow and turbulence,
complex biological systems, mechanical systems, and chemical reactions.
