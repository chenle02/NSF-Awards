This project investigates the theory and computation of optimization problems
and variational inequalities based on their equivalent formulation as a of
nonsmooth equations. On the theoretical side, the goal is to gain, through the
development of a comprehensive theory nonsmooth equations via their
approximations, a better understanding of the sensitivity, stability, and other
instrinsic properties of these mathematical programs. On the computational side,
the goal is to develop, relying on generalizations of the classical Newton
methods for smooth equations to the nonsmooth context, some robust, globally,
locally quadratically convergent algorithms for solving these mathematical
programs. The research is built on work in recent years which has demonstrated
the fruitfulness of this nonsmooth-equations approach to variational
inequalities, complementarity problems, and nonlinear programs.
