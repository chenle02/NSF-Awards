9728118 Clouse A great deal is known concerning the molecular mechanisms by
which steroid hormones regulate gene expression in vertebrates and insects. In
contrast, the growth-promoting steroids found in higher plants are only
beginning to be studied. Brassinosteroids are plant steroid hormones that act at
low concentrations (one billionth of a gram) to profoundly affect the growth of
a wide range of plants including arabidopsis, corn, soybean, rice, potatoes,
radish, lettuce, pepper and oranges. With previous NSF support, our laboratory
showed that brassinosteroids enhanced the elongation of stems and regulated gene
expression in plants. The objective of the current NSF grant is to study the DNA
sequences in brassinosteroid regulated genes that are responsible for
controlling the response to these plant steroid hormones. Because
brassinosteroids are similar in structure to animal steroid hormones,
understanding their activity has great potential importance in basic
developmental biology. In view of the multitude of demonstrated effects
brassinosteroids have on crops, a deeper understanding of the molecular
mechanisms of brassinosteroid action would have agricultural potential as well.
