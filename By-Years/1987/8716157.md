This award will support a U.S.-France Joint Seminar on the Reproductive Biology
of the Genus Ficus in Seasonal Environments. The seminar will be organized by
Prof. Doyle McKey of the University of Miami, Coral Gables, and Dr. Finn
Kjellberg of the Unite de Biologie des Populations et des Peuplements, National
Center for Scientific Research, Montpellier, France. The peculiar reproductive
biology of the genus Ficus, tied to pollination by species-specific fig wasps,
limits most of its representatives to regions where both the plant and wasps can
be reproductively active year-round, unrestricted by cold seasons. Most of the
species are therefore located in tropical environments. However, in areas of the
Mediterranean and in subtropical southern Florida, outlying species of Ficus can
be found, despite a marked cold season. This seminar will explore parallels and
contrasts between adaptations of these species to seasonal environments. Topics
will also include the relationships between adjustments in reproductive
phenology and other aspects of fig and fig-wasp biology. This seminar will be an
important step in coordinating research efforts worldwide on fig/fig wasp
mutualism, a system that has contributed significantly to theoretical and
empirical studies in population biology.
