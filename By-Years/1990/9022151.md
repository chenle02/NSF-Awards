Chemists carrying out frontier research are relying more and more on computers
that are capable of handling sophisticated simulations, data analysis and
graphics software. The need to accomodate multiple users on the single
laboratory computer and multiple users on a single chemistry department facility
can be met by a single solution: individual work stations for the majority of
user needs and, for the remainder, ready access to other types of work stations
and, ultimately, to a mini supercomputer. This award from the Chemistry Shared
Research Instrumentation Program will help the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Colorado at Boulder to acquire, maintain and operate a graphics
computer system. The areas of chemical research that will be enhanced by the
acquisition include: 1. Ab Initio and Semiempirical Calculations 2. Gas Phase
Ion Molecule Chemistry 3. MCSCF Calculations on Organic Radicals
