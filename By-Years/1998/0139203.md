This research by Professor Yi Lu of the University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry program. The goal of this work is to elucidate the role of each ligand
of an artificially introduced dicopper, Cu-A, center in azurin, which, in
nature, contains a mononuclear copper site. This will enable determining ligand
effects on geometric parameters, electronic structure and behavior of the Cu-A
center, which are essential to the function of important charge-transfer
proteins, such as cyctochrome oxidase. In addition, this study provides for the
direct comparison of the structural and functional properties of three important
electron transfer centers: blue (type 1) copper, Cu-A and Fe2S2. The di-iron
center will be inserted into the azurin by a new technique, expressed protein
ligation (EPL), which shows promise as a very efficient and cost-effective way
to generate milligram quantities of proteins containing unnatural amino
acids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electron-transfer proteins are vital to fundamental
life processes. The effects of the various amino acids surrounding the unusual
Cu-A site artificially placed in this protein will be systematically determined
and compared with that of the normal blue copper site and another two-metal
site, Fe2S2, which also occurs in essential electron-transfer
proteins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
