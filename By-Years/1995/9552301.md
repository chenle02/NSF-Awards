Through this project, a state-of-the-art tensile testing equipment is pruchased
for use in Adhesive Technology & Applications Lab, Engineering Materials, and
Polymer Processing. The tensile tester is one of the central tools used in the
study of adhesion. In the lab, many of the experiments performed changes in
adhesive bond strengths due to (a) surface preparations methods, (b) service
environments, (c) types of substrate, and (d) types of adhesive involve the use
of the tensile tester to observe the effect. The new instrument has a wide range
of tensile load forces, hot and cold environmental testing capabilities, fatigue
testing, and computer control and storage of data to enhance the results
measured.
