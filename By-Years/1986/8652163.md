Commercial television is a powerful medium that has rarely succeeded in
bringing scientific and technological information to its vast viewing public.
For approximately eight years Don Herbert and his series "HOW ABOUT..." has
brought science news to millions of viewers across the country. This series is
carried on over 150 commercial TV stations in 80% of the major markets. The
objectives of the program are to further the public's understanding and
appreciation of the importance of science, technology and medical research to
our way of life. Research Communications Ltd. will conduct a two-tiered study to
determine the impact and effectiveness of these news inserts. A telephone survey
will be conducted with station managers and news directors to document the
decision-making process. The second step involves a series of focus groups with
home viewers to determine the effectiveness of the series. Viewers will be asked
a series of questions as well as responding to sample news segments. The
research firm and Prinicpal Investigator have extensive experience in the media
research area. This project of $27,700 is a modest evaluation investment which
could provide clues and insights in mapping further commercial media strategies.
