9407055 Theoretical research will be conducted on the dynamical and electronic
properties of surfaces in materials. The work involves non-adiabatic charge
transfer, vibrational line shapes, atom- surface scattering, sticking and
desorption, and adiabatic potentials and rates. The principle goal of the
research is to discover the fundamental principles which determine the motion of
electrons, atoms, and molecules at the surfaces of metals and insulators, as
well as to develop theories of what the various experimental probes of these
motions actually measure. %%% A theoretical research program will be continued
to study the properties of surfaces and their response to various external
probes. The research is of fundamental importance in understanding the structure
and properties of surfaces, and of strategic importance in utilizing many of the
technologies which are so dependent on material surfaces such as catalysis and
microelectronics.
