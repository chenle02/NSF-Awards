A major objective of the grant is to investigate ballistic magnetoresistance
(BMR) in magnetic nanocontacts in technologically important magnetic
nanostructures based on the magnetic transition metals (Ni and Co) as well as
the half-metallic magnetite system. The nanocontacts will be made using
electrodeposition techniques along with nanometer size sharp tips fabricated
using electrochemical methods. A principal objective is to make a systematic
study of the effects of contact diameter, local domain structure and the
composition of the nanocontacts on BMR. The results from the study will
constitute fundamental understanding of spin-polarized electron transport across
nanometer-sized magnetic constrictions. The contact diameters will be selected
spanning from diffusive to ballistic electron transport regimes. The development
of BMR nanocontacts would greatly enable the current data storage capacity to be
increased from the current Gbits per square inch range to the terabits per
square inch range. The collaborative research between SUNY Buffalo and Arizona
State University involves participation at NIST for imaging magnetic structures
using Scanning Electron Microscopy with Polarization Analysis
(SEMPA).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research on microfabricated nanocontacts
supported on a solid substrate find a range of useful applications as stand-
alone units such as in ultra-high sensitivity magnetic sensors as well as novel
biological sensors where a given molecule can be made to give its own unique
electronic signature. Along with the laboratory training of researchers at
graduate and undergraduate levels, outreach activities include a five-week
summer apprentice program for minorities and women students from Buffalo-area
inner city high schools.&lt;br/&gt;
