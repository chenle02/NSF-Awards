Pesticide use on plant crops pose long-term effects to human health and the
environment. The U.S. Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Region, in a Draft
Environmental Impact Statement (1989) has adopted a pest management policy which
gives preference to non-chemical control measures. Reliable non- chemical
control is not available for fungal root diseases of conifer seedlings,
therefore chemicals remain in use. Environmentally safe strains of
microorganisms can effectively protect plants from root diseases. Furthermore,
new methods have been developed for coating seeds with these beneficial
organisms. As yet, these new technologies have not been applied to forest
nurseries. This research project will elevate biological control organisms and
current seed coating technology for biological disease control in barefoot
forest nurseries. The control of damping-off and root rot diseases of Douglas-
fir by Pythium, Fusarium, Phytophthora and Cylindrocarpon will be elevated. The
data obtained will assist in the production of a seed coating product which
would be available to federal, state and private forest nurseries. The product
will be adaptable to food crops as well as horticultural and ornamental
industries.
