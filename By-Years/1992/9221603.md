This award is the starter grant increment of Dr. Colon's Postdoctoral Fellowship
in Chemistry. The research will result in a better understanding of the
reorganizational energy of molecules as a function of distance in long range
electron transfer reactions. Electron transfer rates will be measured for Re(II)
and Re(I) coordinated to human myoglobin variants. The effects of distance of
electron transfer and of the electronic coupling in the protein on electron
transfer rates will be evaluated. Flash-quench and photoinduced electron
transfer experiments will be used to obtain the desired rates. %%% Biological
electron transfer plays major roles in respiration, photosynthesis, and immune
response. The research to be carried out will provide a better insight into
these important reactions. These insights will be helpful to scientists studying
many aspcects of human health.
