9550467 Zhang We propose to further conduct our research in the area of high
performance parallel/distributed and computing. We will concentrate on three
important problem areas: 1) investigating performance and computation problems
in parallel and distributed architecture and system design; 2) developing
parallel numerical methods and software for solving large real-world problems;
and 3) building software tool and environment for parallel and distributed
computing and performance evaluation. Our underlying goal of this research is to
understand the comparative advantages and disadvantages of various types of
multiprocessing hardware and software environments, and to discover new methods
that efficiently solve different types of application problems on parallel and
attract more minority graduate students to participate in high- performance
computing research supported by our established and growing expertise in the
proposed research areas. The proposed projects are major research activities in
the newly established High-Performance Computing and Software Laboratory at the
University of Texas at San Antonio, which has been funded by NSF, the U.S. Air
Force and industries. ***
