9602856 Nees This collaboration between The Center for Ultrafast Optical Science
(CUOS) at the University of Michigan and MEDOX Electro-Optics, Inc. will address
the fundamental barriers to the dynamic range of picosecond and subpicosecond
streak cameras. The research effort will concentrate on the reduction of jitter
in streak cameras to allow accumulation of the data from several ultrafast
events. By using linear photoconductive switching technology to generate the
voltage ramp in the streak tube a jitter-free voltage ramp can be generated. The
photoconductors used to generate this ramp will be characterized and the effect
of laser amplitude fluctuations on the absolute timing of the signal will be
studied. Several experiments involving optoelectronically swept streak cameras
will then be performed to ascertain the effectiveness of the jitter-reduction
method and to understand the remaining limitations on dynamic range and temporal
resolution. This activity is supported jointly by the Division of Physics and
the office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Directorate for Mathematical
and Physical Sciences, and is funded under the NSF "Grant Opportunities for
Academic Liaison with Industry" (GOALI) Program. ***
