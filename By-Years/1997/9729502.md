This award is made under the high performance connections portion of NCRI's
Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64. It provides partial
support for an OC-3 connection to the enhance and accommodate research needs for
the University of Cincinnati by establishing a connection to the Very High
Performance Backbone Network Service (vBNS) in through the Ohio Internet2
GigaPop currently being developed by the Ohio Academic Resources Network
(OARnet). Project in this proposal include: scientific visualization of large
scale molecular simulations, simulation of engineering systems involving fluid
dynamics, simulation of turbofan-based propulsion systems, parallel-distributed
computing, remote data access, CERC mechatronics distributed design system,
parallel and distributed systems network, compiler optimizations for distributed
clusters of workstations, data warehousing, and distance learning. With this
high performance network capability the University of Cincinnati will expand
current research and collaboration with both academic institutions and federal
laboratories. On this project, collaborating institutions include: Ohio
Supercomputing center, Ohio State University, University of California-Davis,
Los Alamos National Laboratory, Oak-Ridge National Laboratory, Lawarence
Livermore National Laboratory, Naval Research Laboratory, Miami University of
Ohio, and Write State University.
