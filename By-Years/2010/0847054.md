This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-

green engineering measures such as artificial turf, reflective roof coatings,
and urban forests have proven advantageous in conserving resources in individual
buildings, holistic modeling of urban meteorology and engineered systems at the
physical process level is lacking. Building upon engineering tools from fluid
mechanics, heat transfer and wireless embedded systems, this research will
improve the linkage of these processes and quantify indirect effects to catalyze
smart growth and sustainable urban engineering. The results are targeted to
provide a scientific basis for engineering and optimization tools that support
economic and public decision making. Multi-scale modeling from the building
scale, to the neighborhood and city scale will be conducted. On the building and
neighborhood scale, advances in modeling the heat and momentum exchange between
urban canopy and atmosphere, and the effect of atmospheric stability on
dispersion in urban environments are to result from this research. The
educational program will include collaboration with K-12 environmental science
teachers and environmental clubs across San Diego County. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
