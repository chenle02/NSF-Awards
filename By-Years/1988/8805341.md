This project studies the behavior of low-rise wood-framed buildings. It is
intended to develop guidelines for do's and don'ts for designers and builders. A
simple but realistic three-dimensional model for nonlinear analysis of low-rise
wood-framed buildings will be developed and used. A mathematical tool will be
produced to help understand the seismic performance of low-rise wood-framed
buildings by predicting such characteristics as strength, deformation, ductility
and damage potential. The model to be developed will enable the seismic behavior
of low-rise buildings to be studied rationally and lead to improved standards
and design methods.
