Multiple astronomical observations have established that about 85% of the matter
in the universe is not made of known particles. Deciphering the nature of this
so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics,
and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised
of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments
after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our
galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located
deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays.

The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration has pioneered the use of
low temperature phonon-mediated detectors to detect the rare scattering of WIMPs
on nuclei and distinguish them from backgrounds. This work will have a broad
impact which extends beyond the dark matter search. The technical developments
will further advance phonon-mediated detectors, which have already found many
applications in science and technology.

This program, working with techniques on the leading edge of measurement
technology, supports education and training of physics and electrical
engineering undergraduate students in the PI's group, a diverse body including
non-traditional and first-generation college students, as well as students from
groups underrepresented in STEM disciplines. The PI participates in the CU
Denver's Mini-STEM school, the local CafÂ´e Scientifique, and a field trip
program at a local K-8 magnet school.

This award will enable the PI and his students to fulfill specific
responsibilities for both SuperCDMS Soudan and SuperCDMS SNOLAB projects,
including operations support for SuperCDMS Soudan, superconducting quantum
interference device (SQUID) characterization and testing for SNOLAB, and support
during construction and initial commissioning. Planned activities also include a
modest R&D effort toward multiplexed SQUID readout, required for the next-
generation dark matter direct detection efforts.
