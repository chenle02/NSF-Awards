9413156 Warren This project is a contribution to the Indian Ocean Expedition
(IOE) of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE). In it, the PI will
participate as a co-principal investigator on two separate legs of the
hydrographic survey: line I-2 along 8 degrees South, and I-3 along 20 degrees
South. In addition, the PI will collaborate in the analysis and synthesis of the
data on these and other sections collected as part of the IOE, as well as with
the data from current meters deployed along line I-3. Objectives include studies
of meridional overturning, and descriptions of detailed paths and transports of
deep currents in the tropical South Indian Ocean that contribute to this
overturning. ***
