This project will develop a laboratory program in environmental health and
environmental chemistry using an electron capture detector, a capillary
conversion kit to convert a Hewlett-Packard Model 5880A (HP-5880A) gas
chromatograph equipped with dual flame ionization detector, and ancillary data
acquisition board and chromatographic software. This equipment will greatly
expand the scope of the laboratory experiences available to undergraduate
environmental health science and chemistry students, and will enable the
university to better assist high school science teachers. A number of laboratory
courses will be modified in order to make use of the requested enhancements to
the HP-5880A: Practicum in Environmental Health, Environmental Measurement,
Introduction to Research Techniques in Chemistry, Instrumental Methods of
Analysis, Introduction to Research in Chemistry. This resource will be made
available to colleagues and students from other graduate programs at Indiana
State University (ISU). In addition, we will prepare a laboratory manual that
will be used at ISU and made available to others upon request. In addition,
selected high school students and their teachers will be given an opportunity to
gain hands-on experience with the analysis of environmental samples.
