This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project possesses a unique
chemical detection technology in which colorimetric changes in an array of dyes
constitute a signal much like that generated by the mammalian olfaction system;
each dye is a cross-responsive sensor. This technology has recently been
expanded into the realm of the detection of aqueous analytes for use as an
electronic tongue - dubbed TasteSeeing. Preliminary results indicate that near-
instantaneous, vivid responses are obtained from small solution samples and that
the majority of the array appears to be robust in water. This Phase I program is
designed to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility of the
technology as a methodology to characterize aqueous solutions.

This technique, while attractive to a wide range of markets, will initially be
focused on the detection and identification of potential terrorist chemical
agents. The goal is to integrate the TasteSeeing technology into a portable and
inexpensive device to detect rapidly low levels of dissolved chemicals in water
and other fluids.
