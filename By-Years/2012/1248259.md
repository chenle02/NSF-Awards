This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a novel
hemodialysis catheter with an integrated distal valve that can be opened and
closed from the proximal hub. Chronic hemodialysis catheter use is associated
with significant complications such as infection, thrombosis and loss of lock
solution. This novel device will be the first to provide clinicians with a tool
to manage these complications. The research objectives include refining the
design of the distal valve; refining the design of the proximal hub; and an in
vitro assessment of lock solution loss and catheter thrombosis. The project will
create and evaluate at least three distal valve design concepts, with the most
promising prototype being optimized for performance and manufacturability.
Proximal hub designs will be similarly evaluated and optimized. The final distal
valve and proximal hub designs also will be validated and verified to ensure
they meet product performance requirements. A published in vitro model will be
used to study the final device?s ability to prevent loss of lock solution and
its tendency for catheter thrombosis. The novel device is expected to have
improved outcomes compared to standard catheters.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is a disruptive, novel
hemodialysis catheter for the vascular access device market, which was valued at
over $3 billion in the U.S. in 2009 and is estimated to reach more than $4.6
billion by 2016. Furthermore, the new catheter could provide the healthcare
system incredible savings because a significant portion of the $29 billion spent
annually treating end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients is dedicated to
managing complications with vascular access ? many of which are associated with
catheters, such as serious infections, thrombosis and loss of stock solution. If
successful, the proposed project should reduce catheter complications, leading
to improved clinical outcomes, higher levels of patient satisfaction and lower
overall healthcare costs.
