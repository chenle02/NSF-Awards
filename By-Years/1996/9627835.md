Manga 9627835 Quantitative values for properties of geological materials at high
pressure and temperature, such as those obtained in the diamond anvil cell
(DAC), are essential for understanding the present state and the past evolution
of the Earth. The PI proposes to develop a set of 1- and 3-dimensional models of
the temperature distribution in the DAC for a range of experimental
configurations. Results obtained from the combination of experimental data with
theoretical analyses will be applied to the Earth, and implications for the
composition and thermal structure of the mantle and core will be studied.
