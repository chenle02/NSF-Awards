The focus of this research is to use peptide architecture to incorporate
bifunctional catalysis into small molecules. Combinatorial synthesis will be
used in conjunction with a high-throughput fluorescence-based screen and a
subsequent chiral GC assay to optimize the reactivity of beta-turn peptides.
These small enzyme mimics have been shown to function as catalysts, and will be
used to achieve kinetic resolution of simple alcohols, enantioselective ketene
additions, enantioselective carbon-carbon bond formation with various
nucleophiles, and enantioselective conjugate addition of azides and thiols to
achiral enamides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this renewal award, the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational
efforts of Dr. Scott. J. Miller of the Department of Chemistry at Boston
College. Professor Miller will focus his research on the development of
catalysts that mimic enzymes found in nature for the synthesis of new
pharmaceuticals. The educational activities of the award will include the
training of graduate students, undergraduate students and postdoctoral fellows
in a multidisciplinary environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
