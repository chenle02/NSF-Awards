This research contains two projects. First, the principal investigator plans to
investigate tail distributions of sums of Banach-valued independent random
variables. The principal investigator, with Pawel Hitczenko, already has many
results concerning the case of real-valued random variables. But now the
principal investigator feels that there are also fundamental questions
concerning the Banach-valued case, for which up until now there are only
partial, albeit deep, results. The second part of this proposal is to find new
martingale inequalities. This work, joint with his Ph.D. student Jerry Shen,
will extend the celebrated inequalities of Burkholder, and also similar
inequalities involving so called tangent sequences.

A single random event in and of itself is hard to predict. But far more is known
when the effect of many random events are averaged together. This study of the
sum of many different random variables goes back to the foundations of
probability theory, including such celebrated results as the laws of large
numbers and the central limit theorem, both foundational in the study of
statistics, finding applications to any field, for example, medicine, in which
single events are hard to predict. Despite the long history of this study, there
remain many questions still unanswered. This work will be pure research,
focusing on the fundamental aspects of this averaging behavior.
