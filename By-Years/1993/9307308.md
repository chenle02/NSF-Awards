9307308 Hebert This research examines the mechanism of surface pitting in
aluminum alloys. Surface impurity concentration is varied by annealing and
surface dissolution treatments to asses the effect on pit density. Surface
impurity and defect concentrations are monitored through surface analytical
techniques, including Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy, Secondary Ion Mass
Spectroscopy, and positron annihilation measurements. Relationships between the
importance of candidate defects (e.g., vacancy/impurity clusters, dislocations,
surface roughness) as corrosion sites are sought. Early stages of pit initiation
are examined through the interaction of chloride ions with aluminum oxide films.
The positron measurements are carried out as a function of temperature in order
to provide defect migration or bonding energies so that the atomic structure of
the defects can be characterized. These measurements are performed on high
purity aluminum doped with impurity elements to determine how various impurities
behave as corrosion sites. %%% Practical information should result from this
research that will assist in controlling corrosion of aluminum and its alloys.
