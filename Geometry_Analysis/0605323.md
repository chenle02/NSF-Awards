The proposal predicts substantial developments in three themes. The final goal
of the first one is the topological classification of surface singularities; it
aims to generalise the classical work of Artin and Laufer (and the author) about
rational and elliptic singularities by identification of natural subfamilies
beyond elliptic singularities, and topological determination of their analytic
invariants. There is a special emphasise on hypersurfaces with rational homology
sphere (RHS) links, when the author (with R. Mendris) conjectured that even the
embedded topological type can be recovered from the link (hence, predicting an
even sharper property than Zariski's `multiplicity conjecture'). The second part
is motivated by a conjecture of L.I. Nicolaescu and the author which connects a
certain Seiberg-Witten invariant of a RHS--link with the geometric genus of the
singularity (as a generalisation of a conjecture of Neumann and Wahl valid for
integer homology sphere links). The proposal targets the limits of the
generalised conjecture. The new ingredients are provided by the recently
invented Heegaard Floer homology (of Ozsvath and Szabo). The third part focuses
an unexpected development of the second part applied in the classical open
problem of classification of rational (uni)cuspidal projective plane curves. The
author (in his joint article) formulates very strong criterion conjecturally
satisfied (and in many cases verified) by the local topological types of
singularities which can appear as singularities of such projective curves. It
appears that it is much stronger than the existing criterions, conjecturally it
even has a classification power. Its connection with Heegaard Floer theory is
striking.

Mathematical models which describe geometrical objects present in the real life
or in the nature are represented by functions, or by the set where they are
zero. In general, a function in a generic point behaves `nicely', but at some
special points it may have some anomalies: these phenomena are described by
singularity theory. Its mathematical methods vary rather diversely, it uses
techniques from topology, algebra, analysis, combinatorics, number theory; in
this way the results and the theory becomes very interesting (and difficult), it
alloys different aspects. The proposal targets surface singularities, and the
proposed problems lie in the core of singularity theory (which has revived
recently with a large intensity). The proposal lines up a series of new objects
and new methods which conceptually modify the general picture. The proposer's
research will be integrated in the process of undergraduate, graduate and
postdoctoral training.
