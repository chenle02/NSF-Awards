This project develops a logical framework that is well-adapted&lt;br/&gt;to the
tasks of formulating and proving meta-theoretic properties
of&lt;br/&gt;programming languages and the correctness of translators
and&lt;br/&gt;compilers; these tasks arise naturally in the context of ensuring
the&lt;br/&gt;safety and security of software. The framework being investigated
is &lt;br/&gt;specialized to reasoning about relational specifications
concerning &lt;br/&gt;formal objects that embody a binding structure. Such
specifications &lt;br/&gt;simplify the encoding of formal systems that often
treat syntactically &lt;br/&gt;complex constructs and that also manifest non-
deterministic and &lt;br/&gt;non-terminating behavior.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Underlying the framework is an expressive first-order
logic that allows&lt;br/&gt;predicates to be interpreted through fixed-point
definitions and that&lt;br/&gt;also includes inductive and co-inductive
principles for reasoning&lt;br/&gt;about such definitions. One project goal is
to enrich the form of&lt;br/&gt;definitions permitted in this logic and to add
the ability to quantify&lt;br/&gt;over properties or predicates to it. Another
goal is to develop a methodology &lt;br/&gt;for using the enhanced logic in
actual verification tasks such as proving &lt;br/&gt;the correctness of
compilers for functional languages. The project will &lt;br/&gt;make available
to the research community an enhanced software system that &lt;br/&gt;supports
formalization and verification tasks of the kind outlined. At
a&lt;br/&gt;foundational level, the research leads to a better
understanding&lt;br/&gt;of the interaction between inductive definitions and
higher-order&lt;br/&gt;quantification, an issue that is important to many
modern&lt;br/&gt;theorem-proving systems.
