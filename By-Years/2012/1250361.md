Progress in Life Sciences depends upon the development of new tools and
instruments. Our ability to understand the function of living systems on the
cellular and molecular levels is greatly enhanced by imaging techniques capable
of providing structural and chemical information in vivo. Raman spectroscopy,
which is based on the low-frequency vibrational and rotational modes of
molecules, is truly non-invasive, and it could provide significant information
on the chemical composition and physical structure of biological samples.
However, implementation of Raman spectroscopy to study biological structures in
vivo is often problematic because of the relatively large background
fluorescence and relatively low signal level. &lt;br/&gt;This research project
offers an innovative approach using optical parametric amplification to overcome
these shortcomings and improve the ability of Raman spectroscopy to analyze
complex vibrational bands, increasing the signal-to-noise-ratio by more than an
order of magnitude and allowing unprecedented acquisition speed while utilizing
inexpensive complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) line detectors. The
high acquisition rates will allow studying important dynamic biochemical
processes, such as mitochondrial activity in live cells. To test the developed
instrument, a biological system based on yeast cells, Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
commonly known as baker's yeast or brewer's yeast, will be used. In addition to
its traditional roles in baking and brewing, this organism is used for various
applications including biofuel (ethanol) production, pharmaceutical product
development (e.g. hepatitis B vaccine, recombinant insulin), environmental
protection (e.g. hydrocarbon detoxification), and others. Importantly, S.
cerevisiae is also a powerful model system in which to study the most
fundamental principles underlying the function of the eukaryotic cell.
&lt;br/&gt;The project will actively involve students at the undergraduate and
graduate levels. These students will gain interdisciplinary expertise across
fields from physics, optics, chemistry and engineering to biological sciences.
The plan for implementation of the newly developed imaging techniques involves
collaboration with industrial partners and should lead to a commercial product,
which will further contribute to a widespread use of the proposed technique.
