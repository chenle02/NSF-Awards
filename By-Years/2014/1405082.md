In this program we propose to invite a cohort of PREM undergraduate scholars who
will engage their peers, materials researchers, from graduate students to PhD-
level scientists and engineers, and other stakeholders in the materials research
community at the 2013 Fall Meeting of the Materials Research Society. The
program will provide professional and leadership development, and networking
opportunities for the students from the PREM attending the program. They will be
able to present their research in a special poster session. In addition, they
will be invited to join the MRS Mentoring Program. The program will also
highlight the importance of excellence, integrity, and service in the interest
of society as guiding principles in science and engineering careers.
