Balick, Bruce AST 94-17112 Balick and his group will investigate the mass loss
mechanisms in evolved stars with visible nebulae. His previous NSF grant support
was to study and model the planetary nebulae around low mass stars. This work iq
the next step -- to extend the observations and the models to nebulae
surrounding more massive stars -- the Luminous Blue Variables, Wolf-Rayet and
Of-type stars. ***
