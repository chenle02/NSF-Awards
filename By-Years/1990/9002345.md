This award supports the analysis and intepretation of glaciological data,
primarily from Greenland and Alaska. The project will consist of three parts: 1)
The analysis of glacier facies as a classification for all glaciers. It will
focus on the importance of meltwater percolating and freezing within snow to
both the heat and mass balance of glaciers and the extent to which facies
boundaries can be determined from satellites and aircraft. 2) A synthesis of
existing knowledge about snow accumulation on the Greenland Ice Sheet based on
data from pit studies, snow and ice cores, and meteorological stations. This
will demonstrate the extent of orographic control on the distribution of snow
accumulation. 3) An analysis of snow pit and core data from the summit of Mt.
Wrangell, Alaska, obtained between 1961 and 1989 to define the snow
stratigraphy's relation to avaialable climatological data.
