The National Academy of Sciences and the Soviet Academy of Sciences will
conduct a joint workshop on Mechanisms of Membrane Channels to be held May
11-25, 1992 at the Woods Hole Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole,
Massachusetts. The meeting will be chaired by Dr. Bertil Hille of the University
of Washington and Academician Platon Kostyuk of the Bogomoletz Institute of
Physiology in Kiev. The workshop will bring together scientists working at the
forefront of research in the area of biological membranes. Specific subjects to
be addressed are: biophysical and structural analysis of ion permeation and
channel gating, calcium channels and their regulation through G-protein- coupled
receptors; fast, ligand-gated channels of fast chemical synapses and sensory
receptors; and broader cell biological approaches to neurosecretion and
learning. This project fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
knowledge by enabling leading researchers in the United States and the Russia to
combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence in the field of basic scientific research on the basis
of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
