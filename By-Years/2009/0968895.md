Scientific Project and Intellectual Merit: The grant will support theoretical
investigations into the ultimate limits to the precision of optical and atomic
interferometry. The research will exploit recent advances in the foundations of
quantum mechanics and also in quantum information theory, to develop designs and
models of quantum interferometers which have the potential to be orders of
magnitude more sensitive than current devices. Interferometry is at the heart of
much the science of precision measurement, and the work will lead to a new
understanding of the limits imposed by quantum mechanics on the sensitivity of
such devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Precision interferometry is
the engine behind many types of sensing and measuring devices, such as atomic
clocks used in GPS, optical interferometers used in sensitive magnetic field
measurements, such as in medical magnetic imaging. Understanding the limits to
the sensitivity of such devices could lead to breakthroughs particularly in such
sensor technology and open new scientific and commercial vistas that exploit
such sensitivity. The work is also at the interface of quantum information
processing, which can lead to exponentially faster quantum computers. Two
graduate students will be trained in this field of quantum atomic and optical
interferometry, an interdisciplinary activity with synergy to a number of the
most exciting and fast moving areas of quantum sciences and technologies.
