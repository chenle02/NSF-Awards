0104611&lt;br/&gt;Shrout&lt;br/&gt;This U.S.- Chile Program award provides
support for cooperative research between Dr. Thomas R. Shrout of Penn State
University and Dr. Mauricio E. Pilleux of Universidad de Chile in Santiago,
Chile, to carry out research involving the use of copper powder to replace noble
metals in designing multi-layer electroceramic
materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The collaboration will combine the expertise in
surface physics and thin film dielectrics at the Universidad de Chile with the
expertise in electronic ceramics of researchers at the Materials Research
Laboratory at Penn State. Layers of dielectric ceramics have a wide variety of
industrial applications, including actuators, sensors, ultrasonic transducers,
voltage transformers, and dielectric capacitors. This research may lead to
important applications in the manufacture of multi-layer ceramics.&lt;br/&gt;
