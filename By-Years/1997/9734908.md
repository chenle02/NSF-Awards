9734908 Rong This research project is aimed to develop a fundamental framework
for automating dedicated fixture design based on the case-based reasoning
technique. A combination of parametric design and variation design techniques
will be explored, in order to achieve the functions required in the automated
generation of fixture structure geometry. Geometric constraint analysis will be
used for fixture design generation, and it will include both topological and
dimensional constraints in the consideration. Once the fixture is designed,
fixturing performance will be evaluated to ensure the quality of fixture
designs. The research tasks include: (1) fixture design requirement
representation, (2) fixture structure analysis and modeling, (3) fixture design
case description and similarity identification, (4) automated fixture design
case retrieval and modification, and (5) fixture design verifications, including
geometric constraint and accessibility, fixturing accuracy and stability,
fixturing stiffness, and interference-free verifications. The project is
important to automating dedicated fixture designs and to the integration of
fixture design with CAD/CAM. It may lead to a significant reduction of
manufacturing lead time and an enhancement of rapid responding capability to
product changes.
