Characterization of the behavior of saturated rock asses to imposed
perturbations in effective stress is of fundamental importance in understanding
response in rock engineering and tectonophysics. Of particular interest are the
changes in hydraulic conductivitry that may be manifest under relatively limited
shear displacement across rock joints. Where normal stresses are low, relative
to the strength of asperities comprising the joint wall, dilational opening will
greatly increase the void volume of the mass. Since the potential for hydraulic
discharge is increased proportionally to the cube of the joint aperture change,
extremely large conductivity enhancements may occur for modest shear offsets.
The fundamental parameters controlling this phenomenon are investigated by
conducting laboratory and analytical appraisals of conductivity enhancement of
sheared joints. Analytical studies will allow the expected performance of
idealized joint profiles to be quantified prior to testing. The suite of
laboratory tests, conducted in large scale (12x12x12 inch blocks) and under
shear loading, will allow direct comparison with the analytical results.
