Recent studies have demonstrated the powerful abilities of deep architectures
for statistical pattern recognition. Deep architectures transform their inputs
through multiple layers of nonlinear processing. Inspired by the connectivity of
biological neural networks, the hidden layers of deep architectures encode
hierarchical, distributed representations of complex sensory input. Theoretical
results suggest that such representations are needed to solve the most difficult
problems of artificial intelligence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous applications
of deep architectures include visual object recognition, statistical language
modeling, and nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Building on these successes,
this project develops new applications of deep architectures for problems in
speech and audio processing. Current front ends for these problems are dominated
by traditional methods in statistical modeling and signal processing. Deep
architectures have the potential to &lt;br/&gt;overcome many limitations of
current approaches. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has two research
components with interrelated and overlapping goals. The project's first
component explores unsupervised learning in convolutional neural networks. The
goal of learning in these networks is to discover new features for audio event
detection and automatic speech &lt;br/&gt;recognition. The project's second
component investigates the possibility of deep learning in kernel machines. This
possibility is suggested by a recently discovered family of kernel functions
that mimic the computation in large, &lt;br/&gt;multilayer networks.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's research components are tightly integrated
with its educational activities. The project supports two graduate students,
including one female student. An important goal is to develop publicly available
software for use by other researchers.
