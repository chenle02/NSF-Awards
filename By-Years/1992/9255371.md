SRI International, Inc. in collaboration with the Consortium for Policy
Research in Education (CPRE) and Policy Studies Associates will conduct an
evaluation of the Statewide Systemic Initiative Program (SSI). They will conduct
three central data collection activities. First, they will track the progress of
the individual SSI projects through regular interaction with the state
evaluators and an annual survey of principal investigators to obtain uniform and
comparable data about project budgets and activities. In addition, each SSI
state will be assigned to a particular individual on the staff who will be
responsible for updating information about the project. Second, case studies
will be conducted in several states. Third, a system of indicators of the state
of science, mathematics, and engineering education will be built and maintained.
Whenever possible, all 50 states will be included.
