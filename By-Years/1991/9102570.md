Belmont College is establishing a connection to NSFNET via a 56,000 bits per
second line to Vanderbilt University, which connects to the SURANET mid-level
network. The connection enhances collaborations of campus scientists with
colleagues at other institutions, and allows access to libraries and other
remote facilities throughout the internet. This award funds part of the costs
for two years.//
