A new bathymetric chart of the South Pacific will involve incorporation of new
bathymetric data as well as Seasat and Geosat gravimetric data. The production
of the chart at this point is seen to be cost-effective and to fill a gap where
no updated charts exist. In all likelihood it will serve as a basis for future
studies in the Southeast Pacific.
