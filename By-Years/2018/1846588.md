The?broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is on renewable electricity production by large
scale utilities. Today large scale solar generation (the majority of all solar
energy) is almost exclusively by large farms of photovoltaic (PV) panels made
from silicon cells, as used also for rooftop solar. The research is aimed at
enhancing scientific and technological understanding of an alternative approach
that exploits a different, much more efficient type of PV cell.? It promises
lower cost electricity in sunny climates around the world, from longer lived
plants using less land. The potential societal impact is broader adoption of
solar electricity both in the US and across the world, and thus reduced global
pollution. The commercial impact of the project is also huge. In the targeted
global market, $30 billion now is spent annually on new solar installations and
an increase to $100 billion is projected. This is an opportunity for the US to
re-establish itself as a world leader in solar manufacturing, of both the
different PV cells that underlie our approach, and the optical and mechanical
systems that are the target of this research and are key to cost reduction.?

The proposed project will explore a new approach to solar electricity
generation, using advanced photovoltaic (PV) cells that convert sunlight into
electricity with twice the efficiency of silicon PV panels. The innovation is in
the system used to focus sunlight on the cells as needed?for highest efficiency
at lowest cost. The advanced PV cells themselves have already been developed for
spacecraft, but previous efforts to commercialize them for ground use have
failed, because the systems needed to provide concentrated sunlight were too
expensive. The research will be directed to developing, building and testing the
two innovative elements critical to a complete, low cost system: 1) Small glass
lens arrays used at the focus of large dish reflectors to apportion sunlight
equally onto individual small cells. Existing commercial glass molding methods
do not yield arrays of the size and precision needed; a new molding method
tailored specifically for the task will be developed. 2) A novel mechanical
structure will be developed to orient the mirrors toward the sun throughout the
day with minimal use of steel, by employing an efficient spaceframe structure
turning on a ground track, and a sensor-feedback system to eliminate
conventional, heavy, rigid bearings.
