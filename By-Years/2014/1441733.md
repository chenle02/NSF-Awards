The Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) based security primitives
typically suffer from area/power overhead, sensitivity to environmental
fluctuations and limited randomness and entropy offered by Silicon substrate.
Spintronic circuits can complement the existing CMOS based security and trust
infrastructures. This project explores ways to uncover the security specific
properties of the magnetic nanowire and capture them in detailed circuit model.

This project investigates noise sources and randomness present in the magnetic
nanowire, and engineers new techniques to harvest the entropy. The investigators
combine the circuits and models of non-linear magnetic dynamics to realize
hardware security primitives and engines and experimentally validating the
models and design ideas under harsh conditions and attack scenarios. The
techniques developed in this project will improve the security and energy-
efficiency of future circuits and systems.
