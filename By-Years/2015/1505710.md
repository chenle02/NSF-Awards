The Bárðarbunga volcanic system is typical of the fundamental spreading units in
the active rift zones of Iceland. These consist of central volcanoes and fissure
swarms that are typically 10-25 km wide and tens of kilometers in length. The
fissure swarms are the surface expression of dike intrusions fed by the central
volcanoes. On September 3, 2014 an eruptive fissure formed as seismic activity
and geodetic data showed dramatic subsidence of the Bárðarbunga caldera. More
fissure eruptions developed and produced fire fountains up to 50 meters in
height and lava flows covering nearly 20 square kilometers. Much of the central
and north- central interior highlands of Iceland were evacuated and closed to
the public, due to concerns that a subglacial eruption at the central volcano
could generate a jökulhlaup, jeopardizing transportation both in and out of the
area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In collaboration with the University of Iceland?s
Earth Science Institute, the team plans to use a small drone equipped with GPS
navigation and a Go-Pro (still+video) to produce digital image mosaics that
cover many square kilometers in a single 15 minute survey of the active and
recently active (days old) lava fields and fissure eruptions with images of fire
fountaining, spatter deposits, a?a and pahoehoe flow units. Direct observations
and video will document local flow rates, slopes, etc. Samples will be collected
to assess the vesicularity and crystallinity of the samples. One goal will be to
use these data to relate these parameters to the flow morphology, which would
provide a logical ?scaling-up? of experiments they are doing at Syracuse
University in the SU Lava Project.
