This proposal addresses the national problem of under-representation of American
Indians, Black Americans, Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans in science and
engineering graduate programs. The project consists of a series of one-day
conferences on graduate study in science and engineering for minority students,
their counselors and graduate school recruiters. The conferences were held at
nine sites: Boston, New York, Washington (DC), Seattle, Atlanta, Houston, Los
Angeles, San Francisco, and Chicago. Each conference was held on the campus of a
GEM-member with the university serving as a co-sponsor. The goals of the
conferences were: 1) to present accurate information on opportunities for
minority syudents in graduate study in science and engineering; 2) to encourage
undecided minority students to seriously consider graduate study; 3) to offer
opportunities for dialogue between the students and minority men and women
currently engaged in graduate study; and 4) to introduce students to the wide
range of national financial support programs available for graduate study.
Approximately 900 students and 100 counselors, recruiters, university faculty
and representatives from related organizations (ETS, etc.) attended the
conferences. A report of conference activities will be distributed to a variety
of colleges and universities for use in future counseling and recruitment
activities.
