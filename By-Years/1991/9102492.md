This proposal is aimed at the synthesis of new quaternary oxides in molten
hydroxide fluxes, and a study of the reaction conditions that favor certain
structural features in the solids as they crystallize. The development of
practical synthetic routes that result in materials which exhibit specific
properties and which are therefore more amenable to processing is the ultimate
goal of the project. Initial studies will focus on the preparation of new, high-
temperature superconducting quaternary metal cuprates, bismuthates, and niobates
using molten alkali metal and/or alkaline earth metal hydroxides as solvents.
