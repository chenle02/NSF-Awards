The research team has developed a method to produce anti-counterfeit tags based
on periodic arrays of nanopillars that can be realized on any surfaces including
textiles. Both overt and covert images can be created using patterns from
hydrophilic and hydrophobic nanopillars domains taking advantage of the inkjet
layer-by-layer assembly. The hidden images are then visualized for authenticity
verification by fogging them with human breath. By utilizing scalable nanopillar
arrays from polyurethane, this technology may also be less costly than other
options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This technology presents a reliable platform to
make periodic, densely packed hole and pillary arrays with tunable optical and
surface properties, which has many technological applications. Nanopillar
technology offers a new tool to combat such large-scale economic problems such
as counterfeit goods that affect the US economy. Preparation of wear-resistant
nanopillar features on a wide range of common materials including fabric, glass,
plastic, etc enables their wide-scale utilization capable of advancing other
technologies besides counterfeit tags that include energy applications (e.g.
self-cleaning durable coatings for solar cells) and biomedical technologies
(e.g. anti-biofouling coatings).
