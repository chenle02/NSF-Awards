ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0220303&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project,
researchers at the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences at the
University of Miami will collaborate with colleagues at the Nordic Volcanic
Institute in Iceland to investigate the crustal residence time of fluids
circulating through hydrothermal systems of Iceland, utilizing isotopic tools
developed by the PI for submarine hydrothermal systems in mid-ocean ridges. This
will allow the refinement of these techniques for further seafloor studies, as
well as afford the researchers an opportunity to develop new isotopic techniques
for ultimate use in submarine systems. Additionally an in-situ gamma detector
will be deployed within well waters to make remote, detailed, time-series
measurements of radon gas. Previous work by Icelandic investigators has shown
that radon measurements have great potential as an earthquake prediction tool.
