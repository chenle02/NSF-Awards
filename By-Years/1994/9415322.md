Goulden 9415322 This is a planning grant for Dr. Clyde Goulden to lead a group
of scientists to visit a potential research sites in Mongolia and the Buryat
Oblast of Russia to develop a long-term ecological study. The preliminary
investigation includes the sites of Hovsgol Nuur in Mongolia, a large lake
southwest of Lake Baikal, and lakes and rivers in the Oka and Tunka Valleys in
Buryat. The purpose of this visit is to collect data on invertebrates (e.g.,
zooplankton and amphipods) and fishes throughout the Selenga river basin and
Hovsgol Nuur to examine the ecological relationship between Hovsgol Nuur and
Baikal Lake. The data available from these areas are very limited. This trip can
provide important preliminary information for research in this area, which has
been accessible for outsiders to only a limited degree since Hovsgol Nuur is
situated in a remote part of Mongolia and there is no road to reach the lake,
and since only Mongolians and Russians were allowed to enter this area prior to
1990. Dr. Goulden is a distinguished scientist with an excellent record in
carrying out difficult field projects. This visit can provide important baseline
information for carrying out field research in part of Asia.
