This research is to apply several recently developed methods utilizing single-
link cluster analysis to evaluate temporal and spatial changes in mainshock and
aftershock activity in eight different regional catalogs of earthquake
hypocenters. The catalogs are from networks in the Central Aleutians (Adak),
Eastern Alaska, California, Nicaragua, Oregon, the southern Soviet Union, Peru,
and Vanuatu. The goal is to see how statistical properties of earthquake
clusters are influenced by the obvious stress and rheologic differences between
convergent margins, strike-slip margins, and volcanic regions. This research is
a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
