Specialized visual symbols, such as dress, have been used by many peoples to
denote rank, status, affiliation, or class in plural societies. While
anthropologists have recognized that this is a common way to publicly express
social identity, little attention has been paid to why groups develop
distinctive styles and how other groups react socially and politically to these
developments. This project analyzes recent developments in "National Band"
paramilitary groups among the Herero pastoralists of southern Africa. These
associations have begun to use Victorian and Westernized military forms of dress
as vehicles for the public expression of social identity in resistance rituals.
The material culture used in the rituals will be examined in relation to the
regional sociopolitical context and transformations in Herero society. This
study will enable us to better understand the nonviolent forms of political
resistance in Botswana and Namibia used by tribal groups, while demonstrating
the dynamics that underlie the relationship between material culture and social
identity.
