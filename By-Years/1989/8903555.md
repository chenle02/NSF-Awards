This research is on converting a Boolean function circuit description into a
circuit that implements the functions, meeting time and cost constraints. The
approach is to use transformations of if-then-else DAG's in multi-level
minimization. These are particularly attractive for representing Boolean
functions because they can compactly express useful functions, such as
arithmetic and parity functions, that require exponentially larger
representations in the sum-of-products format. Preliminary studies indicate that
even fairly crude transformations provide effective minimization. Research is on
algorithms for: factoring, to reduce the complexity of expressions; sharing
common sub- expressions to eliminate redundant circuitry; and using don't care
information to handle partially specified functions. The proposed research is in
an important area of automated design of IC chips, logic synthesis. The
Principal Investigator is recognized as an expert researcher in this area, has a
history of novel ideas, and the potential to continue producing good research.
This research is important to our understanding of IC design theory and methods.
