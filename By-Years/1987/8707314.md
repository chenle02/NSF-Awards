Interest in the physical processes controlling systematic fracture (joint)
formation in sedimentary rocks has heightened in recent years, motivated by the
importance of fractured rock masses to the petroleum industry, nuclear waste
disposal efforts, and earthquake forecasting. This research focuses on: 1)
characterization of joint geometries in sedimentary rocks by field mapping, 2)
determination of the loading histories responsible for the geometries of
multiple joint sets, and 3) understanding the influence of mechanical
interaction on propagation paths, joint lengths, and joint intersections. The
field work involves detailed mapping at scales of 1:50 to 1:100 of joint traces
on bedding surfaces of well-exposed sedimentary units near Mexican Hat, Utah.
The effects of stress state and crack interaction on joint development will be
analyzed using solutions to boundary value problems of elasticity theory and the
principles of fracture mechanics. Two dimensional laboratory model experiments
of crack growth in PMMA plates using a computer-controlled, biaxial testing
machine will investigate the influence of stress state on crack path and
intersection. Experiments on PMMA plates with an easily fracturable brittle
elastic coating will investigate the sequential development of multiple fracture
sets as a function of loading history. The results of this research will provide
guidelines for interpreting the loading history implied by certain joint
patterns in sedimentary rock. It will also address important questions about
hydraulic connectivity of joint sets and the mechanical behavior of a jointed
rock mass.
