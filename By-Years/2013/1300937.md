The Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms - B Program of the Division of
Chemistry supports Professor Dasan M. Thamattoor of Colby College, in an
undergraduate-driven research program, to investigate alkylidenecarbenes
generated from new photochemical sources based on cyclopropanated phenanthrene
and indan systems. The program includes the study of acyclic alkylidenecarbenes
with alkyl and aryl substituents, the investigation of cycloalkylidenecarbenes,
with a particular emphasis on their ability to generate small- and medium-ring
cycloalkynes, the study of dihalovinylidenes, and the domino generation of two
alkylidenecarbenes from a single precursor and the formation of C2.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research program provides a research experience for
undergraduate students, which trains them in the synthesis of organic molecules
and in the physical methods used to characterize these molecules and determine
their structures. The work will continue an outreach program that provides
research opportunities to high school students over the summer months. Also, the
implementation of new partnerships with math and science teachers at local
elementary and middle schools, to deliver quality instruction in STEM subjects,
will be sought and existing ones strengthened.
