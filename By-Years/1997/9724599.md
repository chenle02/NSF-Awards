Abstract 9724599 Besson This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) project will
develop a means of detecting ultra-high energy elementary particle showers which
develop within the ice sheet at South Pole, Antarctica for the purpose of doing
neutrino astronomy. Neutrinos are a decay product of most high energy nuclear
interactions; however, they interact only weakly with matter and so can be
expected to escape from the region of interaction even if it is surrounded by
dust, gas or other obscuring material. If a neutrino telescope can be made to
work it will provide a look inside densely obscured regions, such as the center
of galaxies and may also point to the (unknown) sources of very high energy
cosmic rays and possibly even gamma ray bursts. A major portion of the funding
for this project is being provided by the University of Kansas as matching
funds. ***
