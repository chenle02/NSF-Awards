This project will analyze samples for tritium and helium-3 taken on two cruises
in the South Atlantic Ocean. These data along with concurrently collected data
by other investigators will lead to a better description of the circulation in
the South Atlantic Ocean and characterization of the formation of near-surface
water masses.
