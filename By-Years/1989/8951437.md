A total station surveying unit (a theodolite and computerized electronic
distance measuring unit) and associated workstation will be purchased for
computer assisted data collection and geologic mapping. The total station
instrumentation is to be used in field geology to replace the plane table and
alidade for topographic and geologic mapping; the level and transit for stream
profiling; and string, graph paper and ruler for fault trenching investigations.
Upon returning to the university, the students will use a Macintosh computer set
up as a geologic workstation to reduce surveying data and to create field
reports. The equipment will enhance the ability of students to interpret geology
and introduce them to modern field methods. The university will contribute 50%
matching funds.
