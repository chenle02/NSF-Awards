To achieve high power plant efficiencies, the turbines in the plant must operate
at the highest possible temperature. Present-day materials place a limit on
these temperatures, so that cooling of the turbine blades is necessary to
maintain their integrity in the face of the high temperature gases that pass
through the turbine. One approach is to pass a coolant through flow passages
situated within the blades. To further enhance the heat transfer within the
passages, fins or ribs are used. The available information about the heat
transfer characteristics of such finned or ribbed passages is insufficient for
design. The experiments to be performed under the present proposal will remedy
this deficiency. The heat transfer measurements will be supplemented by mass
transfer measurements carried out by means of the naphthalene sublimation
technique. The measured mass transfer coefficients will be converted to heat
transfer coefficients via the analogy between the two processes. The obtained
data will not only be useful for design but will also serve to verify numerical
simulations.
