A spaced Antenna Drift radar system will be used for making continuous
measurements of middle-atmosphere wind velocities and other parameters that can
be applied to deduce meaningful physical quantities. During a three years
period, the SAD output will be analyzed and confronted with comparable
information obtained from the data of the Arecibo Observatory incoherent scatter
radar, and with simultaneous equivalent observations taken in other geographical
locations. The involvement of students and faculty in atmosphere research will
be of primary importance in this project. A course will take place on the fields
of the research to entail a total of 100 students, plus lectures, seminars, and
field-trips to the SAD facilities and to the observatory.***//
