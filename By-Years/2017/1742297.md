Project Growing Pathways to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics
(Project GPS) will provide scholarships for 25 academically talented, low-income
students pursuing Associate of Science degrees in STEM fields. The project will
focus on rural students in the State of Nebraska, and will work with local high
schools that offer both dual credit and career pathways, to assist in early
identification and recruitment of academically talented scholars. Students will
benefit from mentorship through networking, team-building, and practical career
experience, that includes unique, collaborative college-industry partnerships.
Support services will address financial and academic support barriers specific
to rural student success. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project GPS will investigate an
interventionist model of the relationships between mentors, cohorts, students,
and industry. This potentially transformative model is possible through college-
industry-community partnerships. These partnerships will bridge established gaps
that inhibit student success, and help students develop critical thinking skills
needed for life beyond the community college. An Immersive Service Learning
Experience (ISLE) will provide an intensive orientation experience and include a
summer component with student participation in independent/collaborative
research, a cooperative education program, or industry internship/job shadow
experiences influenced by cohort composition and local business/industry input.
All ISLE projects will incorporate global sustainability concepts on a local
scale, with intended measurable benefits in and beyond the local community. The
project will generate new knowledge regarding the engagement and support of
rural, community college students, and effective practices for supporting their
degree completion and transfer to baccalaureate degree programs or entry into
the STEM workforce.
