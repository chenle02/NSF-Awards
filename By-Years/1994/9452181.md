9452181 Rudnick-Kaun This project will provide an integrated systems approach to
the laboratory environment of the Pulp and Paper Chemical Technology associate
degree program with additional benefits to students in the Natural Resources
Technology program. This project responds to the local paper industry needs for
trained graduates to work in integrated and automated manufacturing and research
operations performing product analysis and process control using computerized
data systems. The requested equipment is geared toward the rising industry
standards for using increasing amounts of recycled fiber in the paper making
process. Current manual equipment in the laboratories limits the curriculum to
experimenting with fragments of the systems process. This project elevates the
competency level of the curriculum by creating the potential for a new range of
Laboratory experimentation. This curriculum will be shared with other college
and university pulp and paper science programs challenged with educating
students for employment in this dynamic industry.
