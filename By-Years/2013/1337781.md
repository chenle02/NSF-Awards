An award is made to Kennesaw State University for the purchase a
spectropolarimeter and associated equipment for the use in multidisciplinary
research and research training. Circular dichroism (CD) is an essential tool for
the analysis of molecular conformations and is often used in the estimation of
secondary structure in proteins. CD is a powerful probe of changes in protein
conformations. It is possible, for example, to observe small changes in helical
content using difference methods, and the effects of mutations and protein-
protein interactions can be studied. The spectropolarimeter will be used
initially by a core group of five laboratories at KSU and their collaborators.
Dr. Ellen Moomaw's work focuses on structure/function relationships in bicupin
oxalate oxidase. Dr. Michael Van Dyke investigates ligand-nucleic acid
interactions. Dr. Carol Chrestensen studies the activity and regulation of
mitogen activated protein kinase activated protein (MAPKAP) kinase 2 (MK2)
involved in response to oxidative stress. Dr. Jonathan McMurry studies the type
III secretion (T3S) mechanism involved in the assembly of the bacterial
flagellum. Dr. John Salerno investigates catalysis and control in nitric oxide
synthases (NOSs).

The spectropolarimeter significantly enhances the research infrastructure at
KSU. The equipment will be used primarily in research, including projects with
undergraduate researchers. This equipment is also important to the nascent
masters programs in Integrative Biology and Biochemistry at KSU. It is expected
that these programs will complement and strengthen the demonstrated track record
of undergraduate research participation and training at KSU. Involvement of the
facility with course curricula is also planned. The initial user group has
significant combined experience in mentoring undergraduate researchers. Each
faculty member designs individual student-centered research projects that are
carved out of the whole with well-defined goals and objectives giving each
undergraduate researcher a good chance of completion in an appropriate time
frame. This instrumentation will enhance the depth and breadth of opportunities
that KSU faculty can offer their undergraduate researchers. The availability of
advanced instrumentation is an important factor leading to the recruitment of
KSU's best students into STEM careers. The instrument will enhance faculty and
student opportunities to collaborate internationally and improve the visibility
of the institution in the international marketplace. All members of the initial
user group have strong track records of providing research opportunities to
women and underrepresented minorities.
