9400229 Selman This work will continue the research effort on the computational
complexity of feasible computations. The objective is to distinguish properties
of complexity classes that contain feasible computations from those that do not,
to reveal the rich structure that individual complexity classes, such as NP,
appear to have, and to increase understanding of the structural relations
between low-level complexity classes. The emphasis will be to continue research
on the complexity of multivalued computations and on relations between
nonuniform and uniform complexity. The approach is the standard paradigm of
structural complexity, that is, to elicit structural properties of complexity
classes rather than analyze individual concrete problems. ***
