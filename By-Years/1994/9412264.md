9415564 McKee A weeklong international conference entitled "The Physics of the
Interstellar Medium and the Intergalactic Medium" is planned for June 20-24,
1994 to take place at the Elba International Physics Center, Marciana, Marina,
on the island of Elba, Italy. The meeting is intended to be a once-per-decade
event which will review the theory and observations of the fundamental physical
processes occurring in the interstellar and intergalactic mediums. This
gathering will be unique in providing an opportunity for mutually beneficial
interaction between the older and more developed disciplines associated with the
study of interstellar matter in our own galaxy and the new and emerging
disciplines associated with the study of intergalactic matter and cosmology.
