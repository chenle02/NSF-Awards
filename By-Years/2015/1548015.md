This is a project to study long term planning problems for the electric grid
assuming a transition from today's thermal-dominated electric energy systems to
a renewable energy-dominated system. Two topics that will be the focus of the
work are market design and the associated valuation of energy resources, and
capacity expansion. Major issues in market design for such systems include
determining an appropriate market model for grids with high penetration of
renewable sources; determining how such markets should clear to protect the
interests of all parties while maximizing a measure of social welfare; and
finding appropriate valuation models of various energy resources so as to
recover costs that are not covered by the regular market clearing price. If
successful, the project will have significant impact on planning for a future
grid with increasing levels of renewable generation. By engaging with electric
power industry members through an industry funded research consortium at the PI
institution, the researchers will ensure that their results are available to
industry members while also receiving feedback from industry on the project as
it develops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, the aim of this project is
to create mathematical models to analyze the transition from today's electric
power systems to a future renewable-dominated design. The research issues noted
above have not been addressed in the technical literature, pose significant
intellectual challenges, and are crucial to guarantee a secure electricity
supply in the future. The project will develop an integrated suite of short-run
operational and long-run dynamic capacity expansion models. Decomposition
techniques will be used to make the resulting stochastic programming,
complementarity, and adaptive robust optimization models tractable. In addition
to the direct benefits to the electricity sector, this research will
fundamentally advance the fields of computational optimization, energy policy,
and energy economics.
