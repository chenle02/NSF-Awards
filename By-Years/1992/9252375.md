The new Social and Behavioral Sciences Computer Laboratory at the New Community
College of Baltimore will introduce students to computer-based social science
research. Although science is central to the social sciences, introductory
courses typically offer static recitations of conventional social science
knowledge, whereas what students need to learn are the methods of scientific
inquiry. The curricular plan for the lab is based on this and three other
realities of higher education for the 21st century: 1) adult students learn
differently from their younger counterparts; 2) higher education must develop
self-directed learners; and 3) Students must become computer literate. Higher
education is attracting older students with life experience who achieve better
when they complete real tasks, as opposed to simulation and exercises. This kind
of self-directed scientific inquiry is the centerpiece of the Social Science
department's curricular renaissance, which includes the conversion of
introductory social science classes from lecture courses to science lab courses.
