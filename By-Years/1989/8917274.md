There is now compelling evidence that the modification of proteins with ADP-
ribose is a general feature of endogenous eucaryotice metabolism. The study of
this metabolism has been limited due to a lack of analytical methods of
sufficient sensitivity and selectivity. The overall objective of this proposal
is to achieve an understanding of the chemistry of ADP:protein linkages. The
approach is to use ADP-ribosyl amino acids as model systems. These will be
synthesized, isolated and characterized and used as references standards for the
development of methods which will allow the direct identification of ADP-ribosyl
amino acid residues in endogenous proteins. The research will lay the groundwork
for understanding endogenous eucaryotic ADP-ribose metabolism and the mode of
action of bacterial toxins.
