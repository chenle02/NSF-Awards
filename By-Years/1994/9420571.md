9420571 Babu ABSTRACT The goal of this proposal is to assist in the
presentation, evaluation and dissemination of these underlying principles to
undergraduate engineering students utilizing menu-driven, easily accessible,
self-contained, interactive learning modules delivered in the CD-ROM format. Our
task will be to cover a broad range of film structures, methods of deposition,
and characterization techniques emphasizing our expertise and involving the
student in as much experimental contact as possible. Our collective expertise
also includes graphic simulation of film growth and thin film device performance
as well as multimedia production and courseware development. The CD-ROM software
will include a large number of progressively complex example case studies.
Simulation is a powerful and visually appealing educational tool that can easily
lend itself, using the still evolving multi-media format, to intensive
exploration of many what-if scenarios concerning the theory, design and
operation of these reactors as well as film and device configurations. Combining
the study of the associated experimental techniques with that of computer
simulations using transparent interfacing can sustain the interest of the user
even over difficult-to-learn segments of the proposed modules. ***
