9420818 Siniff The Weddell seal is an important upper trophic level species that
has been the focus of long-term studies because of its proximity to Antarctic
support facilities. The most extensive investigations have involved the Weddell
seal population at McMurdo Station where research and monitoring efforts began
in the early 1960s and have continued since that date. The objectives of this
project are 1) to continue the long-term tagging studies by completing the field
work necessary to tag all pups born into the McMurdo sound population and to
replace tags on previously tagged individuals so they will not be lost from the
tagged population and 2) to update estimates of population parameters annually
and to continue the analyses and test of hypotheses associated with this data
base. In support of these analyses we will carry out mark-recapture surveys that
are necessary to obtain all the estimates required for current capture-recapture
models.
