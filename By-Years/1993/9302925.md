This award will support collaborative research by Professor Thompson and
scientists at the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics at Novosibirsk, USSR.
Professor Thompson will study the decays of the phi-meson into pairs of
K-mesons. These decays are sensitive to the origins of CP-violation in quark
decay.
