Manipulating large scale data sources leads to question what are efficient
algorithms. Even linear time algorithms may be much too slow on truly massive
data. Similarly, even using linear space&lt;br/&gt;to store the data may be
unreasonable when input data that is generated is far too voluminous.
Applications abound where these constraints are natural. For example, data
stores that archive web pages on the Internet, all telephone call records or
molecular sequences are massive, and even linear time algorithms to process them
prove slow. Data sources such as network traffic measurements are voluminous and
rarely get archived; instead, it is desirable to process them as they are
generated to obtain suitable sublinear space representations. Two approaches to
building sublinear algorithms are sampling and streaming. In sampling,
algorithms examine a (small) subset of input and solve problems of interest in
sublinear time, typically to some provable approximation. While sampling has
been studied in Probability and Statistics for decades, truly sublinear
algorithms for sophisticated tasks such as clustering and building fourier
representations have only recently been obtained. The algorithms should have
solid theoretical foundations, and should be amenable to analysis using rigorous
theoretical tools. However, some of the algorithms will be also implemented and
subjected to experimental evaluation. It is expected that the algorithms
developed in the context of this project&lt;br/&gt;will have significant
practical impact.&lt;br/&gt;
