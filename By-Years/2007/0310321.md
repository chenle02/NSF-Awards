University will implement comprehensive approaches to strengthen the
institution's undergraduate science, technology, engineering and mathematics
(STEM) education and research infrastructure. With NSF support, the University
will to (1) increase the number of underserved students who enter college,
receive undergraduate and advanced degrees in STEM disciplines, and choose STEM
careers through a coordinated, linked network of existing and new programs and
systems, and (2) expand the opportunities and number of STEM faculty who are
involved in mentoring and integrating research and education activities. The
project's objectives by 2008 are to: (1) increase the number of Langston's STEM
graduates 15% annually; (2) increase Langston's STEM graduates who receive
postgraduate degrees 40% annually, and 3) significantly expand opportunities and
the level of participation of STEM faculty involved in mentoring and in the
integration of research and education activities.&lt;br/&gt;
