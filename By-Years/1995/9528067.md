EEC-9528067 Garrison This award provides funding for a "TIE" project involving
two NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers (I/UCRCs) - the Center
for Separations Using Thin Films at the University of Colorado, Boulder and the
Measurement and Control Engineering Center at the University of Tennessee.
Zeolite membranes will be prepared and used to improve the ability to analyze
multicomponent process streams by process mass spectrometry. Membranes will be
used to induce component separation based on selective size, shape, or sorptive
differences and/or distinctive time dependence based on relative permeation
rates as an aid to mass spectral deconvolution. Membrane properties for optimum
mass spectrometric response will be assessed. Membranes tailored to this
response for a given application will be prepared at the Boulder Center and
tested in Knoxville. Applications guidance for evolution of the combined
technologies will be drawn from problems posed by industrial members of the
Centers. Testing of derived methodologies in member installations will be
included as a regular part of effectiveness testing.
