The major goal of this project is to study the molecular mechanisms of learning
and memory. The approach consists of isolating single-gene mutations that affect
learning and memory in Drosophila, followed by cloning of the genes to
understand their functions and regulations. In parallel, biochemical studies of
normal and mutant flies can help to determine the physiological pathways
involved with learning in flies. The work performed by Dr. Timothy Tully is
exploratory in nature since it will make use of Polymerase Chain Reaction
technology to isolate and identify new amnesiac alleles with the use of a
commonly used mutagen. Characterization of the gene products of these alleles
will potentially provide new insight specific to memory, and studies of its
interaction with other gene products may outline the relationship between
learning and memory.
