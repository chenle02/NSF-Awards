An award is made to Idaho State University to acquire a Fluorescence-Activated
Cell Sorter (FACS) flow cytometer. This instrument will greatly enhance the
research and educational opportunities across multiple departments and colleges
at Idaho State University and at near-by undergraduate institution BYU-I. The
instrument will be housed in a multi-user core facility and accessed by
researchers and teachers in the Biological Sciences, Pharmaceutical Sciences,
and Anthropology. Hands-on experimental design modules will be developed and
utilized in various undergraduate and graduate courses, and within secondary
education teacher-training courses. By incorporating this equipment into
classes, students at all levels of education will gain hands-on experience in
authentic research activities. This equipment will also be accessible to
community partners and incorporated into university-wide outreach and STEM
training activities to promote recruitment, retention, and professional
development of a diverse workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This instrument will be
utilized by a variety of researchers, from undergraduate students to professors.
The ease of instrument set-up and diversity of applications across multiple
disciplines will enhance current research capabilities and open opportunities
for new and innovative projects. Researchers will use this machine to answer
questions pertaining to 1) immune cell responses to environmental contaminants
and physiologic stimuli, 2) cellular protein expression during organismal and
cellular development, 3) plant genome/ploidy quantification, 4) hormone receptor
expression in animal tissues, 5) gene expression in prokaryotes, 6) cell
division and death, and 7) microparticle identification in archeologic samples
(i.e., teeth, pottery). Many of these areas rely on the sorting functions of
this machine to isolate live cells or small particles for further
experimentation. Data generated using this instrument will be disseminated to
the public via presentations and peer-reviewed papers, and data will impact a
wide array of fields while providing cutting-edge training for students in
environmental sciences, developmental biology, evolutionary biology, eukaryotic
and prokaryotic cell biology, and anthropology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
