Thymidine is usually incorporated directly into DNA by bacterioplankton, but
there are a number of environments where it is extensively metabolized. South
San Francisco Bay, California (SSFB) is one of these. Substantial amounts of 3H
from methyl- ı3H!-thymidine are found in RNA, protein, and a fraction extracted
by 80% ethanol. A much larger proportion of the label from 6-ı3H!-thymidine is
found in DNA, and none of it appears in the 80% enthanol. A much larger
proportion of the label from 6- ı3H!-thymidine is found in DNA, and none of it
appears in the 80% ethanol extractable fraction. As a result, bacterial
productivity estimates differ by factors of up to 10 for the same sample.
Additional data suggest that isotope dilution analysis of precursor pool
specific activity doesn't work in SSFB either. These results are in sharp
contrast with Monterey Bay experiments where thymidine incorporation is
"normal": the majority goes into DNA, there is no difference between methyl- and
6-labeled thymidine, and isotope dilution seems to work. The proposed study will
investigate this phenomenon in detail. The overall goal is to determine the
physiological or environmental basis for the difference between SSFB and
"normal" coastal populations and to use this information to adapt the thymidine
method to SSFB and other environments where bacterioplankton have similar
physiologies (meso- and bathypelagic waters, other coastal waters, hypolimnia of
some lakes). Specific objectives are to test the hypotheses that 1) the methyl
group is rapidly exchanged with an unlabeled pool in the cells, 2) ring carbon
or 6-tritiated thymidine will provide better estimates of DNA synthesis rates in
these environments, and 3) the physiological basis for the difference is due to
larger DNA and TdR fluxes in SSFB and greater dependence of SSFB
bacterioplankton on thymidine as a carbon, nitrogen and energy source relative
to "normal" coastal populations.
