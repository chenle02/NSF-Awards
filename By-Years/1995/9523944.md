9523944 Ellis This proposal requests support of a third and final year of a
postdoctoral research fellowship in biosciences related to the environment. The
first two years were funded under DEB 9303261. The project, entitled "Nitrogen
Cycling and Ecological Sustainability in Agroecosystems" relates nutrient
cycling to long term productivity of agroecosystems by comparing nutrient cycles
found in contemporary and traditional villages of the region. The project aims
to investigate the ecological basis for long-sustained productivity of
agriculture in the lake Tai region of China, with a goal of developing
quantitative tools for appraising ecological sustainability in agroecosystems.
Work during the two years of the original award has yielded interesting results,
indicating that natural nitrogen inputs were important to sustaining
productivity in the traditional system, but contemporary inputs of chemical
nitrogen appear far higher than needed, and may cause pollution. An additional
year of support will allow the PI to complete the dataset for two annual cycles
of agroecosystem management and to process the dataset and derive nitrogen
cycling indices.
