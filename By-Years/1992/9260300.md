The concept of momentum transfer is used for removal of submicron particulates
by supplying droplets of solvent at high velocity. In particular, liquid carbon
dioxide is substituted for formerly used solvents (CFCs) to achieve enhanced
ultracleaning lower costs than in other substitute technologies, while removing
CFCs from use, as required by the terms of the Montreal Protocol. Experimental
work varying conditions of operation, using specular surfaces as test objects
and optical methods of documenting results will be used to optimize the
procedure and compare results with alternative technologies. Existing,
commercial embodiments of the core technology will be retrofitted for early use
of findings in industry.
