coding, communication systems, multi-user information theory, cryptography and
security, neural networks, data compression, optical communications, data
networks, pattern recognition, detection and estimation, Shannon theory,
distributed information processing, signal processing, error-control coding.
source coding, and stochastic processes. This symposium is a premiere meeting in
the field of Information theory. Travel through this grant will provide travel
