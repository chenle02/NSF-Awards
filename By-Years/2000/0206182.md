AST-0206182&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Rasio&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
first planetary systems outside our own Solar System were detected about six
years&lt;br/&gt;ago. By now close to 100 extrasolar planets have been detected
around nearby, solar-like&lt;br/&gt;stars. These discoveries of extrasolar
planets will no doubt lead to significant&lt;br/&gt;improvements in our
understanding of many processes related to planet formation, structure and
evolution, as well as deeper questions such as the existence of extraterrestrial
life in the Universe. The search for, and characterization of, extrasolar
planets has nowbecome a top scientific priority both in Europe and in the United
States. This project will address a number of theoretical questions concerning
the formation and evolution of planetary systems around other stars, including
those in drastically different environments than the Sun, such as planets in
dense star clusters or in orbits around collapsed objects like neutron stars. In
particular, the dynamical stability and final fate of extrasolar planetary
systems will be studied using supercomputing simulations that combine the
techniques of orbital dynamics and numerical hydrodynamics. The consequences of
dynamical interactions between planetary systems and their central stars (such
as tidal interactions with 'hot Jupiters', or metallicity enhancements through
'planet consumption') will also be studied using a combination of stellar
evolution and hydrodynamics calculations. All these questions are crucial to our
theoretical interpretation of the new observational data on extrasolar
planets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
