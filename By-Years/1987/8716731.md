This project will investigate advanced ceramic processing methods through use of
colloidal techniques to produce ceramic superconductors. The processing methods
used in this project will allow the microstructures to be precisely controlled;
thereby, revealing the relationship between microstructure, properties, and
processing for the new class of materials. The extreme anisotropy of the cuprate
superconductors necessitates the development of texture microstructures in
polycrystalline aggregates. Therefore, the project will investigate cryogenic
colloidal processing techniques to obtain preferential crystallographic
orientation of grains as the ceramic greenbody is formed. This might be
accomplished in the project by dispersing particles of the superconductor in
liquid nitrogen and filtercasting in the presence of a magnetic field. The
investigators will evaluate electrical characteristics of controlled
microstructure samples with respect to transition temperature, and critical
current densities while under strain. The investigators will construct equipment
to measure the critical current density as a function of strain in a magnetic
field.
