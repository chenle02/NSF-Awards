The District 11 Weather Study Program (DEWS) is an innovative district-wide,
weather-education project, involving all fifth-, and eighth- grade students in
District 11 which is located in the northeast section of the Bronx. DEWS
capitalizes on the most-recent advances in satellite and Internet
telecommunications technologies. The predominant principle governing the project
is that pupil participation in activities that are directed toward the
utilization of near-real time weather information can help to motivate young
students to develop an interest in science. Current satellite-cloud imagery,
radar graphics, and National Weather Service (NWS) numeric and text information
are used extensively in lessons at the Northeast Bronx Weather Station (NBWS),
the center for weather-education activities in District 11. Current state and
local forecasts, storm and flood advisories, warnings, and summaries,
climatological reports, and hourly surface-weather observations are only a few
examples of the national and international NWS information products available to
pupils for study. Each student activity at the NBWS is designed to take full
advantage of the data streams available at the facility. All of this information
is accessible for display on four personal desktop computers. The monitors
presently on site, however, do not allow for effective full-class viewing of
weather graphics and imagery. The equipment requested for this project will
allow for full-screen display of real-time data that will greatly enhance large
group presentations both for student and staff programs at the NBWS. In
addition, partial support is requested of real-time data services that will
enable the NBWS to maintain its present level of real-time weather data.
