9306753 Grant The study of hybridization is important in evolutionary biology
because it reveals the forces at work in the final stages of speciation. Some
populations of animal species commonly hybridize, but it is usually difficult if
not impossible tho determine the causes and consequences of hybridization in
nature. The proposed research takes advantage of an exceptionally favorable
situation for investigating the causes of hybridization and the reasons for
relatively high fitness of the hybrids. On the small island of Daphne Major in
the Galapagos archipelago the medium ground finch, Geospiza fortis, occasionally
interbreeds with the two others; G.scandens, a resident species, G. fuliginosa,
an immigrant. Pedigree analysis has shown that hybrids may survive and breed as
well or better than the parental species, over several years. Ecological reasons
for their high fitness will be investigated by intensive study of feeding
efficiencies and diets. Possible advantages arising from enhanced heterozygosity
will be assessed by an analysis of inbreeding effects in the G.fortis and
G.scandens populations. Causes of interbreeding will be identified by
statistical analysis of mating patterns. %%% There are basic and applied aspects
of the proposed research. Results will be of theoretical importance to our
understanding of speciation. A demonstration of the role of hybridization in
maintaining genetic variation in small and potentially endangered populations
will be the value to the applied field of conservation biology.
