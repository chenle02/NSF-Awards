Reliable interactive power networks (IPN), with applications ranging from FACTS
and distributed power generation to naval ships and telecommunications,
constitute one of the pillars of foundation of our socio-economic progress and
security. IPN are characterized by hybrid dynamics, nonlinearities, multi-
dimensionalities, and multiple time scales. Conventional approaches to modeling,
analysis, and control of IPN using smooth averaged models are not always
adequate and in many cases yield inaccurate results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
proposal addresses these inadequacies and has four objectives: (a) develop a
theoretical underpinning of IPN to realize a unified hybrid-modeling framework
(UHMF); (b) nonlinear analyses of IPN using the UHMF to predict instabilities
(leading to failures) due to complex inter- and intra-network interactions,
hybrid dynamics, parametric variations, and disturbance propagations; (c)
develop robust hybrid controllers (beyond the realm of traditional feedback
control) in an optimal and anticipatory framework to stabilize the dynamics of
the IPN in the presence of destabilizing influences and identify impending and
incipient failures by establishing thresholds for instabilities; and (d) develop
efficient and robust algorithms to analyze the dynamics of IPN, validate the
predictions of nonlinear analyses and the effectiveness of control using
existing off- and on-line simulations on virtual test beds, ultimately leading
to experimental verifications on a scaled prototype. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a
broader note, the proposed work will promote integration of research and
education, dissemination of knowledge for enhanced technical and scientific
understanding, focused industry-university collaborations, cross-disciplinary
growth, student and faculty involvement at local and national levels, and
participation of students from under-represented and minority groups.&lt;br/&gt;
