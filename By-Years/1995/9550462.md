9550462 Baldwin Project Summary A monthly series of interactive satellite
teleconferences are being delivered to faaulty who teach undergraduate
engineering students. Each telecast will feature an innovative "best practice"
that can be adapted by participants. NTU will work with NSF DUE staff to
identify topics and presenters. NTU will produce, market, deliver and evaluate
eight one-hour, interactive teleconferences in 1995. This grant enables the
seminars to be provided without charge to faculty participants. A license to
copy and reuse a videotape of the teleconferences as well as the printed
material provided to each registered college is integral to this very cost-
effective dissemination project. Participants will be surveyed to determine the
impact of their participation.
