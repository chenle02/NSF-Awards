This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in marine geology
between Donald F. McNeill of the University of Miami and Djafar Aissaoui of the
University of Paris (South). The objective of their research is to calibrate and
refine the timing of geodynamic events associated with an active, subducting
plate boundary. The investigators will apply carbonate magnetostratigraphy to an
uplifted atoll in the Loyalty Islands of the South Pacific. Dr. McNeill brings
to this collaboration experience in rock magnetics and magnetostratigraphic
dating of shallow-water carbonates. He has constructed a superconducting
magnetics laboratory for data analysis. This is complemented by Dr. Aissaoui's
knowledge about the Atoll's geology and stratigraphy. Carbonate
magnetostratigraphy is a novel technique for timing and determining rates of
motion at active plate boundaries and for extracting data on past sea level
events. Results from this research will determine its feasibility for studies at
active plate boundaries and could lead to its widespread use for research in
geodynamics and plate tectonics.
