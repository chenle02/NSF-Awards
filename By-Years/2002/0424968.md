Ierapetritou&lt;br/&gt;0424968&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this
research is to develop systems-based quantitative approaches that consider the
whole picture of cell metabolism, including intra and inter compartmental
processes within a multi-objective framework. This is needed in order to
investigate the characteristics of hepatocyte cells, the role of specific
functions in bioartificial liver systems, and the optimization of their
performance. Their hypothesis is that there is a finite number of hepatic
functions which are most critical for patient survival, that it is possible to
significantly upregulate these functions in hepatocyte cultures, and as a
result, maximize cell function and reduce the cell mass required in the
bioartificial liver. In particular, the specific aims for this research are: (1)
to characterize and optimize substrate supplementation to enhance hepatocyte
function, (2) to modulate the hepatocyte function through the use of antisense
technology with the target to examine different substrates and validate the
importance of different pathways as predicted by specific aim 1, and (3) to
develop a quantitative analysis to study the effects of uncertainty
considerations mainly due to variability of plasma concentration. &lt;br/&gt;
