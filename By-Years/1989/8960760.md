This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in the general
area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfield of photodetector
technology. The focus of this activity is the development and evaluation of
linear arrays of bolometer elements for use as uncooled detectors in infrared
spectrometers. These arrays will incorporate recently-developed thin films with
high temperature coefficients of resistance and be fabricated using lithographic
and ion milling techniques. The arrays will contain 1000 or more elements to
obtain good resolution in the 4000-400 wavenumber range. Element detectibility
should be comparable to that presently obtainable with single element uncooled
detectors, but detector response should be much more rapid. Incorporation of
these arrays in IR spectrometers offers the potential of developing instruments
in which major optical components are stationary. Advantages include high
measurement speed, ruggedness, and reduced cost which portend a desirable
commercial instrument.
