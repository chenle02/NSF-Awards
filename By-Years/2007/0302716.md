&lt;br/&gt;The IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT) is
held yearly at &lt;br/&gt;different locations in the world. The 2003 ISIT will
be held from June 29 . July 4, 2003, &lt;br/&gt;at the Pacific Convention Plaza,
Yokohama, Japan. The expected attendance, based on &lt;br/&gt;the experience of
recent ISIT.s, is 750.850 technical delegates from more than 25
&lt;br/&gt;countries. About one-third of these attendees are expected to be
graduate students, and &lt;br/&gt;many more will be recent graduates and new
assistant professors. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests support for
the travel expenses of ISIT participants from the U.S. &lt;br/&gt;These
participants would be individuals whose papers have been selected for
presentation &lt;br/&gt;at the Symposium, but who lack funds and would not be
able to attend without travel &lt;br/&gt;support. The total amount requested is
$30,000, based on a total of 20- 30 grants of &lt;br/&gt;$1000-$1500 each.
