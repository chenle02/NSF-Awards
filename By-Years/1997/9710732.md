This study focuses on how knowledge about environmental safety is generated and
how this is translated into different disciplinary and work contexts. More
specifically, it examines waste management, worker safety, and public health
practices utilized in nuclear weapons production. Identifying this package of
behaviors, risk assessment practices, and decision-making procedures as
`environmental safety`, this analysis seeks to understand how nuclear weapons
scientists, engineers, managers, and workers undertook to contain and limit
damage from the hazardous materials with which they worked. Arguing that nuclear
weapons production occurs in a dynamic sociotechnical system, the study uses
changes in environmental safety to illustrate the knowledge flows and
organizational structures in the Cold War Institution. The general approach will
be to track the generation and flow of ecological, health, and safety knowledge
within the nuclear weapons production process through archival research of the
laboratories, agencies, and divisions involved in such work. Archival work will
also be conducted to determine official policy and operational practices at
various production sites.
