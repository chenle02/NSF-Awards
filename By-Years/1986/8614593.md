Evolutionary changes in distantly-related groups often produce outward
similarities that can be misinterpreted as evidence of close relationship.
Paralellisms, as they are called, can only be discerned by evaluating ancestor-
descendant relationships using evidence that is independent of the features in
question. PIs propose to collect and analyze 18s ribosomal RNA sequence data for
a variety of gastropod taxa. The research goals are: a) construct a phylogeny
for the orders of snails, based on molecular data and b) identify parallelisms
in the evolution of morphological character complexes. A new molecular phylogeny
lab will be established at the California Academy of Sciences for this and
future projects. A successful attempt to construct a biochemical phylogeny for
the snails would have the widest impact on invertebrate zoology, paleontology
and evolutionary thinking in general. There is a vast body of lower-level
knowledge of this class, all without a believable phylogenetic framework. The
need for and importance of this research is beyond doubt. Establishing a
molecular lab at the California Academy of Sciences will benefit not only this
research project, but that of other Curators and investigators in the Bay area.
