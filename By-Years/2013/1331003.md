This is a post-doctoral study, during which the PI will be trained in
ethnographic methods and will conduct an ethnographic study of laboratories in
which in tissue engineers are working on developing a sustainable source of
protein.

The topic is of general social importance because it pertains to biotechnology,
animal welfare, and food security. The PI plans to produce academic journal
articles, a book, and to share his results with the public through a workshop
and museum exhibit. He has experience writing for a broad audience and this will
contribute to the project having a broad impact.
