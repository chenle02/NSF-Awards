From an algorithmic point of view, systems based on wireless communication pose
unique challenges that are not present in standard networks. Wireless devices
may move around and communication between these devices can be disrupted for
several reasons including obstacles, background noise, and interference problems
due to transmissions from the own wireless network, from a malicious jammer
trying to disrupt communication, as well as coexisting networks using the same
frequency band. Finding suitable models that on one hand allow the rigorous
design and analysis of protocols and on the other hand are useful in practice is
a major challenge and deserves significant research
efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will investigate models for wireless
communication that cover a wide range of physical layer phenomena and that are
yet simple enough so that they are useful in theory and practice. In contrast to
prior algorithmic approaches, our approach will be to model communication
problems due to physical layer issues (such as ackground noise, obstacles,
jammers, etc.) with the help of an adversary, and to develop medium access (MAC)
protocols that are provably robust against these adversaries. Such an approach
has many interesting applications. First, it allows for more general scenarios
for the background noise than previous approaches as it covers bursty situations
that might be due to some temporary obstacle or operation of a machine that
creates interference. Second, the adversarial model would also allow us to
determine how robust a protocol is against wireless jamming attacks, which are a
real threat to standard protocols such as the 802.11 family or networks of
simple sensing wireless devices (where traditional physical layer techniques
cannot be successfully applied). Finally, the adversarial model may allow us to
abstract from interference problems due to transmissions of far away devices in
the wireless network. In addition, we will also focus on important applications
such as leader election and broadcasting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since wireless
networks are a component of many widespread and/or critical systems, the
proposed research will have an impact in several respects, including immediate
applications to emergency services, the military, and local area networks in
hazardous areas. Moreover, the proposed research will also have an impact in
solidifying the international collaboration with the U. of Paderborn, Germany,
and in advancing education and enhancing diversity.
