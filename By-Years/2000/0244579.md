&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0244579&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
goal of the project is to solve differential equations for conformal blocks on
Riemann surfaces of an arbitrary genus, to quantize the differential equations
for conformal blocks, to describe the modular properties of solutions of the
equations, to construct the representation theory of dynamical quantum groups,
which is an algebraic structure underlying the properties of the conformal
blocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special functions have been the objects of
mathematical study since the seventeenth century. The Gauss hypergeometric
function is an example. The theory of special functions is a useful tool to
solve differential equations important for applications. New problems of
mathematical physics require new special functions and suggest new approaches to
studying special functions. Conformal field theory finds its origin in the
physics of surface at critical temperature, and string theory, a unified model
of particle interactions. The object of this research is the mathematical
structure of conformal field theory. This theory explicitly associates a
mathematical object called a complex vector space of conformal blocks with
equations that model physical systems.&lt;br/&gt;
