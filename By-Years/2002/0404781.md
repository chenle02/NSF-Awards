The research goal of this project is to elucidate the remarkable structure-
properties relationships for electronic complex oxides such as high-temperature
superconductivity (HTSC) through the study of their local structure at a
nanometer scale, and to provide the scientific basis for developing new
materials with better properties. This will be achieved principally through
neutron and x-ray scattering with the atomic pair-density function (PDF)
analysis, applied for static and dynamic structures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader impacts include the improvement the PDF method and further demonstration
of its power as an alternative method of structural characterization. Products
of this project, the improved software for the PDF determination, will be made
available to general users. This will benefit the field of nanotechnology,
catalyst research, ceramics research and materials science in
general.&lt;br/&gt;
