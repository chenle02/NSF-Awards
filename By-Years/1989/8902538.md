Research into two main areas is proposed. (1) Nuclear magnetic order will be
investigated below 100 nK in Ag, Au and Rh. AC magnetic susceptibility and low-
frequency cw-NMR measurements will be used to characterize the phase diagram.
(2) A torsional pendulum technique will be used to study the superfluid density
and the energy dissipation of helium-four confined in various geometries,
including Zeolite, silica gel and Vycor glasses. Effects of pore size, substrate
randomness and flow on the superfluid transition will be examined.
