Information on crustal fluids and their role in deformation processes is
obtainable from the investigation of fluid inclusions, mineral phase equilibria
and stable isotopic composition of rocks and minerals. These three approaches
will be combined in a study of fluid-rock interaction in two granulite grade
shear zones of the S. Grenville Province, Ontario and New York. This study will
test the hypothesis that CO2-rich primary fluid inclusions in the shear zones
record late movements during which the minerals did not isotopically re-
equilibrate. The results will help constrain pressures and temperatures during
high-grade deformation and thus have important significance for the tectonics of
deep-seated continental crust in orogenic belts.
