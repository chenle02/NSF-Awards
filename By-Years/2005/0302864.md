The Virtual Tutor for E-Learning Assessment and Feedback addresses the twin
challenges facing distance education when used as a tool for educating the
technicians of a high tech workforce. The first challenge is the need for a
hands-on laboratory experience to adequately train technicians. The second
challenge is the fact that the teacher is remote in space and/or time.
BrainFrame, a new intelligent tutoring system (ITS) software package developed
by Stottler Henke Associates, will be adapted to automate the assessment and
feedback component of the experiential exercises. The ITS reduces the need for
immediate access to a live instructor. This tool will be embedded in the
competency based virtual experiential exercises. The 'smart help' of an
intelligent tutor will enable the student to get help when needed without having
to wait for a response to the course instructor at any time of the day or night.
Both assessment capability and feedback are incorporated in the Intelligent
Tutor software and model. Research indicates that learners using a virtual tutor
compete favorably with classroom-based instruction. The disciplinary focus of
the exercises is topics in common between Controls Technology and Manufacturing
Technology curricula. The primary activity is the development of competency
based experiential exercises for a virtual educational environment. The primary
audience is the distance education student of a two-year terminal degree
program. Additionally, there are many process plants located far from
educational institutions whose employees and prospective employees could greatly
benefit from a distance-education program leading to a technical degree.
