This award is for the continuation of the Earthquake Engineering Research
Institute's (EERI) Program to Maximize Learning from Destructive Earthquakes
(LFE). Conduct of immediate post-earthquake investigations has improved
technical knowledge of earthquake effects and has provided significant new
information leading to improved building practices, thereby contributing to the
reduction of earthquake losses. The scope of the EERI Learning from Earthquakes
Program will continue to involve three principal activities: l) Conducting post-
earthquake field investigations; 2) Providing a clearinghouse for post-
earthquake field investigations; and 3) Disseminating the lessons learned
through public briefings and special reports. EERI will obtain increasingly
focused information about the effects of earthquakes on the built environment
and the concomitant ramifications in the societal arena; document findings from
those investigations; improve procedures and guidelines for conducting future
investigations; and broaden the dissemination of lessons learned to researchers,
practicing engineers, and others concerned about reducing future earthquake
losses.
