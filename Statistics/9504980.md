Institution: University of Michigan Title: Comutationally Aggressive Approaches
to Sequential Design Abstract: This research is concerned with the design and
analysis of sequential designs for experiments. Features of particular emphasis
are i) obtaining optimal designs and exact analyses through new computer
algorithms and use of high performance machines; ii) generating practical
designs which protect against problems such as selection bias or time trends;
iii) flexibility in design, allowing researchers to realistically represent
their goals and resource constraints. These techniques are applicable to a wide
range of applications, but particular attention will be paid to clinical trials,
and industrial testing (particularly in reliability testing, using sequential
approaches to reduce costs and/or time). Both Bayesian and frequentist models
will be considered. This research explores the design and analysis of sequential
designs of experiments, in which decisions adapt or change as information
arising from the experiment accrues. Using new computer algorithms and high
performance computers, new designs are developed for problems in areas such as
clinical trials and industrial testing .
