This research assesses the feasibility of achieving a desirable property balance
theoretically on the basis of micro-mechanical models of short-fiber composites.
With solutions to these models, parametric studies of the effects of the
relevant microscopic variables on composite properties will be carried out, and
conclusions regarding the feasibility will be drawn. There are numberous
commerical applications which demand highly flexible, ductile materials which
still possess adequate strenght and creep resistance. By altering the fiber-
matrix interface, as well as the fiber matrix materials, fiber aspect ratio and
volume fraction, various trade-offs between flexibility and strength may be
achieved.
