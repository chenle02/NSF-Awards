This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to Trinity University for the
renovation and repair of Moody Engineering Building which houses research and
research training activities of the Department of Chemistry. This building was
constructed in 1966 and has not been renovated since that time. The ARFMP grant
of $288,650 and $288,650 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to
modernize these research and research training facilities. This project will
address the need to improve the current research infrastructure by alleviating
insufficiencies in the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system,
modifying the spatial configuration, and providing adequate fume hoods and bench
space. This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by providing an
improved environment for the conduct of chemical research and for the training
of quality undergraduate students. Trinity University is an institution with a
particular commitment to recruiting and graduating women and minorities in
science and its Department of Chemistry is experiencing significant growth in
course enrollments and in the numbers of majors who go on to attend graduate
school.
