9457217 Tyler The tightly adherent biomolecules that are utilized in the
adhesion of microorganisms to surfaces are to be examined by Time-of-Flight
Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) in order to determine surface
interactions of the initial attachment of microorganisms to surfaces. Basic
research/development on spectra interpretation is to be an additional focus of
this project, and used as a means of opening this area of research to this new
surface analysis technology. ***
