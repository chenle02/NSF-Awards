&lt;br/&gt;The foci of this research involve the palladium-catalyzed
hydroalkylation and oxidative alkylation of unactivated olefins. The scope of
hydroalkylation will be explored and the use of dialky ketones and electron-rich
aryl groups will be used to develop processes for the formation of
cyclopentanones, carbobicyclic and heterocyclic compounds. Intermolecular
hydroalkylation processes will also be tested and the mechanism of palladium-
catalyzed hydroalkylation wil be elucidated. Procedures for catalytic,
asymmetric hdroalkylation will be developed as will tandem
hydroalkylation/carbonylation and hydralkylation/carbometallation methodology.
The scope of oxidative alkylation with respect to carbon nucleophiles and
substitution will be examined and oxidative alkylation procedures terminated by
beta-heteroatom elimination will be developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this
award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the
research of Dr. Ross A. Widenhoefer of the Department of Chemistry at Duke
University. Professor Widenhoefer will focus his work on the development of
methodologies for palladium-catalyzed alkylation of unactivated olefins. The
chemistry holds great potential as a new method for C-C bond formation and could
have an important broader impact on organic synthesis, in particular on the
ability of synthetic chemists to construct complex naturally occurring and
biologically active molecules of interest to the pharmaceutical industry. Aside
from providing an excellent environment for the training of graduate students,
the project will also involve participation of underrepresented minority
undergraduate students from North Carolina Central University, a neighboring
HBCU. &lt;br/&gt;
