&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act
of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dmitry Matyushov of Arizona
State University has an award from the Theoretical and Computational Program of
the Chemistry Division to study the electrostatics at the interface of a polar
liquid and a solute of nanoscale dimensions using a combination of numerical
simulations and analytic techniques. These studies focus on a range between the
macroscopic and microscopic scale where the electrostatics is not understood and
where neither microscopic nor macroscopic pictures apply to the nanometer liquid
interface. The research is performed in conjunction with experimentalists
studying these phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These studies address many
important questions regarding electron transport in biology, artificial
photosynthesis and solar energy harvesting. Additionally, Professor Matyushov
and his research group are involved with outreach activities involving high-
school teachers geared toward inspiring interest in science in local schools.
