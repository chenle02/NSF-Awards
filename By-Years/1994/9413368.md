CTS-9413368 High gradient magnetic separations (HGMS) technique will be to
collect and separate nanometer size particles. Magnetic properties allow the
small particles to be subjected to a large driving force for separation. The
mechanism of separation of nanoparticles will be investigated for different flow
conditions using a range of magnetic fields. The dynamics of particle collection
will be studied in both liquid and air media. The research may lead to an
improved understanding of the behavior and interactions of small particles in
magnetic fields. The research will also provide training to students in the
important interdisciplinary area of ultrafine particle processing. Development
of the proposed separation technique could have impact on pollution control and
biotechnology, and also lead to the development of novel nanostructured
materials.
