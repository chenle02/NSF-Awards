This project focuses on the investigation of mathematical models of nonlinear
wave phenomena such as the appearance and persistence of large eddies and the
onset of turbulence in fluid flow. The formation and oscillation of coherent
structures are phenomena which such as the Kuramoto-Sivashinisky, Sine-Gordon
and Nonlinear Schroedinger equations. By employing methods of inverse spectral
theory, invariant manifold theory and numerical methods, this project will be
aimed at explaining the common mechanism which gives rise to the above phenomena
in these disparate models.
