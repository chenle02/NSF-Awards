This is a fundamental engineering research project to develop the basis for
providing "smart systems" in the surgical procedure. The complexity of the
physiological response to anesthetics and other drugs is enormous. However
computers are now available that can easily handle this complexity using the
appropriate mathematical equations. The principle object of this proposal is to
develop a computer controlled system which will provide the necessary monitors
for the condition of the patient, then it will prescribe the proper drug dose
regimen to maintain the cardiac output of the patient within a very small
tolerance. Such a system would have a great impact on surgery by greatly
lowering the risk of injury or death during surgery.
