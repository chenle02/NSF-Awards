Elena Galoppini of Rutgers University at Newark, Gerald Meyer of Johns Hopkins
University and Piotr Piotrowiak of Rutgers University at Newark, are supported
by a NIRT grant (Nanoscience Interdisciplinary Research Teams) for their
interdisciplinary effort to improve our fundamental understanding of electronic
interactions at organic molecule-nanoparticle interfaces and to allow us to
control them in a predictable manner. The research employs synthetic
methodologies that allow control over the distance and orientation of surface
bound organic molecules with respect to the nanoparticle surface. The materials
that will be prepared will enable these researchers to probe long-standing
fundamental questions concerning interfacial electronic interactions in
molecular detail that was not previously possible. Experiments will be carried
out in which the position of redox and photo-active organic compounds relative
to a nanoparticle surface will be fixed to control and tune the interfacial
electronic interactions through systematic molecular-level variation of surface-
attached dyes and nanoparticle materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The preparation
of assemblies of molecular components (supramolecular structures) that perform
desired functions such as light harvesting antennas or fluorescent sensors is a
significant long term research goal. This research will probe interfacial
interactions between semiconductor nanoparticles and attached molecular species.
The research will contribute to our fundamental understanding of electronic
interactions occuring at the interfaces between semiconductor nanoparticles and
attached molecular species in order that we might control them in a predictable
manner. Graduate students, undergraduate students and postdocs will receive
excellent training and research experiences in a forefront nanoscience research
program.
