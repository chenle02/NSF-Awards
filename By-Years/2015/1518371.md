This award funds the research activities of Professor Ali Chamseddine at the
American University of Beirut, Lebanon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The quest for
unification of fundamental physical interactions has been the subject of
intensive research for nearly forty years. The stumbling block in this program
is the inclusion of the gravitational force among the other three forces
mediating the strong, electromagnetic and weak interactions. These latter forces
are very well understood in the framework of quantum field theory. In contrast,
the gravitational force, because of its extreme weakness, is sizable only for
macroscopic objects and is therefore mainly understood only at the classical
level. Professor Chamseddine's research focuses on the development of a quantum
theory of gravity. As such, research in this area promotes the progress of
science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and
understanding of new physical laws. Due to its interdisciplinary nature, this
work will also contribute to the advancement of knowledge in high-energy
physics, gravitational physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. Moreover, this
project is envisioned to have significant broader impacts. The American
University of Beirut (AUB) plays a very important role in promoting the American
educational system in the Middle East. The recent launching of the Ph.D. program
in theoretical physics is a step towards the promotion of high-level research in
the Middle East, and is attracting students of high
caliber.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More technically, Professor Chamseddine will
conduct research investigations in supergravity, grand unified models, quantum
gravity, string theory and noncommutative geometry. He will pursue the
construction of spectral manifolds in noncommutative geometry which reproduce
the Standard Model Lagrangian coupled to gravity. In addition, he will study
physical applications and dynamical realizations of this quantization scheme.
