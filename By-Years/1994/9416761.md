9416761 Todorovska This action is to support digitization of recordings of
strong ground motions by the Los Angeles and Vicinity Strong Motion Network
during the Northridge earthquake. Of the 77 stations in the field at the time of
this earthquake, 65 stations recorded complete strong motions from the main
shock, at epicentral distances between 2 km and 85 km. Numerous aftershocks were
also recorded, several having magnitude M &gt; 5. These data are invaluable for
better understanding of the rupture process and of the damage in various areas,
as well as for understanding site effects and for forward modeling of ground
motion in areas where there were no other recordings. ***
