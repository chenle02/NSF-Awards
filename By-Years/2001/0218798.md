An important and challenging question currently facing biologists is the
identification of binding sites in DNA. These regulatory elements are for the
proteins that are involved in the regulation of genes. The appropriate
computational tools can be extremely valuable for pruning the search space of
experiments, efficiently suggesting potential regulatory elements on which to
focus limited laboratory resources. As more related genomes are sequenced and
our understanding of regulatory relationships among genes, improves, a novel
problem arises that is addressed here. Namely, the data to be analyzed will
often be heterogeneous, a collection of co-regulated genes from one species
together with their orthologous, i.e., corresponding, genes in several related
species. This project will design, implement, and test algorithms for this novel
problem and related issues in the discovery of regulatory elements. All software
will be made freely available on the Internet.
