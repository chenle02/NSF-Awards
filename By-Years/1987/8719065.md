This research seeks to demonstrate two propositions: (1)People differ both in
how they understand or think about the world (cognition), and the factual
information in the world which they pay attention to (perception). For example,
expert teachers may differ from novice teachers both in the categories they use
to interpret the same classroom observation (cognition) and in the kinds of
classroom behaviors they pickup or are attuned to (perception). (2) It is then
assumed that a major determinant of whether people are in a perceptual or
cognitive mode (i.e. differ in the things they see as well as how they see the
same thing) is the social setting in which their interpretations or observations
take place. Consider the example of a teacher who is told to communicate a
general verbal impression of a student. The demand to communicate under such
conditions encourages the use of stereotype.like categories because it is easier
to share these categories than it would be to describe a series of
individualized perceptual reactions. Alternatively, if a teacher is told to
develop a specific behavioral description of a student's problem behaviors,
judgements are likely to be less stereotypic and more perceptually grounded.
Other conditions which favor stereotypic impressions include being forced to
make judgements about social interactive properties of people such as dominance,
caring or cooperation, without the benefit of observing actual social
interactions over time (i.e. from second hand verbal information). The research
will attempt to show that the necessary information for judgements of traits
such as dominance or competitiveness is directly observable in the amount or
type of coordinations of actions that develop over time. For example, in a
cooperative relationship actions become increasingly coordinated, while in
dominance, one person's actions may come to increasingly direct the others. The
emphasis in this research is on the multiple roles played by the social setting
is in sharp counterpoint to most current cognitive work in social information
processing which is overly verbal. Moreover, it is claimed that investigating
the conditions which encourage a sensitivity to social stimulus factors may be
useful to both evaluation and training purposes in regard to distinguishing
between good and poor clinicians or expert versus novice teachers. Such research
may also serve to help explain and thus reduce the widespread use of stereotypic
views of the world.
