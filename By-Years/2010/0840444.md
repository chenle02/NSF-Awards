This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award from the Chemistry
Research Instrumentation and Facilities Multiuser Program (CRIF:MU), Professor
R. David Britt and colleagues Alan L. Balch, Susan M. Kauzlarich, Mark J. Kurth,
and Philip P. Power from the University of California-Davis will acquire an
X-ray diffractometer with a low temperature device. This instrument will support
research and education in areas such as the study of fullerenes, Zintl ions,
metal-to-metal bonded species, inorganic and organometallic compounds, porphyrin
related devices, and combinatorial medicinal chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An
X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three
dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and
provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule
relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here will impact a
number of areas, including chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This
instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.
