Subject: Abstract ------------------------------- Message Contents
------------------------------- 9731482 This proposal funds scientific
instrumentation required aboard the R/V MOANA WAVE, a 280' research vessel
operated by the University and owned by the Navy. In 1998, the National Science
Foundation will support 198 days of research on the ship. The research will be
conducted primarily in the Northeast and Central Pacific. The instrumentation
requested includes an undulating towed vehicle, a winch for mooring operations,
refurbishment of a fast seismic streamer, coring equippment, and a dual lowered
Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP). This instrumentation is necessary to
support the scientific programs assigned to the ship.
