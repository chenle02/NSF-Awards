This research project addresses several physiological problems that have emerged
from recent studies of diving behavior in king and emperor penguins. Foremost is
the seemingly consistent pattern of both species to make frequent, exceptionally
long and deep dives. The emperor penguin is the most suitable species for
measuring physiological variables related to breath-hold limits and oxygen
management, while diving voluntarily. Some of these variables are muscle and
blood oxygen levels and blood chemistry. The king penguin is most suitable for
studies of the effects of compression on gas exchange. Some measurements will be
blood oxygen and nitrogen contents during the course of simulated dives to 200
m. Other experiments will determine the energetic output of diving, the
morphological and behavioral development of diving of incipient fledglings and
specific measures of foraging success. The results of this work will be relevant
not only to diving physiology, but will also comprise an essential element in
understanding energetics and trophic relationships in the polar ecosystem.
