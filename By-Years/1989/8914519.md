Dr. Zinn will measure the metal abundances and radial velocities of about 400 RR
Lyrae variable stars. These data will improve our knowledge of the dependence of
kinematics on metal abundance in the halo of our Galaxy and the populations of
stars in the thick disk of the Galaxy. This will constrain models of the early
evolution of the Galaxy. Two globular clusters, which are the most metal- rich
clusters thought to contain RR Lyrae variables, will be observed. These data and
computations of synthetic horizontal branch models will help resolve the enigma
of the origin of the metal-rich RR Lyrae variables. Color magnitude diagrams
will be constructed for about 10 globular clusters of stars close to the
Galactic Center. These data will set an upper limit on the age variations that
may be present, which in turn will constrain models of galactic evolution. The
two most popular, and competing, pictures of the formation of the halo of our
Galaxy predict very different relationships between the abundance ratio of iron
to hydrogen and the mean rotational velocity about the Galactic Center. There is
considerable debate whether the present data support either picture over the
other. Dr. Zinn has designed an observational project which he expects will rule
out one or the other of the two models.
