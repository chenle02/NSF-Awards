This grant provides funds to help organize the 2013 US National Congress on
Computational Mechanics (USNCCM). The conference will take place on October
10-12, 2011 at Raleigh, North Carolina. The USNCCM conference facilitates the
exchange of information on all aspects of computational engineering and science
and provides a forum for discussion, education, and recognition of the talents
of the computational engineering and science community. The USNCCM conference
promotes the development and strengthening of the interfaces between various
disciplines in engineering, sciences, and mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
2012 2013 US National Congress on Computational Mechanics will host a student
paper/presentation contest and actively seek the participation of groups
underrepresented in science and engineering for participation. The funds
provided will support undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral students.
