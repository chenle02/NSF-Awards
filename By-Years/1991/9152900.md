FTIR will be incorporated into general chemistry, organic and advanced organic
chemistry, physical chemistry, inorganic chemistry, and independent study
(directed research). The instrument will be used in general chemistry to analyze
gases in Los Angeles smog. In the organic and advanced organic chemistry
laboratories, the instrument will be used to characterize products from various
experiments, including multistep synthetic sequences. In physical chemistry the
instrument will measure the fundamental absorption bands of HCl while the
inorganic laboratory will study CO stretching bands on various carbonyl
compounds. The instrument will also see considerable use in our heavily enrolled
undergraduate research courses (independent study). The grantee will match tne
NSF award from non-Federal sources.
