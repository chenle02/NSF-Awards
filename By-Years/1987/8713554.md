This project deals with experimental and computer modeling of metal forging
operations such as forging. A significant advantage of a forged part is the
enhanced physical strength due to metallurgical grain-flow and orientation.
Consequently, a number of computer-aided forging programs predict both the
forging load-history and the internal plastic- deformations associated with
specific die and billet configurations. However, there appears to be no
quantitative validation of these plastic deformations due to a lack of
experimental information dealing with quantitative internal plastic-deformations
and grain-size distributions associated with accurately known forging-
conditions. Furthermore, there appears to be no statistical assessment
associated with the variations of the internal deformations due to variance of
the forging population. This project addresses some of these issues by both
experimental and computational methods.
