A subject of intense current interest in astronomy is mass loss from stars. Mass
loss occurs during virtually all phases of stellar evolution, though the rate of
mass loss varies considerably. One of the more enigmatic phases of mass loss
occurs during the red giant phase of stars that have masses similar to that of
the sun. These stars may shed up to 10-3 solar masses per year and thereby
produce planetary nebulae (which are circumstellar gaseous shells that expand at
speeds of a few km/sec). The mass loss regions surrounding some of the most
luminous red giants are characterized by strong hydroxyl maser emission. The
Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to investigate theoretically and
observationally such regions. The objective of the research is to understand
better the mass shedding process; to describe in greater detail the geometric,
dynamic, thermodynamic, and magnetic structure of the mass loss regions; and to
determine the collective influence of this mass loss on the chemical evolution
of the galaxy.
