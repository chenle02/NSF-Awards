In the past decade, natural disasters (e.g., wildfires and hurricanes) have been
exacerbated by climate change, yet the methods for improving community
resilience to electricity power outages resulting from these disasters have
remained largely unchanged. At the household and community levels, most
resilience efforts related to electricity supply focus on deploying rooftop
solar or diesel generators. While these resources can provide backup power,
there are barriers to ownership (e.g., roof space for solar photovoltaics and
proper ventilation for diesel generators) and they are not always attainable for
low-income populations. This Disaster Resilience Research Grants (DRRG) project
investigates the degree to which modular micro-grids built on novel technologies
(e.g., solid-oxide fuel cells) can supply constant electrical power during
disaster response and humanitarian relief efforts. This work will benefit
communities by allowing more residents to remain in place after disasters,
enabling healthcare responders to maintain more facilities, and reducing the
area impacted by power outages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research investigates
and crafts disaster mitigation strategies for an emerging technology (fuel-cell-
based microgrids) by combining economic analysis, electricity planning, and
operations research methods. This novel approach will facilitate new energy
transition analyses that can assess the degree to which decentralized
infrastructure will reduce the electrical outage time, and provides a framework
for better deployment of initial humanitarian relief efforts immediately
following disasters. The work will combine a microgrid optimization model with a
multi-criteria decision analysis model to evaluate 1) the capability of these
emerging technologies to supply uninterruptible power during disasters, and 2)
the trade-offs between cost, resilience, and equity
objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
