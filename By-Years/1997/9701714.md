ABSTRACT PROPOSAL # : DEB-9701714 INVESTIGATOR(S) : HAMILTON INSTITUTION:
MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY The aims of this research are to investigate linkages
between hydrology, biogeochemistry, and ecology of wetlands in glacial
landscapes, with the long-term aim of developing a predictive understanding of
the relative sensitivity of different wetlands to climate change. The research
plan involves monitoring of a large number of different wetlands in relation to
annual variation in climate, and as part of the NSF CAREER program it includes
significant student participation through class projects and independent
research. The wetlands to be studied are all in central Michigan. The general
hypothesis is that the variability among wetlands can be explained by
variability in a small number of key hydrologic processes including groundwater
inputs, hydraulic residence time, and seasonal pattern of flooding and
desiccation. These same variables will also control responses to climate change.
