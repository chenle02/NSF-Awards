A more comprehensive, challenging and meaningful laboratory experience in the
study of human factors is being developed to reinforce ergonomic principles
learned in coursework. The laboratory is being revamped to include networked
printers, support data analysis software, a co-processor/disk drive for format
conversion, a dynamic strength tester, additional anthropometers, heartrate
monitors and flexible 'tapping-task' equipment. This project is being matched by
an amount equal to the award.
