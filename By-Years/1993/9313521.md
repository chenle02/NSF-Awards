9313521 Bolla The Biology Department of St. Louis University has an active and
growing group of faculty in the area of botanical research. In the last three
years, their research and research training efforts have expanded to the point
that their outdated facilities are no longer able to provide suitable space.
This is especially true for faculty-supervised student research projects.
Undergraduates hoping to work on independent research projects are now routinely
turned away for lack of suitable lab space. To resolve this problem, St. Louis
University has planned to renovate a moribund research lab into a shared-use lab
for students and faculty, and to replace a research greenhouse whose
environmental controls cannot be repaired. The research lab will receive new
casework, an autoclave, plumbing, laminar flow and fume hoods, as well as new
space partitioning. The new greenhouse will have modern environmental controls
that will support a wide range of experiments. These facilities modernization
projects will alleviate the space shortage by creating highly suitable
environments for research in plant growth and physiology, biochemistry, and
plant pathology. The renovations will enable student and faculty research
collaborations, and will help to attract students to careers in science. ***
