Proposal 0416731&lt;br/&gt;Vascular Pattern Formation in Leaves of Arabidopsis
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to understand the progressive building
of vein networks during the development of plant leaves. A hierarchy of primary,
secondary and higher order veins appears during the formation of a leaf. This
provides landmarks that position other types of cells that carry out
photosynthesis, gas exchange, sugar transport and other functions with an
essential relationship to the vein system. The vein pattern of a particular
species is not fixed, and it can be optimized to the requirements of the
environment to provide greater photosynthetic or water efficiency when needed.
This project has used genetics and molecular biology to identify several dozen
genes and gene products with potential roles in the vein patterning process. The
current project will follow through on understanding the roles of the products
of these key genes, some of which are members of biochemical pathways for
signaling within or between cells (e.g., sterols). What are the targets of these
signals, and what triggers them at the right time and place to form continuous
files of vein cells? The project will identify the immediate triggers and
targets for these signals, using the currently identified gene products to find
the unknown ones, and to bootstrap along to additional partners. The scientific
impact of this will be to increase the understanding of venation formation,
providing potential tools for modifying the adaptation of plants to different
environments or the efficiency of plant growth. The broader impact of the
project is that it serves as a training vehicle for graduate students and
postdoctoral scientists, and as a source of materials for the PI's teaching to
undergraduate and graduate students. The PI is active in teaching biology to
non-science undergraduates, many of whom have an interest in working on science
policy and science &amp; society issues.&lt;br/&gt;
