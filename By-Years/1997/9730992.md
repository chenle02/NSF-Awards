9730992 Key This award supports a three-year collaborative research project
between Professor Jennifer Key, Department of Mathematical Sciences at Clemson
University, and Professor Jamshid Moori, Department of Mathematics at the
University of Natal in South Africa. The investigators will explore the
possibilities for various classes of designs, especially those associated with
good codes and finite geometrics with large automorphism groups. Professors Key
and Moori will also study the links among the theories of designs, codes, and
groups, especially the use of algebraic coding theory and group theory, in the
investigation and classification of combinatorial designs, with a particular
emphasis on designs and codes arising from finite geometrics. The proposed
collaboration combines Professor Key's expertise in group theory and problems
associated with the classification of designs and their codes with Professor
Moori's expertise in the theory of finite groups and their representations. The
Division of International Programs and the Division of Mathematical Sciences are
jointly providing funding for this project.
