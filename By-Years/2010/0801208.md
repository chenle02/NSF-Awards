This project has two main objectives. The first objective is to study the
asymptotic behavior of the cohomology groups of modular varieties and of the
number of rational points on such varieties over finite fields as the level
varies. It will establish a rather important property of modular varieties,
namely that the modular varieties over appropriately chosen finite fields
provide examples of varieties with many rational points compared to their Betti
numbers. This will shed some light on a difficult and largely open question of
the optimality of the Weil-Deligne bound on the number of rational points on
varieties over finite fields. This result might also find applications in coding
theory. The second objective is to develop arithmetic tools for the study of
modular curves over function fields and to use the parametrizations by modular
curves to study non-isotrivial elliptic curves over function
fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modular varieties introduced by Shimura and their
function field counterparts introduced by Drinfeld play an absolutely central
role in current algebraic number theory. One of the main applications of these
varieties is to the Langlands conjectures, since the cohomology groups of these
varieties provide a link between Galois and automorphic representations. The
project builds on and extends the results obtained by the PI earlier. The
methods which will be employed come from the ideas in the proofs of the
Langlands conjectures over function fields, rigid-analytic geometry and
representation theory over local fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
