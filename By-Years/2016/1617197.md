This project aims to obtain provably optimal cryptographic constructions, using
objectively practical techniques, for a wide range of tasks. To achieve this
goal, the project makes progress on three technical fronts. First, a general-
purpose framework is developed that encompasses and systematizes known practical
cryptographic techniques from many domains. Second, the project develops
techniques for proving concrete, fine-grained lower bounds about constructions
within this framework. Finally, techniques from program synthesis will be
applied to the new framework. These techniques culminate in methods for
automatically synthesizing secure and optimal cryptographic constructions.

This project focuses on cryptographic constructions that use fast, practical
techniques. Such constructions are the most likely to have immediate impact on
everyday use. The cryptographic applications areas being studied range from
fundamental ones already in widespread use, such as symmetric-key encryption and
digital signatures, to more advanced ones more recently approaching practical
adoption like garbled circuits. The project also advances undergraduate and
graduate education in cryptography with the ongoing development of comprehensive
and innovative curricular materials.
