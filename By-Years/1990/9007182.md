The method of resampling for statistical inference known as the "bootstrap" has
proved useful in situations where the data are observations from independent
identically distributed random variables and this research will extend the
method to a simple kind of dependence encountered in the Markov chain. One case
that will be considered is that of a Markov chain with a countable state space
and homogeneous transition probabilities. The question of whether or not it is
possible to provide bootstrap descriptions of the distribution of the difference
of the empirical and true transition probabilities will be examined. Related
questions for the estimation of the distribution of hitting times, stationary
distributions, etc., for recurrent Markov chains with finite, countable and
uncountable state spaces will be studied.
