9350819 O'Connor This project has developed a computer laboratory to improve the
teaching of statistics in undergraduate courses in the social sciences. A strong
focus involves courses in economics and psychology and on students who do not
have a strong background in mathematics. The central idea is to provide an
environment where undergraduate students become active learners by actually
doing statistics. This involves not only the generation, collection, and
analysis of data but also the writing of scientific reports. Other activities
include data storage, and the use of computer software and technology. The
software includes a general purpose statistical package, and an integrated word
processing and spreadsheet program which enables students to produce scientific
reports based on their work.
