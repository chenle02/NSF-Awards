PROJECT ABSTRACT

Problems in Statistical Model Building. Grace Wahba, PI.

This research is to further the development of Smoothing Spline ANOVA and
related variational methods for multivariate function estimation and statistical
model building, so that these methods may be used in analyses of very large
complex heterogenous data sets as occur in demographic medical studies,
environmental and climatic data analyses and classification problems in a
variety of areas. These methods are flexible nonparametric methods, but
generally contain commonly used parametric families as special cases. The
general approach proceeds in the following steps: (i)propose families of models
that are appropriate for specific areas of application, (ii) develop new
numerical algorithms as required for fitting the models, (ii) develop further
methods for tuning the models and providing accuracy estimates, (iii) develop
information concerning the properties of the methods, including testing on
realistic simulated observations where the `truth' is known, (iv) and applying
the resulting methods to important data sets, with the expectation of extracting
information from these data that is not obtainable by standard parametric
methods.

The goal of this project is provide to scientists in medical, environmental and
atmospheric sciences and supervised machine learning, new and useful tools to
more efficiently analyze their data. Tasks are proposed to develop new methods
that are appropriate for more efficient data analysis in complex demographic
studies which follow populations over time, collecting information useful for
understanding relationships between possible risk factors and the incidence and
progression of various diseases. Tasks are also proposed for the development of
new methods that are appropriate for understanding relationships among various
factors of interest in large environmental and atmospheric data sets with `non-
standard' indirect observational data; and for exploiting some new methods in
classification that have wide applicability for building classification
algorithms based on learning from large data sets in very high dimensional
spaces.
