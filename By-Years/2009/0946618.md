The Atlantic coastal forests of Brazil are considered one of the World's
biodiversity "hotspots"; nearly half of the plant species in the Atlantic
forests are unique to this region. Within these coastal forests, those in
northeastern Brazil (from Bahia to Rio Grande do Norte) are the most biodiverse
and the most critically endangered. Nevertheless, the distributions of the plant
species in this region and their relationship to species in adjacent regions are
not known. The goal of this project is to study the vegetation of these
northeastern forests and demonstrate that the forests of the southern portion
(Bahia) and those of the northern portion (Pernambuco) are not as distinct as
previously hypothesized. This will be accomplished by collecting and identifying
plant specimens in targeted forest fragments throughout the region which will
make it possible to map and predict the distribution of plant species.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discovering new species and clarifying the distribution of
forest plants in northeastern Brazil will enhance our understanding of the
history of this unique region and its flora. In addition, data on species and
their distributions will be provided to appropriate government bodies and local
organizations so that decisions about conservation priorities can be made
wisely. The PI and Co-PI will provide training in botany, ecology and
conservation to student both in the U.S. and in Brazil.
