Shaun O'Boyle, a Guggenheim Fellow photographer, will join a cruise on the
Laurence M. Gould (LMG), traveling to Palmer Station in Antarctica, and document
the visual relationships between science and architecture, architecture and
landscape, and scientists and the environment. At Palmer, the artist will
photograph building interiors, exteriors and infrastructure, overall station
panoramas, and scientists working in the field and on station. Similar
photographs will be taken aboard the LMG to document ship life, science taking
place onboard, infrastructure, and seascapes. The artist intends the project to
complement his previous work at McMurdo Station.

This project will provide a historical archive of the U.S. Antarctic Program's
(USAP) infrastructure and architecture at Palmer Station. As a stand-alone
project, it is outstanding, but it is also an extension of the artist's work
documenting McMurdo station, which increases its historical impact. The proposed
work will expand the artist's "Antarctica: Portraits of Place" and create a more
complete and valuable record of the USAP facilities in this time period.
Outreach includes various venues including museum exhibits, lectures, and a
blog, each reaching a different audience.
