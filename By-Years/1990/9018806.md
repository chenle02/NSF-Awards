Understanding the basic physical characteristics of fluids in hydrothermal
systems is critical in modelling fluid flow in such environments and in
characterizing the extent and depth of crustal alteration produced by high
temperature fluids. The present award will support the development of new
instrumentation to measure temperature, pressure and electrical resistivity of
fluids in high temperature systems. This instrumentation will play an important
role in understanding fluid flow in both marine and continental environments and
should be an important contribution to documenting the basic physical
environment in boreholes.
