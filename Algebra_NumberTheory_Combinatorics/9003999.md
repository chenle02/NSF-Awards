This research, in the area of automorphic forms, makes use of theta-liftings
for the construction of automorphic forms related to the representation theory
of groups over local fields. Although scholars in local representation theory
have obtained deep results about lifting general classes of unitary
representations, the applications to automorphic forms have often been
restricted to lifting one-dimensional characters. This research involves a
specific and important case of the global lifting problem and success should
provide guidance for more general work in the future. This research bridges both
Modern Analysis and Algebra and Number Theory and concerns the representation
theory of classical groups together with automorphic forms on classical groups.
