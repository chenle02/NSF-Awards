A one week workshop on introductory FT-NMR is being held for twelve faculty
members. These faculty come from two and four year institutions in a seven state
region including Arkansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Illinois, and
Iowa. Special efforts are being made to recruit women and minority participants.
The workshop consists of lectures, instrument use, and data analysis. Topics
covered range from introductory NMR theory to pulse sequences and 2-D NMR.
Participants use a JOEL 270 MHZ FT-NMR, purchased with NSF-ILI support, to
obtain proton, carbon-13, phosphorous-31, DEPT, COSY, HETCOR, and other spectra.
Each participant receives a handbook containing theory, spectra, and specific
NMR applications suitable for use in undergraduate laboratories. The
participants gain an expanded knowledge of modern NMR techniques and are
encouraged to introduce these techniques into the undergraduate chemistry
curriculum. A follow-up meeting will be held at the midwest Regional ACS
meeting, November 1996. Participants reports on the use of information from this
workshop at their institutions will be collected, edited, published and
distributed to all institutions of higher education in the seven state region.
