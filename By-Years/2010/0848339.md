This multidisciplinary proposal explores dynamical processes of human learning
and adaptation that occur at different time scales. For example, there are
several variable time scales in the learning of motor skills, including the
cyclical processes within a trial, the duration of a trial, the rest interval
between trials, the number and timing of practice sessions in a day, and the
distribution of practice sessions over days, weeks, months and years. These time
scale relations are explored using both theoretical and empirical approaches.
The project investigates 1)the influence of practice schedules on changes in
learning dynamics in relation to the well known trade-off between speed and
accuracy; 2) the time scales of temporary (adaptation) and persistent (learning)
change; and 3) the changes in characteristic dynamic properties of learning that
arise from different phasing of practice schedules in relation to the circadian
cycle. One anticipated outcome is a new theory of practice that is relevant to
instructional and practice strategies for enhancing performance in human motor
skills in a number of contexts including human factors, music, physical activity
and sport, in addition to the relearning of physical activities as in
rehabilitation and physical therapy.
