This award will provide supplementary support for a long-term research stay by
Dr. Barry Goodell of the University of Maine to conduct collaborative research
with Drs. Koichi Yamamoto and Hitoshi Karasawa of the Forestry and Forest
Products Research Institute in Tsukuba, Japan. They will study the biochemistry
and molecular biology of enzymatic wood degradation. The mechanisms by which
fungi penetrate and degrade wood cell walls are still incompletely understood.
Dr. Goodell's laboratory has been investigating the action of degradative
enzymes and metabolites using immunological probes and transmission electron
microscopy. Dr. Yamamoto and Dr. Karasawa have been using the techniques of UV
microspectrophotometry and scanning electron microscope-based X-ray analysis to
localize and quantify lignin in the wood cell. It is hoped that collaboration
will enable these researchers to establish links between enzyme/metabolite
function and selective delignification.
