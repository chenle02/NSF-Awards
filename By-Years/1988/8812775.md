The process by which consumers make purchase timing decisions is central to
understanding a wide range of economic behaviors. Although this process may
often be complex, at its center is a rather straightforward dilemma; how to
balance the rewards of immediate consumption with the risks of delayed regret.
The decision of when to buy a major durable, for example, requires one to weigh
the lure of immediate enjoyment against the fear that a better product value may
become available later. Likewise, the extent to which a consumer will stock up
on a discounted grocery item depends on how the rewards associated with paying
the lower-than-normal price are balanced against the perceived likelihood that
the apparent "discount" is, in fact, a rather routine one. This research will
explore the process by which consumers make sequential purchase timing and
quantity decisions in uncertain dynamic environments. Through the use of
interactive computer experiments, the research will explore the ability of
consumers to form rationale sequential buying strategies under variations in the
pattern and predictability of temporal price and product quality changes,
uncertainty of future product demand, the risk and complexity of decisions, and
the cost of sequential information gathering. The research should identify sets
of sequential decision heuristics which will allow current formal behavioral
theories of decision making under uncertainty to be extended to temporal
domains.
