The liquid scintillation counter purchased through this project is making it
possible to introduce the theory and techniques of scintillation counting into
the undergraduate biochemistry curriculum. The new machine is used to teach
undergraduates how to count radioactive isotopes commonly found in industrial,
medical, and academic laboratories. The instrument will be used also to study
the transport of amino acids across biological membranes, to determine amounts
of protein synthesis, and to find the rate at which two strands of DNA combining
to form double stranded DNA interact. This instrument also will be used in a
variety of undergraduaste biological and chemical research projects. This
project will better prepare biochemistry, chemistry, and biology students for
success as scientists and medical professionals, and for their service to
society. The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal sum
obtained from non-Federal sources.
