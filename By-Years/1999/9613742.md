Abstract CTS-9613742 Juan dePablo, U. of Wisconsin - Madison Large-scale
atomistic computer simulations of clay swelling by aqueous electrolyte solutions
will be performed, and compared to experiments. The "expanded ensemble"
molecular dynamics approach, developed by the P.I. for polymer gels, will be
extended to clay studies. A connection is made between the molecular
microstructure and macroscopic behavior of the respective materials. While the
dynamic simulation research is performed at the University of Wisconsin
(Madison), the complementary experimental clay research is carried out at the
National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). This award will provide support
for travel between the two partners. This project was submitted in response to
the NSF-CONACyT Collaborative Research Opportunities Announcement (NSF 96-145).
A parallel proposal was submitted by UNAM to CONACyT, and an award was
recommended by CONACyT. The research has primary relevance to soil mechanics and
the stability of oil recovery wells.
