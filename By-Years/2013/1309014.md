Assessing how small mammals influence species composition of grassland
communities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Determining the factors that regulate plant
abundance and composition has been a long-standing endeavor for ecologists.
Traditionally, this issue has been examined with a ?bottom-up? perspective and
has focused primarily on the relative importance of environmental factors and
plant-plant interactions in structuring communities. Increasingly, however, we
know that ?top-down? factors can influence the recruitment into local plant
communities and can be key to dictating the ultimate structure of the resident
community. The proposed work will examine how generalist herbivores (ubiquitous
small mammals) influence recruitment and the ultimate composition of species and
traits within local plant communities. Specifically, the proposed study will
examine the effects of herbivory by voles and granivory by mice on recruitment
and establishment within coastal California grassland communities. The proposed
study will also identify to what extent herbivore activities influence the
composition of traits that influence competitive plant-plant interactions by
assessing trade-offs in trait composition within communities with different
productivities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research provides the Fellow
with diverse opportunities to develop as a researcher, mentor, and teacher. The
training objectives will include 1) enhancing technical and experimental skills
that will incorporate trophic interactions, 2) mentoring undergraduate and
graduate students, 3) expanding teaching experience, and 4) participating in
community outreach activities. This work will also generate a large trait
dataset that covers not only resource acquisition traits but also seed traits
for California grassland species that will be made available for other
researchers and for land managers at the Pepperwood Preserve, where the research
will be conducted.
