Large-scale distributed-memory machine designs represent a very attractive
possibility for low-cost massively-parallel computation power. This work
provides mathematical foundations of computing and computation theory by
developing new models for designing, structuring, and analyzing software for
such machines. The main objective of this research is to develop and refine
modeling methodologies for parallel/distributed computations. These techniques
will be based on the modeling and analysis capabilities of Extended Petri Nets
and Communicating Finite Automata. In addition to the well- known properties of
these modeling mechanisms, new properties of parallel computation behavior will
be investigated, primarily influenced by relevant analytical properties from the
field of control theory. This work forms a basis for new software development
methodologies for parallel computers. Most significant will be its impact on
improving the usability of the class of easy-to-build, but difficult-to-use,
non- shared memory MIMD systems.
