The proposed activity is targeted to present a very general regularization
framework. It enhances the processing of sets of signals and images using
variational techniques. The key idea is to exploit information from the entire
set for the regularization of each image. This is done via a non-parametric
variational approach.

This framework can improve image and signal processing techniques for many types
of data-sets. Sets which contain many repetitions of similar objects or patterns
are expected to gain considerable performance. Such data-sets are common in many
diverse fields. The new method is anticipated to have a significant contribution
in the analysis of medical images, the enhancement of aerial and satellite
imagery, and in processing biological signals and genetic data.
