Professor Ye will study evolution equations and applications to problems in
Riemannian geometry. In particular he will study the Ricci flow, the Yamabe
flow, and the harmonic mapping flow. The method of evolution equations has
become an important method for finding critical points of geometric functionals
and in understanding the dynamic structure of space. The evolution equations to
be studied in this research can be understood physically by imagining a
stretched rubber band immersed in a viscous fluid such as oil. The evolution
equation for this example then describes the way in which the rubber band
shrinks. The speed at which it shrinks at any point on the band is proportional
to how much the band is curved at that point. Since so many physical problems
involve deformation of curves or surfaces, the potential for application of this
research is substantial.
