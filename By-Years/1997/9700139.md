9700139 Veenstra This is an award to assist in the purchase of equipment for
conduct of research being conducted by seven co-investigators who are
investigating the fate of organic compounds when released into the biosphere and
concepts to decontaminate soil and to reduce or prevent environmental pollution
by production process changes and by treatment of process residuals. The
projects being conducted by co-investigators from the School of Civil and
Environmental Engineering and the School of Chemical Engineering include
development of a novel granular activated carbon regeneration process, use of
alternating current plasma reactors for treatment of volatile potential air
pollutants, biological treatment of soil contaminated by pollutants produced
during production of munitions, development of a biofiltration process for
treatment of gases containing potential air pollutants and development of a
process for manufacture of sulfolane to minimize production of environmental
pollutants. The proposal leading to this award, was submitted in response to NSF
93-155, Research Equipment Grant Program. This award will assist the seven co-
investigators involved in conducting research using equipment obtained with
assistance from this award to increase their competitiveness, efficiency and
output. The equipment will also enhance capabilities for education of graduate
and undergraduate students. ***
