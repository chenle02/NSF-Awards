The goal of this project is a determination of the three- dimensional structure
of the hydroxylase component of the enzyme methane monooxygenase (MMO, EC
1.14.13.25). MMO catalyzes the conversion of methane into methanol. High quality
crystals of MMO hydroxylase which diffract to 2 A resolution have been obtained.
The crystal structure will be solved using multiple isomorphous replacement
techniques. The resulting model will be refined used XPLOR and PROFFT to
maximize the agreement with the observed diffraction data. The refined structure
will be analyzed in light of continuing spectroscopic and kinetic analyses by
our collaborator, Dr. John Lipscomb, to provide a framework for understanding
how this enzyme functions. %%% Dr. Ohlendorf proposes to determine the structure
of the catalytic portion of methane monoxygnease (MMO) to understand to better
understand how it works. There are several reasons why this enzyme is being
studied. One is that MMO plays a key ecological role in recapturing of billions
of tons of the greenhouse gas, methane, into biomass. If this enzyme suddenly
disappeared from the face of the earth, all that methane would be released into
the atmosphere. Second, the reaction catalyzed by MMO is important in the
production of clean burning fuels. An understanding of how MMO functions could
assist in the design of improved catalysts for this process. Third, MMO produces
an extremely reactive species that is capable of inserting an oxygen into
virtually any C-H bond. The ability to control and modulate this activity has
tremendous potential in developing new processes for the synthesis and breakdown
of difficult molecules.
