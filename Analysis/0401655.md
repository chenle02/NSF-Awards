Dr. Lorenzo Sadun will analyze several problems on the topology and dynamics of
tiling spaces. One problem concerns computing the Cech cohomology groups of
tiling spaces. Another problem is to find criteria for when the natural
translation action on a substitution tiling space (or a deformation of such an
action) is topologically mixing. A third problem is to consider tilings of
hyperbolic space, where the natural group action is nonabelian and in that the
group is not amenable.

These problems are motivated by quasicrystals, a class of solids that are highly
ordered but are not crystals. Quasicrystals are modeled by aperiodic tilings,
and ergodic theory relates the bulk properties of a quasicrystal (such as its
ability to diffract light, its electrical conductance, and its rigidity) to
certain averages taken over a space of possible quasicrystals, or equivalently a
space of tilings. The better we understand the abstract mathematical properties
of tiling spaces, the better we understand the down-to-earth physical properties
of quasicrystals and of other materials.
