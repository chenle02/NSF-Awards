9455314 Walker Lecture room demonstration experiments, which actually show how
things work, are relatively new to computer science educators. In most other
fields of science, demonstrations have proven quite effective in combination
with a variety of teaching methods and have been successfully used for many
years. Such "live" demonstrations, especially for introductory classes, awaken a
keen interest in the "chalk and talk" lecture and tend to be remembered long
afterward. We believe that lecture room demonstrations need to be considered
seriously as a teaching aid for helping to revitalize introductory computer
science courses. The real problem is that very few instructional materials are
currently available on this subject. This project addresses the need to develop
computer science lecture room demonstration materials. More specifically, it
concentrates on development of eight innovative, low cost, computer-hardware-
related lecture room demonstration experiments to improve the computer literacy
course taken by non-computer science majors. These demonstrations help students
to better understand basic concepts of how computers operate and permits them to
see firsthand, a number of attention-grabbing, real-world applications. Students
learn that computers are used for more than just running software applications.
The demonstrations show students how computer and peripherals work; illustrate
aspects of telecommunications and networking; show actual business and
industrial applications; and present emerging computer related technologies such
as multimedia, hypermedia and virtual reality. Details of how to build and set
up the demonstration apparatus, teaching techniques, and results from classroom
trials are made readily available via pamphlets, presentation at workshops, and
the Internet. This project is expected to be of great interest and benefit to
all teachers of the computer literacy course.
