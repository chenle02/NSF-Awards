9520587 Tomozawa Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute will host the University
Conference on Glass Science on August 9-11, 1995. The theme of this meeting will
be Optical and Electrical Properties of Glasses a topic of both scientific and
technological importance in the area ranging from optical communications to
electric batteries. Outstanding scientists in the field will deliver the invited
talks. The topics included are; ionic conduction and transport, dielectric
properties, optical and nonlinear optical phenomenon and wide coverage on the
synthesis of glasses by various methods. %%% This conference provides a forum
for participants to assess critical scientific issues and plan future research
directions in glass science and technology in materials of importance to optical
science and engineering. Furthermore, it presents an excellent opportunity for
students to enhance their knowledge of the field, and meet international experts
in this high technology area. ***
