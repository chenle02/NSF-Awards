This proposal requests funds for student travel to the Programming Language
Design and Implementation (PLDI) conference in Dublin, Ireland. This is an
important conference for students in the programming language research area.
Student attendance provides an international experience for the students and
helps build a community that will become the next generation of global
researchers.
