Award #0139398 Tarokh, Vahid

Dr. Vahid Tarokh, a recognized leader in the research field of wireless
communications, will receive the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Alan T.
Warterman award for his work as the primary inventor of "space time coding", a
new technique that significantly improves the speed and reliability of wireless
data transmission.

These innovations helped form international standards for the latest cell
phones, personal digital assistants and other wireless devices. By some
estimates, more than one billion handsets might be employing the space-time
codes within five years.
