EAR-0132629&lt;br/&gt;Young&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this study, researchers at
UCLA will develop further the new method of laser ablation sampling of rock
materials for analysis by multiple collector inductively coupled plasma-source
mass spectrometry (MC-ICPMS). The new technology will permit researchers to use
the isotopes of important and abundant rock-forming elements like magnesium,
silicon, and iron as a means to discover the physical and chemical processes
that affected rocks from a spectrum of environments. These environments include
the ocean floor, the insides of asteroids, and the deep sources of volcanoes.
Results will be used to elucidate details about a variety of phenomena related
to the formation and subsequent evolution of the Earth. Questions that will be
addressed using the new technique include: how flowing water heated from
undersea volcanoes affects the chemistry of Earth's crust; how rocks formed from
gas and dust in the early solar system and how this process gave rise to rocky
planets and satellites with large amounts of water, including Earth; the
timescales of events leading to active volcanism on Earth; and the ways in which
isotopes can be used to distinguish biological from non-biological chemical
processes in rocks and in the atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;
