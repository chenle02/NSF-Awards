Vision involves capturing the energy of light by photopigment molecules in the
eye; these photopigments are incorporated into elaborate membrane structures
within photoreceptor cells. These membranes often show high rates of turnover
during time, and the mechanisms remain unclear for how these organized
membranes, incorporating high amounts of photopigment proteins, are formed and
regulated. This project uses as a model system the compound eye of an insect,
the moth Manduca. This organism is already a model for developmental and
physiological studies. The pathway and regulation of membrane assembly and
photopigment insertion can be separated experimentally. Ultrastructural,
biochemical, immunocytochemical, and electrophysiological techniques will be
used for examining the mechanisms and significance of turnover in this nocturnal
insect with a complex visual system. This Research in Undergraduate Institutions
(RUI) project with a novel approach will have an impact on visual science, and
also will be important for its impact on training undergraduates in modern
neuroscience.
