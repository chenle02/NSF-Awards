This action funds Scott N. Schiffres of Carnegie Mellon University to conduct a
research project, entitled "Nano-sized particles to enhance heat transfer in
melting-freezing with applications to solar thermal energy storage," during the
summer of 2012 at the University of Tokyo in Hongo, Tokyo, Japan. The host
scientists are Shigeo Maruyama and Junichiro Shiomi.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in the study of how nano-
sized particles, such as carbon nanotubes and graphene, influence thermal
conductivity in materials undergoing phase-change. A metal coated fiber 3-omega
technique is being used to characterize thermal conductivity of the phase-change
material with nano-sized particles in addition to characertizing other aspects
of the nano-sized particle suspension. One application of this research is to
understand how nano-particles may enhance heat transfer during melting and
freezing, allowing for enhanced thermal storage and reduced energy usage.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
