This grant will provide superior instrumentation to educate technicians for
emerging high technology biology-based careers in the manufacturing and
production phase of the biotechnology industry. The Biotechnology Associate in
Science degree, certificate and industry specific training programs offered by
the NH Technical Colleges/Institute are the only programs in the state that will
train technicians for entry level employment into the biotechnology industry and
for further education at four year colleges in New Hampshire and other states.
The contextual learning that takes place in the cornerstone courses,
Biotechnology Experience I and II, will produce technicians that know how to
function in the biotechnology industry. The interactive multimedia teaching and
independent student learning laboratory will facilitate the teaching and
learning of conceptually difficult aspects of the practice of biotechnology. The
resource center created by the very existence of the biotechnology facility
located at NH Technical College at Pease will connect students, educators,
government and bioindustry representatives interested in the development of New
Hampshire's and New England's biotechnology industry and will help to nurture a
seamless infrastructure which will provide multiple entrances into and exits
from education and jobs in biotechnology.
