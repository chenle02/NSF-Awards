In this project supported by the Chemical Structure, Mechanisms and Dynamics
Program, Professor John Fourkas of the University of Maryland and his research
group will develop a technique called parametrically amplified vibrational sum
frequency generation (PAVSFG) for the study of the structure and dynamics of
surfaces and interfaces. PAVSFG is an advanced version of conventional sum
frequency generation spectroscopy, which is based on a second order nonlinear
optical (NLO) process in which two low energy photons combine at a surface or
interface to produce a high energy photon. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since second
order NLO processes are very weak in intensity, the parametric amplification
process developed in the Fourkas lab will have positive consequences for a wide
range of surface and interfacial science investigations, including biological
membranes and catalyst surfaces. This project will also be the vehicle for
training students and post-doctoral researchers in cutting-edge optical physics
and physical chemistry.
