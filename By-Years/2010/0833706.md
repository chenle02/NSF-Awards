ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;DRL 0833706&lt;br/&gt;PI: Gerald
Knezek&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Northern Texas&lt;br/&gt;Title:
M-SOS-W: Middle Schoolers out to Save the World&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this
project, approximately 600 sixth graders from seven middle schools in Louisiana,
Maine, Texas and Vermont are monitoring home energy use under supervision of
their (11) teachers. The data are being used to develop optimum scenarios for
conserving energy and reducing production of greenhouses gases in local
communities. The teachers are receiving professional development to carry out
the project. Students and teachers are using online software tools to record and
analyze their data and create projections of future energy use based on
assumptions of policy changes. They are communicating their results within the
project via information communication technology. Research is being conducted on
the effects of the project on students' and teachers' changes of attitudes and
interests in science, and in students' gains in science content knowledge
through comparisons with matched, untreated schools.
