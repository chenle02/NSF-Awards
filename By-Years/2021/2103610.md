The broader impact /commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development a safe way to reduce aflatoxin contamination in food. Aflatoxin
contamination is a risk to human and livestock health. The World Health
Organization estimates that 25 percent or more of the worldâ€™s crops are
destroyed by aflatoxin contamination annually. The proposed technology would
support food security, help to reduce hunger worldwide, and improve quality of
life by providing increased quantities of safe food. The technology would allow
for crops to not be wasted, enabling economic benefits. In addition, this
environmentally friendly method has the potential to reduce or replace fungicide
and pesticide use, further benefitting the
environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the
development of nanotechnology that has been shown to significantly reduce fungal
aflatoxin biosynthesis and excretion, using very low concentrations of
manufactured silver nanoparticles (NPs). Research has shown that the reduced
toxin production is not due to the silver ion but rather by transcriptome-level
changes in the fungi based on reduced production of reactive oxygen species
after exposure to the NP. Nano-fungal interactions also may be regulated based
on the optimization of NP physico-chemical properties, and both size and coating
of the NPs have been shown to have a significant effect. This regulation may
allow for silver NPs to inhibit aflatoxin production by fungi responsible for
grain, fruit and vegetable spoilage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
