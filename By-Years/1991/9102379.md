Research in a procedure for evaluation of structural condition from passive
monitoring of response to ambient loadings is proposed. The condition monitoring
procedure is fully automated, can interface directly with computer-based
structural maintenance and management systems, and can provide condition
information of a quality and frequency adequate to support an aggressive,
proactive maintenance program for structures. Aggressive maintenance can
minimize repair costs and interruptions of service in important structures. A
database of dynamic strain records obtained in a separate testing program
conducted at the university of Colorado involving thirty highway bridges of
various spans and construction is available as input to the condition monitoring
procedure. With these records a quick and economical evaluation of the condition
monitoring method is possible.
