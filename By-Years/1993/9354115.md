9354115 Garibaldi Xavier University intends to develop a strategic plan that
would identify: o the major enhancements or restructuring required in the
applicable Science, Engineering and Mathematics (SEM) disciplines of the
university, and o the strategies required to overcome the specified
deficiencies. Each of these efforts will be undertaken with the ultimate goal of
achieving those results that will project the university into the future as a
model institution of excellence in the selected SEM disciplines and as a
significant contributor to the production of young scientists and engineers. The
SEM disciplines of interest in this project will include Biology, Chemistry,
Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics and the Dual Degree Engineering Program.
