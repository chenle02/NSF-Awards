This ethnographic study examines refugee tech initiatives with a focus on the
actors involved in developing, deploying, and making use of various apps and
digital platforms that address the challenges facing displaced people. The goal
is to understand "tech-for-good" as an endeavor by empirically engaging with the
ethical imaginaries and practices of the people developing and deploying such
technologies in the context of transnational migration. In the wake of scandals
and lawsuits against big tech companies, there is a broad recognition that high
tech does not necessarily equal progress and positive change thus it is
imperative to understand alternative technical imaginaries and ethical practices
explored in this study. This project's results will provide valuable insights
into different technical imaginaries for future technologists. Data will be made
publicly available through the Platform for Experimental and Collaborative
Ethnography, an online data-sharing platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More
specifically, the project focuses on the following research questions: What
different ethical imaginaries undergird "tech-for-good" initiatives in the
context of migration and displacement? How are ethical relations practiced by
different actors in the development, launch, rollout, and continued deployment
of "tech-for-good" initiatives? The researchers will address these questions by
analyzing the media and promotional materials, as well as the digital artifacts
themselves, alongside an ethnography that observes the practices as well as
interviews that probe the ethical imaginaries that underlie actorsâ€™ "tech-for-
good" initiatives. By attending to such initiatives in precarious and
transnational spaces (rather than Silicon Valley companies or similarly elite
tech spaces), the project will explore different ways "tech-for-good"
practitioners develop and critically evaluate technical possibilities and hereby
contribute to our understanding of the ethics of technology in
practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
