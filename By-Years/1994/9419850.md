9419850 Kingsolver Some insect species accumulate distasteful or toxic chemicals
to deter potential predators, while others rely on speed or manuverability to
escape. Palatable and distasteful butterfly species tend to differ in body and
wing shape, flight speed and flight manuverability, but it is unclear how these
characters are interrelated and how they affect vulnerability to predation. This
research will use experimental manipulations of the distribution of body weight
to test hypotheses about how body weight and body shape determines flight and
survival under lab and field conditions in both palatable and unpalatable
butterflies. One of the study species is an important agricultural pest. The
research will provide an experimental case study of the targets and mechanisms
of natural selection that operate on flight and dispersal in insects.
