DMS-9510336 Steinbart Steinbart will investigate the solutions to differential
equations in the complex plane having entire functions as coefficients. In
particular, she will study the growth properties of such solutions in the case
when one of the coefficients is transcendental. This award is a planning grant
that will allow the PI to further develop her independent research program and
to develop a competitive NSF grant proposal. It will provide funds to support
her participation in the XVI Rolf Nevalinna Colloquium, an international
conference specializing in complex analysis and related topics.
