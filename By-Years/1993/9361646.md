9361646 Lei The proposed will develop an injection laser capable of emitting
coherent radiation in the spectral range from the blue to the ultraviolet. A
wide bandgap semiconductor will be provided with an asymmetric barrier that will
permit injection of minority carriers while blocking the extraction of majority
carriers, thus establishing the necessary population inversion. To make this
light emitter into an injection laser, the device can be provided with either a
Fabry-perot cavity or a superlattice that forms a distributed feedback grating.
A simple structure will be made to demonstrate that efficient minority carrier
injection can be obtained with resultant emission of short wavelengths. Then the
final structure will be designed and the limits of performance will be
calculated; obtainable wavelength range, expected efficiency, power handling
capability, and far-field pattern. ***
