Formal modeling and verification technology has made significant advances in the
last two decades. Techniques like model checking and theorem proving are now
used in both the hardware and software industries. Formal techniques are also
increasingly being used in scientific modeling, as for example in systems
biology and in the engineering of complex cyber-physical systems. The biggest
challenge facing this technology is the lack of trained users and developers of
this technology. To address this gap, we started the Summer School in Formal
Techniques. The first such school was held in the Summer of 2011 at Menlo
College in Atherton, California, with support from the National Science
Foundation and SRI International. The school attracted 80 participants with a
diverse range of interests and backgrounds. The lectures were rigorous and
covered the spectrum of formal techniques including static analysis, model
checking, theorem proving, invariant generation, compositional verification, and
systems biology. The second edition of the school builds on the success of the
first one to develop a well-knit community of young researchers with a deep
interest in formal methods.
