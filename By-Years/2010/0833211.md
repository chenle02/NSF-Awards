The Tropical Conservation Biology and Environmental Science (TCBES) Program
proposes to establish a CREST Center in Tropical Ecology and Evolution in Marine
and Terrestrial Environments at the University of Hawaii, Hilo. The goal of the
TCBES Program is to become a highly collaborative research center in tropical
conservation biology and environmental sciences in Hawaii. The center will
facilitate three research themes: 1) The Evolutionary Genomics and Ecology of
Local Adaptation and Speciation (EGES), 2) Coral Reef Ecosystem (CRE) 3)
Terrestrial Ecology and Climate Change (TECC). The TCBES Program is an integral
component in the transformation of the sciences at the University of Hawaii at
Hilo (UH Hilo) and Hawaii Community College (HCC). The TCBES Program mission is
to promote: 1) a research center of excellence of national importance in
conservation biology and environmental sciences in the marine and terrestrial
environments, 2) the training of graduate, undergraduate, and post-doctoral
students in these fields, and 3) the further development of collaborations with
federal and state agencies in Hawaii and with faculty at Ph.D.-granting
institutions. The NSF CREST Program will build on the current strengths of the
TCBES Program. These include a) Hawaii?s outstanding natural laboratory
featuring a tremendous diversity of habitats, endemic species, and endangered
species, b) an integrated research and education program that is building the
STEM pipeline for students in Hawaii from K-12 through to undergraduate and
graduate programs, and c) strong partnerships with federal and state agencies in
Hawaii.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
