This research will study the detailed source processes of the Loma Prieta
earthquake using a combined teleseismic data set including teleseismic broad-
band and short-period body waves and strong motion data near the source. To
simulate the highest frequency energy radiated by the mainshock, the research
will include the analysis of aftershocks used as empirical Green's functions. By
means of this technique, details of the main shock rupture surface will be
mapped. This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction
Program.
