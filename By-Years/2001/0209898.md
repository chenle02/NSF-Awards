Daniel G. Nocera and Moungi G. Bawendi of MIT and Manoochehr M. Koochesfahani of
Michigan State University are jointly supported by the Division of Chemistry,
the Division of Chemical Transport Systems and the Office of Multidisciplinary
Activities of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate for their
interdisciplinary collaboration on new molecule-based optical diagnostic
techniques to measure flow on small spatial scales. They will use newly
synthesized fluorescent tracers based on caged laser dye molecules and
nanocrystalline quantum dots to image flows at speeds of less than 1 mm/s. New
optical techniques will be developed for the quantitative measurement of
multivariable flow properties (e.g., flow velocity field, temperature,
concentration) and transport in small dimensions. The diagnostics will
interrogate important fundamental principles of flows in microchannels including
transport to within 50-150 nm of surfaces. Understanding the flow behavior in
microchannels is a key step in the development of active flow and mixing control
on small spatial length scales. These principles defined from these flow studies
will be incorporated in microchannels that contain Distributed Feedback (DFB)
lasers as optical sensor elements. The integration of flow control and mixing
with DFB architectures may lead to unprecedented analytical sensitivity on
exquisitely small length scales. These principles are the underpinning of many
emerging microdevice technologies, especially microsensors and microreactors.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collaborative Research in Chemistry (CRC) awards are given
to interdisciplinary teams of scientists working on problems of broad chemical
interest. The emphasis in these awards is on new collaborative modes of research
and training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
