The objective of this project is to further develop a new technology based on
the directed modification of bacterial surfaces. The properties of cellular
surfaces are determined to a large extent by the presence of externally exposed
receptors and enzymes. Until now, it has not been possible to localize proteins
on the bacterial surface. Recently, the Principal Investigators (PIs) have
demonstrated that enzymatically active recombinant proteins can be anchored on
the surface of E. coli and other gram negative bacteria. This opens the way for
numerous biotechnology applications including: (i) Generation of inexpensive
cellular adsorbents consisting of cells coated with recombinant receptors; (ii)
Production of new microbial biocatalysts consisting of cells expressing surface
anchored enzymes for use in lieu of immobilized enzyme particles; and (iii)
Development of bacterial analogues of the mammalian immune system suitable for
the selection of antibodies with desired properties.
