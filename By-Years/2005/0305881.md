The objective of this research is on developing a new concept and foundation for
efficient one-step preimage computation for sets of states in large sequential
circuits based on novel automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) techniques,
where current &lt;br/&gt;binary-decision-diagram (BDD)-based approaches fail.
This is by taking the advantage that ATPG engines are not vulnerable to the
space explosion problem, and thus the ATPG-based techniques can be applicable to
very large designs. However, computation of preimages will stretch ATPGs in a
way that they were not required before - they must&lt;br/&gt;return all
solutions instead of merely one solution. In other words, even though the state-
of-the-art ATPGs are efficient in finding one solution, simply making them
continue to search all other solutions will result in temporal explosion, in
which exponential time will be required to compute the complete preimage. To
remedy this problem, a new ATPG algorithm that intelligently prunes the
redundant search spaces due to overlapping solutions is needed. In doing so,
this new approach can significantly accelerate the search for all solutions
necessary for preimage computation. Once the building block for preimage
computation can be efficiently performed, it can naturally be plugged into
formal model checking and equivalence checking engines for large sequential
systems. This research addresses the following relevant issues: (a)
identification of previously explored spaces that contain solutions; (b) pruning
of the spaces that only contain conflicts; (c) combination of multiple solutions
in a compact form; and (d) iteration of the &lt;br/&gt;computation process to
obtain preimage for multiple cycles. As this research brings about a new
approach via which implicit state-space traversal can be performed, it offers an
entirely new and effective dimension to the design verification arena for
verifying large and complex sequential systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
