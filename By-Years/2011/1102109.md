The objective of this program is to demonstrate current injection, continues-
wave lasing action at room temperature from sub-wavelength-scale disk resonators
by developing high-quality modes in the proximity of low-loss conductive media
and provide CMOS-compatible buildings blocks based on nanocavities that require
current injection and electric field application. The developed nano-resonators
will also be used as external nano-modulators.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit is in developing practical, planar
nanolasers that is smaller than one wavelength of lasing mode in vacuum. A
challenge to build current injection nanolasers arises from the difficulty of
suppressing absorption of light by electrode metal. The PI?s approach to build
sub-wavelength-scale current-injection nanolasers is to use simple, high-Q disk
nanocavity designs with transparent conductive oxide (TCO) electrodes such as
indium tin oxide (ITO). The PI?s designs with TCO media have advantages,
including large thermal conductance, small electric resistance, and large
quantum efficiency via the direct current injection to small lasing modes.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are in inducing the development of on-
chip photonics systems, such as optical interconnect chips, lab-on-chip, quantum
information chips, imaging devices, and data storage chips, via the development
of breakthrough technology in nanolasers. The electrically-controlled light
localization technology would break the boundary set by present light
localization technology and open up possibilities of creating new light
localization devices and enhance the performance and functionality of optical
devices. The program will provide excellent outreach opportunities by creating
online, hands-on, free scientific curriculums.
