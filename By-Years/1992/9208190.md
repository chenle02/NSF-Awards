The underlying theme of this mathematical research is the analysis of solutions
of nonlinear partial differential equations, particularly in conservative
evolution equations that arise in mathematical physics and in fluid dynamics.
Emphasis will be on the study of the existence question for classes of
equations, in particular, the existence of periodic solutions, and the study of
a priori regularity and other properties of the evolution. The work is limited
to three objectives. First, in the area of infinite dimensional dynamical
systems and KAM theory, continuing research will be done in extending techniques
of Hamiltonian perturbation applied to the wave equation to other equations and
to investigate methods related to studies in higher space dimensions. The second
direction involves smoothing properties of dispersive equations. It has been
known for some time that solutions of dispersive evolution equations can be
smoother than their initial conditions. But their quadratic norms can grow
unbounded without cut-off restrictions in spatial directions. Work will be done
to isolate the parts of the equations which contribute to the growth and try to
develop estimates on the norm size. The final part of the project studies waves
in free surfaces and interfaces. The problem, known as Stokes conjecture,
concerns the solitary wave of extremal form. Such waves are known to be analytic
except at their crest. It is the object of this study to show (i) that a
Lipschitz singularity of interior angle 120 degrees must occur at the crest and
(ii) that the extremal wave profile is monotone decreasing and convex on either
side. Partial differential equations form the backbone of mathematical modeling
in the physical sciences. Phenomena which involve continuous change such as that
seen in motion, materials and energy are known to obey certain general laws
expressible in terms of the interactions and relationships between partial
derivatives. The key role of mathematics is not to state the relationships, but
rather, to extract qualitative and quantitative meaning from them.
