9453862 Smith The District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) Mathematics,
Science and Technology Initiative seeks to provide the mathematics and science
fundamentals which will permit all students to participate fully in a
technological society and to enable a significantly greater number of these
students to pursue careers in mathematics, science, engineering or technology.
To reach these goals, DCPS proposes to carry out a four part program to: (1)
produce and implement a national-standards-based mathematics, science and
technology (MST) K-12 curriculum; (2) establish an extensive professional
development program for teachers and administrators to change the culture of the
classroom by use of exciting, hands-on student-centered instruction; (3)
establish demonstration schools at each educational level to be used for
constant refinement and dissemination of "best practices' in MST education; and
(4) link community organizations, science-rich institutions and other partners
with the DCPS in support of K-12 MST education. The reform will be coordinated
by the District's Center for Systemic Educational Change, through its MST
Resource Team which is led by the Deputy Superintendent, DCPS. ***
