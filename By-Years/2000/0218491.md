Many computational problems of practical interest can be posed in terms of
search. Examples include discrete optimization problem that arise naturally in
many areas of science, engineering and business. The development of a robust
network infrastructure coupled with the advent of reasonably-priced computing
equipment has helped focus attention on techniques that use multiple processors
operating in parallel to improve search performance. Our research focuses on the
design, development, implementation and evaluation of scalable, fault-tolerant,
distributed search technique and their application, generally in concert with
other optimization techniques, to construct hybrid optimization systems.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much of the work described here relies on a unique
underlying parallelization paradigm of our own design called nagging. It
contrast to more traditional problem partitioning techniques, nagging plays
mutiple reformations of a problem --- or portions of a problem --- against each
other to improve performance. We will improve and refine our understanding of
nagging, including research on adaptive strategies for combining nagging and
partitioning strategies; to improve and refine our distributed search
infrastructure, including, for example, the use of cryptographic protocols to
support authentication and distribution of new applications across management
boundaries; and to continue our interdisciplinary collaborative efforts to apply
distributed search concert with other optimization techniques to scientific
computing problems. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
