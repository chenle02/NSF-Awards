9400413 Maxwell The American Mathematical Society requests a grant in the amount
of $20,000 for participant support of the first quadrennial John von Neumann
Symposium, to be held in the summer of 1994. The supplemental funding from the
NSF will be used t support travel and Nonlinear Wave Equations", was selected by
the 1993 AMS Committee on Summer Institutes and Special Symposia. The Symposium
will provide the opportunity for cross-fertilization between the classical
theory of nonlinear wave equations on the one hand and operator algebra on the
other. This is most appropriate given von Neumann's deep and central interest in
the relation between operator algebra and quantum mechanics and the announced
goal of the Symposium to treat topics of emerging significance that are likely
to underlie future mathematical development. Members of the Organizing Committee
for the 1994 von Neumann Symposium are: Haim Brezia (co-chair), Irving Segal
(co- chair), William Arveson, Robert Blattner and Thomas Branson. The 1994 John
von Neumann Symposium will be held during a one week period in June, 1994, in
the greater Boston area.
