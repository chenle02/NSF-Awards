This research develops a data set of postings on Craigslist during the mid-
November to late December 2010 time period. The purpose of the data set is to
support subsequent analysis for evidence of "scams" -- fraudulent postings. The
dataset will provide a basis for testing algorithms for automatic scam
identification. Such scams are expected to be most common during the high volume
period targeted for collection.
