0853618&lt;br/&gt;Chen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is for the development
and characterization of a capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT)
array with IR light delivery for use in real-time 3D photoacoustic imaging (PAI)
of the brain. The proposed "photoacoustic flashlight" would enable high
resolution anatomical imaging of the neuovasculature, and functional imaging
based on changes in oxygenated hemoglobin, which is the primary absorber of IR
light in the brain. It also holds potential for molecular imaging, which would
require the introduction of optical contrast agents. In this device, a light
source implemented using optical fiber delivery and lens focusing provides
pulsed optical energy that illuminates the target tissue and stimulates a
thermoelastic-based acoustic signal. An array of micro-capacitor sensing
elements with suspended electrode membranes detect the radiated acoustic wave
via change in capacitance due to the deformation of the membranes. The research
objectives include evaluation of different designs for integrating light with
CMUT sensing elements, characterization of prototype PAI-compatible CMUT arrays,
development of board-level parallel beamforming for real-time PAI, and
evaluation of prototype CMUT devices in phantoms, nerve bundles and rat brain.
