This proposal seeks to elucidate the coarsening effects in miscibility-gap
alloy solidification owing to thin-film effects. The NSF funding sought will
support the experimental phase of a joint experimental/analytical investigation
where the analytical part is being supported by NASA. In the experimental study,
the directional solidification of the succinonitrile-camphene system via video
imaging through a transparent cell utilizing a gradient stage microscope
facility will be done. This will provide important information on the repulsion
and capture of ultra-fine particles and droplets by advancing solidification
fronts. Utilizing a Rame-Hart pendant drop apparatus, component interfacial
tensions will be measured. The data obtained will be used to validate the
analytical model being developed under NASA funding. In particular, validation
will hinge on predictions of the critical droplet size with measurements of the
largest droplets rejected by the advancing solidification front determined from
the video imaging data. This work will provide the first experimental data for
droplet rejection in directional solidification. All prior studies involved
solid particle rejection.
