The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development, design, and optimization of
new materials in the absence of gravity. The current approach to in-space
manufacturing is primarily trial-and-error. The proposed technology will advance
a systematic approach to in-space manufacturing, enabling the development of new
materials with better properties and cost-competitive associated infrastructure.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will advance the translation of material development in zero-G
environments. Chemical formulations of known materials may be unstable under the
effect of body forces, but the mechanisms through which these forces impact the
phase diagram remain unknown. This project will integrate experimental,
computational, and machine learning techniques to identify material formulations
amenable to zero-G manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
