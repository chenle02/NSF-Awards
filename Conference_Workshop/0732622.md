The Young Mathematicans Conference is an opportunity for students involved in
REU programs to present their research results in talks and posters
presentations and discuss mathematics with their peers from all over the
country. Approximately 70 students are invited to report on about 50 projects.
In addition the conference invites around a dozen mentors to exchange ideas and
experiences in supervising undergraduate research. Highlights of every
conference are three plenary lectures by highly accomplished researchers and
teachers, who introduce students to advanced, innovative, and exciting topics in
mathematics. The YMC conference series was started in 2003 and has taken place
during a week-end in August in every year since then.
