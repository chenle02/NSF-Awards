Structural biology is fundamental to the advancement of basic biomedical science
and diffraction methods provide the most definitive structural information. New
crystal structures of biological macromolecules are now being determined
routinely at a very high rate; new techniques, for example those based on novel
detectors, synchrotron sources, or diffuse scattering, continue to be
introduced; and the advent of protein engineering has lately facilitated the
difficult step of extracting mechanism from structure and re-emphasized the
connection between the structural and informational aspects of molecular
biology. Discussion of these results and of continuing developments in
methodology is important to the progress of the field. The Gordon Conference on
Diffraction Methods in Molecular Biology is the premier forum for such
discussion.
