Biochemical engineering research is conducted in two areas: tissue-culture
reactors and separation of biologicals by preparative high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC). Large-scale cultivation of normal mammalian cells is of
importance to the production of very high value biologicals such as vaccines,
plasminogen activators, hormones and various polypeptides. Also underway is the
design and evaluation of the performance of a 5-liter tissue-culture reactor
with a perfusion system using conventional and "liquid" microcarriers. In the
area of bioseparators, this research effort is aiming to contribute to the
design and scale-up of HPLC columns by providing a systematic approach in the
evaluation of various columns and operations with respect to their protein
separation capabilities.
