The journal of Chemical Education is initiating a monthly feature column devoted
to undergraduate chemical education projects funded by the National Science
foundation. Three columns annually contain announcements of awards in the
Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement, Undergraduate Course and Curriculum,
and Undergraduate Faculty Enhancement Programs. The remaining nine monthly
columns will feature 2-3 exemplary projects which are either in progress or
recently completed.
