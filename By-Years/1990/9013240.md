This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing work of Dr.
Philip B. Shevlin at Auburn University, who is investigating the chemical
reactions of single carbon atoms. This work will provide new insights into the
nature of an unusual class of chemical intermediates having simple molecular
structures but very high reactivity. The experiments that will be carried out by
Professor Shevlin will focus on the abstraction by atomic carbon of single atoms
from hydrocarbons and halocarbons to generate the corresponding monovalent
methylidynes, C-H and C-X. The reactions of methylidynes with arenes and
aromatics having small fused rings will be used to study and characterize this
little-understood class of intermediates. The large exothermicity of bond
formation to atomic carbon will be employed in oxygen abstraction reactions of
oxygenated organic compounds to form carbon monoxide and novel, high energy
intermediates.
