Present database systems process all the data related to a query before giving
out responses. As a result, the size of the data to be processed becomes
excessive for time-constrained (and, perhaps, realtime) database application
environments. For example, for Scientific database applications, data gathering
and analysis capabilities can be greatly enhanced if there are real- time/online
querying capabilities that return approximate responses to check the quality of
the generated scienctific data. Also, with real-time/online "on-the-fly" data
analysis (querying) capabilities, the size of the stored data in scientific
databases can be kept small and, thus, manageable. Similar problems occur in
time-constrained manufacturing database applications. A new methodology is
needed to cut down systematically the time to process the data involved in
processing the query. To this end, one can use data samples and utilize
statistical approximation to construct an approximate response to given query.
In this research, a methodology will be developed for the construction of
approximate query responses for databases under time (and/or accuracy)
constraints, and with incomplete data.
