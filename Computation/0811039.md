Many physical processes of great importance to science and technology require
numerical methods that couple modeling of the interactions of individual atoms
in small regions with modeling of the interactions among larger sets of atoms
(continuum models) in the remaining regions. An important example is crack
growth, where practical predictive models require the accuracy of the detailed
interaction of the atoms in a small region near the crack tip, along with the
efficiency of continuum modeling in the larger surrounding material.

Although the greatest accuracy could be achieved by a computer simulation of the
interactions of all of the atoms in the material, the large number of atoms in
the material makes this approach infeasible for even the fastest computers. The
quasicontinuum method can make possible such simulations without sacrificing the
accuracy needed for reliable prediction by coupling an atomistic model in the
neighborhood of the crack tip with a continuum model in the surrounding
material. The continuum model achieves the desired accuracy with a major
reduction in computational work by replacing the large numbers of atoms in
selected regions with representative atoms.

The principal investigator proposes to develop analysis and adaptive algorithms
for quasicontinuum methods that will ensure their reliability and improve their
efficiency. Theory and rigorous numerical experiments will be developed to
determine the most accurate and efficient atomistic-continuum coupling. The
development of the quasicontinuum method has the potential to facilitate the
design of new materials better able to resist failure and having other
properties important for science and technology.
