Peter Pulay and Amy Apon of the University of Arkansas are supported by the
Chemistry Division through the Information Technology Research program in a
collaborative effort between theoretical chemistry and computer science. They
will develop quantum chemical methods and the supporting cluster software
necessary for efficient execution on low-cost parallel hardware. The first
effort in this project is the development of a computer program for correlated
electronic structure calculations for large molecules on parallel computers. The
second effort is the development of fault-tolerant parallel file system tools
for large-scale scientific calculations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
impacts of this work include production of general-purpose tools for optimizing
file and disk access for a variety of long-running large scale applications on
low-cost parallel architectures.
