9506730 Plank This project is an experimental study of the behavior of sediments
in subduction zones. A major question to be addressed is whether sediments melt
or dehydrate beneath arc volcanoes. Another goal is to determine rock/melt and
rock/fluid distribution coefficients for important element tracers that can be
used in quantitative models. The proposed research will involve high pressure
and high temperature laboratory experiments on natural pelitic samples and on
metapelites. The chemical compositions of aqueous solutes, melts and residual
solid run products will be measured using a new experimental design derived from
recent advances in experimental petrology combined with ultrasensitive
analytical tools. The data collected should generate further insights into (a)
the role of subducted sedimentary material in arc petrogenesis, and (2) the
efficiency of crustal recycling throughout Earth history, and (3) the thermal
structure of subducting slabs.
