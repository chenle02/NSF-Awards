This project seeks to advance the state of the art as it relates to modeling and
evaluating coupled unsaturated flow in waste containment systems. Such systems
are vital to securing nuclear, hazardous and municipal waste throughout the
country. If successful, the new models will address behavior that is currently
unaccounted for and approximated with physically inaccurate simplifications. The
collaboration strategically leverages the strengths at each institution to
address experimental and theoretical objectives.

The goal of this research is to evaluate the existence and significance of
chemico-osmosis and membrane behavior in unsaturated clays. A collaborative
experimental and theoretical approach will be employed to achieve this goal. The
overall objectives are: (1) to develop and evaluate an innovative apparatus for
measuring membrane behavior and quantifying coupled fluid and chemical transport
in unsaturated clays; (2) to clarify the direct and coupled driving forces
governing fluid and chemical fluxes; (3) to measure governing parameters on
unsaturated soils under conditions representing practical problems; (4) to
develop a model for solute transport under unsaturated conditions that
incorporates membrane behavior, and (5) to quantify the importance of coupling
as a function of the degree of saturation and solute concentration in soils
typical of barrier materials.
