This grant provides funding for the development of simple, efficient, and near-
optimal approximation algorithms for perishable stochastic inventory systems.
Perishable products, such as fresh food, pharmaceuticals, and blood banks are
ubiquitous and an indispensable part of our society, and spoilage and outdating
represent a major threat to the profitability of companies such as grocery
retailers. Thus, finding effective inventory management policies for perishable
products is of significant importance. However, the analysis of dynamic
perishable inventory systems is notoriously difficult in both theory and
computation due to the high-dimensional nature. Indeed, the optimal control
policies are very complex even in the case of independent and identically
distributed demands, and the computation of optimal policies using dynamic
program is in general intractable due to the "curse-of-dimensionality." The
models studied allow general non-stationary and correlated demand processes,
capturing the seasonality nature of the economy, and the approximation
algorithms developed admit theoretical worst-case performance guarantees.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will lead to
efficient tools for inventory managers to effectively incorporate demand
forecast, such as advance demand information (ADI), martingale models of
forecast evolution (MMFE), autoregressive moving average (ARMA) demand models,
and Markov modulated demand process (MMDP), in making inventory replenishment
decisions for perishable inventory systems. It will allow inventory managers to
make use of available and reliable data, such as forecast updating, for
inventory planning. The research will advance the science of stochastic
inventory systems and provide deeper understanding of the subject area. The
outcome of the project will help firms reduce waste, increase revenue, and even
save lives (e.g., in blood bank applications).
