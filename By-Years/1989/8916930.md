It is commonly accepted that shallow crystallization and degassing of silicic
magmas contribute to the potential explosivity of a volcanic eruption, but the
rates at which such processes operate in natural systems are unknown. The recent
eruption of Mount St. Helens involved both explosive and non- explosive (dome-
building) episodes that have followed a pattern of decreasing intensity and
decreasing time-averaged magma production rates from 1980 through 1986; this
trend has been interpreted to be the result of progressive of a single batch of
dacite magma (e.g. Scandone and Malone, 1985). This project is for a detailed
textural and chemical study of the products of the 1980 explosive eruptions of
Mount St. Helens volcano with the goal of 1) using changes in glass chemistry
and groundmass crystallinity together with stratigraphic work on deposits of May
18, 1980 (provided by Criswell, 1987) to assemble a pre-eruption stratigraphy of
the Mount St. Helens magmatic system. 2) quantifying observed groundmass changes
through the summer of 1980 to determine rates of crystallization in response to
system degassing and depressurization, and 3) relating measured crystallinity
and bulk chemistry to physical changes in eruptive style of the volcano; in
particular, relating these parameters to observed patterns of degassing and
changes in eruption rate and intensity. Proposed methods of study including not
only detailed microprobe, BASEM and TEM analysis, but also quantification of
textural parameters (e.g. the size and shape distributions of crystals and
vesicles) made possible by recent advances in automated image analysis
capabilities. This study differs from other approached to the "petrologic"
inverse problem" not only in the extreme sample control based on timing,
seismicity, and eruption style, but also in the application of textural as well
as chemical criteria for sample classification.
