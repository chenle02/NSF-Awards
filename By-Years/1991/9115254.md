This is a collaborative proposal between Temple University, Villanova
University, Drexel University and Millersville University to design and
prototype an AI repository consisting of a variety of educational materials and
computing environments. The AI repository, to be maintained and supported by
Temple University, will be used by students for software projects and for
independent personal study in AI laboratories associated with computer science
courses.
