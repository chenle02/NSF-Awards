This research project is directed at developing a strategy or methodology to
examine and evaluate the issues which permit an informed decision about whether
the structure under consideration is a candidate for base isolation, what type
of base isolation is most suitable, and what technical problems should be
expected so that appropriate design features may be included. The research is
divided into three phases; the first phase consists of assembling data on
various current base-isolation schemes and developing methodologies for the
selection of a design system. Subsequent phase will focus on technology
assessment and feasibility evaluation, and application examples.
