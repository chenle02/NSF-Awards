9416184 Perkins This project is being funded as part of the National Earthquake
Hazards Reduction Program's investigation into the causes and effects of the
January 17, 1994 Northridge earthquake. The investigators are developing models
for estimating uninhabitable dwellings from future earthquakes affecting the San
Francisco Bay Area. This project takes advantage of the unique opportunity
provided by the Northridge earthquake. The investigators will determine if the
entire modeling process (including damage-based intensity mapping and dwelling
unit data collection techniques) can be transferred to southern California and
to a different fault mechanism (thrust vs. strike-slip). The project's goal is
to examine the effects of the Northridge earthquake on housing stock and mass
care requirements to improve emergency planning, disaster response, and
residential rebuilding efforts in future earthquakes either in southern
California or other areas. ***
