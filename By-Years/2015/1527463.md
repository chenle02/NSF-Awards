Due to technology scaling, electronic circuits are becoming more susceptible to
radiation-induced soft errors also known as transient faults. Soft errors may
lead to application crash or even worse, silent data corruptions (SDC) that are
not caught by the error detection logic but may cause the application to produce
incorrect output. Another serious problem is the rise of detected unrecoverable
errors (DUE) that often directly impact the reliability of any computer
applications. The challenge is to achieve soft error resilience in a way that
does not significantly increase the performance overhead, power consumption, and
complexity of underlying hardware. To this end, this project designs and
develops low-cost hardware/software cooperative techniques for soft error
resilience. The resulting artifacts and technologies are expected to contribute
to the nation's competitiveness by addressing the challenge of building reliable
computing systems in the presence of soft errors.&lt;br/&gt;This research
involves three intermediate research goals: design novel microarchitecture, that
dynamically verifies the correctness of the processor core execution based on
sensor-based soft error detection, to achieve soft error resilience at low cost;
design a compiler that forms verifiable and recoverable regions in the presence
of soft errors and provides relevant program analysis techniques; and design and
develop compiler optimization and microarchitectural techniques that
significantly reduce the verification overhead. This project will create tools
and technologies for realization of soft error resilient computing systems,
contributing fundamentally to the fault tolerance research community. Adoption
of the resulting compiler and microarchitectural techniques will impact a broad
range of any disciplines that need correct computation results thus requiring
reliable computing systems, covering from mobile devices to high-performance
large-scale computing systems. Consequently, use of the resulting technologies
will make the execution of current and emerging applications much more reliable,
and therefore directly affect our way of life.
