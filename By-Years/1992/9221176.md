This action supports a phase transformation conference to address the
controversial roles of shear and diffusion in the formation of plates that are
not the product of a martensitic transformation. The conference will be held in
Hawaii, 18-22 Dec 1992. The conference site was selected to enable a wide
selection of participants. Transmission electron microscopy and analytical
microscopy offer new information on this type of phase transformation. Critical
experiments are covered and recent evidence argued. The conference creates a
framework that incorporates several features of the current possible
transformation mechanisms. The Proceedings of the conference are to be published
in the archival literature. %%% Phase transformations are inherent to the
development of appropriate microstructures in engineering metallic alloys. This
conference addresses a type of transformation common to both ferrous and
nonferrous alloys.
