This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project will investigate
self-imaging in fiber structures, and determine feasibility of developing two
classes of novel device: highly efficient, near diffraction-limited rare earth
ion-doped glass lasers and amplifiers, and high power/energy fibers for
transport, routing and coupling of diffraction-limited beams. Conventional
single mode fiber lasers can deliver similar performance at low power/ energy,
but higher power systems require larger fiber apertures, leading to multi
spatial mode propagation. Self-imaging accesses a new operating regime for
guided wave devices, enabling diffraction-limited power scaling of lasers and
beam-transport fibers. In comparison, bulk lasers are less efficient, and more
susceptible to thermo-optic distortions. The self-imaging proof-of-concept has
been demonstrated in a 16W planar waveguide laser fabricated from diffusion-
bonded crystals. However, that approach is not well suited to fabricating
2-dimensional waveguides where 4 separate polishing/bonding steps are needed.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Application of this work would be the design and
development of optimized waveguides for the telecommunications industry. The end
product would be an integrated product with improved optical characteristics.
