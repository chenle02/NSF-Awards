This award supports the participation of US-based participants in the
international workshop "Lie Theory and Poisson Geometry," held at the Centre
International de Recontres Mathemathiques (CIRM), in Marseille, France, during
the week of January 10-14, 2022. Its subject is the interplay between Poisson
geometry and representation theory, and it is aimed primarily at early-career
mathematicians. Its overarching goal is to expose the participants to a diverse
spectrum of ideas on the forefront of modern research in these fields, and to
give them an opportunity to enlarge their network of collaborators.

The meeting consists of a series of mini-courses given by senior mathematicians
and contributed talks delivered by young researchers. These focus on the latest
progress in several rapidly evolving areas at the intersection of Poisson
geometry and representation theory, with an emphasis on Poisson manifolds of
compact type, Poisson-Lie groups and quantum groups, and cluster structures in
Poisson geometry. They are supplemented by structured discussion sessions, with
the goal of promoting an active exchange of ideas and the formation of long-term
working groups. Details of the schedule can be found on the conference website:

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
