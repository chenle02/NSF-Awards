9316919 Atela The investigator plans to study several problems in complex
dynamical systems including the geometry of the Mandelbrot set. Another
component of the research involves study of the three body problem in celestial
mechanics along with bifurcation and chaotic phenomena. Undergraduate students
will also be supervised as part of the scope. The research has potential
applications to cosmology, fractals and the analysis of chaos. ***
