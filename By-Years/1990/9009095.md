Funds are requested for the purchase of equipment of critical importance for the
pursuit of experiments in the area of low temperature physics at the University
of Massachusetts. The equipment will permit interesting and timely experiments
in the areas of: films of 3He/4He mixtures; localization; and the behavior of
helium in restricted/disordered environments.
