9452784 Smith This two year project is to develop a CD-ROM based curriculum that
will provide a community of learners an opportunity to solve real- world
problems. With Culver Productions as a base of operations, the development
process will involve a known group of science educators including Global Rivers
Environmental Education Network (GREEN), University of Michigan, and Paradyme
Productions. Students will identify problems based on watching a video
documentary that presents opposing facts and opinions and then navigate through
a rich database of video, text, graphics, GIS maps, and simulations to develop
startegies to solve problems. Students will be guided through telecommunications
to communicate with other schools, contact public officials, or retrieve
government documents to develop their strategy. Final results will be evident in
many forms including active debates and verbal communications, hands-on
research, and custom produced multimedia presentations. The curriculum, "Without
Water," will help teach students the role citizens play in the health of society
and the earth.
