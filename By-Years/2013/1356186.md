Through this project Briar Cliff University is providing scholarship awards to
entering freshmen majoring in Biology, Environmental Science, Chemistry, and
Biochemistry with demonstrated high motivation, academic talent, and financial
need. In partnership with Sioux City high schools and the Iowa Governor's STEM
Advisory Council, Briar Cliff is recruiting its "STEM Pathways Scholars"
primarily from the State of Iowa and the Tri-State Region including areas of
Nebraska and South Dakota. By enabling increased access to high quality STEM
education, the project is enlarging the pool of well-prepared undergraduate
students who can help meet pressing regional, if not also national, workforce
development needs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical features of this project
include the use of evidence-based practices and creative strategies in
addressing Briar Cliff students' identified needs for greater peer support,
academic engagement, and career development. Scholars benefit from a rigorous,
supported program of study that includes: a first-year STEM Living Learning
Community (LLC); an advising trio, comprised of a peer mentor, faculty mentor,
and retention specialist; peer-led academic coaching in gateway courses;
inquiry-based research embedded in first- and second-year labs; service-learning
experiences in environmental preservation and prairie restoration; field
experiences; a careers in STEM speaker series, networking events, professional
mentors, and optional internships; and attendance and presentation at regional
science meetings. The evaluation of the project utilizes a mixed methods
approach and matched comparison cohorts to examine the effectiveness of "STEM
Pathways Scholars" strategies, including the project's particular emphasis on
experiential learning. Findings are being disseminated among Briar Cliff's
partners in STEM and higher education institutions throughout Iowa and the
Midwest through shared impact reports, presentations at regional science
meetings, and publications.
