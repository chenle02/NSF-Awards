In order to determine which types of air monitoring technologies and what kinds
of scientific collaboration work best, the PI will compare monitoring projects
with contrasting configurations of technology and collaboration. The PI will
create and teach an annual science and engineering ethics course during which
students will spend a week in a fenceline community learning from residents and
other expert-activists about local environmental hazards and the technologies
that produce them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will create
bridges between engineering professional communities and the public through
exchange of expertise. The community collaborations she proposes will
simultaneously broaden pathways for non-engineer citizens to actively and
substantively participate in engineering projects and broaden the education of
engineers to understand the community contexts and environmental justice
implications of design decisions.
