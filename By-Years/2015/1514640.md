Online education has recently made significant advances with several university
teams and start-ups delivering interactive online content and assessment to web-
enabled students. One untapped market that has huge commercial potential is web
based offering of tiered introductory engineering education to middle and high
school students as preparatory courses (and, potentially advanced credit) for
college. However, for this method to be effective, school teachers need to be
adept at understanding online material and guide and assess the students using
the same online resources. The goal of the proposed work is to promote advanced
engineering education amongst K-12 students using scalable and economically
viable online models that focus on training high school STEM teachers.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project represents a unique and scalable
approach to engineering education among K-12 students. It seeks to address two
important limitations of most online education approaches: (a) Scalable online
education tends to eliminate in-class type interaction, mentoring and feedback;
and (b) Online education does not include true hands-on experience that is
essential in engineering disciplines. The goal of this project is to develop a
tiered approach to K-12 engineering education that involves the following
components: Nanotech content, Scalable STEM teachers' training, and scalable
hands-on experience for students. The proposed program should lead to
significant traction with middle and high schools in a variety of ways including
creation of signature courses and/or electives; advanced placement high school
courses that can receive college credits; and content incorporated into existing
math and science courses.
