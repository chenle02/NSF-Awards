This proposal will provide support for participants from institutions in the
U.S. to attend the Fourth Arolla Conference on Algebraic Topology. The
conference will be held August 20th - 26th, 2012 in the village of Arolla,
Switzerland. The goal of the Arolla conferences is to bring together experts
from a wide variety of fields within homotopy theory and K-theory to learn of
current ground-breaking work throughout these disciplines. The following
individuals have agreed to give plenary lectures at the upcoming conference:
Arthur Bartels (Munster), Mark Behrens (MIT), Gunnar Carlsson (Stanford),
Michael Ching (Amherst), Daniel Dugger (Oregon), Teena Gerhardt (Michigan
State), Ian Leary (Ohio State), Ib Madsen (Copenhagen), Niko Naumann
(Regensburg), Angelica Orsono (Chicago), Kari Ragnarsson (DePaul), Goncalo
Tabuada (MIT), and Antoine Touze (Paris XIII). These plenary speakers have made
significant contributions to many subfields of algebraic topology, including
K-theory, L-theory, equivariant stable homotopy theory, homotopy theory and
algebraic geometry, applied and computational algebraic topology, group
representations and cohomology, homotopical algebra, Goodwillie calculus and
operads, and higher category theory. There will be 10-12 contributed lectures,
chosen from abstracts submitted by registered participants so as to cover a wide
range of topics. For more details about the conference, visit the conference
website at http://sma.epfl.ch/~hessbell/arolla/arolla?2012.html.

Algebraic topology is a field of mathematics that uses algebraic tools to study
properties of shapes that are preserved under continuous deformations. It
developed as a distinct discipline within mathematics in the late 19th/early
20th century and has played a major role in 20th and 21st century mathematics.
The Arolla conferences are among the few continuing established conferences that
cover a broad range of topics within algebraic topology. The conferences bring
together researchers from around the world who work in many specialties within
algebraic topology to exchange ideas and learn of new developments in the field.
The conferences particularly encourage participation from young researchers.
Funding from this proposal will support U.S.-based speakers at the 2012
conference, thereby enabling conference participants to learn of work that is
taking place in the U.S. It will also support participation by young researchers
and those from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in mathematics in
the U.S., providing them with opportunities to learn more about what is
happening in the field, share their work with others, explore ideas for new
research, and develop professional networks in Europe.
