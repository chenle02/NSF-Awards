The purpose of this project is to develop materials for beginning readers
(kindergarten to third grade) that will promote children's knowledge of and
interests in areas of science while taking into account the tentativeness of
their reading skills. Very little material is now available which meets these
particular conditions. Not only will such material be of specific interest to
many young readers, but it will enhance the competence of all children for
understanding and appreciating the range of writing in science that they will
encounter in the later grades. The outcomes of the project will be twofold: (1)
A prototype demonstration set of science books for beginning readers and (2) A
project report that documents the development and effectiveness of the materials
and provides guidelines and rationale for their use. The project grows out of a
program of classroom research on interests and learning styles of beginning
readers which was conducted by ETS staff in collaboration with public school
teachers. Research techniques developed in these previous studies will be used
as a guide to constructing texts that have substantial science content yet are
directly accessible to the beginner. The work of the project will entail
collaboration with teachers, scientists and a writer.
