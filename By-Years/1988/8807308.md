The regulation of carbon metabolism in non-photosynthetic tissues (sinks) of
higher plants is poorly understood, despite the fact that these tissues
constitute the bulk of the world's supply of food. Photosynthetically derived
carbon is generally translocated to sinks as sucrose but, once unloaded, may be
processed in different ways. Depending on the type of sink, the imported sucrose
may be used predominately in biosynthesis and respiration, or stored, either as
sucrose or starch. Little is known about the biochemical mechanisms by which
this partitioning is accomplished. These studies will make significant
contributions to the understanding of carbon metabolism in sink tissues, an area
of plant biology in urgent need of development. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate
(F2,6P2), a regulatory molecule shown to control carbon partitioning in
photosynthetic cells, may play a related role in sinks as well. The
concentration of F2,6P2 is determined by the activities of fructose 6-phosphate,
2-kinase (F6P, 2K) and fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase (F2,6P2ase), which synthesize
and degrade F2,6P2. The Fellow will purify F6P,2K and F2,6P2ase from a variety
of sink types to determine whether differences in the properties of the enzymes
correlate with different patterns of carbon partitioning. With the purified
preparations, the affinity of the enzymes for their substrates and their
sensitivity to metabolite effectors will be measured. It will be determined
whether sink F6P,2K and F2,6P2ase reside on separate proteins as in leaves, and
tested whether the enzymes might be regulated by covalent modification (for
example, phosphorylation).
