James Anderson of Penn State is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to predict molecular structures and properties
using quantum Monte Carlo methods. Applications of his fixed-node technique
employing effective core potentials include metcars, fullerenes, and diamond.
For test systems, all-electron calculations will be performed to assess the
performance of the effective core potentials. Methodological developments
consist of computing trial wavefunction corrections directly, and combining this
correction method with the released-node technique. Practical, economical, and
reliable methods for predicting molecular structure and properties are necessary
in accurate models of combustion, materials, and biochemistry. Monte Carlo
calculations have yielded the most accurate quantum mechanical results for small
molecular systems, and thus provide reliable standards against which to test
other computational methods in molecular electronic structure theory. This
project will provide additional benchmarks and also develop more efficient Monte
Carlo methods applicable to larger molecular systems.
