The PI will undertake a computational study of scalar transport (e.g.,
contaminants or thermal energy) in wall turbulence and the influence of Prandtl
(or Schmidt) number on near-wall and dispersion behavior. Central to this study
will be the development of Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) in conjunction with
Langrangian Scalar Tracking (LST) for the generation of numerical data and the
development of descriptive models. The program will incorporate advances in High
Performance Computing to allow the detailed investigation of heat and mass
transfer in turbulent flow for a variety of fluid systems. Central concerns are
the prediction of the spatial variation of turbulent transport properties, the
effect of molecular Prandtl number on turbulent transport and the effect of
boundary conditions on the scalar property transport. The innovations of the
present work are (a) the use of hydrodynamics generated by a Direct Numerical
Simulation (DNS) to generate Lagrangian data for turbulent dispersion; (b) the
development of plane Couette flow simulations for the study of transport in the
constant stress region; and (c) the study of chemical reaction in turbulence in
the Lagrangian framework. The results, if successful, will have impact on a
variety of practical heat and mass transfer problems (heat exchange, mixing,
reactor flows, turbine blade cooling, pollutant dispersion in the atmosphere).
The work will also foster the application of HPC technology in ways that will
make DNS more assessable and cost effective, and potentially will lead to the
ability to study scalar transport in other important physical problems, such as
transport in very small-scale flows. Specific plans have been laid out to
introduce HPC to undergraduate students who will participate in the research at
different stages of the work and through the introduction of HPC into the
curriculum of Chemical Engineering at the University of
Oklahoma.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
