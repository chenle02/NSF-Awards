The PI proposes an undergraduate summer school in mathematical logic, to be held
at UCLA in summer 2010. The goals of the summer school are to introduce
promising undergraduate students to graduate level material in mathematical
logic, including central results and research techniques; ac- commodate a wide
spectrum of experience with mathematical logic, ranging from students who have
very little experience with the area to students who have already taken advanced
courses in their home institutions; improve the students? mathematical problem
solving skills; and encourage them to pursue graduate studies in mathematics.
One such summer school had already been held, in 2009, with great success. The
proposed school will continue the same innovative format, and build on the
publicity and reach generated by the 2009 summer school to ensure continued
success.
