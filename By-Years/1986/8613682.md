Exploratory research will be done on a novel approach to quantitative modeling
and design of performance-adaptive computer interfaces for integration of data-
driven automated systems. The project will evaluate, both theoretically and
experimentally, adaptation of the system's sample rate and output interpolation
process as a function of input signal band-width, and the signal processing gain
of the system in response to signal-to-noise ratio estimates.
