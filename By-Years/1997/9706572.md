The goal of the project is to demonstrate the feasibility of a broad-based
language for scientific and engineering computation. Such a language should
serve equally well for developing production scientific code (which is now
typically written in FORTRAN or C) and as the scripting language for interactive
scientific computing environments (such as Mathematica or Matlab). This breadth
would greatly simplify the development of code by allowing a clean transition
from prototyping and small- scale experiments to full production code, and would
better support the evolution of production code. As a broad-based language it
should support both numerical and symbolic computation, should include
constructs r parallel programming, and should include the high-level language
features found in systems such as Mathematica (e.g. pattern matching, higher-
order functions, and automatic memory management). The project involves
demonstrating that it is possible to support these features while maintaining
good code efficiency. As such, the project includes work on compiler techniques,
on language design, on the development of scientific codes, and experimentation
on the codes using the compiler and language. The project is using ML extended
with the parallel constructs from NESL as a testbed.
