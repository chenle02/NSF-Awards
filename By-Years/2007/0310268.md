This program seeks to build, through the American Educational Research
Association, an educational education statistical analysis infrastructure to
conduct scientific quantitative studies of education policy and practice. The
program awards small grants of $15 to $35 thousand to researchers for field
initiated studies and awards fellowships for researchers to reside in federal
agencies while conducting statistical studies. The focus of this&lt;br/&gt;
grant is the building of capacity to conduct analysis of large-scale national
and international datasets. The proposal includes activities for funding Federal
Agency Fellows, Postdoctoral Fellows, Small Grants, Training, Grants, and Think
Tanks for issues of concern to federal agencies. The grants are administered by
an active Governing Board composed of 17 prominent researchers from a wide range
of fields related to education, science, mathematics, and psychology.
