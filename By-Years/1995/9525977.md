9525977 Lee This project will explore important aspects of midlatitude storm
track dynamics that heretofore have received relatively little attention.
Understanding of the dynamics of storm tracks is critical to the improvement
extended range forecasting and short-term climate. Three characteristics of
atmospheric flow that affect storm track formation and variability will be
explored: (1) the effects of background barotropic deformation, (2) the
relevance of linear, barotropic Rossby wave guides, and (3) the role of wave
breaking of midlatitude synoptic-scale waves. The results of these studies will
guide future parameterizations of transient eddy momentum fluxes. The study will
employed both observational analyses and a hierarchy of linear and non-linear
models. ??
