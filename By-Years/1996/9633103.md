This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER), funded by the Informations
Technologies Office, DARPA, addresses the following problems in the new area of
Biomolecular/DNA Based Computation:(a) Determining correct models for
biomolecular/DNA computations;(b) Developing techniques that make
biomolecular/DNA computations error tolerant;(c) Determining a set of
``practical'' solution techniques for certain NP-hard problems (such as,
breaking DES cypher and ``accurate'' pattern matchings for the human genome
project) that exploit the massively parallel biomolecular/DNA computations. One
of the goals of this SGER project is to initiate and develop collaborative
efforts with the Biochemistry Department at Princeton University.***
