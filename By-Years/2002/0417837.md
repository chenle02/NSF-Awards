This project will develop an information-theoretic analytical framework for the
modeling and analysis of limited discretionary regimes (LDRs): situations in
which institutional structures restrict, bound, guide, or constrain the
discretion exercised by actors within them. Specifically, it will develop the
analytical framework and customize it for modeling LDRs, demonstrate, with
analytical proofs and simulated evidence, the soundness of the framework for
application to LDRs, and apply the framework for modeling the determinants of
judicial discretion exercised by Federal judges under the Federal Sentencing
Guidelines. In applying the proposed analytical framework to a real-world LDR,
the project aims to demonstrate the information-recovery potential of the
proposed strategy with regards to an expanded array of research applications.
The proposed project will enhance the set of analytical tools at the disposal of
researchers, practitioners, policy-makers, and educators.
