This project uses the medically important dimorphic fungus Candida albicans to
study general mechanisms of shape determination in fungi. It extends the
bacterial concept of quorum sensing to more complicated organisms such as the
fungi. The project explores how single celled fungi determine how many of their
kind are present at a certain location. That is, are enough cells present to
have achieved a threshold or quorum? For Candida albicans, the consequences of
quorum sensing are that the fungi exhibit different growth patterns depending
solely on their initial cell densities; they grow as single celled, budding
yeasts at high cell densities and as long filaments at low cell densities. Each
cell releases low levels of a specific signaling molecule and then senses the
extracellular concentration of that molecule. This project focuses on whether
quorum sensing is a general phenomenon in all dimorphic fungi and aims to
elucidate the chemical structures of the molecules which are secreted and
detected. The long term benefits from this project could include the development
of novel anti-fungal drugs, designed not to kill the fungus but instead to
restrict its growth to the yeast morphology. There is a dire need of effective
anti-fungal antibiotics and a novel class of anti-fungal drugs would greatly
benefit the treatment of both animal and plant diseases.&lt;br/&gt;
