Goodge 9615562 Abstract This award supports four meetings of the Antarctic
Working Group for Geology and Geophysics (ANTWG^3) over the two year from 1996-
1998. The ANTWG^3 affords a broad conduit for exchange of information between
the Antarctic Geology and Geophysics Program within the US Antarctic Program
(USAP), and the diverse parts of the broadly-defined Antarctic earth science
community. As such, it is a forum for discussion of the future goals of
Antarctic geological and geophysical research, and the future needs of
researchers from the operational and science support portion of the USAP. More
specifically, the Working Group brings to the program ideas about emerging
scientific and technical opportunities within the fields of geology and
geophysics, programmatic needs, and programmatic opportunities as perceived by
the wider earth science community. The Working Group also serves to provide
feedback to the program on current logistical and science support issues related
to ongoing activities. The information exchange between the research community
and the Antarctic Geology and Geophysics Program, that is facilitated by the
ANTWG^3, allows the US Antarctic Program to be better positioned to support
future cutting edge geological and geophysical research and it also promotes
better information exchange amongst investigators interested in geological and
geophysical research in the Antarctic.
