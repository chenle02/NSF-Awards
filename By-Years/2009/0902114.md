For the vast majority of human history, people all over the world have lived in
small social groups as hunters and gatherers, and not in towns or villages.
Agriculture has been claimed to be the driving force for recent population
expansions: in the strongest claims, almost all current language families
ultimately have their pre-industrial distribution because of agricultural
expansion. While the spread of farming and languages associated with it has
claimed a lot of recent attention, there has been very little corresponding work
on the languages of hunter-gatherers. It is important for our overall
understanding of social dynamics to analyze what drives change and spread among
hunter-gatherers and determine whether such processes are different from what
occurred after the farming revolution, 10,000 years ago. Researchers from the
US, Canada, New Zealand and Australia will collaborate on work comparing hunter-
gatherer groups on three continents (North America, South America, and
Australia). In North and South America, some hunter-gatherer languages have
spread over large distances, but farming and associated languages have also
spread widely, and in some cases farmers reverted to foraging. In Australia, the
transition to farming never took place but one language family spread very
widely. Results from genetics, linguistics, anthropology and archaeology will be
combined to clarify what the relative contributions of migration and language
shift were to language spreads. Among the linguistic data to be collected are
vocabulary in the fields of plants and animals, and kinship and social
organization.
