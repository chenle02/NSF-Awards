9308132 Bitterman Although invertebrates comprise more than 95% of all animal
species, there has been very little careful scientific study of their
intelligence. Few invertebrate species actually are suitable for the purpose,
which requires that they be abundantly available, live well in or near the
laboratory, and have manageable sensory, motor, and motivational properties. Dr.
Bitterman and his colleagues have been studying honeybees, which are highly
evolved invertebrates that do meet these requirements and are also of great
economic importance (honey production and the pollination of crops). For the
most part, Dr. Bitterman uses individual foragers that come of their own accord
to the laboratory, where they work for sucrose solution to take back to their
hives. The experiments carried out thus far show many detailed similarities in
the learning of honeybees and vertebrates, similarities that are surprising in
view of the vast differences in brain structure and the remoteness of the
evolutionary relationship (the two lines of animals have been evolving
independently from a primitive common ancestor over a period of 500 million
years). As the tasks set for the animals become increasingly complex, Dr.
Bitterman expects to find differences in performance that reflect the absence in
honeybees of certain advanced vertebrate capabilities, differences that should
help to define more clearly both the common and the advanced capabilities. The
present phase of the work deals with such phenomena as the selection and
integration of concurrent sensory inputs; the integration of present and
remembered inputs; inhibitory control of behavior; and the rules of choice.
