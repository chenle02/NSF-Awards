9418151 Jacobs This project will process, analyze, and report the findings of
the previously funded first systematic oceanographic study of the continental
shelves of the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas, which included temperature and
salinity profiling, water sampling for ocean chemistry, and continuous precision
bathymetry. Upwelling warm deep water covers the Amundsen and Bellingshausen
shelves and was found to deliver significant amounts of heat to the sea ice and
fringing ice shelves. The regional precipitation is heavy, and has historically
maintained a perennial ice cover. However, within the last few years satellite
images have shown that the ice has been receding dramatically, with large areas
of open water persisting through the winter in sectors that earlier had been
ice-covered. These anomalous ice distributions are likely to have been
accompanied by altered surface water properties, and possibly changes in the
deep vertical circulation. There are indications that the conditions favoring a
reduction in the sea ice may migrate westward toward the Ross Sea, and may have
influenced a gradual wapming over recent decades on the western side of the
Antarctic Peninsula. The current project will investigate the production of
shelf water and deep water through interactions with coastal polynyas and
floating ice, and make use of a large body of ancillary data on the geochemical,
biological, and cryospheric environment. The project made use of the R/V
Nathaniel B. Palmer in two cruises: one in the late austral summer 1993-1994,
and a subsequent cruise in September and October to observe late winter
conditions. ***
