The research will examine models of rigidity percolation in random mechanical
networks of springs. Networks are studied under pressure. These simple models
may lead to insights into the phase diagrams of solids under pressure. It is
proposed to examine the controversial question of rotational invariance of free
standing solids with strained interiors which has important consequences for
critical exponents. The reasons why Cauchy's relations are obeyed in these
random systems are explored. The static and low frequency critical behavior will
be pursued both numerically and using scaling relations.
