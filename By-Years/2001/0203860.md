Interest in organic solid state chemistry has undergone explosive growth in
recent years due to the broadly based recognition of the scientific challenges
and technological importance attached to the discovery and study of new organic
andpoilymeric materials. Many scientists from other disciplines see
opportunities for performing exciting research in this area. The 2002 Electronic
Processes in Organic Materials Gordon Research Conference will be held at Salve
Regina University, Newport, Rhode Island from July 21-26, 2002. The goal of the
conference is to facilitate international collaborations and informatation
exchange across a broad spectrum of researchers with interests in solid state
organic materials. The NSF funds will be used to support the attendance of 5
graduate students and post-doctoral scholars and 7 senior U.S. session chairs
and invited speakers.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;The Solid State Chemistry
community continues to have direct impact on technological areas that are
crucial to advancing societal needs through the design, synthesis and
application new materials. Specific area in which important advances are being
made include organic superconductors, field-effect transisters, lasers,
conducting wires, light emitting diodes and semiconductors. J Since these
technical areas are of very high priority to industry, students educated and
trained in these multidisciplinary areas involving solid-state organic chemistry
compete very well in the job market and go on to contribute in many significant
ways to the global economy.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
