The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is a flattened, convoluted sack within muscle
cells that controls the movement of calcium ions, and thus regulates the
contraction of muscle. It has been hard to study the properties of this
membranous sack directly because it is so small and inaccessible within the
muscle cell, but new techniques have removed both problems. Dr. Eisenberg has
developed a mechanically skinned preparation of a specialized lobster muscle,
the remotor of the second antenna, that contains a large amount of SR (70% of
its volume) to control its very rapid contractions. This preparation can be
studied with modern techniques of electrophysiology. Its membrane potential can
be recorded directly, and the properties of the individual ion channels of its
membrane can be measured. The objective of this research is a systematic study
of the electrical properties of the SR compartment, emphasizing the properties
likely to be involved in the control of the rapid contraction of the remotor
muscle. The following features will be studied: the ions responsible for the
resting potential of the SR and the effects of calcium ions, chloride ions,
caffeine, and procaine which are known to affect excitation-contraction
coupling. The two different types of calcium channel found in the SR will be
studied, and agents that modulate their behavior will be sought. The resistance
and capacitance of the SR compartment will be measured. This research is of
great biological interest. Although it has been known for many years that the
sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) controls muscle contraction by regulating the levels
of intracellular calcium, this will be the first time that direct measurements
of the electrical properties of the SR membrane and its individual ion channels
have been made in any preparation. This specialized, rapidly contracting lobster
muscle should provide important clues to the general mechanisms of control of
muscle contraction.
