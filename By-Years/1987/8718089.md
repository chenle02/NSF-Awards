The purpose of this project is to install and operate a sodium lidar at the
South Pole Station to study the dynamical behavior of the upper atmosphere. The
lidar can detect the sodium layer at about 90 kilometers altitude, and by
measuring the height and density of the layer determine the vertical motion of
the upper atmosphere. There has been a recent increase in interest in this
subject due to the discovery, by this investigator, that there was a dramatic
decrease, by a factor of 50, in sodium above Svalbard in the arctic during July
of 1987. The reason for this loss is unknown, and it is important to determine
whether a similar phenomenon occurs over the antarctic. The results,
particularly the study of atmospheric gravity waves, may shed some light on the
dynamical characteristics of the antarctic ozone hole. This research is jointly
supported by the Division of Polar Programs and the Division of Atmospheric
Sciences
