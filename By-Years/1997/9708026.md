Abstract ATM-9708026 Baldwin, Mark D. Northwest Research Associates, Inc. Title:
Observational Studies of Stratospheric and Stratosphere/Troposphere Coupling The
objective of the proposal research is to use observational data, like the recent
reanalyzed consistent data sets, to explore stratosphere variability,
stratosphere-troposphere coupling, and equatorial troposphere waves. A better
understanding of the stratospheric variability will allow increased confidence
in global change. In the long term another benefit of a better understanding of
stratosphere-troposphere coupling will be improved numerical weather forecast
models and climate prediction.
