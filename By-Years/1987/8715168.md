This project is a conference on linear algebra and its applications. It is
sponsored by the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics and will be held
at the University of Wisconsin. In addition to National Science Foundation
support, the conference also will be supported by the Department of Energy.
Linear algebra is a central area of mathematics and mathematics applications.
Research in linear algebra is important to linear systems, control theory, and
signal processing in engineering, statistics, economics, population biology,
geophysics, nuclear spectroscopy, and business. The developments of methods and
algorithms in these applied areas rests on the theoretical research in linear
algebra. The conference will feature: large scale computing and numerical
methods, linear systems and control, signal processing and VLSI, inverse
eigenvalue problems, optimization, and multivariate statistics.
