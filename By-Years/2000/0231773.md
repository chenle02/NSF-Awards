Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) is partnering with the Worcester Public
School System on a project focusing on the development of human resources
related to grade K-6 STEM education. Projects goals include: developing
partnerships among graduate and undergraduate fellows, public school teachers
and students, and WPI and WPI-affiliated faculty; implementing the Massachusetts
Science and Technology/Engineering Curriculum Framework (MSTECF) in the K-6
curriculum by using the partnerships to develop specific teaching strategies;
and assessing and disseminating the outreach process, student learning outcomes
and teacher preparation that result from this project. The intellectual merit of
this project is evidenced by the support given to the innovative technology
component of the state standards. The direct interaction with K-6 schools,
teachers and students is part of the broader impacts of this project. This
project is partially supported by funds from the Directorate for
Engineering.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Title of Project: K-6 Gets a Piece of the
