This project serves national interest by transforming teaching and learning in
the discipline of linguistics. Workshop activities linguists to improve their
understanding of scholarly teaching and pedagogy and to create and disseminate
innovative, peer-reviewed pedagogical resources. The peer-reviewed library
created by this project provides accessible, vetted, contextualized pedagogical
materials for linguistics instructors, improving the experiences of
undergraduate students. Since many students enrolled in linguistics courses are
in other disciplines, the artifacts produced by project participants reach
audiences both within and outside of the discipline of linguistics.

This project builds on recent calls to interrogates how theories of race are
operationalized in linguistics, and on recent scholarship that challenges the
Western scientific tradition of the discipline, which has privileged certain
languages, communities, cultures, and epistemologies over others. The project
plays a critical role in the discipline by focusing on the linguistics
classroom, the entry point for scholars into the discipline. To ensure that
library artifacts are relevant for a variety of institutional contexts and
student populations, project participants focus on issues of justice, equity,
diversity, and inclusion during the development of their contributions to the
pedagogical resource library.
