9361820 Siu Millimeter-wave technology is finding use in many commercial
applications including communications, resource monitoring, collision-avoidance,
and security/surveillance systems. Essential to these applications is efficient
power generation at millimeter-wave frequencies. Present GaAs- and InP- based
modulation-doped field effect transistors (MODFETs/HEMTs), in spite of good
small signal gain and low noise figure at 94 GHz, are however not suitable for
power applications. Major deficiencies of present "power" MODFETs include low
power gain and breakdown voltage. A nanometer-scale self-aligned gate with
separately controllable gate-source and gate-drain spacings will enhance both
gate-drain breakdown and power gain. Microwave Monolithics Incorporated (MMlnc.)
and its subcontractor the University of California at San Diego (UCSO) propose
to exploit the advanced nanofabrication technique for high performance
millimeter-wave power devices, and concurrently use the nanofabricated
structures to study carrier transport properties such as velocity overshoot in
realistic materials and device systems. The combination of nanometer-scale
asymmetric self- aligned gates and advanced heterostructure materials will
result in high power, high gain millimeter-wave devices and circuits. The
scientific knowledge and data gained by the proposed studies will also be
valuable to the design of future generation high frequency and high speed
components.
