This project is developing and aims to publish an extensive set of hands-on
activities (mostly but not exclusively in astronomy) that incorporate current
science research into modules suitable for use in a general science course for
nonscientists or in the standard introductory astronomy course in which many
students enroll to satisfy their general education science requirement. In these
activities, students analyze data that has been sufficiently well-processed that
even those who are not science majors can use the data to draw conclusions.
While some of the activities only take one class period, others are more
extensive and extend over several class periods&lt;br/&gt;
