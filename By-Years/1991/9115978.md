A research group at Arizona State University proposes to purchase an
element/isotope analysis system for use in environmental biology. Environmental
biology is a critical area for development because of a rapidly expanding
population and associated environmental stress in the Southwest. The proposed
instrumentation will support studies of subjects such as: stream- riparian and
lake-ecosystems, focusing on nutrient cycling and transformation; comparative
physiology research on insect nitrogen excretion; and host nutritional quality
and reproductive success in natural populations of cactophilic flies. The
University will support this endeavor by providing a technician dedicated to the
laboratory, space and necessary improvements in the space, maintenance costs,
and cost-sharing on capital purchases. The projects are all characterized by
substantial involvement of student researchers (graduates and undergraduate).
This instrumentation will allow a significant improvement in training of these
students.
