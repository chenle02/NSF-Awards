With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Steven R. Kass of the
University of Minnesota-Twin Cities will study organic ion-molecule reactons in
the gas phase. A unique variable temperature flowing afterglow-triple quadrupole
aparatus forms the experimental basis for the work. In some cases, solution
studies will be performed on the same species. Results will be supplemented with
ab initio molecular orbital calculations. Particular attention will be given to
antiaromatic ions, unimolecular rearrangements, and the effect of (particularly
remote) substituent effects on ion reactivity and stability. These experiments
will provide fundamental understanding of certain elusive and highly unstable
reactive intermediates, including a class for which no previous experimental
information has been available. Experiments such as those which will be
performed provide the hard-core data on which the rules of organic chemistry are
built, and extrapolation of the basic results obtained in the gas phase to
solution, where most preparative organic chemistry is done, will have
substantial impact on theory and potentially on practice in organic chemistry.
