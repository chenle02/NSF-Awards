9310944 Drzal The purpose of this Research Equipment Grant Award is to allow the
purchase of an Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM) by the
Composite Materials and Structures Center at Michigan State University. This
device will be used to perform processing and durability research in polymer,
cement and ceramic matrix composites in order to increase their use on the
durable goods industry. Studies will include investigations of the failure of
composites under combined thermal, mechanical and moisture environments.
