Two-dimensional tilings lie at a fulcrum connecting many areas of mathematics
and physics. Easy to visualize and appealing in their simplicity, tilings have
fascinated mathematicians at all levels, artists, architects, and the general
public. This goals of this project are (1) to study tilings in the context of
recent mathematical developments about algebraic curves and surfaces, exploring
their connections to algebra, geometry, and representation theory, (2) to
disseminate mathematical ideas to a wide audience and increase aesthetic and
intellectual appreciation of mathematics in the general public, and (3) to
develop an active and diverse community of young researchers, postdocs, and PhD
students focusing on this circle of ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One primary area
of research will be modular toroidal compactifications of spaces of K3 surfaces.
This project, joint with V. Alexeev, seeks to build extensions of the universal
family of polarized K3 surfaces to the boundary of a toroidal compactification,
extending previous work on degree 2 and elliptic K3 surfaces. The approach
employs tilings of integral-affine structures on the sphere. The second primary
research topic is moduli spaces of higher differentials. This project aims to
study strata of higher differentials, their volumes, and the connection with
enumeration of tilings. Joint work with P. Smillie explores decompositions of
flat surfaces into Penrose-like tiles. The approach is novel, requiring a
generalization of Hurwitz theory to one complex-dimensional leaf
spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
