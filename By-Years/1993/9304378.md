The Department of Statistics at the University of Wisconsin- Madison will
purchase computing equipment which will be dedicated to support research in the
mathematical sciences. This equipment will be used for several research
projects, including in particular: assessment of estimation techniques for
nonlinear mixed effects models, tree-structured statistical methods, and
statistical model building.
