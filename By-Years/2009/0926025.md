This interdisciplinary research project aims to develop a comprehensive taxonomy
of acceptable and tolerable risks posed by natural hazards. Examples of natural
hazards include tornados, hurricanes, and earthquakes. Currently available
approaches to risk analysis do not adequately capture the impact of natural
hazards on the well-being of individuals. They also fail to consider the moral
implications of the influence of the built and modified natural environments on
both the probability of occurrence and the severity of the societal impact of
natural hazards. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs define risk as the probability
that individuals' capabilities will be reduced due to a hazard. Capabilities
refer to the states and activities that are valuable, such as being adequately
nourished or sheltered, that an individual has a genuine opportunity to achieve.
Drawing on probability, reliability, and statistical methods, the PIs will
develop a formulation to predict the impact of hazards on capabilities, based on
available data from past disasters. The PIs will specify thresholds of
acceptable and tolerable levels of capabilities using the general principles
employed in law to specify broad legal rights, such as the right to free speech.
These thresholds will serve as empirically verified standards, against which the
predicted level of individuals? capabilities should be compared. Finally,
standards for permissible and impermissible increases in the probability of
occurrence and the severity of the impact of hazards on capabilities due to the
characteristics of the built and modified natural environments will be
identified.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed taxonomy provides an original and
potentially transformative theoretical framework, which brings ethics to the
center of risk analysis and conceptualizes in a novel manner the impact and
moral significance of hazards. The proposed taxonomy can be used to formulate
informed and sustainable public policies regarding resource allocation in the
context of natural hazard mitigation.
