Energy cooperation has the potential to transform wireless communication
networks towards sustainable operation. By envisioning network devices that are
not only energy harvesting from natural sources, but also from one another by
means of energy transfer, overall network lifetime can be significantly extended
with reliable operation and without relying on the power grid. Initial research
studies in energy cooperation have assumed altruistic network nodes, willing to
transfer their energy to others to sustain their operations. This project adopts
a more realistic viewpoint where nodes would participate in energy cooperation
to improve network performance when their actions simultaneously improve their
individual performance.

This project aims to develop communication and networking mechanisms for next
generation networks where nodes are engaged in energy cooperation. In
particular, the project focuses on the strategic decision making framework that
results in mechanisms to incentivize nodes to participate in such energy
cooperating networks. The project consists of two trusts: incentivizing signal
and energy cooperation and network formation via energy cooperation. The
intellectual merit of the project includes combining techniques from
optimization theory, game theory, communication theory, wireless networking and
information theory to design energy-sustainable network operation and network
formation schemes, physical layer cooperation and energy cooperation schemes.
The broader impacts of the project include enabling green operation of wireless
networks with longer network lifetimes, and educational broader impacts such as
dissemination of research results in the form of tutorials, survey articles,
lectures.
