The objective of the proposed research is to examine the effect of aliovalent
dopants on the kinetics of phase transformation in ceramics and identify
fundamental transport mechanisms. Work is proposed on Bi2O3, CaTiO3-YCrO3, and
PbI2-CdBr2 systems. Foe phase separation in these systems to take place
diffusion on one or more sub-lattices is necessary. Doped and undoped samples
will be fabricated, annealed, and examined by transmission electron and optical
microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The role of defect chemistry and the effects
of aliovalent dopants will be explicitly included in the theoretical analysis of
phase transformation kinetics. The proposed research will impact on the
determination of phase equilibria in ceramics and the development of
technologically important ceramic materials.
