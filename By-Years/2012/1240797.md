This engineering education research project will enable two workshops with the
purpose of bringing together experts in engineering education research and
taxonomists to understand how to identify and classify research in engineering
education. The goal of the workshops will be to understand the spectrum of
engineering education research and allow emerging areas to gain
recognition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of
this project will be to help understand the diversity of research investments in
engineering education, identify areas that are emerging, and help current
researchers better frame their projects using a common ontology. The project
will also help ongoing efforts to evaluate STEM education portfolios. This
project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers by
making investments that lead to emerging new fields of engineering, or shifting
existing fields. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by
creating results and research that are useful for society by informing
educational policy and practices.
