In their study of design, engineering students often work without a context. As
a consequence, they may fail to understand the social, historical, economic, and
other implications associated with the design and manufacture of products. Also,
students often design in an environment that is insular and hardly imitative of
the team development characteristic of engineering in American industry. This
project will investigate some of the potential benefits to collaborative
learning and a concurrent design environment when the powerful communication
tools of high-bandwidth networking and digital hypermedia are joined. A high-
bandwidth network connecting digital hypermedia databases will enable both
engineering design operations and information to be exchanged concurrently among
users at several remote sites. Research and development of this proposed
distributed multimedia environments, should enable students to learn new ways of
working with and using technology and hypermedia tools in order to collaborate
more effectively. The objectives of this study are as follows: 1. to examine the
characteristics inherent in a hypermedia distributed environment (non-linearity,
annotations, multiple representations) as a communication medium which supports
collaborative design between distant geographic locations; 2. to modify and
develop communication tools and resources of collaborative design for use in a
distributed hypermedia environments; 3. to analyze communication activities of
students in a collaborative design environment in order to promote the teaching
of collaboration skills needed for concurrent engineering design; and 4. to
introduce computer-assisted cooperative work models into the engineering
curriculum.
