The objective of this research is to investigate possible fault location
approaches for transmission lines utilizing sparse voltage and current
measurements from buses and branches that may be distant from the faulted line.
The approach is to derive the measured quantity as an analytical function of the
unknown fault location based on the bus-impedance matrix technique, and then to
solve the equation for the fault location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This research
has the following intellectual merits: It will explore appropriate estimation
theories for transmission line fault location, aiming at making fundamental
contributions to the areas of power system monitoring, protection and fault
analysis. The research will investigate algorithms for both single-circuit and
double-circuit lines by employing sparse voltage and current phasors or
magnitudes alone. Synchronized phasors from phasor measurement units will be
fully exploited. The developed method has the potential to be utilized for
online protection purposes, and this could significantly improve distance
protection accuracy harnessing only local data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research will have broader impacts in several areas: First, the developed
approach can greatly improve the reliability of the power system, reducing the
costs associated with the outage, and enhancing the welfare of the society.
Second, the research results will be utilized in the classroom to enrich the
curriculum. The underrepresented students, especially women, African Americans
and those from Appalachia will be encouraged and recruited to work on the
project. Third, the research results will be promptly and broadly disseminated
through technical publications and
presentations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
