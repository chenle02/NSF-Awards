Ball State University will initiate a two-week, commuter and residential, Young
Scholars project in Physics (electronics) for 48 students in grades 11-12. This
somewhat unorthodox girls-only/boys-only program attempts to provide educational
opportunities for all interested applicants, while attracting young women into
what has historically been a male-dominated area. Emphasis is placed upon the
applications of electronics, with laboratory activities constituting
approximately 60% of the program schedule. Students construct a PC computer
interface, and as a follow- up project they use the interface to perform an
experiment after returning home; results are then reported to the project staff.
