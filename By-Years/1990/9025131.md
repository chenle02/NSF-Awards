The overall objective of the proposed research is to develop suitable
networking concepts for mobile networks, along with analytical models and
methodology that permit both theoretical prediction of system performance and
examination of parameter tradeoffs. Of particular interest are techniques that
provide intelligent features in the sense that they enable mobile networks to
maintain performance levels by adjusting and adapting to changes in the
communications environment. Dynamic control, assignment, and reallocation of
communication resources due to changes in traffic loading, interference, and
topology will be investigated for cellular and non-cellular configurations.
Areas to be investigated include: techniques for managing hand-offs of
communicating platforms; use of spatial macro-diversity features; and dynamic
control and assignment of communications assets - including both borrowing and
sharing of channels and gateways. Procedures to accomplish this may involve
mixtures of central and distributed control. Appropriateness of the techniques
for various settings will be considered. Analytical modeling and computer
simulation will provide the primary underlying bases. It is expected that as a
result of this investigation new techniques will be devised that will allow
improved communications with large numbers of mobile platforms over wide
geographical areas. In addition, the analytical models and approach will provide
tan enhanced foundation for understanding, modeling, and designing mobile
communications networks.
