Engineering Other - (59)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The engineering education
literature has consistently established the ability to use statistical quality
tools and principles as a competency gap for engineers in the United States.
Thus, the purpose of this project is to investigate the use of simulation-based
active learning tools to effectively teach engineering students key principles
of quality engineering when designing manufacturing systems. Specifically, this
active learning environment allows students to study the status of the
manufacturing plant and extract data, as well as design, implement, assess, and
evaluate control charts within a virtual manufacturing plant that manufactures
and assembles optical mice for personal computers.
