The Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) based security primitives
typically suffer from area/power overhead, sensitivity to environmental
fluctuations and limited randomness and entropy offered by Silicon substrate.
Spintronic circuits can complement the existing CMOS based security and trust
infrastructures. This project explores ways to uncover the security specific
properties of the magnetic nanowire and capture them in detailed circuit
model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates noise sources and
randomness present in the magnetic nanowire, and engineers new techniques to
harvest the entropy. The investigators combine the circuits and models of non-
linear magnetic dynamics to realize hardware security primitives and engines and
experimentally validating the models and design ideas under harsh conditions and
attack scenarios. The techniques developed in this project will improve the
security and energy-efficiency of future circuits and systems.
