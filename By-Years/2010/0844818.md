Eels migrate from rivers to the sea to breed and when they do so, one of the
main challenges they face is that they must cope with the increase in salinity.
In seawater, teleosts (bony fishes) lose water to the environment and in order
to overcome this problem, they drink seawater. The intestine absorbs both salts
and water, but the excess salts are excreted by the gills. It is not known how
water absorption takes place in fish intestines and the goal of this project is
to use molecular, biochemical, and physiological approaches to determine if
water transport proteins, aquaporins, are involved in this process. One aspect
of this project will reveal whether aquaporin proteins are in the correct
location in intestinal cells to absorb the water. In addition, the functional
characteristics of these proteins will be determined by expressing them in
Xenopus (frog) oocytes and studying their transport characteristics. Eels will
be transferred from freshwater to seawater, mimicking their natural migration,
to test the hypothesis that there should be an increase the production of
intestinal aquaporins that corresponds to the increased water absorption seen
during acclimation to seawater. In addition, the importance of these proteins in
intestinal water transport will be demonstrated by determining the rate of
intestinal water transport after the levels of aquaporins are lowered by
interfering with the intestinal cell's ability to synthesize these proteins. The
project will not only have a major impact on understanding how fish are adapted
to living in seawater, but will also increase the general level of knowledge
concerning water transport processes in other animals. This project will involve
the training of graduate and undergraduate students at both Georgia Southern
University and Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory.
