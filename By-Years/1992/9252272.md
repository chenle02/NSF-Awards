Freshman Engineering students at Rancho Santiago Community College are using
Three-Dimensional Solid Modeling in their Graphic Design courses. Computer-aided
design has been taught at Rancho Santiago since 1983. Emerging curriculum models
have identified Three-Dimensional Solid Modeling, using computer graphics
technologies, as the dominant engineering tool for the 90s. The College's
Engineering faculty have investigated the use of solid modeling by engineers and
developed curriculum and laboratory manuals for this subject. The new PCAT
486-MHz Microcomputer Systems allow making the laboratory on this subject a
requirement for all Engineering majors. The curriculum and laboratory materials
are also incorporated into four engineering design classes. Applications will
include two-dimensional and three-dimensional Boolean geometry operations,
creating solids, camera walk, presentation and rendering, editing, plotting, and
annotation.
