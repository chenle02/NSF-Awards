The Pacific to Arizona Crustal Experiment (PACE) is a multidisciplinary
transect which crosses an old magmatic arc, a continental rift, and an
extensional terrane all located in southern California. The PIs will collect
magnetotelluric data along this transect to enhance the seismic experiments
already planned. Prominent mid-crustal refectors have already been found on
CALCRUST lines in eastern California and COCORP lines in Arizona.
Magnetotelluric soundings will be sensitive to these reflective zones if they
are cause by fluid, partial melt, or conductive minerals such as graphite in
mylonitic zones. Thus, electrical measurements will help identify midcrustal
structure. Further, measurements in the Peninsular Ranges will help locate the
old suture zone between continental and oceanic crust. The magnetotelluric
survey will be contracted to a commercial contractor in order to guarantee the
best data possible and will use the latest 2-D inversions and 3-D forward
modeling to interpret the data. This survey is designed as a reconnaissance for
a possible future EMSOC experiment.
