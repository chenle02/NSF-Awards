The research is to determine the applicability of pH monitoring to concrete
materials manufacture and production. There are two parts, The first part
involves pH monitoring of the chemical reaction between water and Portland
cement. The objective of this part is to determine the rate of change of the pH
and the characteristic data as a new means to classify cement types. The second
phase consists of monitoring the change of the pH in concrete that utilizes
Portland cement; changes in pH are to be observed when variables are altered
individually. This project is one supported under the Creativity Awards for
Engineering Students.
