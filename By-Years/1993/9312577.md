9312577 Segall This award provides 52 per cent of the cost of acquiring four new
Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers and of upgrading four older generation
receivers so that they will be capable of positioning with an accuracy in the
millimeter range. The receivers are to be used for accurate geodetic
measurements in research projects of the crustal dynamics group in the
Department of Geophysics at Stanford University. The University is committed to
providing the remaining funds needed for the acquisition and upgrade. The Global
Positioning System, when utilized with state-of- the-art receivers and data
processing methods, is capable of measuring horizontal and vertical motions of
the continental crust with sub-centimeter precision. GPS will be used by the
Stanford group to measure plate tectonic motion, strain build-up near active
faults, displacement due to earthquakes, deformation associated with volcanic
activity, and subsidence due to underground fluid extraction. ***
