Epitaxial thin film ferroelectrics have potential application in a wide range of
current and emerging microelectronic technologies, including static random
access memories, high dielectric constant capacitors, pyroelectric detectors,
and optical frequency doublers and waveguides. The proposed research focuses on
the theoretical understanding and experimental verification of equilibrium and
metastable structures realizable in ferroelectric thin films. The collaboration
between Wolfgang Pompe of the Technical University of Dresden benefits from the
experimentally-based approach of the PI and the theoretically- based approach of
Pompe.
