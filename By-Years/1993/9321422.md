9321422 Menoni Fundamental materials research will be conducted to elucidate and
solve basic material problems which prevent the use of Indium Gallium Aluminum
Phosphide for short wavelength semiconductor lasers. Growth techniques will be
developed to obtain highly efficient multiple quantum well structures.
Characterization of the relevant physical properties of these structures will
involve measurement of carrier confinement, carrier lifetime and radiative
efficiency across the whole range of Aluminum composition. These studies will
also evaluate the role of multiple quantum barriers to increase carrier
confinement. %%% Increased understanding of the physical properties of Indium
Gallium Aluminum Phosphide heterostructures is expected to provide the basis for
the design of efficient semiconductor lasers operating in the green-to-red
region of the visible spectrum. An important feature of the program is the
training of graduate and undergraduate students in a fundamentally and
technologically significant area of materials and processing research. This
research will contribute to improving the general performance of advanced
devices and integrated circuits used in computing, information processing, and
telecommunications. ***
