This project defines a novel architecture for energy efficient computing, called
FAWN, or a "Fast Array of Wimpy Nodes", which uses a large collection of small,
slower computers to do tasks formerly handled by a single large, fast computer.
By using more, slower, computers in tandem, the architecture runs more energy
efficiently. However, doing so in a practical manner requires overcoming many
significant challenges: The individual nodes have much less memory than
programmers are used to; the computational task must be split across a much
larger number of nodes, and the load must be balanced between them so that no
single slow computer will cause the overall operation to be delayed too long.
Modern datacenter environments further operate under very strict requirements
for processing delay in order to ensure user satisfaction; these requirements
may be harder to meet when running on the FAWN
architecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is tackling these challenges by
developing new techniques for storing and managing large volumes of data on fast
solid-state&lt;br/&gt;(Flash) memory. Through collaboration with experts in CS
theory, the project is developing new algorithms for memory-efficient, highly
parallel data analysis and data-mining, and implementing and evaluating them in
a demanding, high-performance environment. Through a collaboration with Intel,
the project is constructing a 100-node prototype of a FAWN cluster using
cutting-edge low-power processors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has the
potential to substantially reduce the capital and operating costs of large
Internet services, and to greatly reduce their energy costs and footprint. It
may also substantially advance the state of the art in practical algorithms and
systems architectures for data-intensive and energy-efficient computing.
