9500360 Dunsmuir Flavor in tomato fruit is associated with high levels of both
sugars and acids. It is known that the level of malic acid in the fruit declines
by 50 per cent with ripening and this reduction is thought to be mediated by
cytosolic NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME). This project will attempt to specifically
decrease the levels of the NADP-ME in the tomato fruit using targeted gene
suppression. A number of transgenic tomato lines will be generated with
diminished levels of the fruit-specific NADP-ME and the biochemical and sensory
properties of these lines will be examined. Transgenic lines which are
identified as having elevated malic acid levels in the ripe fruit and improved
sensory properties, will then be evaluated in the field to determine whether
there are any deleterious agronomic effects and to identify suppressed lines
which would be used in breeding programs. The anticipated outcome of this
research is the ability to directly engineer the acid levels in tomato fruit
which could significantly effect the flavor of tomatoes and could result in the
development of a technical approach for the directed alteration of acid levels
in fruit such as tomatoes, grapes and pineapples. This could improve flavor for
fresh market and processed fruits.
