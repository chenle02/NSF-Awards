Proposal Number: III-9361277 PI: Mary Appelhof Institution: Flowerfield
Enterprises Title: Videomicroscopy of Live Earthworms This project will adapt
videomicroscopy and use of fiber optics similiar to those used for endoscopy in
medicine to study eartrhworms. The equipment will allow direct observation of
earthworm digestive tracts, pumping pairs of hearts, the inside of their burrows
and the emergence of the worms from their cocoons. This will be possible because
young worms are quite translucent. A videotape record of what the students see
using the new equipment will also be possible. Teacher and student evaluations
of existing videotape will be used to determine the optimum array of equipment
to be built.
