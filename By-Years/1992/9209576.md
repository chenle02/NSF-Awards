This proposal is funded under the Research Initiation Awards (RIA) Program
Announcement, NSF 88-99. The research builds on a cognitive model to provide a
scientific basis for understanding how people perceive and process information
from graphic displays. Phase 1 proposes to model ocular scanning behavior using
knowledge about the graphic display and the goal structure of the task. The goal
is to measure the similarity among sequences of eye movements used to answer
questions posed to a range of graphic displays. Phase 2 of this research
explores errors people make processing information from complex information
displays. The studies examine when working memory overload occurs, what
information is lost, and how overload influences performance accuracy. The
resulting model will provide a research tool for understanding visual cognition
and perception. It will also provide designers a metric for measuring display
quality, working memory constraints, and information processing time.
