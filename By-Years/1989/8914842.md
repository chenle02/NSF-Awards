The secure, reliable, and economic operation of the national electric power
systems is of great importance to the national economy. Increasing power systems
complexity, coupled with the need to reduce production costs, results in
escalation of complexity of the problems facing the power industry.
Consequently, it is necessary to continuously reevaluate present methods in
operations and planning, and to define research needs in order to pave the way
for the innovative approaches required by the increasingly challenging problems.
The scope of this workshop is to bring together researchers in Power Systems
Operations and Planning and to provide a forum for discussions of research
needs. It is expected that the workshop will define present state of the art and
research needs.
