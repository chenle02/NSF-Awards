The oceanographic instrumentation program supports requests to acquire
instrumentation for the collection, processing and analysis of oceanographic
data. This proposal from Texas A&amp;M University requests funding for equipment
that will be used to support NSF-funded research cruises aboard the R/V GYRE, a
182 foot vessel that is owned by the Navy and operated by the University.
Equipment requested, which consists of an upgrade for the SAIL system, new
recorders for the autoanalyzer, and replacement sensors for the CTD, is high
priority for the NSF- funded science programs aboard the R/V GYRE in 1992.
