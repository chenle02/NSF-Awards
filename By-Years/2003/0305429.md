This U.S.-Brazil award will support the collaborative research of Drs. Ganesh K.
Venayagamoorthy, Ronald Harley, and Donald C. Wunsch, University of Missouri-
Rolla to work with Dr. Nelson Martins, Brazilian Utilities Research Center
(CEPEL), and Dr. Djalma M. Falcao, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (COPPE),
in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This international team will work to improve the
productivity of the existing and future Brazilian power generation and
transmission systems using the intelligent control techniques developed by the
PIs in an earlier project. CEPEL, the Brazilian national electricity research
and development organization, will provide a small-signal stability program for
the U.S. team to analyze the Brazilian power system. The Brazilians have already
carried out various investigations into finding methods to optimize their power
system, and are among world leaders in this regard. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project has the potential to lead to nonlinear controllers for reducing costs of
energy and transmission. The U.S. electric power grid is comparable to the
Brazilian grid in terms of size and challenges faced. The results of this work
will benefit both the U.S. and Brazil.&lt;br/&gt;
