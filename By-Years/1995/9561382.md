This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses
problems associated with current microelectronics lithography systems which
utilize masking technology. These problems include: the need for multiple masks
required for subsequent layers of an electronic module; the difficulties
associated with generating large-area masks; and the dependence on foreign
suppliers for mask substrates. The only available technology which does not
require masks is laser direct-write imaging, which is inherently slow due to
it's bit-by-bit, serial mode of addressing. Phase I develop a maskless, large-
area, high-throughput, high-resolution, lithography system which combines a
Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) with an established patterning technology. The
DMD is a micro-mechanical, spatial light modulator with high parallel-processing
power and replaces the conventional mask without any loss in throughput. When
used in conjunction with a seamless scanning technology, it can generate any
possible pattern with hiqh resolution over an unlimited area. This technology is
expected to meet a critical need in the microelectronics manufacturing industry
and also significantly increase U.S. competitiveness in an enabling technology
area.
