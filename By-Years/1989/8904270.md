Experimental, theoretical, X-ray diffraction, and petrological studies were
proposed that will define the thermodynamics of two common mineral types:
tetrahedrite- tennantite (td-tn) sulfosalts and Ti, Al, and Fe3+-rich high-
calcium pyroxenes. Results will be integrated spectroscopic and petrological
studies to provide data that will help significantly in understanding the
environment of formation of many ore deposits. One atmosphere (Pt-loop) melting
and crystallization experiments were proposed to determine of crystal-liquid
equilibrium between high-calcium pyroxenes and alkalic silicate melts. These
results will be combined with pther data to produce a model of the
crystallization of high-calcium lavas.
