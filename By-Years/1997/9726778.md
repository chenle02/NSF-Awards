This award supports Dr. David Weitz and a post doc from the University of
Pennsylvania in a collaboration with Thomas Palberg of the Department of Physics
at the Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz. The Mainz group has developed a
two-color cross- correlation technique that suppresses the interference of
multiple scattering. The Pennsylvania group has developed diffusing-wave
spectroscopy (DWS), which specifically exploits multiple scattering. The two
methods are complementary, one providing average information for a large range
of scattering angle, the other providing more detailed, angle- dependent
information. In this work, the expertise of the two groups will be combined to
study identical samples of particular colloidal suspensions and to extend
important knowledge over a complete range of concentrations.
