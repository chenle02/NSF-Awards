Few scientific innovations in this century have had as much impact on society as
the discovery of plant growth regulator substances (phytohormones) by plant
physiologists and their development in the 1940s into agricultural herbicides.
By the 1950s a once-esoteric line of academic research had left the botany
laboratories and entered the fields, transforming farming practices worldwide
and shaping agribusiness throughout the last half of the 20th century. This
study uses archival sources and the scientific literature to investigate the
trajectory of U.S. research on plant hormones in the 1920s through the 1940s.
Particular attention will be given to connections between academic plant
biologists, the chemical industry, and government agricultural agencies in the
development and dissemination of this innovation after the war. While a history
of plant physiology will have intrinsic interest and utility, the study aims to
examine broader issues, such as emerging links between science, industry and the
state forged during the war and patterns of agricultural research and
development that have persisted from that era through the recent recombinant DNA
revolution and thus inform biotechnology today.
