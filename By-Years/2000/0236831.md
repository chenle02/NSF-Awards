PECASE: Spectral Directional Radiative Properties of Rough Si at Elevated
Temperatures

Zhuomin Zhang

This is an NSF CAREER/PECASE grant for research on the radiative properties of
silicon at elevated temperatures. The principal investigator will conduct
measurements of the directional radiative properties of Si wafers with polished
and rough surfaces from room temperature up to 1000 C and from 0.4 to 20
micrometers. The theoretical part of the study will emphasize the effect of
surface roughness on emittance and transmittance. The fundamental mechanisms,
such as the temperature dependence of the carrier scattering rate and photon-
enhanced absorption, will also be investigated.

The radiative properties of rough Si determined from this project will be used
in a detailed heat transfer analysis to predict the emitted and reflected
radiation from the wafer to the radiometer and the rapid thermal processing
(RTP) chamber to optimize the RTP chamber design. In addition, an integrated
educational plan is proposed to advance thermal science engineering education
through the development of a microscale thermal science program and the writing
of appropriate instructional and laboratory manuals.
