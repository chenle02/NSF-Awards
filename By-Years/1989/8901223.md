This award provides funds to the Department of Biology at Princeton University
to establish a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site. An information
package describing Princeton's summer REU program will be sent to over 350
colleges and universities across the United States. Special efforts will be
directed toward recruitment of minority students. A faculty committee will
select participants (mostly about to enter their senior year) by competitive
criteria (academic record; letters of recommendation; statement of purpose). To
demonstrate its commitment to the summer undergraduate research program,
Princeton University has agreed to match funds to support up to three additional
minority student: e.g., for every minority student selected to participate in
the program, Princeton will donate monies to support a second minority student.
The REU program is modelled after the research-oriented component of Princeton
University's undergraduate curriculum in Biology. Participants from other
schools will visit in the spring, to meet with several faculty members of their
own choosing and to discuss the research ongoing in their laboratories.
Participants will then select a faculty advisor, under whose guidance they will
formulate a detailed research plan and be assigned specific readings from the
primary scientific literature, to be completed before their return at the
beginning of the summer. From June 15 through late August, they will conduct
research under close faculty supervision and both hear and present research
seminars. Where merited, their results will published. Each student will submit
a written report about the progress of their research and the impact of the
program upon their career goals.
