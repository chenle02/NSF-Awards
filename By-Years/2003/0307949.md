"Hands-On Optics" is a comprehensive, national level program that introduces
middle school youth to the science of optics using hands-on kits, modules and
related activities. Six optics modules will be developed for use in after-school
and weekend programs. Modules will focus on engaging topics such as
kaleidoscopes, optical illusions, magnifiers and solar telescopes while
exploring the principles of reflection, refraction, light and vision. "Hands-On
Optics" will be introduced at four MESA sites in California and then
disseminated to 13 other sites in California, Arizona, Oregon, Colorado, New
Mexico, New York and Maryland. Additional dissemination venues include four
science centers and two NSF-funded research centers. Students will also develop
optic projects for competitions and participate in Industry Shadow Days, while
parent workshops and a supporting website will provide guidance on careers.
"Hands-On Optics" is projected to serve 39,500 students over a three-year
period.
