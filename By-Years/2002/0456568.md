&lt;br/&gt;This proposal consists of several projects, each of which will
increase our ability to interpret future data on physics beyond the standard
model. &lt;br/&gt;The first part concerns the connection of Supersymmetry with
Higgs physics. &lt;br/&gt;Also predictions are made of what type of experimental
results will be found if physics is described by a Higgless extension of the
Standard Model as well as by a grand unified SO(10) model. In these models, loop
corrections will be calculated which will effect theCP phases, including both CP
violating and CP conserving but large possible effects. These effects will be
important in analyzing data. The PI will also analyze in these models physics in
the Higgs sector, rare B decays, electric dipole moments, the muon g-2, and dark
matter (by considering the thermal equilibrium relic density).
