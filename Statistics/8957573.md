This research is concerned with Inverse Problems, that is, making inferences
about the world from indirect and distorted data. Particular examples include:
study of the geodynamo and earth's magnetic field at the core-mantle boundary
using satellite and observatory mearurements of the magnetic field. study of the
three-dimensional seismic velocity structure of Earth using observations of
ground motion after earthquakes. "deblurring" images and recovery of missing
frequencies in wideband signals in exploration seismology, spectroscopy.
Progress in inverse theory requires new methods for measuring the uncertainty
given nonlinear physical constraints, and nonlinear data relations. New
techniques will be developed and applied to rigorous inference of nonlinear
problems with nonlinear prior information.
