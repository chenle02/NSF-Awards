This award supports participation of US-based researchers, including invited
speakers, recent Ph.D. recipients, and graduate students, in the international
workshop "Practical and Structural Model Theory" held at the University of
Leeds, UK, July 25-29, 2022. The model-theoretic notion of o-minimality was
developed around 40 years ago and has had considerable impact in several parts
of mathematics. This meeting is devoted to o-minimality in all its aspects and
provides a unique opportunity for graduate students and beginning researchers to
get involved with, and contribute to, this exciting
area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than twenty leading researchers will present
invited talks at the workshop, covering three general themes: (i) the model
theory of o-minimal structures and theories, including the classification of
definable groups, (ii) applications of o-minimality, including to algebraic and
Diophantine geometry, and (iii) generalizations of o-minimality, including NIP
theories, distality, and applications to combinatorics.
