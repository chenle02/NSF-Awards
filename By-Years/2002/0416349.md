With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor
Marcin Majda of the University of California-Berkeley is investigating the
viscoelastic properties of water at the air/water interface. Electrochemistry
and electron spin resonance (ESR) techniques are being employed with amphiphilic
derivatives of TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy free radical) as
probes. By selecting different polar head groups exhibiting progressively
greater immersion depth, the lateral diffusion constants obtained by ESR and
electrochemistry are being interpreted in terms of the apparent viscosity of the
aqueous interfacial region. An area of focus is on the implementation of ESR
Heisenberg spin exchange in the study of interfacial processes.

The experimental strategies being pursued are enabling new insights into aqueous
interfaces, such as those formed by emulsions, water droplets in the atmosphere
and phospholipid membranes contacting water.
