Long-term Research: Environmental Ethanol as a Potential Factor Maintaining the
Alcohol Dehydrogenase Polymorphism in Drosophila Melanogaster This award
recommendation is made under the Program for Long and Medium-Term Research at
Foreign Centers of Excellence. The program is designed to enable young U.S.
scientists and engineers to conduct long-term research abroad at research
institutions of proven excellence. Awards provide opportunities for the conduct
of joint research and the utilization of unique or complementary facilities,
expertise and experimental conditions in foreign countries. The award will
support a 15-month research visit by Dr. J. Fry, University of Michigan Ann
Arbor, with Dr. Jean R. David, Laboratoire de Biologie et Genetique Evolutives,
Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Gif-sur-Yvette, France. The award
recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate, international travel,
local travel abroad, stipend, dependents' allowance, if applicable, and a flat
administrative allowance of $250.00 for the U.S. home institution.
