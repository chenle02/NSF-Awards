9521231 WAKEHAM Degradation rate constants for several planktonic lipid compound
will be investigated under controlled laboratory conditions. Activity of benthic
animals was the most likely factor causing the difference observed between rate
constants in oxic and anoxic sediments profiles measured in the field. Animals
can alter oxic/anoxic boundaries, control material transport processes, directly
or indirectly affect microbial populations, and directly consume organic
detritus. Differences under oxic versus anoxic conditions in remineralization
efficiency and formation of intermediate products show that degradation follows
different pathways. Research will specially consider the effects on degradation
and preservation of planktonic lipids of grazing, bioturbation and oscillation
between oxic and anoxic conditions caused by benthic animals. Radiolabelled
tracers degradation rates and pathways under various influences of benthic
animals. Further intensive study of the structure of metabolites produced during
incubation experiments will provide a more detailed picture of the degradation
of these important compounds.
