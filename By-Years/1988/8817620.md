The study is aimed at understanding the changes in chemistry and circulation of
the SE Indian Ocean during the glacial late Quaternary. The specific questions
that the study will focus on concern the vertical distribution of dissolved
nutrients and oxygen deficit in the deep and intermediate waters during the last
glacial, and upwelling off NW Australia as predicted by climate reconstructions
of that time. Cores are planned to be collected from the NW Australian margin by
the Australian Bureau of Mineral Resources ship Rig Seismic. These will be
analyzed for the calcium carbonate and organic carbon content, as well as stable
isotopes to answer the proposed questions.
