This award provides funds to assist in the purchase of a modern scanning
electron microscope (SEM) for research in systematic biology and paleoecology at
the Oklahoma Museum of Natural History (OMNH). In addition, the funds will
assist in the purchase of a critical point dryer and a sputter coater, items
required for the preparation of some types of materials for study with the SEM.
The SEM to be purchased operates with variable pressure in the specimen chamber,
and thus can image specimens at low pressure that are large (e.g., dinosaur
teeth), too fragile (e.g., block of trilobite-rich shale), or too rare to be
studied with conventional SEM preparation techniques. In addition, the SEM is
capable of imaging very small, coated specimens (e.g., pollen, flowers) in the
conventional high magnification/high pressure mode. Initially the instrument
will be used by faculty/curators, research associates, graduate students, and
undergraduates for studies of the systematics and evolution of flowering plants
and heterosporous ferns, early Cretaceous vertebrates, Lower Paleozoic and
Cenozoic bats, and other small mammals. The availability of the microscope will
improve the research and educational capabilities of the University, and improve
the museum's ability to preserve biological, paleontological, and archeological
specimens while insuring their availability for research.
