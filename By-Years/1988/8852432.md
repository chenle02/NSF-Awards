This award provides funds to purchase equipment for a newly developed laboratory
course in the Department of Psychology at Bryn Mawr College. This course will
teach female undergraduates sophisticated techniques to enable them to conduct
advanced, publishable research in neural and behavioral sciences. The course
will use oscilloscopes, waveform generators, brain stimulators and will deal
with Ohm's law, Kirchoff's laws, Thevin's theorem, resistor capacitor networks
for low-pass and high-pass filters. Ultimately students will simulate the
electrical properties of nerve conduction and ionic conductances. A sciatic
nerve lab will introduce the student to principles of recording and to classic
nerve conduction experiments. The goal will be the understanding of principles
of volume conduction, especially as they apply to the recording of remote
potentials in the brain. Use will be made of stimulators, digital oscilloscopes
for examination of waveform, and the electrophysiological amplifiers. Chronic
recording of EEG will use the computer and the amplifier and the band pass
amplifier to enable the student to use power spectral analysis of endogenous
rhythmic activity in order to correlate such activity with behavior. Students
could conduct research projects on the relation of hippocampal theta rhythms and
pharmacological manipulations on recorded activity of single cell. Students will
learn how to use the digital oscilloscope and the computer software packages in
order to determine the criteria for identifying single units. The grantee
institution is matching this NSF award with funds from non-Federal sources.
