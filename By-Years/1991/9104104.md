The oxidation of water to molecular oxygen is a characteristic reaction
associated with photosynthesis in higher plants and cyanobacteria. Light quanta
producing excitation of the photosystem results in the transfer of electrons one
at a time until four electrons are removed from two water molecules to produce
O2. Drs. Sauer and Klein are investing the chemical intermediates involved in
this transfer of electrons and in the storing of the oxidizing equivalents
needed to yield O2. Manganese is involved in the water-splitting enzyme, and
they are using X-ray absorption spectroscopy to determine the oxidation states,
ligation and local structure around the Mn. Together with studies using EPR
spectroscopy, their results have verified the direct participation of Mn
oxidation state changes in the water-splitting process. This proposal aims to
characterize further the structure of the quartet of Mn atoms involved, the
essential cofactors, inhibitors and protein ligands through the use of X-ray
absorption spectroscopy, electron-nuclear and electron-electron double resonance
spectroscopies. They hope to learn, most importantly, how water becomes
incorporated into the water-splitting enzyme prior to the final formation and
release of O2. Knowledge of this process will be most useful in development
artificial systems whereby solar energy can be used to convert water into
molecular oxygen and hydrogen fuel.
