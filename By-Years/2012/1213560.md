In this award, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the
Division of Chemistry, Professor Gordon Brown of Coker College and his
undergraduate student researchers will be supported to study the intermolecular
bonding in: (1) van der Waals complexes between carbon dioxide and nitrogen
heterocycles and (2) complexes between halogen-containing small molecules and
Lewis bases. The researchers will study these species with chirped-pulse Fourier
transform microwave spectroscopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microwave spectroscopy is
an important physical chemical method that gives precise information about
molecular geometry and binding. The classes of species that Professor Brown and
his students will study will provide information on potential carbon-
capture/storage materials as well as fundamental information about the
intermolecular interactions between halogen-containing species. The
undergraduate students working on this project will gain useful experience in
conducting physical chemical research with state-of-the-art equipment, and will
be well-prepared for further study in the chemical sciences.
