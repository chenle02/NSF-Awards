The Division of Chemistry supports William Eckenhoff of Rochester University as
an American Competitiveness in Chemistry Fellow. Dr. Eckenhoff will work on
studying the photocatalytic activity of molybdenum and tungsten dithiolate
complexes for the reduction of water to hydrogen. The PI will collaborate with
scientists at the 'Powering the Planet' Center for Chemical Innovation. The
ultimate goal of this research is to develop inexpensive, efficient
photocatalysts for the generation of hydrogen fuel. For his plan for broadening
participation, Dr. Eckenhoff will participate in a number of activities
(including the American Chemical Society's Project SEED) which are specifically
aimed at mentoring high-school age students from underrepresented groups.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research like that of Dr. Eckenhoff is aimed at developing
improved photocatalysts for water reduction - to enable the generation of
chemical fuel from water and sunlight. The results of research like this can
help society come up with energy alternatives to fossil fuels. The efforts at
broadening participation being pursued by Dr. Eckenhoff are aimed at encouraging
young people from underrepresented groups to pursue careers in the sciences.
