This award is made under the high performance connections portion of NCRI's
"Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64. It provides partial
support for two years to create a gigapop centered around the University of
Maryland-College Park (UM-CP) and the University of Maryland-Baltimore County
(UMBC). The two campuses are connected by an OC-48 line, which also connects to
the vBNS at OC-3. Other research institutions in the Baltimore area connect
through UMBC, while Washington area research institutions connect through UM-CP.
Applications include projects in remote sensing data collection and
distribution, atmospheric science, the Earth Observing System program,
interactive visualization, and large-scale intelligent document retrieval.
Collaborating institutions include most of the Internet 2 institutions and
several NASA facilities.
