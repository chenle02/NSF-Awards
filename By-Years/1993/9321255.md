This research is on test paradigms for high-frequency, linear and nonlinear
mixed signal circuits and systems. Issues in BIST (Built-In Self-Test) and
design for testability are being addressed. Fault models for hard faults (open
or short circuits) and for soft faults (deviations from nominal component
values) are being developed. For BIST design, a high speed, low power, current
mode copier is employed as the sample/hold circuit to achieve 10 ns/sample at
0.1% accuracy under 3.3V power supply. Both CMOS and BiCMOS technology are being
used. Design for testability work focuses on properly selecting component values
and topological structure to increase testability and diagnosability. The
problem of determining component values is formulated as an optimization problem
which includes testability strategy as a parameter. The new methods are being
tested on realistic circuits.
