Staples&lt;br/&gt;1437387&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed
research is to investigate microfluidic flow of gases inspired by the manner in
which insects manage to pump gas through their microscopic breathing air ducts.
The project aims to develop a combination of theoretical and computational tools
to explore novel microfluidic methods for gas transport. In particular, the PI
will capitalize on her group's ongoing research that studies 3D gas transport in
arthropods. The research objectives include theoretical methods to obtain
reduced order models for flow in inelastic tubes, and computational methods to
develop meshfree simulations of the process. Using this simulation approach, one
of the objectives of the proposed research is to assess the validity of using an
inelastic tube with local contractions in a practical microfluidic-system for
gas transport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current gas microfluidic devices are mostly
2D geometries and are indistinguishable from liquid microfluidic devices. They
generally consist of smooth, straight channels with uniform cross sections, and
are in general ineffective. However, this project is focused on exploring
exactly this recently discovered paradigm inspired from nature: gas transport in
insect respiratory systems relies on inelastic but locally collapsible tracheal
tubes, which differs from macroscopic transport or liquid flow across small
spaces. This research program can lead to designing novel microfluidic
strategies and devices. Poor gas flow distribution capacities severely limit
many microfluidics applications important to public health and industry. In
addition to the cooling of handheld electronics devices, many artificial tissue
growth and medical lab-on-a-chip technologies are currently limited because of
ineffective 3D gas distribution at the microscale. The proposed work could
potentially have a profound impact in these fields.
