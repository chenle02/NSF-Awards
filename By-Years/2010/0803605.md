The Web is enormous and in constant flux, causing much content to be lost over
time. Historical collections of web content are thus of monumental value in
preserving records of significant aspects of modern society. The Internet
Archive offers access to hundreds of billions of historical web page snapshots.
The scale of such archives, however, presents tremendous challenges to making
this content fully searchable. This research effort investigates efficient and
effective approaches to store, index, and retrieve web content from large-scale
historical archives. In addition, the temporal content and structure of the
archives are mined to exploit temporal characteristics that can improve search
result ranking. Technological advances from this work are being tested on
content from and in collaboration with the Internet Archive and integrated into
its infrastructure, enabling new archival search capabilities for the public.
