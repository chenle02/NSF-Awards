Many existing senior integrated systems labs typically focus on control of
single-input/single-output processes that are no longer representative of modern
multivariable processes in manufacturing, robotics, and aerospace applications.
By performing practical control/robotic experiments which utilize floating point
processors, the student engineer can obtain the training for coping with multi-
input/multi-output systems such as a two-link robot manipulator or an inverted
pendulum. To simplify the use of floating point processors, the Robotics and
Machine Automation Laboratory (RAMAL) Development group at the Clemson
University Center for Advanced Manufacturing (CAM) has developed a WINDOWS
MATLAB software interface which allows the user to program control algorithms
for a high speed, floating point processor (i.e. the TYS320C30) in a
straightforward manner.In this project, an Undergraduate Integrated Systems
Laboratory (USIL) is developed in which seniors perform a sequence of laboratory
experiments involving mechanical design, power amplification design, control
design, and computer interface design. After the initial set of experiments, the
students are required to integrate these various subsystem designs for
experiments such as the inverted pendulum and a two-link robot manipulator. This
project promulgates the transfer of the WINDOWS MATLAB software into the
undergraduate curriculum through the use of six C30 workstations and the
necessary supporting hardware.
