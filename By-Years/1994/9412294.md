9412294 Beckham This Research Initiation Proposal is to support the development
of novel polymers based on molecular mobilities of individual components. The
molecular mobilities are specified by the time scale and geometries of motion as
determined by 2D exchange NMR spectroscopy. A polymer, polyrotaxane, will be
constructed by threading a relatively immobile linear component with a mobile
cyclic one. By the judicious choice of components based on molecular mobilities,
technologically useful materials will emerge. ***
