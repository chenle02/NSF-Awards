This award provides partial support for the 2009 Conference on Quantum Fluids
and Solids. The conference brings together both experimental and theoretical
expertise in an interdisciplinary framework to resolve outstanding problems in
condensed states of matter including superconductivity, superfluidity, and
supersolids. The connections between vortex structure and dynamics, manifest in
cold condensates of atoms, superfluids, and superconductors will be presented.
Quantum effects that have recently been uncovered in mechanical systems, and in
systems of low dimensionality in liquid and solid helium, as well as in novel
materials will be a focal point. The significance of the breadth of the topics
in this conference is to provide an exceptional educational opportunity for
young scientists and students. Additionally the most promising new research
directions and their applications will be established through active discussions
and workshops organized within the conference program. The conference will be
held on the Northwestern University campus, August 5-11, 2009 with the
expectation of 250 participants. This project is co-funded by the Division of
Materials Research and the Division of Physics.
