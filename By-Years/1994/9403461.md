This project is concerned with the development of implementing new matrix
decomposition algorithms for solving the systems of linear algebraic equations
arising when orthogonal spline collocation (that is, spline collocation at Gauss
points) is applied to separable, second order, linear problems on rectangular
regions. These algorithms have application in the solution of nonseparable
boundary value problems, problems on general regions, and time dependent
problems. The success of matrix decomposition algorithms depends on knowledge of
the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices arising in corresponding two-point
boundary value problems in one space dimension. Knowledge of such an eigensystem
with respect to one coordinate variable reduces the original two-dimensional
discrete problem to solving a collection of independent discrete two-point
boundary value problems with respect to the other coordinate variable. A
software package is developed implementing orthogonal spline collocation
algorithms with polynomials of arbitrary order on nonuniform partitions in each
coordinate direction. The package includes, as a special case, a fast transform
solver for piecewise Hermite bicubic orthogonal spline collocation for Poisson's
equation in various coordinate systems.
