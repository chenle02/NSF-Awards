This award supports a two-year collaborative research project between Max
Cooper, M.D., of the University of Alabama at Birmingham and Professor Takeshi
Watanabe of Kyushu University. on the analysis of the function of the surface
antigen BP-1/6C3 expressed on mouse hematopoietic cells (mostly B-lymphocytes)
and analysis of its possible influence on B-lineage differentiation. Cell
surface proteins expressed by developing B lymphocyte precursors are involved in
regulatory interactions with other cell types in hemopoietic tissues that help
orchestrate this entire process. The antigen identified by the BP-1 antibody is
a good candidate for this type of function since its expression is restricted to
early B-lineage cells, and it may modulate their proliferation. BP-1 is a cell
surface metallopeptidase, animopeptidase A (APA). To determine the function of
APA in B cell development, two strategies will be followed. First, transgenic
mice expressing APA driven by the immunoglobulin heavy chain promoter and
enhancer will be constructed. Study of this transgenic mouse model will permit
the determination of the effect of prolinged expression of APA beyond the early
B cell stage where its expression is normally extinguished. An alternate
informative approach will be to disrupt the APA gene by homologous
recombination. Since BP-1/APA is expressed in a variety of tissues outside of
the homopoietic lineage, these "knockout" mice should also help to define the
necessity for and function of this enzyme in other systems. The expertise of the
U.S. and Japanese groups is complementary and collaboration has been in progress
for several years. Dr. Cooper's group has made appropriate monoclonal
antibodies, cloned the corresponding c-DNA, and established its aminopeptidase A
activity. Dr. Watanabe's group is well known for their expertise in molecular
biology, particularly in the area of B cell gene expression.
