This proposal requests funds for Oceanographic Instrumentation for R/V Pelican,
a 116-foot, general purpose research vessel operated by the Louisiana
Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON) as part of the US Academic Research
Fleet. The vessel has averaged 156 days at sea over the last five years. There
are currently 173 days scheduled in 2022, 100 (58%) of which are for
NSF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this proposal, LUMCON provides technical
descriptions and rationale for the acquisition of the following Oceanographic
Instrumentation:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pacific RO 20 L/hr Reverse
Osmosis System $9,801&lt;br/&gt;WET Labs ECO-FLNTU-RTD Fluorometer/Turbidity
Sensors $13,902&lt;br/&gt;Suite of Spare CTD Sensors $281,478&lt;br/&gt;
$305,181 &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the
present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines
(NSF 19-602). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the
vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded
oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by
the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and
operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any
US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their
research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of
potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
