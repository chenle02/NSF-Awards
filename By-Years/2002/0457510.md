An Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers planning meeting has been
awarded to determine the feasibility of Virginia Polytechnic Institute (VPI) to
join the existing Center for e-Design. The research proposed at VPI will be to
research and develop method tools that support the realization of a new design
paradigm that can be used to develop new engineered products and systems. This
new paradigm will allow design and product realization to be customer driven in
a collaborative e-design environment and support transparent analysis, as well
as virtual simulation and prototyping. The research that is proposed will also
encompass considerations pertaining to the life cycle of the product or system
under development.
