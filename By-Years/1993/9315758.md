9315758 Geskin High pressure waterjet machining is extensively used in the
cutting of non-metallic materials. While abrasive particles can be added to the
jet to machine metallic materials, such modification reduces the life of the
nozzle and associated equipment and the beam diameter typically increases. The
project is to investigate the feasibility of modifying the high pressure
waterjet machining process to transform the water microdroplets into ice. It is
expected that such a modification will significantly increase machining rates to
a range somewhere between that of conventional waterjets and that of abrasive
waterjets. It is also expected that the beam diameter can be significantly
smaller than that of conventional abrasive waterjets, increasing the resolution
of the operation. Ice jets may allow materials to be cut more quickly and with
better accuracy, allowing the high pressure waterjet process to find new
industrial applications.
