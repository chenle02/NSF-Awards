9507612 Weil Among three related alleles of the maize waxy (Wx) gene. each
caused by a 2 kilobase Ds insertion into precisely the same site, one allele,
wx-m5:CS7 ((Ds) (CS7), reverts germinally as much as 90 fold less than the other
two even though all three alleles show the same frequent, somatic reversion in
the endosperm. The suppression of CS7 germinal reversion is genetically linked
to Wx, independent of the transposase source and does not suppress excision by
Ds insertions at other loci, suggesting a cis-acting mutation subjecting the CS7
Ds to a novel type of developmental control. The overall hypothesis tested in
this proposal is that, because of a mutation in the CS7 Ds, the host plant can
now suppress this transposon by developmentally restricting how accessible it is
to proper transposase binding. Specifically: 1. The Ds elements in SD7, CS8, and
CS8311B will be sequenced and compared, 2. DNA methylation will be compared and
the excision rate quantitated at different stages during plant development, 3.
The interaction of the DS elements will be tested by assaying the suppressiol of
CS7 germinal reversion in CS7/CS8 heterozygotes, 4. cis- and trans-acting
factors controlling CS7 excision will be identified and 5. maize proteins that
bind the CS7 Ds and the CS8 Ds differently will be identified. %%% The goal of
this research is to understand genetic control mechanisms in plants by examining
mechanisms whereby plants regulate transposable element activity and how they
interact with each other. Three transposons of corn which have inserted into
identical positions on the corn genome have different germinal excision
frequencies although such frequencies are identical in somatic cells. Studies
will be initiated to determine the mechanisms controlling such differences in
the corn plant. These studies will contribute to a more general understanding of
factors regulating gene expression as well as allowing more insight into the
participation of plant host factors in transposition. ***
