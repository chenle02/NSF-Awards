The research is concerned with geometric and computational aspects of modern
nonlinear continuum mechanics, with special emphasis on inelasticity. From a
fundamental standpoint: (i) the research will further explore the Hamiltonian
structure of nonlinear elasticity, plates and shells; (ii) develop a general
framework for nonlinear plasticity, which is physically motivated,
mathematically well-posed and suitable for large-scale inelastic computation. On
the numerical side, a basic objective is to develop computational methodologies
suitable for a supercomputing environment. In particular, (iii) development of
new algorithmic treatments for inelasticity which by-pass current limitations,
such as the necessity for so-called incrementally objective algorithms. Finally,
(iv) the research will use this methodology in applications concerned with
bifurcation and localization problems.
