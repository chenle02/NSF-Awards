9306689 Hall In this project, PI's will carry out a meridional hydrographic
section along about 149 degrees East in the western Pacific contributing to bout
US and international plans for the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE),
along a line designated as WOCE Hydrographic Program (WHP) line P-10. One PI
will oversee the cruise, particularly measurements of hydrographic parameters
and nutrients, and the other will oversee the shipboard Acoustic Doppler Current
Profiler (ADCP) measurements.
