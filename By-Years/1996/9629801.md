Modern higher-order languages such as Scheme and Standard ML provide simple but
powerful tools for controlling complexity through abstraction. For twenty years,
a major goal for research on these languages has been the development of
implementation techniques that bring their performance closer to that of lower
level languages. This project will study techniques for optimizing the use of
memory in higher- order programming languages, using a combination of
theoretical and experimental techniques. Specific activities include: (1)
Development of theoretical methods for proving the correctness of storage
optimizations in compilers. (2) Proof of correctness of several variations of
aggregate update analysis and their associated transformations. (3) Analysis and
experimental investigation of new algorithms for generational garbage
collection. ***
