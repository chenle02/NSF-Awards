9414468 Walker Obstacles encountered in designing low noise, high efficiency,
heterodyne receivers and local oscillator (LO) sources at submillimeter
wavelengths include the quality and cost of waveguide structures. At wavelengths
shorter than 400 um, rectangular waveguide structures, feedhorns, and backshorts
become prohibitively difficult to fabricate using standard machining techniques.
Silicon micro-machining techniques will be used to fabricate high quality
waveguide structures and components for use at submillimeter wavelengths. The
objective of this project is to develop the technology necessary to construct
high efficiency, low-cost heterodyne array receivers and signal sources which
operate into the terahertz frequency range. Silicon laser etching will be
demonstrated by constructing and testing silicon micromachined waveguide mixer
arrays for use at 492 and 850 GHz. These arrays will be built in collaboration
with the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy. ***
