High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is a modern instrumental technique
used to isolate and analyze components in a mixture. Through this project,
Eckerd College chemistry students will apply the theory of liquid chromatography
to experimentation using HPLC instrumentation. The equipment will be used by
both chemistry and marine science students for the isolation, identification,
and quantitation of pigments in marine plants. Students are expected to carry
out a complete investigation including research design, sampling, analysis, and
interpretation of results. Their studies include determining relative
proportions of pigments in various species of marine plants, or in a single
species collected at different sites.
