9308407 Lee This project is on research to increase the foreign gene expression
level in plant cell cultures. This involves studying the cellular and
environmental parameters influencing the efficient production of mammalian
proteins in suspension plant cell cultures and obtaining stronger promoter
systems than those currently available. Also, an understanding of how different
properties of mammalian proteins affect the efficiency of gene expression in
plant cell cultures will be pursued. To facilitate this last objective, the
proteins in this study include monoclonal antibodies, bovine lysozyme, human
interleukin 6 (IL- 6), and the Tac subunit of the interleukin 2 receptor protein
(IL - 2R). In addition to having different structural and biochemical
properties, these products all have important applications in medicine and
biotechnology. ***
