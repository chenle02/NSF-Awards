This research will concentrate on the study of arithmetic aspects of
automorphic forms on a unitary group G in three variables with respect to a CM
extension E/F. Three related topics will be investigated. The first is an
investigation of the coefficients in the Fourier-Jacobi expansion of a
holomorphic automorphic form on G which is an eigenfunction of all Hecke
operators. The coefficients, which are theta functions on an abelian variety
with complex multiplication by E, are determined by the eigenvalues of the Hecke
operators, but no explicit formula is known. It is suggested that the
coefficients are related to special values of L-functions. The second topic
concerns the study of automorphic forms on G and their Fourier- Jacobi
expansions over rings of integers. The third topic is an investigation of the
Galois representations associated to automorphic representations of G. This
research will concentrate on those areas of number theory concerning automorphic
forms of many variables and abelian varieties. The former are functions which
encode much of the information on the number theoretic problem to be solved
allowing one to use the powerful techniques of analysis in the solution. The
latter are geometric objects which are relevant to the number theory problem.
Together these objects form powerful tools to solve the very deep problems of
number theory. This P.I. is a master of these tools and so much of great
interest will result from this research.
