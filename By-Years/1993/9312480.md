9312480 Lande A detector for solar neutrinos will be constructed for siting in a
deep underground laboratory relatively free from backgrounds due to cosmic rays.
The detector will use 100 tons of iodine as the active medium, from which
elemental xenon will be recovered following reactions between the solar
neutrinos and iodine nucei. Data from this detector will confront theories of
stellar processes as well as setting limits on the properties of neutrinos which
have been postulated to explain a deficit in the solar neutrino flux. ***
