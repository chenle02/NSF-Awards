This doctoral dissertation improvement project will study the relative
importance of summer temperature and precipitation in controlling the carbon
balance in peatlands in Alaska and southern Patagonia. Past shifts in the
earth?s rotational axis have differentially affected temperatures in the
northern and southern hemisphere. By examining past rates of carbon
sequestration in cores from peatlands in both hemispheres the importance of past
climate can be inferred.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High latitude regions are
experiencing warming at rates faster than elsewhere on earth. Because warming
affects both the production and the decay of organic matter in peatlands, it is
unclear how warming will affect carbon storage in peatland soils, which account
for about one-third of soil carbon globally. Understanding the fate of carbon
stored in peatlands is key to assessing the global carbon budget.
