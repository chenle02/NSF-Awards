9316474 Ralser The Grenville Orogeny is the last of several period of
deformation to affect the PreCambrian rocks of Southwestern US., but is the
least understood. This project will peruse several indications in existing
geochronology that the effect of the Grenville is present in the form of
greenschist facies shear zones in several mountain ranges in New Mexico. Results
will help understand the distal effects of the Grenville an Older rocks in this
area, and may provide insights into how geochronological work could clarify
distal orogenic effects generally.
