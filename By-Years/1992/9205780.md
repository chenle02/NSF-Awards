This project focuses on the proximal products of the cataclysmic phase (1982) of
El Chichon Volcano which have not been studied in detail before. Specific goals
are: (1) to document the stratigraphy of the proximal deposits, (2) to determine
the facies distribution of various proximal flow and surge units, (3) determine
the type of eruptive activity that produced the various proximal units, (4) to
understand the nature of transport and deposition in the proximal environment,
(5) to interpret surface characteristics of tephra in various bedding types by
using an imaging analysis with the SEM, (6) to investigate the role of
hydromagmatism, and (7) to mimic the eruptive history through 3-D modelling. The
models developed will be important for mitigation of volcanic risks at their
similar volcanoes.
