This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of graduate students and
postdocs attending the "Nineteenth Riviere-Fabes Symposium" that will be held
from April 15-17, 2016, on the campus of the University of Minnesota.

This annual conference, of which the 2016 meeting will be the nineteenth
rendition, honors the mathematical legacies of the late Nestor M. Riviere and
Eugene B. Fabes by focusing on recent developments in analysis, especially in
the field of partial differential equations. The 2016 program will feature four
principal speakers (Andrea Bertozzi, Fanghua Lin, Jonathon Mattingly, and Roman
Vershynin), each of whom will deliver a two-hour lecture. The program allows
ample time for informal discussion among the participants.
