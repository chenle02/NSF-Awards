This project aims to provide a foundation for applying machine learning in
practice. The research component has two goals. Firstly, to develop data
collection and refinement methods that allow machine learning algorithm to
extract structure from data. Secondly, to perform empirical and theoretical
analyses of machine learning algorithms to develop a deeper understanding of
current and new methods, and to uncover the characteristics of datasets that
make them amenable to particular learning algorithms. The education component of
this project aims to provide practitioners with the foundation required to apply
machine learning successfully in practice by providing a deeper understanding of
the type of structure that various learning algorithms can detect, by creating
tools for collecting data, by giving students hands on experience applying
machine learning in practice, and through inter-disciplinary research projects.
These research and education activities are being performed in the context of
several application domains, including mapping global land cover of the Earth
from remotely sensed data, content-based image retrieval of high resolution CAT
scans of the lung, learning to detect anomalies for computer security, and on-
board processing of planetary data. In addition to its contribution to applied
machine learning, this project has the benefit that the successful application
of machine learning to proposed application domains will result in non-trivial
contributions to medicine, computer systems development, and geography.
