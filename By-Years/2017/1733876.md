The European Commission, under its Horizon 2020 program, launched a new project
in 2016: "ICT Policy, Research and Innovation for a Smart Society: Towards New
Avenues in EU-US ICT Collaboration" (the PICASSO project). Under this proposal,
NSF will provide co-funding for US researchers to participate in a symposium
focused on identifying potential technologies for US / EU collaboration at the
intersection of IoT (Internet of Things) and CPS (Cyber Physical Systems). The
workshop will address societally important objectives shared by US and EU
funding research sponsoring organizations, research institutions, and other
stakeholders. This workshop, "Trans-Atlantic Symposium on ICT Technology and
Policy: 5G Networks, Big Data, Internet of Things and Cyber Physical Systems for
a Smart Society," will be held at the University of Minnesota, June 19-20, 2017.
The target audience for the symposium includes leaders in industry, academia,
and government agencies. The workshop will result in greater awareness of shared
EU/US priorities and needs in ICT technology and policy and in enhanced
collaborations. Attendance of approximately 100 is
anticipated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is focused on thematic ICT
(Information and Communication Technology), and topics that are of high priority
for both EU and the US: Cyber-physical systems (CPS), Internet of Things (IoT),
big data, and 5G networks. ICT policy specifically targeting these technical
topics is a cross-cutting activity. The PICASSO Symposium will include keynote
lectures and dedicated sessions in all these areas. The PICASSO project has
produced "Opportunity Reports" in these topics, and these will also be
presented. The workshop will provide inputs to help define opportunities for US/
EU collaboration in these emerging and important areas of research. The agenda
also includes sessions on smart society topics, including smart cities, clean
energy, intelligent transportation, and intelligent manufacturing. A final
report will be prepared for NSF and the European Commission.
