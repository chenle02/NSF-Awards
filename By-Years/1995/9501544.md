An empirical model of the three-dimensional Earth's magnetosphere which will
provide specification of magnetic and electric fields as well as plasma
parameters will be constructed. This effort involves extending the existing
three-dimensional magnetic field model of the magnetosphere by (1) providing
plasma distribution in force equilibrium with the magnetic forces, (2)
determining electric field pattern in the magnetosphere by mapping its pattern
from the ionospheric level, and (3) implementing realistic representation of
global changes during the substorm growth phase. The resulting model will
provide a global specification of magnetic and electric fields together with
plasma parameters (number density, convective flow velocity, and temperature)
without any constraint on the spatial scale size. The effort will be extended to
include a representation of the substorm growth phase. The model will be useful
in providing initial setup parameter values for numerical (MHD, hybrid, or full
particle) simulation to investigate on subsequent dynamical changes.
