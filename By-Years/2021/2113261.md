It is estimated that the Connecticut region has 7,000 unfilled computer jobs and
12,000 unfilled jobs in advanced manufacturing. Although African American and
Latino workers now represent 29% of the general workforce population, they
comprise only 15% of the computer science and 16% of the advanced manufacturing
workforce. To increase access to these high-paying technical jobs, this project
will design and implement a five-week program intended to increase the interest
of inner-city high school students in computer science applications in advanced
manufacturing. The program activities will take place at Connecticutâ€™s Community
Colleges, with significant input from regional computer science and advanced
manufacturing industries. The overall goal of the project is to motivate high
school students to pursue careers as STEM technicians, thus helping to address
advanced technology workforce needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will
implement problem-based learning to teach students the process of solving real-
world, industry-relevant challenges that include the building, programming, and
flying of drones. In addition, it will help students learn professional skills
such as teamwork and leadership, through participation in the challenges and
through internships in related industries. Strategies to support student
persistence will include mentoring, career profile videos, student success
stories, and guest speakers from industry. The project will provide professional
development workshops for high school and community college educators. These
workshops will focus on how to use drones to introduce computer science and how
to integrate professional skills into the curriculum. The participating teachers
will develop curriculum modules that will be distributed nationally and
contribute to the sustainability of the project. This project is funded by the
Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of
technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's
economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
