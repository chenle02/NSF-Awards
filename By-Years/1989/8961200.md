The objective of this research will be to develop a new graph- theory based
technique to convert a variational geometry description to a constructional
system. Preliminary research in two-dimensions has indicated the prospect of
dramatically increasing the speed of variational geometry solution, and thus
increasing the range of problems to which it may be applied. Successful
implementation in a mechanical design package will greatly expand the utility of
conceptual design software to the mechanical engineer.
