The patch clamp electrode has allowed the study of single ion channels in cells
in culture. Although the technique has proven to be a powerful tool, as
presently used, it has several drawbacks: Only one cell can be studied at a time
and cells eventually "die" from exposure to the high salt content which fills
the electrode. This research project involves replacing the present pipette-type
of patch clamp electrode with one constructed using state-of-the-art microchip
technology.
