9612303 Pickering Alloy dissolution involves the selective removal of one
component of the alloy under the action of a corrosive medium in a particular
service environment. As the alloy leaching occurs, the mechanical properties of
the alloy deteriorate significantly. The mechanisms of dealloying in metal
alloys are under study in this grant. Several research thrusts are underway,
including (1) the effects of lattice strain on the electrochemical behavior and
surface morphology of alloys undergoing selective dissolution; (2)
characterization of surface morphology, chemical composition and correlation
with current at early transient stages of dealloying, below and above the
critical potential; (3) evaluation of the effects of key inhibitors and
surfactants on the dealloying behavior; (4) the significance of underpotential
deposition with regards to the dissolution- redeposition mechanism; (5)
evaluation of the magnitude and consequences of ohmic potential drop within the
electrolyte that fills the pits that form upon dealloying above the critical
potential; (6) application of scanning tunneling microscopy to study dealloying
with increased spatial resolution. The research covers a variety of alloys in
the copper, zinc, and amalgam families. %%% This grant addresses a serious
problem in industry and civil infrastructure, dealloying and its degrading
effects on metal alloys. The problem affects a wide variety of alloys and
components, high strength steels, superalloys, machine parts, faucets and water
pipes, and even dental fillings. ***
