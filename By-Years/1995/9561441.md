DMI-9561441 Bromberg This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
has the potential to substantially reduce the energy consumed in distillation
processes, particularly for separating azeotropes and other close-boiling
mixtures. It also has the potential to improve product purity, reduce
environmental pollution and reduce equipment costs. The project proposes a novel
process in which azeotropic distillation is augmented with reversible gel
absorption requiring approximately half the energy of conventional azeotropic
distillation, as components in a mixture can be selectively absorbed and
recovered without undergoing a phase change. Whereas conventional hybrid
processes are generally limited to aqueous azeotropes, the gel system is
expected to be useful for a broad range of commercially important aqueous and
non-aqueous mixtures. The objective of the Phase I investigation is to
synthesize and characterize a gel suitable for at least one commercially
important azeotropic system. The project will build on recent work in which
polyethylene-based gels were found to absorb components selectively from
mixtures of close-boiling liquids. Information on gel selectivity and the phase
transition process will be obtained and used to estimate energy costs for the
new process. Further enhancement of gel performance is planned for Phase II,
including a study of absorption kinetics and a pilot-scale demonstration. If
successful, the gel-absorption hybrid distillation process will be of use in the
organic chemical and petroleum industries. It is of particular interest for
distillation and purification of ethanol-water and will enable economical reuse
and recycling of solvents in the specialty chemical, pharmaceutical and medical
industries, where the addition of an entrainer compromises product purity. The
process promises to save $100-300 million per year in energy costs,
substantially increase azeotropic distillation capacity at small capital cost,
and create a new $5-50 million market for se paration gels.
