High-speed connectivity to remote state and national cyberinfrastructure
resources such as advanced computing systems, data stores, and scientific
instrumentation is crucial in states like South Dakota. For this project, the
South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSM&amp;T) and Black Hills State
University (BHSU) are collaborating with the University of South Dakota (USD) to
transform the way campus and state networks are designed and operated by
addressing the unique challenges of deploying accessible cyberinfrastructure in
a rural state. Specifically, SDSM&amp;T and BHSU are building out campus network
infrastructure in support of multidisciplinary research and education including:
advanced imaging and microscopy, underground science, weather prediction, and
high throughput genetic sequencing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a system
architecture conceived and designed in year 1 and deployed in year 2 this
project aims to increase STEM research and education productivity in western
South Dakota by re-architecting campus networks and regional aggregation points
so that they are optimized for current and future research and education
applications. Architectural characteristics include aspects of the Science DMZ
approach to streamline academic data flows; improved wired and wireless
connections within and between science buildings and the network core; network
measurement leveraging existing campus edge PerfSONAR nodes as well as new nodes
at each campus core; data transfer nodes based on the Flash IO Network
Appliance; and Globus middleware for data movement. With guidance from state,
regional, and national advisors this collaboration is establishing an
aggregation model for accessible cyberinfrastructure in rural regions where
under-resourced institutions are the norm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
