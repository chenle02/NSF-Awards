This is a project at the crossroads of algebraic combinatorics and geometry.
Algebraic varieties are the solution sets to systems of polynomial equations and
are the central objects in algebraic geometry. Determinantal varieties are an
important class of such algebraic varieties. They appear in Schubert calculus, a
branch of algebraic geometry, that plays a central role in the study of
combinatorial positivity questions. The PI will study generalizations of
determinantal varieties as well as the combinatorial objects that govern them.
This project will provide opportunities for collaboration with undergraduate,
graduate, and postdoctoral researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary focus
will be on three families of varieties: symplectic matrix Schubert varieties,
alternating sign matrix varieties, and quiver loci. The PI will develop the
theory of diagonal Gr√∂bner geometry through the study of related combinatorial
structures. The PI also seeks explicit formulas to compute the Castelnuovo-
Mumford regularity of alternating sign matrix
varieties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
