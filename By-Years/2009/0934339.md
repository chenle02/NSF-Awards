IIP 0934339 Florida Atlantic University Furht

Florida Atlantic University (FAU) is planning to join the existing
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) entitled "Center for
Advanced Knowledge Enablement" (CAKE) which was established as a single-
university Center in 2008 at Florida International University (FIU).

CAKE conducts research in performance studies, benchmark evaluations, and the
application of novel algorithms, routines, data models, network analyses and
software tools to large-scale data sets. The goal of the FAU site is to provide
the synergy to the Center, include additional industry partners, and provide
collaboration between FIU and FAU researchers, and industry partners. The FAU
faculty of the proposed I/UCRC site will carry out research in existing and new
technologies for various Web-based applications, video compression and
communication, video transcoding systems and servers, next generation of
hardware/software development techniques and tools for mobile devices, and RFID-
based automation systems. The research plans at the FAU site are well laid out
and promise high likelihood of success.

The activities proposed have a wide ranging impact on the industry for improved
application of data management and access. The addition of FAU as a research
site helps the Center expand the interaction of researchers, students, and
industry members beyond one university, and broadens participation of
underrepresented groups in several ways. FAU plans to expand opportunities of
mentoring and graduating computer scientists from under-represented populations
at the BS, MS, and PhD levels, and will extensively involve female students via
its faculty affiliation with the FAU's Women in Computer Science student
organization. FAU also plans to include other US universities and international
collaboration in the framework of the Latin American Grid Project, an existing
NSF PIRE project, and other collaborations with European, South American, and
Asian universities.
