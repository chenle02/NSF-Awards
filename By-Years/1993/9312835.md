Linguistic theory and computation have both made substantial progress over the
past decade. However, the connections between the two have not been as carefully
elucidated, so that the synergy between linguistic science, which in effect
describes data structures, and computer science, which describes the algorithms
engaging those data structures, has not been fully realized. Partly for this
reason, current application systems by some estimates lag behind linguistic
theory by 5-10 years. This 2-day workshop aims to bring together researchers in
both linguistic science and computation to address this gap, with the aim of
producing a book of collected consensus and divergent views on this important
topic.//
