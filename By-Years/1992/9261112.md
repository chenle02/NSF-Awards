This project addresses methods to provide practitioners of mathematical
programming with ready access to the advanced linear programming (LP) tools of
Langrangean Relaxation (LR) and Lagrangean Decomposition (LD). These tools are
used primarily to solve mixed integer programs (MIP). These programs arise
naturally in the solution of problems that occur in myriad industrial settings,
such as process industries, manufacturing, finance, government, transportation,
and utilities. Current application of state-of-the-art techniques to the
solution of these problems is clearly held back by a lack of modeling tools.
This project will initiate work which combines one of the best modeling tools --
GAMS -- with the capabilities of LR and LD to provide an advanced modeling
system that will facilitate the solution of large, complex problems, This system
will interactively provide the non- expert user with full access to the power of
modern mathematical programming techniques for use in solving problems within
their own fields of exploration.
