Proposal Number: ECS-961224 Principal Investigator: Howard Milchberg Title: Soft
X-ray Sources and Optics for High Spatial, Temporal and Spectral Resolution
Interferometry Abstract: The research focuses on the construction and
application of a high resolution (25 nm) X-ray microscope to problems in
lithography and biology. The instrument will be suitable either for scanning or
imaging microscopy and has the potential of enabling single shot imaging of
biological samples without distortion of the samples.
