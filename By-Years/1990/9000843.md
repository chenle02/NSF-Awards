This award provides funds to establish a Research Experiences for Undergraduate
site in southeast Wisconsin. Eight highly qualified undergraduates will be
recruited to conduct research, at the Biomedical Research Institute laboratories
on the campus of the University of Wisconsin-Parkside in Kenosha. Based upon
extensive experiences with undergraduate research together with active research
programs, faculty representing the focus of Molecular and Regulatory Biology
will serve as potential project supervisors. This program is designed to develop
each participant's intellectual confidence, technical competence and research
independence via: 1. Guidance by active researchers in the areas of Molecular
and Regulatory Biology. 2. A program of specific goals for each student's
research progress via a meeting and seminar schedule plus instruction in
literature search and seminar presentation techniques complementary to each
project. 3. Amplification of the NSF effort through a commitment to carry over
meritorious students for a second summer of research using internal funding
and/or to support additional students each summer. 4. Aggressive regional
recruitment of superior candidates with special efforts to attract
underrepresented groups plus housing arrangements proximate to the UW-P
laboratories, and, 5. Immediate and long-term evaluation of the NSF-REU
experience.
