In this Experimental Physical Chemistry project, sponsored by the Chemistry
Division, Prof. Anderson (SUNY Stonybrook) will develop a new and powerful
method for preparing polyatomic ions in specific excited vibrational states. The
effect of specific vibrational excitation on ion reactivity will then be studied
by high resolution molecular beam methods. The primary question to be answered
is, "in what range of molecular size and vibrational energy are vibrational mode
effects important?" A clear answer to this question will determine the future
course of research in this field for many years to come. %%% Bonds which hold
molecules together are not rigid; they stretch and vibrate. A long sought goal
of physical chemistry is to influence the course of chemical reactions by
stimulating specific vibrations in order to facilitate breaking specific bonds.
Prof. Anderson (SUNY Stonybrook) will develop a new method for doing this using
simultaneous irradiation by lasers of two different wavelengths. This is
important because the method can be applied to larger and more chemically
relevant molecules than was previously possible.
