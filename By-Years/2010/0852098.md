The Northern Arizona University (NAU) REU Site will provide a research
experience for undergraduates during the summers of 2009-2013. Eight students
will be selected to participate in a 10-week hands-on research experience in
environmental science or a related field under the guidance of an experienced
faculty mentor. Recruitment will focus on tribal and community colleges that
have large Native American and Hispanic enrollments. Existing relationships with
institutions such as Din√© College, Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute,
Navajo Technical College, Fort Lewis College, and Arizona Western College will
facilitate the recruitment of students from these colleges. Students will be
selected based on satisfactory performance in at least one science course, lack
of access to research opportunities, attendance at a tribal or community
college, interest in pursuing a scientific career, match of students' interests
to mentors, and overall academic performance and potential. The first week
consists of an intensive field-based group research project at a local research
station, which will help prepare the students for their individual research
projects. A variety of academic and social activities are scheduled to foster
personal relationships among students and mentors, to encourage the exploration
of relationships between Native American cultures and science, and to enhance
the understanding of environmental issues facing communities on the Colorado
Plateau. Research mentors often have significant external research funding;
therefore, it is anticipated that REU students who continue on to a 4-year
degree program at NAU will be able to continue their research during the
academic year. Moreover, it is anticipated that a significant number of
participants will become co-authors on scientific publications. Students receive
a stipend, single dorm room housing, a dining allowance, and other support. More
