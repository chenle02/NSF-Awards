CMIP5, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (Phase 5) promotes a standard
set of earth system model climate simulations in order to: i) evaluate how
realistic our models are in simulating climate of the recent past, ii) provide
projections of future climate change on two time scales, one near term (out to
about 2035) and one long term (out to 2100 and beyond), and iii) understand some
of the factors responsible for differences in model projections, including
quantifying some key feedbacks such as those involving clouds and the carbon
cycle. This project aims to analyse CMIP5 model output to assess the impacts of
physical processes in the Southern Ocean that influences surface water pCO2
variation, and air-sea CO2 uptake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Systematic model
intercomparisons will be carried out to tackle three main questions: 1) How
significant are the zonal variations&lt;br/&gt;in surface ocean pCO2 throughout
the entire Southern Ocean, hence, how representative are conditions in Drake
Passage of ESMs in other areas of the Southern Ocean? 2) Does the rate of pCO2
increase in the surface waters of the Southern Ocean concur with the increase of
total Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC) upwelled to the ocean surface south of
the fronts? 3) What physical processes can explain the excessive surface water
pCO2 concentrations found near the Polar Front in half of the eight available
ESMs?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increased knowledge of future climate change is in
the interest of the US.
