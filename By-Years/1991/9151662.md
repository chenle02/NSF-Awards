The primary goal of this new Lasers &amp; Spectroscopy Laboratory is to
strengthen the intermediate and advanced laboratory experiments so as to bridge
the gap between strong introductory course laboratories and required senior
research projects. This project involves the overhaul of laboratory experiments
for the Introduction to Modern Physics course and the Advanced Physics
Laboratory for juniors. The advanced laboratory must cover topics in Electricity
&amp; Magnetism, Modern Optics, and Solid State Physics. The current project
concentrates on the optics and spectroscopy aspects of the two intermediate
laboratory courses. The theme is a lasers and spectroscopy teaching laboratory
consisting of four experimental multi- purpose stations. An emphasis on optics
has pedagogical advantages in such a laboratory. The experiments will also
strengthen the preparation of students for their senior research project.
Components for each of the experimental stations are being assembled, tested,
and evaluated by senior students and faculty prior to their integration into the
new laboratories. Some existing equipment will be incorporated into the new
laboratory.
