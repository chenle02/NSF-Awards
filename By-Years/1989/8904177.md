The proposal requested support for the continuation of a multi- faceted project
addressing the role of accessory minerals in the geochemistry of the earth. Over
the past 5-1/2 years, efforts have focused principally on the magmatic behavior
of these minerals in the continental crust. A principal goal has been to
develop, through strategic high pressure-temperature experimentation, predictive
models of accessory phase solubilities in crustal melts. The focus now will
shift largely away from magmatic behavior of accessory minerals to their
behavior under subsolidus or metamorphic conditions, and will include the upper
mantle as well as the crust. The overall goal is to provide (and later apply)
constraints on the role of accessory minerals in trace element geochemistry,
geochronology and heat production in the lithosphere.
