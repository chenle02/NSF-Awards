This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)." &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Analytical and Surface Chemistry
(ASC) program of the Division of Chemistry supports the research program of
Professor Yves Chabal of the University of Texas at Dallas. Prof. Chabal and his
students will examine the surface chemistry and chemical functionalization of
technologically important semiconductor surfaces and nanostructures. The group
will employ surface infrared spectroscopy, arguably the most discriminating and
versatile technique to derive chemical and structural information, in
conjunction with spectroscopic ellipsometry, Raman and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy to study chemical processes on Ge, SiC
and other III-V semiconductor surfaces. The study will be carried out in close
collaboration with several theory groups in order to develop detailed
understanding of the reaction pathways and product structures. The study will
provide students with a unique opportunity to train in an interdisciplinary
field which is of great interest to the chemical and semiconductor processing
industries. Prof. Chabal and his students will contribute to various activities
at UTD aiming to increase the number of students from under represented groups
in science.
