Laminations of gypsum sand and silt, eolian and lacustrine clay, and organic-
rich material occur on a scale of millimeters in late Pleistocene/Holocene lake
sediments in the Estancia Basin in central New Mexico. A feasibility study has
established the seasonal character of the laminae and their potential for
reconstructing a high-resolution chronostratigraphy. The vertical and lateral
continuity of the laminations provides a basis for reconstructing a
stratigraphic sequence on a decimeter scale and a time-series with a temporal
resolution ranging from decimeter decades to centuries. Changes in the
proportion of eolian, lacustrine, and biogenic components reflect changes in
water depth and volume, wind intensity, and in the hydrologic balance of the
closed lake system. Reconstruction of a high-resolution stratigraphy will
eventually permit the measurement of the hydrologic response to climatic forcing
and quantitative estimates of changes in climatic variables. Methods applied
elsewhere to the reconstruction of varve time- series will be adapted to
reconstruct a time-series based on accumulated thickness and composition of
bedding and laminations. These parameters will be measured in closely spaced
samples, indexed to an age model for the reconstructed time-series, and
expressed as sediment flux. The radiocarbon chronostratigraphy will be refined
with additional analyses. The high-resolution stratigraphy in the central area
of the basin will be correlated with shoreline deposits to connect the
stratigraphic record to an improved hydrologic/climatic model for the Estancia
Basin. In addition, the investigation will compile a record of eolian influx and
will help develop methodologies for reconstructing high- resolution
stratigraphic records in other lacustrine basins.
