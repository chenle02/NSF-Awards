This award to Professor Luis Colon of the SUNY at Buffalo is supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division. The proposed
investigations are focused on the synthesis and characterization of silica-based
organic-inorganic hybrid materials for use in high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) and capillary electrochromatography (CEC). The silica
hybrids will be synthesized by copolymerizing alkoxysilanes with hydrolyzable
alkoxide groups. This approach results in the production of chromatographic
materials in different formats (i.e., films, monoliths, and particles), some
with the potential for stability over a wide pH range. The solution chemistry
will be monitored with NMR; the physicochemical characteristics of the organic-
inorganic hybrids will be assessed using ESCA, SIMS, FTIR, SEM and/or TEM,
microbalance gravimetric analysis, and nitrogen gas adsorption methods.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed investigations are directed toward the
synthesis and characterization of silica glasses. Different formats of the
material will be synthesized, suitable for chemical separations. The different
parameters used during the fabrication process will be studied to establish the
reaction conditions leading to materials with the best performance. The
characteristics and compositions of the synthesized glasses will be assessed
using a variety of spectroscopic and physical probes. Fabricated materials such
as these have potential applications to the separation and purification of a
large number of chemicals, ranging from pharmaceutical to environmental areas.
These investigations are part of a long-term research program focused on the
development and study of new and improved materials for chemical separations in
the liquid phase. The research program mainly involves graduate and
undergraduate in executing the experimentation, contributing to the education,
development, and training of a new generation of scientists.&lt;br/&gt;
