Graduate student K. Christopher Beard proposes to study the Plesiadapiformes,
an important group of fossil mammals found, among other places, in the American
West. These extinct species are considered by many to be early primates, though
their evolutionary relationships to this and other mammal groups is a
controversial subject. In order to expand our understanding of this group, Mr.
Beard will concentrate his efforts on an analysis of post-cranial fossils. These
data on limb proportions and biomechanics will also shed light on controversies
regarding the life habits of early primates, specifically, whether they were
arboreal or ground-dwelling. These new data will be combined with information
from the literature into an analysis of evolutionary relationships. Early
primate evolution is far from well understood, and the proposed research would
add a new dimension to the information on which our understanding is based. New
analyses of primate and other early mammmal relations will have wide impact on
vertebrate zoologists and on evolutionary biologists in general.
