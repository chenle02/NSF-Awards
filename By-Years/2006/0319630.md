This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project will investigate a novel
low capacitance design of high purity silicon detectors that offer high-energy
resolution, high efficiency, high count-rate operation and straightforward
fabrication. By maintaining a low capacitance, the new detectors can reach
greater volumes than previously achievable with standard Si (Li) detectors. The
research plan requires a combination of device modeling, prototype fabrication
and extensive testing, with a goal of producing the largest high purity silicon
detectors to date. Collaboration with a manufacturer on this project will bring
great expediency to the work plan and provide an immediate pathway to
commercialization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The detectors will find great use in a
multitude of settings - industrial and academic research labs, portable
instrumentation, and large-scale scientific research. Given the many diverse
areas that employ x-ray characterization, the detectors will be found in fields
such as materials analysis, astronomy, medicine, structural biology, nuclear
physics and environmental monitoring.&lt;br/&gt;
