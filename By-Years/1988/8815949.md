This project will investigate the verification of a theoretical model for the
prediction of fracture of brittle cementitious materials, such as concrete and
ceramics. The results will be very beneficial, not only for predicting the
fracture toughness of cementitious materials, but also enable researchers to
compare data from different experiments, and finally lead to a concensus of
minds on establishing standards for testing the materials in the future.
