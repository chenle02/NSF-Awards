Tapestry: The Institute for Philosophy and Religion will plan the dissemination
of the results of a conference entitled "Stories from the Circle: Science and
Native Wisdom." "Stories from the Circle," initiated in May 2002, brought
together 32 native and non-native leaders in education in native and western
science to discuss the range of ideas and practices that constitute Native
Science and to consider how native ways of learning may be applied to informal
science education. The proposed planning activity would plan multimedia
dissemination of conference outcomes.
