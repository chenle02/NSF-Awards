Network densification - where a multitude of base-stations and access points
with overlapping wireless footprints and disparate capabilities pervade the
physical domain - is the way forward towards meeting the tremendous demand for
mobile data. The main objective of this project is to reevaluate the manner in
which wireless networks are engineered and spectrum usage is managed so as to
exploit dense access infrastructure. The project is expected to make
contributions in three areas: 1) Design, analysis and prototyping of
communications and network protocols to enable unprecedented fine grain control
over transmissions over shared spectrum without requiring high coordination
overheads, by leveraging emerging agile access techniques; 2) Design and
analysis of novel, simple and sparse-state algorithms that leverage the large
flexibility in such systems to achieve near-optimal resource allocations; 3)
Modeling and analysis of extreme dense wireless networks using mean field games
to both evaluate the performance of resource sharing between providers in this
regime, as well as evaluate economic and policy incentives to deploy a range of
contractual structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research activity
relies heavily on the development of sound theory and analysis of extremely
dense networks, algorithmic development, simulation for large-scale systems and
finally prototyping small-scale regimes. The research will serve as a catalyst
towards changing traditional wireless networking paradigm, from one where
infrastructure points connect to many mobiles, to one where a mobile connects to
a large number of infrastructure nodes. The research will be disseminated
broadly to researchers, practitioners and policy makers, leveraging in
particular, a strong industry focused research center, as well as in efforts
reaching out to public high school students, parents and teachers.
