Funding from NSF will support a special occasion conference, "Factor Analysis at
100: Historical Developments and Future Directions." The conference marks the
100th anniversary of the publication of Charles Spearman's seminal and
monumental article, "General Intelligence, Objectively Determined and Measured,"
in the American Journal of Psychology, which outlined the framework of a new
statistical tool in support of his psychological theory about intelligence. The
statistical method was factor analysis. In the 99 years since it was introduced,
factor analysis has become as integral to the development of psychological
science as any method or procedure used in the study of human behavior. Vigorous
methodological research and development continues today on factor analysis and
its various extensions and generalizations, and these methods serve a critical
role in substantive research in many areas of psychology as well as other
sciences. The overarching objective of the conference is to examine the history,
current state and significant issues, and future directions of the theory,
methodology and application of factor analysis. Through this examination, we
hope to clarify the state of the art and future directions of research, and to
facilitate and enhance the quality of continued research with respect to both
methodology and application. These objectives will be achieved by gathering
together the most prominent researchers in the field along with an audience of
scientists and students with a special interest in learning more about the field
and carrying on the development and proper use of factor analysis and related
methods. The bulk of the funding provided by NSF will be used to promote and
support attendance and participation at the conference by graduate students,
university faculty, and researchers with an interest in the theory and
application of factor analysis.
