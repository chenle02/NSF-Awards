Abstract for award DMS-0402044 of Ramakrishnan &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The
general theme of this proposal is the study of the ubiquitous
cusp&lt;br/&gt;forms in various contexts. The four specific problems proposed
deal with the&lt;br/&gt;arithmetic, analytic, geometric and group
theoretic&lt;br/&gt;aspects of these fundamental objects. To elaborate, the
first problem asks&lt;br/&gt;if certain four dimensional Galois representations
attached to cusp forms&lt;br/&gt;are irreducible, and such results are unknown
in dimensions bigger than 3.&lt;br/&gt;The second problem deals with obtaining
*exact* averages of twisted L-values&lt;br/&gt;of holomorphic cusp forms, and
the ensuing implications for class numbers&lt;br/&gt;and a diophantine question.
The third problem suggests that in special but&lt;br/&gt;pervasive instances
(like for the Delta function), there should be&lt;br/&gt;Calabi-Yau varieties
which geometrically realize the associated motives and&lt;br/&gt;hence the
L-functions, which encode the statistical properties of
Frobenius&lt;br/&gt;traces. The fourth problem is concerned with the *-selfdual
representations&lt;br/&gt;of reductive groups G admitting involutions *, and
asks for a study of a&lt;br/&gt;certain sign attached to cusp forms on
G.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate certain mysterious and
deep relations&lt;br/&gt;Between automorphic functions, which are continuous and
pulchritudinous, and&lt;br/&gt;discrete objects like the integers and their
building blocks, namely the&lt;br/&gt;prime numbers, which exhibit haunting
statistical properties. Automorphic&lt;br/&gt;functions encode enchanting
symmetries occurring in nature like the&lt;br/&gt;waveforms on a disk. The
discrete tones therein have alluring arithmetical&lt;br/&gt;meanings. Often
mathematicians and physicists build generating functions&lt;br/&gt;out of
discrete collections of numbers, and the pressing problem is to know
if&lt;br/&gt;these functions admit hidden symmetries, that is, if they are
describing&lt;br/&gt;the tones of automorphic functions. If they do, then
miraculous benefits emerge.&lt;br/&gt;Exploiting them is a worthy endeavor, and
there are many gold mines yet to be
discovered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
