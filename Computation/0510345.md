Many physical, biological, and engineering problems involve linear or nonlinear
wave phenomena in adaptive, multiscale, and uncertain environments. The focus of
this proposal is to design, analyze and apply high-order accurate and highly
efficient numerical algorithms, including high-order weighted essentially non-
oscillatory methods, high-order discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods,
and spectral methods, for effective simulations of such wave phenomena using
computers. Mathematical tools will be used to guide the design of such
algorithms so that they will be able to produce reliable and accurate results
for such complicated wave phenomena with a high speed and hence a fast
turnaround time. This will in turn allow a deeper understanding of the physical
and biological phenomena and also to help in many engineering designs, such as
the design of aircrafts and semiconductor devices. In this project, problems in
applications will motivate the design of new algorithms or new features in
existing algorithms; mathematical tools will be used to analyze these algorithms
to give guidelines for their applicability and limitations; practical
considerations including parallel implementation issues for the computation on
massively parallel computers will be addressed to make the algorithms
competitive in large scale calculations; and collaborations with engineers and
other applied scientists will enable the efficient application of these new
algorithms or new features in existing algorithms. The training of young
researchers in this area will also be an important component of this project.
