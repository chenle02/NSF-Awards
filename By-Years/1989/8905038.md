This is project for research in various areas of computation theory, including
complexity theory, logic programming, and common-sense reasoning. The PI is
continuing the investigation of 0-1 laws for NP problems, an investigation that
studies the asymptotic probabilities of NP problems and identifies the
complexity of computing these probabilities. There is also work on finding
connections between logical definability and average case complexity of NP
problems. The PI is studying the parallel complexity of logical query programs
and shall attempt to develop methods for establishing lower bound type results
about the expressive power of database query languages. Finally, some
computational issues arising in the study of circumscription and in other
related areas of common-sense reasoning are being explored.
