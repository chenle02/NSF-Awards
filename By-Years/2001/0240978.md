ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI/Institution: Spall / WHOI Proposal No:
OCE-0240978&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The export of recently ventilated high latitude
water masses from their formation basins via &lt;br/&gt;narrow boundary currents
is a central, and not well understood, aspect of the global thermohaline
circulation. The primary objectives of the proposed work are: 1) to compare and
contrast lateral exchange with the interior and direct atmospheric forcing as
mechanisms to get recently formed water masses into rapid boundary currents and
2) to determine how these processes are related to the downwelling limb of the
thermohaline circulation. By making use of both high resolution numerical models
and simple theories, this process-oriented approach is designed to illuminate
the dynamical balances in this near boundary regime. Finally, we will build on
this dynamical framework to analyze real data from the Labrador Sea. By
comparing and contrasting model results and data, we will attempt to identify,
in the data, the processes that lead to a densification of the boundary current
in the region and to estimate the rate of export of Labrador Sea water. The
proposed study will have broader impacts spanning both research and educational
activities. The insight gained by this process study will provide the foundation
for parameterizations of this important and presently unresolved component of
the thermohaline circulation for implementation in climate
models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
