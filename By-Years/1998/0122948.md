ABSTRACT--TMCC LDMT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project would work with teachers
who are involved in the RSI reform. It would provide professional development
opportunities to the teachers in the RSI schools, and would develop and
institutionalize standards-based curriculum for reservation schools. These
activities are strongly aligned with the goals of the RSI project. The
professional development offered to teachers would be heavily content-oriented,
with some pedagogical training.
