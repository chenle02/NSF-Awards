9510316 Fano The spatia character of the wavefunctions of simple three- body
systems such as He and H2 are studied using the R-matrix, hyperspherical
expansion technique. This enables a systematic study of how these systems evolve
from small to large hyperadii and the mechanism responsible for ionization and
dissociation of the molecular complex. ***
