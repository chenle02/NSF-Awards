A one-half day Symposium, entitled "Signaling Systems, Venoms and Adhesives:
Recurring Themes and Variations", is proposed for the Second International
Marine Biotechnology Conference (IMBC' 91), October 13-16, 1991. The proposed
Symposium assembles scientists whose studies with marine organisms make major
contributions to our understanding of: (1) receptor systems for exogenous
chemostimulants, neurotransmitters and hormones, (2) substances inhibiting
specific receptors, and (3) the biosynthesis of waterproof adhesives. These
seemingaly disparate subjects are integrated by recurring themes apparent in
receptor structure, mechanisms of transduction, and the synthesis and employment
of similar molecules for diverse functions. The following topics will be
discussed: receptor-mediated larval settlement, the recurrence of a defined
receptor type on echinoderm spermatozoa and mammalian cells, the evolution of
families of venoms blocking specific receptors and ion channels, the role of
peptides, steroids and prostaglandins as both endogenous hormones and exogenous
pheromones and the incorporation of the catechol moiety into both
neurotransmitters and adhesives. The Symposium contents will be summarized and
integrated by the organizers for publication in the Biological Bulletin.//
