Long-term, unattended operation of oceanographic instrumentation is dependent on
the availability of power to operate the instruments. The PIs will investigate
new wave power conversion technologies for use in operating oceanographic
instrumentation at sea.

Current wave energy conversion technologies make wave power bulky and
uneconomical for oceanographic and ocean science applications. The PIs request
funding to investigate enhancements that may enable integration of wave power
conversion hardware into small oceanographic buoys. The proposed effort
represents a significant advance over current wave energy conversion approaches
and is expected to be an important step towards making wave power utilization
cost-effective for ocean sensing applications.
