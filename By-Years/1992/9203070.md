Funds are requested to purchase an ICP-MS to be housed in the School of
Oceanography at the University of Washington. Access to an instrument of this
type does not presently exist in the Seattle area, and there are at least ten
active NSF research grants at the University of Washington which would make use
of the high sensitivity and rapid sample analysis capabilities of the
instrument. Presently identified users are in the School of Oceanography, the
Department of Geological Sciences, and the NOAA- Pacific Marine Environmental
Laboratories.
