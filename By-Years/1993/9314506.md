9314506 Morris This study will use Be and b isotopes as tracers of the Sediment
input into active margin volcanism. Concentrations of 10-Be can be compared
between incoming (subducted) sediment and the volcanic, and used to determine
the proportions of sediment accreted, subducted and recycled. The partitioning
can then be used to determine mass fluxes at margins, to be compared with
estimates derived from seismic imaging.
