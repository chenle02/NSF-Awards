This effort represents the fifth in a series of NSF- supported quinquennial
surveys of undergraduate programs in mathematics and computer science
departments at the Nation's colleges and universities. This project provides
much-needed and unique information on undergraduate courses, enrollments,
faculty, teaching formats and organizational structure in mathematical and
computer science departments in U.S. universities, 4-year colleges and two-year
colleges. These data have not been collected by any other agency at any other
time. This proposal also calls for the establishment of a comprehensive and more
permanent data base of all undergraduate departments of mathematical and
computer sciences in the United States. A relatively recent initiative for NSF,
the lead agency for U.S. science and engineering education, is its undertaking
of the development of a national data base on science and engineering
undergraduate education. This survey, conducted by the Mathematical Association
of America, is an important piece of that initiative, and can serve as a
prototype study for NSF in its development of data for other science and
engineering disciplines.
