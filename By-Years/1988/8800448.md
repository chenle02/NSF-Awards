This grant in Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry provides support for the
research of Dr. Maitland Jones, Jr., Princeton University. The work focuses on
the properties of carbon species which lack the usual full complement of
electrons. Such species, called carbenes, have both unusual physical and
chemical properties. An understanding of their behavior is important as they are
found to be intermediates in a variety of chemical reactions. The spectroscopy
and chemistry of substituted adamantylcarbenes will be investigated as will the
study of gas phase reactions of polycarbenes. A new synthesis of one class of
bridgehead double bond-containing compounds will also be sought as will other
new sources and reactions of polycarbenes. A newly discovered photochemical
source of dihalocarbenes will be used to continue the investigation of reports
of non-sterospecific singlet carbene additions, and to see if the
photochemically generated species differ in properties from the more
conventionally produced intermediates. The new route will be expanded into a
general method for generating divalent carbon. New compounds containing
bridgehead double bonds which are kinetically stabilized by adamantyl blocking
groups will be synthesized, as will a new class of bridgehead double bond
containing molecules that benefit little from pyramidalization. Both the
intermolecular and intramolecular reactions of carbenes with carboranes will be
studied. In the latter case, new carbon-boron bridged intermediates have been
produced, and these will be used to study the effect of neighboring frameworks
of carbon and boron on reactive intermediates. The first carbene alpha to boron
will be synthesized and investigated. An attempt will be made to synthesize both
C-C and C-B carborynes.
