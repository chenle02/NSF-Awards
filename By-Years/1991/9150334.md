This one-year pilot program for experienced community college physics teachers
provides two curriculum development workshops during the 1991-92 academic year
at two geographically dispersed community college campuses. One workshop fosters
the approach of using microcomputer-based laboratories (MBL). The other
advocates employing conceptual exercises (CE) and overview case studies (OCS).
The workshops are derived from successful models that apply findings of
cognitive physics education research.Each three-day workshop is led by two
senior university/college physics professors who played a major role in the
development and promotion of MBL and CE/OCS. These hands-on workshops allow
community college physics teacher participants to gain knowledge about recent
developments in these areas and encourage participants to adapt or develop
curriculum materials which incorporate this knowledge at their own community
colleges.The main goal of this project is to help community college students
develop a stronger understanding of physics. The impact of the workshops is
reinforced afterwards by the establishment of a networking system employing
telecommunications bulletin board systems and a newsletter. Extension of this
program to additional sites in other regions of the country is anticipated.
