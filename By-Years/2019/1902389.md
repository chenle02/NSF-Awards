Dixie State University will organize a proposal-writing workshop at the
University of Nevada at Las Vegas. The main activities of the workshop will be
conducted by NSF staff and include participation of past NSF grant recipients in
the area. The PI estimates that there will be 45 participants at the workshop
from southern Utah and Nevada. She expects attendance from faculty members at
Southern Utah University (SUU), Dixie State University (DSU), the University of
Nevada at Las Vegas, the College of Southern Nevada (CSN), the University of
Nevada at Reno, and Nevada State College (NSC). Twenty-nine of the anticipated
forty-five participants have already expressed an interest in attending. The
grant will cover travel costs for participants from SUU, DSU, and Reno as well
as meals and refreshments for working lunches and discussion breaks during the
workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is designed to raise awareness of
funding opportunities for NSF program in the Division of Undergraduate Education
in a geographical area that does not have any Noyce grants. The program includes
a panel discussion with current NSF grant recipients, an outline of funding
opportunities, a workshop on effective grant writing, a mock review panel, a
brainstorming session to get started on grant writing ideas, and a question and
answer session. Participant selection will focus on a diversity of
representation from different schools and STEM disciplines. Because of the need
for qualified secondary STEM teachers in high-needs schools in this geographical
region, the potential for generating high-impact Noyce proposals is high. The
student population in the targeted schools make them good potential sites for
S-STEM proposals as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
