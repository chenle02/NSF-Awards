This reserch program includes three related projects: 1. Calculation and
visualization of large eddy structures arising in two and three dimensional
viscous flow. 2. Development of numerical algorithms for following propagating
interface in flames and crystals. 3. Analysis of the effect of wavelength
truncation on numerical models for energy cascades. The results from this
research program will have a significant impact on current research on
combustion and related fluid dynamics problems.
