9455764 Dolan This project is Phase II of a two-phase project to develop a two-
course sequence in Manufacturing Systems. The sequence can serve as a model for
manufacturing systems nationally. The project involves the New Jersey Institute
of Technology (NJIT) as the lead institution for the North/Central Educational
Technology Educational Consortium and Camden County College as lead institution
for the Southern CIM Technology Consortium. The consortia operate fully
articulated programs aimed at the AAS and BSET degree in Manufacturing
Engineering Technology. The consortia involve all community colleges in New
Jersey, 13 in the Northern Consortium and 6 in the Southern Consortium.
Articulated curricula of the two consortia include a two-course sequence in
Manufacturing Systems. The sequence is critical to the success of the program.
We have noted significant deviations in course content and emphasis amongst the
consortial colleges. This project will involve faculty from the consortial
colleges in development of model curricula and training modules for the
Manufacturing Systems sequence. It will also identify possibilities for sharing
of laboratory resources in support of the model. The first phase of the project
is complete. This involved soliciting input from the manufacturing sector on
required skills which should be attained from the sequence. It also involved the
development of the model curricula and training modules for the first course in
the sequence, Manufacturing Systems I (Introduction to Manufacturing Systems).
Draft copies of the first modules have been distributed to consortial colleges
and were also distributed at the NSF Project IMPACT Conference held in June 1994
in Washington, D.C. The second phase of the project involves the development of
model curricula and training modules for the second course in the sequence,
Manufacturing System II (Advanced Manufacturing Systems). It also involves
identification of laboratory resources throughout the consortia and procedures
for arranging use in support of the model. Pre-publication editing, printing,
and distribution of the final products are also included in this second phase.
