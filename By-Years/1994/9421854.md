In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, William
Klemperer of Harvard University will study the spectroscopy of weakly bound
molecular complexes. The goal of this research is to examine both the structural
and dynamical aspects of molecular interactions and obtain a quantitative
understanding of the intermolecular forces. Microwave and millimeter coherent
radiation will be used to determine hyperfine structure and electric dipole
moments of the ground and low energy vibrational states. Higher vibrational
states will be studied using laser induced fluorescence and vibrational overtone
spectroscopy. The fluorescence of vibrationally excited species undergoing
photodissociation will be analyzed to determine vibration-vibration transfer
during the photodissociation process and the distribution of quantum states of
the photofragments. Ab initio calculations will be used to determine potential
energy surfaces which are consistent with the experimental data. The structures
of molecules and the attractive forces between them are, in part, responsible
for their reactivity. This research will provide detailed information on the
nature of these interactions and the effect of molecular structure on chemical
bonding.
