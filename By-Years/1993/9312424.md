9312424 Sturrock This is a research project to study periodic modulation of
solar flare activity and the distribution of major flares on the solar surface.
Past studies have indicated that all observed periodicities in sunspot activity
are subharmonics of a fundamental 25.5 day periodicity. If this assertion is
proven, then considerable insight into the nature of the solar interior will be
gained. The study on distribution of solar flares is based on the observation
that major flares tend to be concentrated in "hot spots" which typically exhibit
rigid rotation rather than the expected differential rotation characteristic of
the solar surface. The investigators will analyze sunspot data to further
elucidate the behavior of these hot spots. Sunspot data to be used in the study
include observations made by the Greenwich Observatory and the Kitt Peak
National Observatory. ***
