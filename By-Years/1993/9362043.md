9362043 Hodko The objective of this project is to evaluate the feasibility of
soil and aquifer decontamination by application of nonhomogeneous pulsed DC and
AC electric fields of different frequencies and amplitudes paying particular
attention to the complex physical and chemical situation encountered in soil and
aquifer environments. Laboratory scale experiments will be conducted to
determine appropriate electrical regimes for maximum removal rates; the work
will include the use of real soil samples. The experiment of design will seek to
bring about electrokinetically- induced electroosmotic flux and pH gradients in
advantageous ways. This is a Phase I award based on a proposal submitted in
response to NSF 93-18, Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program
Solicitation. Results are expected to identify conditions under which the method
could be used either as a primary or secondary technology for the treatment of
underground formations contaminated with hazardous organic wastes. The
attractiveness and commercial potential of this subsurface treatment is based
primarily on the fact that this technology is an in situ technology targeting
organic contaminants in various physical phases, especially the immiscible
phase.
