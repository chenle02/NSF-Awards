This work develops and tests new approaches to assimilating data into
mathematical models to achieve more accurate prediction, for example in weather
forecasts. The novelty is to consider data that is (a) concentrated in a small
region (as over a metropolitan area), (b) moving (as from satellites, commercial
airplanes, cars, even cell phones), and (c) from easily-measured quantities,
such as atmospheric pressure. Numerical experiments will be supported by
rigorous mathematical analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work involves
computational projects that tie together data assimilation, determining forms,
and turbulence. The data assimilation is by nudging, an approach that has proven
to be conducive to rigorous mathematical analysis but has undergone much less
computational testing than have Kalman filters. Nudging is closely related to
determining forms, ordinary differential equations in trajectory spaces that
capture the global attractors of systems such as the Navier-Stokes equations of
fluid flow. Such systems are expected to display turbulent behavior, which
raises a particular set of computational issues addressed by this
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
