This award in the Joint NSF/DARPA Initiative on Image Understanding and Speech
Recognition is for a study of the visual cues that humans need to guide vehicles
and manipulate objects remotely. Telerobotic operators may be hampered by
response delays, limited visual bandwidth, and insufficient time to attend to
critical details. This study will identify essential visual cues that must be
extracted or preserved to enable competent navigation, obstacle avoidance,
landing, docking, and manipulation. Theories will be tested by human
capabilities in synthesized dynamic visual environments.
