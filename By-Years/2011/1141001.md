Development of professional skills is essential for success in the new global
economy. Equally important is the assessment of the degree to which these skills
exist in the future STEM workforce. This Science, Technology, Engineering, and
Mathematics (STEM) research and assessment project is a joint effort among
Pennsylvania State University, University of Maryland, Florida Atlantic
University, and Auburn University. A multi-disciplinary team is developing and
testing a set of standardized instruments designed to assess four professional
skill areas: Ethics, Teamwork, Global Awareness, and Creative Problem Solving.
The basis for this project is the Model of Domain Learning (MDL) that posits
three factors (interest, knowledge, and strategic processing) that cross three
developmental stages of learning (acclimation, competency, and proficiency).
Incorporated into the design and implementation phases of the project is a
series of four experimental studies designed to test: (1) the validity and
robustness of the MDL framework for assessing professional skills across STEM
disciplines, course levels, and instructors; (2) the sensitivity of the
instruments to document changes in the development of professional skills; (3)
the viability of tracking the development of professional skills using the MDL
framework; and (4) the adaptability of the framework with respect to students'
progress through their degree programs. The project combines both cognitive and
affective dimensions of learning with skill development and is initially focused
on engineering, business, information science and technology, and
entrepreneurship.
