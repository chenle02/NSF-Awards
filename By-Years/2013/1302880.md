The Ohio State University will host a conference entitled 'Hodge Theory and
Classical Algebraic Geometry' on May 13--15, 2013. The conference will cover
Hodge theory, classical algebraic geometry and the interactions between them.
The principal topics will include abelian varieties, higher dimensional
algebraic geometry, and mirror symmetry. Speakers will address recent progress
in approaches to the Hodge conjecture, compactifications of period domains,
variations of Hodge structures, algebraicity of Hodge class loci, and normal
functions.

The goals of the conference are (1) to generate new ideas and collaborations,
(2) to formulate and disseminate new problems and directions of research, (3) to
involve a new generation of researchers in these subjects. This will be the
first event in the U.S. devoted to the progress that has been made in Hodge
theory over the past five years, as well as to the applications that it has in
other parts of algebraic geometry. One of the central problems in this area is
to resolve the Hodge conjecture; this is one of the Millennium Prize Problems of
the Clay Mathematics Institute. The conference webpage can be found at
