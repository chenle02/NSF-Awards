9415790 SCRANTON This investigation will be a biogeochemical component of a
times- series study of carbon cycling in the Cariaco Basin, a nature depression
on the continental shelf of Venezuela. Because of restricted lateral water
exchange with the open sea to the north, this Basin with its oxygenated surface
waters overlying extensive anoxic waters offers an ideal opportunity to study
organic decomposition near a oxidation-reduction boundary. In particular, this
study will focus on the effects of carbon flux, sulfate- reducing and
methanogenic bacteria, and grazing of the bacteria on the cycling of low
molecular-weight fatty acids. The latter constitute an important class of
fermentation intermediates and are key intermediates in carbon cycling under
anoxic organic decomposition in the Cariaco Basin and should be extensible to
other similar environments on the margins of the world ocean.
