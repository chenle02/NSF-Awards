One of the great challenges of modern science is to bridge the gap between
atomic and cellular level phenomena that affect outcomes in living systems. A
potentially transformational facet of this challenge is Quantum Biology:
understanding how quantum properties play governing roles in biological
functions. The overarching goal of this project seeks to apply theory-driven
predictions of Quantum Biology for multi-scale integration of cellular function.
The inter-disciplinary team proposes to use front-edge computational and
modelling techniques in synergy with advanced magnetic resonance techniques to
probe quantum coherent pathways in the biochemical activity of electron transfer
flavoprotein (ETF) that controls the production of reactive oxygen species
(ROS). ROS is a highly reactive species and its buildup in cell causes damages
and eventual cell death. The project aims to use computational and experimental
approaches to provide ground-breaking insights into the requisite lifetimes for
quantum coherence in ETF and its role in ROS production. Connecting persistent
quantum effects to cellular behaviors bridge the atomic and cellular levels. The
project pursues research that challenges fundamental assumptions about
educational and research approaches and aims to achieve a paradigm shift beyond
multidisciplinary approaches in the way the next generation of students are
educated and introduced to quantum research. Researchers and students will
develop necessary skills to accelerate and integrate new knowledge to converge
research at the emerging frontier of Quantum Biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project aims to connect broad spatio-temporal scales, from rapid dynamics at the
molecular level to gradual ROS production at the macromolecular level. The
project also focuses on a novel Quantum Biology area in cell redox biology: the
activation of molecular oxygen by reduced flavoenzymes, where the production of
reactive oxygen species can be described by manifestly quantum phenomena. Also
included in this research is the development of the mathematical foundation of
quantum optimal control with the ultimate goal of proving optimality condition
in the form of Pontryaginâ€™s maximum principle. This project is supported by the
Molecular Biophysics cluster of the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division
in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
