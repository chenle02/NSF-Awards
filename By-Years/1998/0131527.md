This award provides partial support for a workshop organized by the University
of Florida focusing on research on negotiating strategies and mechanisms in
extended enterprises which are spatially and organizationally distributed. The

of the mini-symposium are to bring academic researchers and industry
practitioners together to: (1) Characterize the problems and challenges facing
leading-edge manufacturing and service firms in the areas of electronic commerce
(eCommerce) and supply chain management; (2) Define the state-of-the art
technological and decision support capabilities currently available to industry;
(3) Identify the new technological and decision support solution capabilities
needed for both meeting newly arising challenges faced by industry and for
driving new sources of strategic and competitive advantage; and (4) Identify and
define academic research opportunities and challenges for developing new
technological and decision support solution capabilities sought by industry.
