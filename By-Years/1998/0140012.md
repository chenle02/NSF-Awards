Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will focus on the
phenomenology of noncommutative spacetime, the physics of extra spatial
dimensions, including higher-dimensional theories of particle masses, and six-
quark cluster models of the deuteron.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first two topics
deal with the possibility that the structure of spacetime itself may be altered
at distance scales just beneath those currently accessible in experiments. This
leads to novel particle physics signatures and provides a new framework for
understanding the mysterious pattern of elementary particle masses. The third
topic deals with a model for the short-distance structure of the deuteron (the
nucleus of an isotope of hydrogen) that may lead to a better understanding of
the dynamics of the strong nuclear force.
