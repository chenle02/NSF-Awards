Polyphosphate (polyP) is a ubiquitous polymer found in all cells from archaea,
eubacteria, fungi, and protozoa to plants and mammals. PolyP is comprised of a
linear chain of hundreds of phosphate residues linked by ATP-like, high-energy,
phosphoanhydride metaphosphate) bonds. Several biological functions have been
suggested for polyP, including a reservoir for phosphate and energy, a chelator
of metal ions, a buffer against alkali, and a channel for DNA entry. PolyP also
appears to have a role in two-component signal transduction, yet, its biological
role is poorly understood. Complementary molecular genetic and physiology
experiments will be carried out in the bacterium Escherichia coli with the goal
of better understanding the function of polyP in cell biology. Experiments are
being directed towards addressing two aims: the first is to define the genetic
regulation of the polyP kinase (ppk)-polyP phosphatase (ppx) operon, and the
second is to examine the consequences of rapidly increasing polyP levels on gene
regulation in vivo.
