9321829 Terbough The arrival and survival of propagules of tropic forest trees
has never been studied at the community level. This project examines the
colonization of forest sites by tree seedlings and their subsequent survival. It
relates probability of seedling establishment to environmental factors and
seedling morphological and physiological characters. The research also addresses
the temporal and spatial pattern of seed arrival and the patterns of
differential seedling survival among species. %%% This research is novel in
describing seedling survival patterns and the processes affecting seedling
recruitment for the major species in a tropical rain forest community. The
results of this research have potential application in conservation biology and
tropical forestry. ! ! ! F ( Times New Roman Symbol &amp; Arial o o " h o 1
