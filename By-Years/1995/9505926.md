This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of Colorado--Boulder
in the purchase of a modern single-crystal diffraction system. This new
instrumentation will enhance greatly research in a number of areas, including
the following: (1) transition metal complexes containing quinone and radical
semiquinone ligands; (2) role of metal sulfides in carbon-heteroatom and metal
sulfur bond cleavage; (3) intramolecular Lewis acids as stereochemical control
elements; (4) 2,5-Dicarboxy-Stabilized 1,4-Dihydropyrazines as electron donors
in the synthesis of organic conductors and magnets; (5) extended skeletally
stabilized cyclic and linear phosphazanes; and (6) single crystal x-ray
structures of molecular rods and connectors. The x-ray diffractometer is used to
make accurate and precise measurements of the full three- dimensional structure
of a molecule. The information obtained gives the precise values of all the bond
distances and bond angles of a given molecule and it gives accurate information
about the spatial arrangement of that molecule relative to the neighboring
molecules.
