The goal of this project is to develop rational and implementable methods to
measure and control risk in the finance industry. The topic is timely because
there have been some spectacular failures in the finance industry, because
regulations are under discussion which would institutionalize quantitative risk
measures, and because the leading risk measure, "value- at-risk," has
undesirable properties. Chief among these is that in certain situations,
situations that often arise in credit-risky markets, meeting regulatory value-
at-risk requirements encourages concentration of risk rather than
diversification.

The proposal builds on the idea of coherent risk measures developed by a team,
which includes one of the principal investigators on this proposal. This team
developed a set of axioms deemed to be desirable, and then characterized those
"coherent" risk measures which satisfy these axioms. Their work showed that
every coherent risk measure can be characterized by a set of probability
measures over possible future scenarios. A three- part project is proposed. The
first part is to develop a decentralized implementation of risk control based on
coherent risk measurement. This requires development of duality theory and
equilibrium pricing within a firm. The second is to elicit scenarios and
estimate model parameters in real settings. This mandates refining the
mathematical models to the point that a manageable number of measures over
future scenarios present themselves, and appealing to statistical theory to make
those choices. Finally, it is proposed to extend the existing theory of coherent
risk measures. This project is being supported under the Focused Research Groups
in the Mathematical Sciences activity.
