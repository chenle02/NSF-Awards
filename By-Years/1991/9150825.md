Development of Undergraduate Engineering Courses in Computing and Visualization
at the University of UtahA new and innovative method of undergraduate teaching
in engineering is being developed by the Department of Computer Science, with
the cooperation and participation of the undergraduate teaching faculty of
engineering. Specifically, the departments of Chemical Engineering, Civil
Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering and Material Sciences are
participating in this course development proposal. Furthermore, these
engineering departments are planning to coordinate teaching methods and computer
equipment with the Departments of Physics and Mathematics in the College of
Science, who are making similar upgrades of their undergraduate teaching. A
basic course in Computer Science is taken by all of the students at the
outset.Next, each of the engineering departments are making coordinated
curriculum developments which best suits their purpose.
