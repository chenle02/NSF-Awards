9450073 Ellis A new Gordon Research conference that is focused on innovations in
the teaching of college chemistry provides a unique opportunity to familiarize
an influential group of educators with cutting-edge pedagogical and curricular
developments. By providing a forum for acquainting these individuals with one
another and with the state of the art in course content and instructional
methods, the conference can serve as a mechanism for enhancing the quality of
instruction for our nation's undergraduate chemistry students. Funds are
requested to help ensure broad representation of institutions of higher
education at the conference. ***
