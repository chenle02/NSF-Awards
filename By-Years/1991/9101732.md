This award will support Professor Joseph Bronzino of Trinity College,
Connecticut, in a research collaboration with Professor Pietro deFranciscis of
the University of Naples, Italy. The aim of the research is to study the
development of neuronal plasticity, including synaptic transmission and
modulation of cell activity in chronically implanted, freely moving rats.
Results of these studies would add much to our understanding of a number of
developmentally-dependent hippocampal processes related to learning and memory.
This award will help to maintain a successful research collaboration initiated
over 10 years ago. For this research, the Italian group will collect data from
groups of 45 and 90 day-old groups while the U.S. group will do the same for 15
to 30 day groups. The collaboration will expedite the exchange of scientific
knowledge and will provide students with an opportunity to engage in an
international research effort.
