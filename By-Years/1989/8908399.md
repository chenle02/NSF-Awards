This is a Research Opportunities for Women Career Advancement Award, to enable
Dr. Lynch to extend her sabbatical leave in Dr. Scott Fraser's laboratory at the
University of California at Irvine. During this sabbatical, Dr. Lynch is
acquiring new techniques, such as microinjection of living cells with
fluorescent tracers and monitoring by confocal microscopy, which she plans to
apply to her research on Xenopus metamorphosis and muscle development.
