Proposal Number: ECS-9734228 Principle Investigator: Matthew Johnson Title:
CAREER:Scanning Probe Microscopy of Photonic and Electronic Materials. Abstract
The proposed research is related to the used of scanning probe microscopy to
characterize, understand, and help improve materials issues in optelectronic
devices. Properties such as dopant distribution and the electronic and optical
properties on a nanometer scale will be measured and characterized using in situ
Scanning Probe Microscopy techniques. The measurement techniques and tools
developed in this work will have significant impact in the area of materials
characterization on a nanometer scale, and it may leads to the understanding of
new phenomina and the development of novel devices. The PIs connection with
outside groups who will provide him with materials was noted. The educational
component of the proposed work including the development of Junior/Senior Lab
courses, and the supervision of undergraduate students projects is also
considered adequate. In general, it is felt that the PI is highly qualified to
successfully perform the proposed work. It is because of the expected high
impact of the proposed research and educational activities that this proposal
was highly recommended by the panel. Based on the panel discussion and the
potential merit, this proposal is recommended for the CAREER award at $200,000
over 48 months. February 20, 1998
