This research will address long-standing questions related to the formation of
deep water masses in warm climate intervals and the role of the resulting
circulation in maintaining weak large scale thermal gradients. The researchers
aim to expand the current database of early Paleogene Pacific water mass
composition reconstructions by using Neodymium (Nd) and Lead (Pb) isotopic
records from Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) and Ocean Drilling Program (ODP).

The researchers will test three related hypotheses for deep-water circulation
during the greenhouse climate of the early Cenozoic, as follows: 1) deep waters
were convected in the high latitudes of the Pacific; 2) deep waters did not
convect in the Eastern Tethys; and 3) the deep basins of the Atlantic and
Pacific were not connected.

The broader impacts involve the training and education of two doctoral students
and substantive research experience for two undergraduate students. The
researchers will contribute to teaching and outreach activities through the
development of course materials and learning modules and will incorporate
results into existing activities such as the Urbino Summer School in
Paleoclimatology. Reconstructions will be disseminated to the community as base
maps for future paleoclimatic modeling and proxy studies.
