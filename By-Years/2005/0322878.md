This proposal focuses on discovery and application of two- and three-
dimensionally structured holographically formed polymer dispersed liquid
crystals (H-PDLC) for the creation of electrically switchable mesoscale lattices
targeted at photonic crystal (PhC) and diffractive optical applications. H-PDLC
materials exhibit fast switching (<100 ms), low absorption in the visible and
near IR, high diffraction efficiency, tunable refractive index profiles, and
simple and inexpensive one step fabrication. Holographic-lithography at 351 nm
or 532 nm is proposed to generate optical lattices that are permanently captured
in holographic-polymer dispersed liquid crystals through a photo-diffusion
phase-separation process. The PI will perform temporal multiplexing exposure
techniques to mimic nature and build artificial lattices. One such lattice,
which has been shown to exhibit lasing, is known as the liquid crystal blue
phase (BP). The BP is stable on the temperature scale between the helical
cholesteric phase and the isotrophic phase, where a highly ordered 3D lattice is
found. Other proposed lattice configurations include the diamond lattice,
superimposed lattices, quasilattices, and superlattices, with investigations
focusing on their application potential (e.g. lasing, waveguides, strain-
gauges). By cooperating with the local Chapters of the Women in Science and
Engineering (WiSE) and the National Society for Black Engineers (NSBE), the
research findings can be broadly disseminated to underrepresented groups in
science and engineering through forums and presentations. In addition, a module
will be created for K-12 students and teachers to demonstrate how lattices self
organize, and to integrate lattice formation with art for younger children. A
conference will be organized on photonics and entrepreneurship at Brown
University to bring together faculty, industry, students, and the investment
community to show university researchers how to potentially create value out of
their basic photonics research.
