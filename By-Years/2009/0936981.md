This program will develop three-dimensional numerical models of triple junctions
to examine patterns of mantle flow and melting and crustal accretion. While
important in the plate tectonic record, triple junctions have not been fully
examined in terms of their impact on such processes as crustal accretion. The
numerical models will take into account variable viscosity, melting, buoyancy,
and migration of triple junctions in the absolute plate reference frame. Through
the addition of a thermally buoyant melt source, the numerical models will also
consider plume-ridge interaction and the formation of marine large igneous
provinces. Broader impacts of the proposed work include contributing to the
resolution of fundamental questions about triple junctions and large igneous
provinces, training of a graduate student, and support for a new investigator.
