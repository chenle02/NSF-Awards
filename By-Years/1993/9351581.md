This project establishes a "Non-Destructive Testing Facility" at Maine Maritime
Academy comprising of non-destructive testing equipment commonly used in the
marine construction industry. The object of this project is the development of a
teaching tool which will assist in the understanding of material flaws and the
importance of proper welding techniques. All engineering students at Maine
Maritime academy are required to complete a sequence of courses in welding
theory and practice. The Non-Destructive Testing Facility will include liquid-
dye penetrant, ultrasonic, magnetic-particle and x-ray equipment. Laboratory
projects will include not only weld defect detection, but also corrosion
assessment on board the Academy's training vessel, effects of stress and fatigue
and changes in anisotropic material structure during fabrication. The operation
of the test-bench facility will provide students with an additional hands-on
capability in which the Maine Maritime Academy graduating engineer excels.
