9406325 Nesbitt The proposed project is a study to revise and refine the
chronostratigraphic correlation of marine Paleocene rocks of western Oregon.
Washington, British Columbia and the Alaskan Peninsula. The currently defined
biostratigraphic scheme for these rocks has numerous sources of error. These
have been perpetuated because of the lack of recognition of facies controls,
time- transgressive nature of the faunas, and biogeographical provincialism.
This study will evaluate the existing molluscan biozones and define new biozones
where needed. The molluscan zonal scheme will be correlated with foraminiferal
and calcareous nannoplankton data supplied by collaborating micropaleontologists
who are currently working in this area. Radiometric dates will be obtained from
tuffs and other volcanic rocks interbedded within the appropriate sedimentary
units. The zonal scheme for the Pacific Northwest will be correlated with
worldwide time scales. This refined, reliable and globally relevant
chronstratigraphy will be the foundation for future research projects on
invertebrate and vertebrate phylogenies, faunal response to global climate
changes, and boundary extinctions.
