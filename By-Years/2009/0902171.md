This award will support a program of research in neutrinoless double beta decay
(NDBD). The observation of such decays would indicate that neutrinos are
Majorana particles, i.e. they are their own anti-particles. The rate of the
process is sensitive to the effective neutrino mass. Determining whether
neutrinos are Majorana or Dirac particles and measuring their masses are among
the highest priorities in neutrino physics, as was pointed out in the APS Multi-
Divisional Neutrino Study. The answer will also have important implications for
astrophysics and cosmology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has two
complementary parts. First is the development of the next-generation CUORE
(Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events) detector, including the
operations of the first production tower (CUORE-0) and the subsequent data
analysis. CUORE promises to be one of the most sensitive NDBD experiments in the
next decade. It will be sensitive to the neutrino mass values suggested by
recent atmospheric neutrino oscillation experiments in the so-called inverted
mass hierarchy. The second goal is the R&amp;D towards a large generic
bolometer-based NDBD detector. They will establish a low-background cryogenic
facility near the UC Berkeley campus and start a comprehensive program of
bolometric detector development. This long-range program will be geared toward a
1 ton-scale, modular detector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the
program includes providing an educational and research environment for the
junior scientists, including graduate and undergraduate students. The bolometric
detectors bring together many experimental techniques from low temperature
physics, solid-state physics, and particle and nuclear physics. The implications
from observations in neutrino experiments have broad impact on the origins of
the Universe and it is a subject that sparks the imagination in the general
public.
