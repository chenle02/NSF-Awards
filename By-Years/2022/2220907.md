The 40th Southeastern-Atlantic Regional Conference on Differential Equations
(SEARCDE) will bring together leading experts and junior researchers working in
differential equations and related fields. The conference, to be held at North
Carolina State University (NCSU) in Raleigh, NC, on November 12-13, 2022,
facilitates access for junior researchers in the Southeastern-Atlantic region.
It provides a unique experience for the region due to its research focus, size,
and location, as well as its strong commitment to building regional research
networks and mentoring the next generation of mathematicians who work in
differential equations. This conference aims to support the participation of 150
regional researchers, the majority of whom will be graduate students. SEARCDE at
NCSU serves a significant educational purpose, by helping to train the scholars
of tomorrow in order to increase their future impact as scientists. Moreover,
building connections at all levels and across the Southeastern-Atlantic region
is crucial for increasing diversity in future hires in academia. The 40th
SEARCDE is committed to inclusion and diversity. This year the conference will
be held in cooperation with the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 40th SEARCDE will be focused on the following themes:
(1) Applications of differential equations, especially to problems in life
sciences, (2) Mathematical control and related topics, and (3) Applied analysis
of differential equations. The focus on timely, applied topics, such as life
sciences, aligns the work of the conference with significant societal needs of
broad interest and impact. More information about the conference can be found at

NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
