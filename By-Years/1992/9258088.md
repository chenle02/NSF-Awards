Sophisticated optoelectronic devices will be fabricated by integrating
photodetectors and liquid crystal modulators into VLSI circuits. These devices
will be used as optical neuron arrays in self- aligning optical learning systems
that use repetitively exposed photorefractive dynamic volume holograms to
adaptively classify input data applied to the network.
