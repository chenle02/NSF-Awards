This two-year project upgrades network capacity to the Northwest Indian College
cyberinfrastructure, creating an Internet2-connected network space for
scientific data at the main campus, and increasing the connectivity of extended
campus locations to enable rural student participation in research projects.
Changes include the addition of highly-available storage and database services
as part of a scienceDMZ, the establishment of IPv6 connections capable of
transmitting big data to and from partner institutions, and the integration of
existing directory services with common federation services for access control.
The associated increase in bandwidth also permits enhanced video telepresence to
increase collaboration with partnering institutions and augment remote
instruction between campuses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Northwest Indian College
hosts atypical education and research opportunities because scientific inquiry
at the school is pursued with an indigenous understanding of the planet. Because
the students and faculty begin with unique questions, they produce unique data
sets. This project enables that data to be shared with the larger research
community. Likewise, giving students expanded access to the catalogs at partner
institutions increases the number and scope of research and analysis
opportunities in a number of fields, including marine biology and oceanography,
botany, geology, and health and human services. The exchange of information is
expected to foster knowledge seeking and innovation among students at Northwest
Indian College, and present culturally-relevant education and research
opportunities to Native students at other institutions.
