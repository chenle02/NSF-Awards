This proposal concentrates on both stochastic and deterministic models of
intracellular reaction networks. If the abundances of the constituent molecules
of a reaction network are sufficiently high then the reaction network is
typically modeled as a coupled set of ordinary differential equations. If,
however, the abundances are low then the standard deterministic models do not
provide a good representation of the behavior of the system and stochastic
models are used. The simplest stochastic model treats the system as a continuous
time Markov chain. More complicated models tend to be hybrid in nature with some
components modeled discretely, some diffusively, and some absolutely
continuously (that is, solutions of ordinary differential equations with
stochastic inputs from the other components). This project has two related
goals. The first is to develop rigorous results relating network structure---
typically the simplest information to obtain experimentally about networks---
with qualitative properties of the dynamics of reaction networks, and to do so
in both the deterministic and stochastic settings. The second goal is to develop
and analyze numerical simulation methods for stochastically modeled systems that
account for both the natural scalings and basic mathematical structure of
reaction networks. Stochastically modeled reaction networks often involve
multiple natural scales and it is crucial that these natural scales be accounted
for when developing and analyzing numerical simulation methods. Also, all of the
equations that describe reaction networks are of a very specific mathematical
structure that can be utilized to develop efficient algorithms in both the
discrete and continuous stochastic contexts.

All of the questions being addressed in this proposal have motivation from the
biosciences. Recent advances in experimental methods concerning the dynamics of
the cell (such as green fluorescent protein) have increased interest in how
biological molecules interact at the cellular level over the course of time.
Because Brownian forces are significant at this level, stochastic models for
these intracellular reaction networks, combined with analytical and
computational tools, are essential if they are to be well understood. This
project will also provide a fertile training ground for graduate students. In
particular, there is a high demand for well-trained mathematical scientists with
the interest and expertise necessary to contribute to the solution of problems
arising in biology.
