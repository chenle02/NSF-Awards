The PIs propose to generate a high resolution benthic oxygen and carbon
isotopic stratigraphy for ODP Site 644 in the Atlantic and a Cd/Ca stratigraphy
for Site 677 in equatorial Pacific to obtain a long-term record of the
fluctuations and trends in North Atlantic Deep Water production and changes in
marine carbon cycle. The study will test whether there is a link between changes
in deep water circulation and global climate on a longer time scale of 100,000
to a milion years.
