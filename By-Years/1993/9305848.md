This proposal is for investigation of geometric evolution processes such as
might model dendritic growth of a crystal freezing from its melt. The
mathematical setting is that of geometric measure theory in which crystals are
sets of finite perimeter and temperature and concentration fields are functions
belonging to appropriate Sobolev spaces. The final evolution is a limit of
discrete time approximations in which crystal geometries are determined by
solving variational problems and fields evolve by diffusion equations.
