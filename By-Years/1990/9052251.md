Electronic imaging sensors called charge-coupled-devices (CCDs) will be used to
replace the photographic techniques and the single- channel electronic devices
currently used in an undergraduate course of Observational Techniques in
Astronomy. This change will accomplish three important educational goals: 1) it
will afford the students a more realistic data collection experience, using the
kinds of detectors commonly employed in modern optical astronomy, 2) it will
extend the useful life of our on-campus telescope by combating the effects of
the increased brightness of the night sky, and 3) it will allow students to
explore the analytical techniques of image analysis which find widespread use
not only in all parts of astronomy but in most other sciences as well. Two
scientific-grade CCD imaging camera systems and the accompanying data
acquisition and reduction computers will be purchased. The cameras will be used
on two teaching telescopes on campus; a solar telescope and a 12-inch refracting
night-time telescope. On the solar telescope, students will acquire time- lapse
images of prominences and of active regions on the sun through a narrow-band
hydrogen filter. On the night-time telescope, students will acquire images of
star clusters and of variable stars to gain experience in the techniques of
broad-band stellar photometry.
