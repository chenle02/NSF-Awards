This Doctoral Dissertation Research addresses two related problems, arising in
new democracies. First, why do political elites who are successors of the
authoritarian regime sponsor institutions involving transitional justice, when
such institutions may implicate them? Second, given a decision to engage in
transitional justice, which variant of institutions designed for revealing truth
about past human rights violations better fulfills two normative criteria
suggested by the literature: reaching as many perpetrators and prosecuting as
few innocent as possible?

1) Intellectual merit of proposed activity: The contribution of the
dissertation to the comparative politics of democratic transitions consists in
initiating the application of game theory and formal institutional analysis to
transitional justice phenomena. It will also result in one of the first
applications of quantitative methods to the field of transitional justice.
Funding form the NSF would make possible the creation of the first time-
series/cross sectional dataset of transitional justice events and a dataset with
the results of a survey on attitudes to transitional justice the only survey of
this type to be conducted, so far, in a post-communist country. The data
generated by the survey experiment would allow to draw interesting comparisons
on the operation of truth commissions and screening laws in post-communist and
post-Apartheid societies.

2) Broader impact of proposed research: Although the proposed research will be
carried out in Eastern Europe, the theoretical results it builds on may well be
applied to other democratizing states, in particular to Latin America. The
expected findings of this dissertation are critical to understanding both the
consolidation of new democracies and the reconciliation process between citizens
who sided with the authoritarian regime and those who opposed it. Analyzing
procedures of coming to terms with the past and analyzing the way their rules
interact and shape incentives of voters and politicians is essential for
preventing new democracies from falling back into authoritarian traps.
