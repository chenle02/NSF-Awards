This action funds an NSF National Plant Genome Initiative Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Biology for FY 2015. The fellowship supports a research and
training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to
broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan
for this fellowship to Maggie R. Wagner is " Investigating the effects of
intensive breeding on maize-associated fungal and bacterial communities and
their impact on crop productivity " The host institutions for the fellowship are
the North Carolina State University and Oregon State University and the
sponsoring scientists are Dr. Peter Balint Kurti, Dr. Posy Busby, and Dr. James
Holland.

Bacteria and fungi living within leaves and roots can profoundly affect plant
health, and are a potentially useful tool in sustainable agriculture. Plant
genes partially control these microbial communities, letting certain microbes
into the plant and keeping others out. It is unknown, however, whether genetic
changes caused by intensive crop breeding have affected the composition of the
microbiome. These experiments will expand our knowledge of the maize (corn)
microbiome and improve our understanding of the links between plant genomes,
plant-associated microbes, and crop productivity. The researcher will build her
expertise in plant pathology, microbiology, and genomics while sharing results
with agricultural researchers as well as public audiences at local schools and
educational farms, and will enthusiastically recruit students of diverse
backgrounds for participation in this project and mentorship in science career
development.

Successful integration of microbial improvement techniques into sustainable
agriculture requires a more sophisticated understanding of the relationship
between plant genomes and microbiomes. Moving beyond descriptive studies, this
project uses existing germplasm from current maize breeding programs to test
predictions about how various genetic perturbations might alter the microbiome.
The effects of hybridization, intense artificial selection, and introgression of
disease-resistance loci on microbial endophyte communities will be measured
using high-throughput amplicon sequencing, metatranscriptomics, and culture-
based methods. Greenhouse re-inoculation experiments will then test whether
breeding-induced microbiome alterations feed back to affect plant vigor and
pathogen resistance. Data will be shared publicly at the NCBI Short Read Archive
and repositories such as Dryad, and maize endophyte cultures will be shared on
request.
