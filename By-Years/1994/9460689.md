Poor adhesion of thin-film metals and dielectrics to diamond surfaces currently
impedes the development of diamond in active and passive electronics
applications. The origin of the poor adhesion is the chemical nature of the
diamond surface. The kinetic stability and electronic structure of the diamond
surface limit low-temperature formation of robust interfaces. However, by
chemically modifying the surface of diamond, the formation of robust interfaces
may be enhanced. Advanced Technology Materials, Inc. has discovered a novel
photochemical method to introduce a wide array of new chemical functionality to
the surface of diamond. Preliminary characterization of the chemically-modified
diamond surface suggests improved adhesion of metals. In Phase I they will
expand the range of diamond surface photochemical reactions and measure the
effects of surface modification on adhesion and electrical contact properties.
In Phase II they will apply the technology of photochemical surface modification
to the development of diamond electronic devices, including diodes, cold
cathodes and charged-particle detectors.
