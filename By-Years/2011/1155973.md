This research project will digitally catalog the hand written data notes of
aging Russian linguist Aleksandr P. Volodin on the Itelmen language in order to
preserve this extensive data on this very endangered language, fewer than 20
fluent speakers, most over 70 years of age. Volodin is the foremost Russian
scholar of the Itelmen language, his archive holds over 12,000 slips (dictionary
entries) from his Itelmen fieldwork. Dr. Volodin is of advanced age and
unfortunately is not computer literate; as a result his field data is itself
endangered as no one can fully interpret his personal notes without the benefit
of his knowledge. The project will digitize unique data on a highly endangered
language for access by the linguistics community interested in comparative
syntax and language shift. In addition, it will add content to a FLEx database
which will facilitate production of a print dictionary, allow online access for
language scholars and allow integration with audio-visual materials gathered by
others studying Itelmen.
