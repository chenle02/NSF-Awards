The Principal Investigators will install instrumentation to observe strain
build-up and fluid behavior near the up-dip end of the Cascadia Subduction Zone.
The project will establish a borehole geodetic observatory offshore of Vancouver
adjacent to an existing CORK observatory, which will be enhanced with tiltmeters
and temperature-monitoring instrumentation. Real-time data will be streamed
onshore and made available to the community via the NEPTUNE Canada system. Long-
term data analysis goals include capturing and characterizing slow-slip events
and/or major earthquakes. The project will enhance scientific infrastructure and
produce widely accessible data that will advance understanding of earthquake and
tsunami hazards. A graduate student at RSMAS will be supported and at WHOI
students and/or post-doctoral researchers will be involved in the cruise and
data analysis.
