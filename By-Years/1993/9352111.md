We proposed to incorporate molecular biology experiments into our curriculum as
a means of introducing students to modern biological research techniques. The
objectives of the proposed project are to provide positive and realistic hands-
on research experiences to our majors, and increase the percentage of our
graduates who pursue postgraduate study or careers in science. Recombinant DNA
experiments will be incorporated into the General Microbiology and General
Genetics courses, and a new course in Molecular Genetics will be added to our
curriculum. Access to the basic tools of molecular biology will provide our
undergraduates with the opportunity to participate in basic research in this
area and enhance their employment opportunities by helping them to develop the
analytical and technical skills required of modern biologists.
