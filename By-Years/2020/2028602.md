Machine learning (ML) has the potential to dramatically benefit many aspects of
daily life. Applications range from consumer and business technologies (virtual
assistants) to transportation (driver assistance and self-driving cars) to
health care (hospital observation and physician assistance) and science.
Unfortunately, using ML techniques to solve specific, real-world problems
remains difficult. Building ML applications often requires a multi-step,
iterative process that involves repeated cycles of prototyping, evaluating
results, and fixing failures. This project aims to dramatically reduce the
difficulty of this iterative process, making it easier for a single person to
quickly build ML applications to solve real-world
problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical goal of this project is to
dramatically scale the productivity of the entire end-to-end ML model-
development workflow so that a single subject-matter expert, armed with a large
dataset and access to datacenter-scale accelerated compute capability, can build
accurate models for new tasks in hours to days instead of weeks or months. To
this end, the project will create automated tools that directly empower subject-
matter experts to perform model-development tasks, in rapid iterative loops.
These intelligent tools must execute with low latency and scale to huge datasets
and potentially large, complex models. To meet these requirements, this project
will combine new methods for automatically generated supervision from weak
sources and for curating critical data for training and validation, new ML
programming abstractions, and reconfigurable ML hardware accelerators to support
a heterogeneous set of future use cases and algorithmic
techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
