This is agency cross-cutting review of the national federal expenditures on
materials research with special emphasis on materials synthesis and processing
research. This major effort will be coordinated by NIST and cost over $300,000.
The NSF portion will be $16,800 which will be used primarily for computer
support. A major report illustrating agency by agency funding will be prepared
next year.
