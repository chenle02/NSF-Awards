The project is awarding scholarships to academically talented students with
financial need majoring in Engineering, Engineering Technology, Mathematics,
Physics, or Computer Science. Program objectives include (1) employ recruitment
efforts to expand the number of STEM students earning a bachelor's degree; (2)
promote sustained, high quality faculty/student relationships between
scholarship recipients and their faculty mentors; (3) increase these students'
awareness of the academic support, career planning, and educational enhancement
opportunities available to them and encourage them to utilize these resources
and opportunities; (4) increase these students' awareness of and interaction
with high technology industries and graduate education opportunities.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recruitment efforts focus on high school, community
college, and two-year college students in the five state region with an interest
or aptitude in the STEM fields. Program components include extensive faculty
mentoring and advising, contact with members of industry, educational
enhancement activities, peer mentoring, and meetings of the scholarship
recipients. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project is guided by
current literature on student success as well as prior success with S-STEM
projects that enable SDSU to continue and improve upon a successful scholarship
program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The project provides an
educational model that links existing student support systems and classroom
learning with structured, out-of-the class experiences. Detailed strategies with
frequent contact and monitoring of students early and throughout their college
careers allow for greater retention of STEM students, which directly translates
to impact on students and enables them to graduate with degrees in STEM fields.
