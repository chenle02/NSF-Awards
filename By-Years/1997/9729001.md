The focus of this research is the utilization of allene oxides and
cyclopropanones as synthetic intermediates for the synthesis of a wide range of
carbocyclic and heterocyclic ring systems occurring in natural products. The
thermal rearrangement of fulvene endoperoxides gives rise to the desired
intermediates. Intramolecular McMurray reactions, claisen condensations, enol
lactone formation and sigmatropic shifts are among the reactions to be explored.
The investigations will be carried out with the help of undergraduate coworkers.
With this Research in Undergraduate Institutions award, the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational
activities of Dr. Ihsan Erdan of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at
San Francisco State University. Professor Erdan, with the help of undergraduate
participants, will focus his work on using the synthetic intermediates obtained
from the thermal rearrangement of cyclic peroxides, fulvene endoperoxides, for
the synthesis of a wide range of natural products.
