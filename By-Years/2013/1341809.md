The International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT) is the premier annual
information theory conference worldwide, and thus a valuable forum for graduate
students in this discipline to present their work, receive feedback from other
researchers working on similar or related topics, and to make professional
acquaintances within the discipline. This award provides international travel
funds to be awarded to students who have a paper accepted at this year's ISIT
and who otherwise would not have sufficient travel funds to attend the
symposium. As information theory is a core component of the Communications and
Information Foundations cluster, the efforts to ensure participation of graduate
students in this symposium are consistent with NSF's goal of promoting education
and research of the next generation of scientists.
