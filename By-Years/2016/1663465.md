This award provides travel support for graduate students and early career
researchers to attend the 20th International Conference on Nucleation and
Atmospheric Aerosols (ICNAA) that will be held in Helsinki, Finland in 2017.
This support will allow these early career scientists an opportunity to share
their research results and to interact scientifically with an international
cross-section of experts in their fields. Advancing knowledge of the processes
that form cloud particles will advance weather and climate research.

The International Conference on Nucleation and Atmospheric Aerosols focuses on
the formation, physical and chemical properties, transformations, and cloud
impacts of atmospheric aerosol particles. The conference is held every four
years in rotating locations. The desired outcomes of the meeting are to
strengthen the connections between the theoretical, modeling, and applications-
based researchers from the international community and to foster the involvement
of early career scientists.
