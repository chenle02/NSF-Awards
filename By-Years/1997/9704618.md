9704618 Zeng The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty four months of research
abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions
abroad. This award will support a three-month postdoctoral research visit by Dr.
Yanni Zeng to work with Dr. Heinrich Freistuhler at the Institut fur Mathematik
in Aachen, Germany. An additional three months will be supported by the
University of Alabama at Birmingham. Dr. Zeng will study shock wave stability.
She will investigate a system which is a typical example of a broad class of
nonlinear partial differential equations that together with the equation of
state, determine the plane waves of a conducting fluid in the presence of a
magnetic field. She will study the large time behavior of the solution. Dr.
Freistuhler has expertise in the field of non- strictly hyperbolic systems and
Dr. Zeng's expertise is on hyperbolic-parabolic systems. Together they hope to
solve the shock wave stability for magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations and
similar systems from physics, and achieve their goal of qualitative analysis for
such systems. ***
