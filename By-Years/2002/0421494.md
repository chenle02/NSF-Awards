0421494&lt;br/&gt;Armstrong &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research
Instrumentation (MRI) grant supports acquisition of a Scintrex CG-5 gravimeter
capable of measuring relative gravity to plus or minus 5 mGals. The gravimeter
would support research and education by faculty and students at Cal State
University Fullerton in structural geology and basin analysis research.
Additional support will also fund the acquisition of gravity modeling software
and related manufacturer training. Specific research targets for the gravimeter
will include looking for buried faults within the northern Gulf Extensional
Province, Baja California and investigations of the geometry of buried Tertiary
sedimentary basins in northern Thailand. Cal State Fullerton is a non-Ph.D.
granting institution and serves a student body that consists of a majority of
traditionally underrepresented students in the
geosciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*** &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
