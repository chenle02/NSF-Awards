Increased numbers of chemistry majors seek courses and research with biological
applications. The Department of Chemistry is responding by actively
demonstrating the fundamental role of chemical principles in many life science
applications by increasing the exposure of undergraduates to the chemical basis
of selected biological phenomena. This project presents physical chemistry
laboratory students with key techniques used in studying the physical behavior
and properties of biological macromolecules. Fluorescence spectroscopy allows
examinination of biological systems from a physical chemistry perspective. The
initial set of experiments being introduced include fluorescence anisotropy
measurements to yield membrane micro-viscosity, a steady-state fluorescence
quenching study of the kinetics of protein denaturation, and an investigation of
the thermodynamics of formation of several B-cyclodextrin inclusion complexes.
These curricular revisions are serving as an introduction to elements of
biophysical chemistry for all chemistry majors.
