Professor Youssin will investigate singularities of complex algebraic varieties.
He will study the relationship between decompositions of the L-2 cohomology that
come from intersection cohomology and those that come from modules over rings of
differential operators. He also intends to study relations between Newton
polyhedra and resolution of singularities. This is research in the field of
algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern
mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past
quarter- century. In its origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the
plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes
use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and
conversely is finding application in those fields as well as in physics,
theoretical computer science, and robotics.
