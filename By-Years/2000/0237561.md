0237561&lt;br/&gt;Curry&lt;br/&gt;This award to Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution in Massachusetts provides support for the development and
fabrication of a piston coring system capable of recovering samples of 40-50
meters length. The award includes support for the corer itself, including a
corehead of variable weight from 5 to 13 tons, and including drag plate,
altimeter and modem-controlled release. It includes a traction winch capable of
50 tons of pull, suitable for use with 12-strand synthetic braided rope, and a
take up drum and level wind system for rope storage. It includes separate
winches, sheaves, davits, booms, barrel-racking system, platforms and hydraulic
power systems, plus related equipment, suitable for rigging, deploying and
recovering the piston corer from a large UNOLS vessel. It includes modifications
to R/V Knorr appropriate to ensure that the system can be deployed safely. It is
anticipated that the new Long Coring System will provide an important shared-use
facility for marine geoscientists, especially those investigating processes
involved in ocean and climate history, and we envision it will be heavily used
to support sampling programs beginning in about 2006.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
