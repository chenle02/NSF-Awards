This project is for the theoretical investigation of convective plasma
transport and ionosphere-magnetosphere coupling in the outer planets Jupiter,
Saturn, Uranus and possible Neptune. The magnetospheres of Jupiter and Saturn
are driven by internal sources of plasma from embedded satellites. The energy
from the planetary rotation plays an important role. The magnetosphere of Uranus
is driven by the solar wind, a familiar situation like the terrestrial
magnetosphere. However, the planetary rotation is still very important. In all
of these magnetospheres, convection is regulated by electrodynamic coupling to
the ionosphere. In order to investigate these processes, numerical modeling will
be used. To guide the modeling effort, the observations from the Voyager
experiments of plasma and magnetic field will be used. The comparative study of
the various planetary magnetospheres will enhance our understanding of
terrestrial magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling processes.
