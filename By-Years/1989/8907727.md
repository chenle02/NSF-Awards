Tensegrity structures are self prestressed cable networks (i.e. do not require
anchorages), in which the cable network is prestressed against a discontinuous
system of bars. This arrangement makes these structures inherently collapsible
and deployable, since in the unprestressed state, cables are lax and the
disjoint system of bars provides no rigidity. Tensegrity structures share
potential applications with other types of deployable structures. They include:
1) Temporary space covering (e.g. exhibition halls); 2) Temporary shelters in
transient situations such as for expeditionary forces, flood and other natural
disaster emergencies, social events; 3) Shelters in inhospitable climates or
inaccessible areas; 4) Sports halls; 5) Decorative, architectural space
coverings; 6) Deployable structures in space such as dish antennae, solar
collectors, components in space and lunar stations. The objective of the
proposed six months project is to demonstrate the feasibility, as well as
potential limitations of double-layer tensegrity networks, by fully analyzing
and designing a real-scale prototype, and comparing the result with a more
conventional structure such as double-layer space truss. Combined with results
of currently underway analytical and experimental work, the results of this
investigation are expected to provide a firm basis for a proposal for an
investigation of larger scope.
