University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collaborative Research: Network Dynamics and
Organizational Strategies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;We know that,
in general, people tend to share similar world views of other individuals around
them -- a classic principle known as homophily. Yet, we know surprisingly little
about the effects of network dynamics beyond individuals within a specific
organizational context. As a case in point, this research project uses advanced
statistical and computational methods to analyze network data regarding ties
among and between individuals. Of course, people might hold views or make
choices independent of their ties to other members in the same group or
organization. Alternatively, individuals might share views with their peers. In
this latter case, shared perspectives may simply reflect classic homophily (aka
selection bias), or true peer influence channeled by the new network ties
developed with peers. The research focuses (a) on the degree to which
organizations or normative entities recruit and/or influence people's choices
and (b) on ways in which this creates broader effects beyond organizational
boundaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Until recently, the
needed fine-grained data and analytical techniques were not available to answer
these questions empirically. Findings from this research have the potential to
advance our understanding of group processes generally. Findings may be of
interest to a variety of stakeholders, including public officials, the media,
the business community, and the general public. In addition, findings from this
study have the potential to advance social science methodologically and provide
valuable quantitative methodological training opportunities for students.
