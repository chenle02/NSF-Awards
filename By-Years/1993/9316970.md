9316970 Ghose The principal objective of this exploratory research program is to
study the structure and dynamics of magnesium silicate melts by in situ laser
Raman spectroscopy with simultaneous CO2 laser heating to temperatures of
~3000oK The experiments involve creation of a localized melt in a magnesium
silicate glass or crystal plate using a CO2 laser beam - with the glass or
crystal plate to act as the crucible for the localized melt. Raman scattering
data from the melt area will be interpreted from conventional and quantum
molecular dynamics simulations based on large atomic clusters. A good match of
the experimentally observed and theoretically calculated vibrational spectra and
radial distribution functions will ensure the correctness of the derived melt
structures, which in turn will be used to calculate their thermodynamic and
physical properties, including viscosity.
