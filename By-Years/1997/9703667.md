9703667 Ritter The objective of this research is to understand the mechanisms
involved in slow crack growth at polymer adhesive interfaces that have been
tailored to promote adhesion. The research involves both impenetrable and
penetrable interfaces. An example of an impenetrable interfaces is silane
coupled epoxy/glass and of a penetrable interface is PS/PMMA. Slow crack growth
is measured under both constant and cyclic loading using the Double Cantilever
Drilled Compression (DCDC) test. Although this test has been used to study crack
growth in monolithic glass and ceramic materials, the use of the test to study
crack growth at polymer adhesive interfaces is new. The unique advantages of
this test is that crack growth is stable and the interfacial fracture toughness
can greatly exceed the fracture toughness of the adjoining materials because of
the stabilizing role of the compressive loads. Finite element modeling is used
to estimate the energy associated with plastic and viscoelastic deformation
while the energy associated with chain disentanglement, pullout, and scission is
estimated based on micromechanical modeling. Direct measurement of the intrinsic
adhesive energy is by the Johnson, Kendall, and Roberts technique, where the
contact radius between a sphere (made of polymer adhesive) and a flat plate
(made of the bonded material) is measured. %%% Through careful experimentation,
micro-mechanical modeling, and finite element analysis, the influence of slow
crack growth on the various mechanisms that contribute to the fracture
resistance of both impenetrable and penetrable interfaces is explored. This
should significantly improve understanding of adhesive bonding. ***
