Distributed computer networks control, scheduling and management are well-
studied topics in scientific and engineering applications, yet the problem of
finding optimal approaches that are not too complex to solve or implement on
practical systems remain unsolved. Many computer networks are naturally
clustered, and imbalance of load usually occurs among the clusters rather than
inside the clusters. This project will develop clustered computer networks'
control, scheduling and management policies for allocating computational
resources across network clusters and for managing network operations based on
simple network management protocol(SNMP). This project will first develop
clustering model based on the data collected from monitoring Bradley network
loads from real applications. Then the project will investigate and develop
adaptive computer algorithms and heuristic schemes for developing the control
policies. Finally, the project will develop network load monitoring tools based
on X- window and Tcl/Tk for network manager interface. The control schemes
developed are expected to be applicable to network load balancing and management
in many other clustered distributed systems. The project is funded under the RUI
program.
