The objective of this project is to develop software methods that will allow
accurate measurement of the intensities of diffraction maxima (Bragg Peaks) in
x-ray diffraction data from macromolecular crystals. In these data, the Bragg
Peaks are often overlapping and are further obscured by background signals.
Software currently used for data analysis cannot accurately integrate across
severely overlapped peaks, and background calculations are not accurate. This
problem can be addressed by using larger detectors, but that solution is
prohibitively expensive. A more economical solution depends on developing more
accurate methods for deconvolution and background determination. Emphasis will
be put on making the methods more accurate and fast, with minimum user input
required. The routines developed will be compatible with crystallographic data-
processing software currently being used by macromolecular crystallographers,
and will be made available to the crystallographic community.
