This is a study of the initiation and growth mechanisms of filamentous carbon
on nickel, cobalt, and the alloys of nickel, cobalt, and iron.
Computer.generated phase diagrams are used to control solid "surface" and bulk
compositions. The gas phase consists of mixtures of carbon monoxide, carbon
dioxide, methane, hydrogen, and water. Experiments are performed in an
isothermal, differential, gravimetric reactor. Filament and solid structures are
observed using electron microscopy along with metallurgical etching. Solid.phase
identification is performed using X.ray and/or electron diffraction and magnetic
susceptibility measurements. Laser interferometry and laser speckle metrology
are used to generate low.temperature "surface" phase diagrams and explore
crystalline orientation effects on filament initiation and growth. Carbon
filaments grow as a result of catalytic decomposition of carbon.bearing gases on
iron, nickel, or cobalt, or their alloys. These filaments can be used in
high.strength, low.weight composites. However, they are also a serious corrosion
problem for many transition.metal.based alloys and catalysts.
