Unresolved issues on the timing and magnitude of changes in deep ocean chemical
composition and circulation can be tackled with selective paired measurements of
benthic foraminiferal Cd, &amp;13C, and &amp;180 in deep ocean sediment cores.
Gaps will be filled and benthic paleochemical coverage of the last glacial
maximum, and cores from the South Atlantic, Antarctic, and Northwest Pacific
will be examined to clarify why existing &amp;13C and Cd evidence suggest such
different glacial paleochemical characteristics. Two more long downcore Cd
records will be completed to constrain the amplitude, timing, and spectral
characteristic of benthic paleochemical changes. This data will be examined from
the perspective of simple models for carbon and nutrient cycling within the
ocean, in order to assess the role of ocean chemistry and circulation in
controlling atmospheric CO2.
