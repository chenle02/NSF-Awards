9507396 Thompson This project concerns the expression of Fed-l, a nuclear gene
encoding chloroplast ferredoxin in higher plant leaves. Fed-l mRNA accumulates
in response to illumination, both in dark-grown seedlings and in
photosynthesizing leaves of green plants. However, the response mechanism in
green leaves differs dramatically from the promoter-mediated transcriptional
responses typical of most other plant genes. Previous work has focused on the
response in green leaves and identified an internal light response element
(iLRE) within the transcription unit. Sequences located both in the untranslated
leader and in the 5' portion of the coding region are essential for iLRE
function, and an open reading frame is required in this portion of the coding
region. These observations support the hypothesis that light effects are
mediated by translation-dependent changes in mRNA stability. Such mechanisms are
only beginning to be studied in plants, but are likely to be of considerable
importance. Experiments are designed to provide additional information about the
sequence requirements for iLRE function, and to test the hypothesis that the
Fed-l light response involves changes in mRNA transport and/or degradation.
Components of the iLRE will be defined at the nucleotide level and additional
nonsense codon insertions will be tested in order to determine whether an open
reading frame must extend over the full length of the coding region. Chemically
inducible and repressible promoters will be used to determine the in vivo half
life of Fed-l mRNA in the absence of inhibitors and to test for light effects on
the kinetics of mRNA accumulation in nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. Our
experiments will provide a basis for future investigations, including a genetic
analysis of mutations affecting Fed-l expression, and will help us reach our
long term goal of defining the entire set of events and factors that regulate
production of this important photosynthetic protein. %%% This project concerns
