9302403 Brown A low cost GPS Time sensor is proposed to be developed which will
be suitable for power system fault detection and control. GPS provides a highly
precise time reference which allows data to be synchronized to within 100
nanoseconds between substations and control centers. Applications of precise
time in power control include data logging, relay testing, fault isolation and
phase angle measurements. Failures can be isolated in a grid to a precision of
100 meters by measuring the relative time of arrival of a fault at two stations.
Phase angle measurements can be determined to a precision of 40 micro-rad.
Currently, the least expensive GPS timing receivers suitable for power system
control cost over $10,000. Such equipment would be very expensive to install at
tens of thousands of substations throughout the electric power grids. It is
proposed under this effort to develop a low cost precise time synchronization
GPS sensor for use in electrical power system monitoring. The proposed sensor
will provide a highly reliable, time reference accurate to 100 nanoseconds for a
cost of less than $1,500. ***
