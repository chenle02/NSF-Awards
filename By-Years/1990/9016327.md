Populations of grouse in the genus Tympanuchus are on the decline, and little
information exists regarding the systematics or population genetics of taxa
within this genus. This research will utilize restriction endonuclease analysis
in combination with enzymatic DNA amplification (polymerase chain reaction, PCR)
and nucleotide sequencing of selected portions of the mitochondrial DNA
molecule. Both extant and extinct populations will be integrated in a detailed
assessment of systematic relationships and patterns of geographic variation
within and among prairies grouse species. Genetically-unique populations will be
identified and the extent of divergence among them estimated. The effects of
historical factors and recent human influence on the origin and current
distribution of prairie grouse populations will also be evaluated. These data
will provide valuable information regarding the evolutionary history of prairie
grouse in North America as well as the integration of molecular genetic
techniques in solving problems of conservation biology and wildlife management.
