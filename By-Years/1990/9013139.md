There are two faculty investigators in the projects described below, F. R.
Cohen and S. Gitler, as well as two of their graduate students involved in
thesis research. All of the research concerns algebraic techniques in topology.
F. R. Cohen intends to consider problems in classical homotopy theory and some
offshoots to the cohomology of certain discrete groups. Three of the main
projects involve (1) improving his bounds on the exponent of a mod-2-to-the-r
Moore space, r at least 2, and trying to extend some results to the case when r
is 1, (2) a study of the Whitehead product involving spaces of rational
functions together with their interplay with Cayley-Dickson algebras, and (3)
the cohomology and stable structure for the classifying space of certain
discrete groups called mapping class groups. Some of these problems involve
configuration spaces and are part of joint work with S. Gitler and L. Taylor
(University of Notre Dame). S. Gitler intends to consider several problems
centered on mapping spaces, their cohomology, and their relationship to homotopy
theory. For example, he intends to study maps (X,Y) and their cohomology for
"good" spaces X and Y. Setting Y equal to a space in the omega-spectrum for
Morava K-theory, K(n), one gets useful examples of spaces with periodic homotopy
groups. Gitler intends to study applications of these spaces.
