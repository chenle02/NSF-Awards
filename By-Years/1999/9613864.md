This research explores a set of techniques for robust logic synthesis tools to
support the design automation of high-performance and low-power sequential
synchronous circuits. The approach is based on a new concept of logic timing,
which combines retiming with logic optimization across register boundaries into
a single efficient optimization technique. Also being explored is state encoding
for sequential synthesis of circuits specified as finite state machines. The
model is based on a controlled reencoding/retiming of the symbolic
representation of the state machine represented initially with one-hot code.
This facilitates a reliable estimation of circuit cost, such as delay, power,
and sequential testability, as a direct function of the encoding. The proposed
work is being carried out in collaboration with Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. of
Austin, TX.
