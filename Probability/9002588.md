The principal investigators will work on some problems in modeling financial
markets. The work will include contingent claim pricing, utility maximization
and equilibrium existence and characterization in securities markets which
exhibit various kinds of incompleteness. Securities are modelled as Ito
processes. Incompleteness in these models can arise because there are too few
securities to hedge all the risk associated with the underlying Brownian motion,
because there are constraints on admissible portfolios such as short-selling
prohibition, or because of transaction costs. The problem with different
interest rates for borrowing and investing will also be examined.
