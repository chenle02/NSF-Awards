Six major cone proteins of 40S hn RNP exist as three tetramers which bind pre-
MRNA during transcription and package 700 nucleotide lengths of RNA into a
repeating array of regular particles. It is likely that this phenomenon play and
important role in preventing heteroduplex formation during transcription and
that it forces the numerous transcripts of active genes into a manageable
conformation. Clearly the packaging mechanism must accommodate all RNA
processing events. Several lines of evidence demonstrate that the core proteins
alone do not pass the necessary information to direct particle assembly at
sequence specific sites in vitro, thus the reactive sites involved in splicing
may not be packaged in hn RNP in the same way as the bulk of the RNA. Attempts
will be made to provide a topological view of RNA and proteins in monoparticles
and to determine if mechanisms exist to phase the assembly of hn RNP in a
splicing consistent manner. A large number of ultrastructural and biochemical
findings now argue convincingly that pre-MRNA is packaged during transcription
into a repeating array of regular ribonucleoproteins particles and there is
considerable evidence that splice site recognition, spliceosome assembly, larial
formation, excision and legations all occur while RNA exists in a highly
packaged state. Recent work by Dr. Le Stourgeon now makes possible mechanistic
understanding of RNA processing.//
