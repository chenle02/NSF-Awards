This award funds a wide range of scholarly and educational projects related to
the principal investigator's research interests in Number Theory. With regards
to his own research, the investigator plans to study, among other topics,
partitions and modular forms, Gaussian hypergeometric series, character sums,
varieties over finite fields, polynomial-exponential equations, and thedivisors
of modular forms. In addition to his own research, the investigator will develop
a number of new outreach and educational programs at the high school and
undergraduate levels, and will become involved in training programs at more
advanced levels. Specifically, the investigator will direct workshops for high
school students and high school teachers, will support programs for talented
undergraduate students, and will provide enhanced opportunities for graduate
students and postdoctoral fellows.

Number Theory is a very old branch of mathematics which has its roots in the
study of the whole numbers. In modern times it has become an important tool in
many applied endeavors. For example, systems which enable secure transmission of
data over the internet are based on Number Theory, as are error correcting codes
for reliable data transmission. The Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER)
Program supports the early development of academic faculty both as educators and
as researchers. The program emphasizes the development of full, balanced
academic careers. This award will allow the investigator to further develop his
ongoing program of research in Number Theory. It will also support the
investigator's broadly based educational and outreach efforts at the high
school, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels.
