The research plan focuses on application of nondestructive evaluation techniques
to geotechnical engineering, combining elements of electrical and mechanical
engineering with the rich heritage of geotechnical engineering. The plan attacks
on two scales. 1. Diagnostic acoustic emission analysis of rock failure
mechanisms for real time monitoring. 2. Application of recursive system
identification to soils excited by earthquake strong motion for analysis of
nonlinear behavior and damping. ***
