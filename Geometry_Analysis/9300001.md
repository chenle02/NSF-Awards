The Principal Investigator proposes to study some variational problems on
Riemann Surfaces that have applications to the study of the Moduli space of
curves and three dimensional hyperbolic geometry. Specifically, he proposes to
study an extremal length problem on a Riemann surface the solution of which
would lead to new invariants of Riemann surfaces, and then new local functions
on Moduli space. He also proposes to study the shapes of images of harmonic maps
of surfaces in hyperbolic three-manifolds, including the differential-
topological singularities of the images, and the dependence of the motion of the
image surface in the three-manifold upon the motion of the domain in Teichmuller
space.
