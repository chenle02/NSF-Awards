Statistical physics provides an immensely useful set of tools to analyze natural
phenomena involving complex interacting systems whose dynamics is difficult to
describe exactly, but whose average behavior is amenable to analysis. It has
found applications far beyond the realm of physics. To gain a deeper
understanding of the mathematical underpinnings of this theory, it is necessary
to study simplified models that nevertheless exhibit rich behavior similar to
physical systems. This research project will study one class of such simplified
discrete models, percolation models. In a separate topic area, probabilistic
tools inspired by statistical physics will be applied to differential equations,
to analyze the long-time behavior of their solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project will study the behavior of metrics of physical significance, including
the chemical distance and the effective resistance in critical random
environments, such as Bernoulli percolation and oriented percolation in low
dimensions. These metrics are of central importance for the study of random
walks, for instance. Separately, the project will also study the behavior of
nonlinear Hamiltonian partial differential and stochastic differential equations
with random initial data, especially data chosen from invariant and quasi-
invariant measures of Gibbs type. These objects allow for the construction of
special solutions with improved long-time behavior compared to the generic case.
The principal investigator will participate in the organization of summer
schools, as well as the design and teaching of classes on statistical mechanics
of both lattice systems like percolation, and continuous dynamical systems like
partial differential equations with random data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
