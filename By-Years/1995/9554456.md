40403 Special Computing Title: Technology in Teaching and Research: A Look at
Private Education in Appalachia Technology in Teaching and Research is an
ambitious, long- range project designed to unite the efforts of faculty in
private colleges across the Appalachian region to strengthen their use of
technology in the undergraduate curriculum. The first step in the project, A
Look at Private Education in Appalachia, is to determine what technology is
currently in place and how faculty are using it in their classrooms, both for
instruction and research. The study is expected to show that while many of the
Appalachian colleges and faculty are seriously lacking in the resources
necessary to employ technology to strengthen their instruction, in far more
cases the colleges and their faculty are on the edge of excellence in their
access to and use of technology. At the end of the study, a college or faculty
member will be able to examine itself or himself in view of what is happening at
like institutions. The college will be able to determine what is necessary to
strengthen its competitive edge in recruiting and maintaining students, and the
faculty will be able to identify other faculty across the region who share their
interest or who can strengthen their knowledge and skills. The final report
documenting the results of the study will be available for dissemination to
colleges across the nation who may also want to prepare for the 21st century.
