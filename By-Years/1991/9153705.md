The immediate goal of this two year program is to provide 20 high school
science teachers from the New York area with practical experience in research in
modern biology, biochemistry, cell biology, chemistry, genetics and molecular
biology so that they can transmit to their students knowledge gained regarding
content, scientific method, and the excitement of scientific research. The
program was created to develop a partnership in science education between high
school science teachers and University faculty and to encourage sustained
associations between them. Participants in the program are committed to working
in a Columbia University research laboratory for at least two consecutive
summers. A major premise of the program is that affiliations of science teachers
with research laboratories and practicing scientists will provide the teachers
with a better appreciation of the excitement of scientific discovery, the tools
and technologies of modern biology and chemistry, the trajectory of a
scientist's career and the realities of working as a scientist. Based on the
knowledge and experience gained during the summer research experience, teachers
are expected to plan and implement a series of activities in their schools
during the following academic years. These activities may include inservice
offerings, implementation of new student laboratory experiences, new curriculum
projects, field trips to research laboratories, or other appropriate activities.
An amount equal to 42.4 % of NSF cost will be provided as cost share.
