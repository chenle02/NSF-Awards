With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Stuart Shieber will conduct three
years of interdisciplinary research on noncompositionality in natural language,
where the meaning of a phrase seems to depend on more than the meanings of its
parts. This research is based on an analogy between computational side effects
in programming languages and apparent noncompositional phenomena in natural
languages. The investigators hypothesize that techniques developed in the
programming language community to specify side effects, such as various
&lt;br/&gt;"type lifting" operations, may be applied to the problem of modeling
apparent noncompositionality in natural language. These techniques will have to
be augmented to appropriately model interactions among side effects, a subtle
problem that has not been satisfactorily addressed in the programming language
literature, let alone in their application to natural
language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will relate linguistic
interpretation to computational evaluation, yielding an empirically superior
treatment of linguistic side effects that is more uniform and modular and thus
easier to study and teach. Educational materials introducing natural-language
semantics with the new framework will be developed and deployed in classroom
teaching. Prototype natural-language processing systems based on the new
framework will be developed to verify its predictions. By making these materials
freely available, the project will contribute to the educational infrastructure,
and through dissemination of papers and software, to the research infrastructure
in linguistics and computer science. The project will also provide valuable
research experience for undergraduates and advanced training for graduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
