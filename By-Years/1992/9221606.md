This project is an international collaboration in glass research between the
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Glass Research at Alfred
University and the HVG- a glass research institute in Germany. This project
implements an Industry/University/Government Cooperative Research Program
between the United States and Germany. The ultimate objective of this joint
effort is to couple the glass research expertise at Alfred University with the
glass research institute in Germany to conduct Advanced Glass Processing
research which will benefit the industry members in both Centers. The research
projects at Alfred University will investigate the effects of Dealkalization on
Surface-Related Mechanical Properties of Alkali Silicate Glasses, the Denist,
Wetting Behavior of Glass in Controlled Atmospheres, and the Reflectometry
Measurement of Thin Film Amorphous Films. The research projects in Germany will
examine the impact of small chemical additions, basicity and oxidation state on
the structure and properties of silicate glass melts. These factors strongly
influence the glassmaking process. The Deutsche Forshungs Gemeinschaft (DFG)
will fund $220,000 per year for three years for the research projects at HVG.
The research projects at Alfred University will be supported by the New York
State Legislature at $33,000 per year for three years, DOE (through the
Westinghouse Savannah River Co..) at $195,000 for three years, and the
Industry/University Center for Glass Research at Alfred University at $50,000
per year for three years. This project is being cost shared with Dr. Carole
Ganz, Program Manager of the International Centers Cooperative Program, Division
of International Programs. The Program Manager recommends Alfred University be
awarded $55,000 for the first year for a three year continuing award.
