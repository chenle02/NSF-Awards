&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor John Rabolt of the University of Delaware and
Dr. Bruce Chase of Dupont Corporate R&amp;D Experimental Station are working to
develop a portable infrared focal plane array spectrometer for the real-time
detection of chemical and biological agents in gases. The method has the
potential to deliver infrared absorbance information on a time scale of 100's of
microseconds. High surface area polymers produced by electrospinning will be
utilized to concentrate trace quantities of toxic analytes. The method has the
potential to amplifiy and produce IR spectra of aerosol droplets and
particulates that cannot be detected in the gas phase due to their size and/or
transmissivity. The rugged instrument can sample in real time and would have
applications in national security, environmental and industrial process
monitoring. One specific target analyte in this project is a sarin
surrogate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is supported jointly by the NSF and
the Intelligence Community. The Approaches to Combat Terrorism Program in the
Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences supports new concepts in basic
research and workforce development with the potential to contribute to national
security.&lt;br/&gt;
