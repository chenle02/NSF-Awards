Intercomparison measurements between Lowered Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler
(LADCP) and Expendable Current Profiler (XCP) velocity profiles will be
conducted to better define the response function and noise characteristics of
the LADCP. Both noise and beam spreading are likely sources of uncertainty for
studies of the finescale internal wave field (vertical wavelengths smaller than
200 m). Beam spreading effects arise from horizontal non-uniformity in the
oceanic flow field and have the greatest impact at low buoyancy frequencies:
Lower buoyancy frequencies imply smaller horizontal wavelengths (greater
horizontal non-uniformity) for a given vertical wavelength. Therefore, the
comparison measurements will be done in a region where stratification is
relatively weak on a World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) cruise running
south of Greenland in the North Atlantic. Spectral models will be developed to
further understand these errors, delineate limitations of the instrumentation
and optimize processing algorithms for finescale parameterization studies.
