The PIs will test and apply nested photochemical and meteorological models to
ascertain their ability to simulate the production and transport of ozone,
nitrogen oxides, and anthropogenic and biogenic hydrocarbons in the earth's
boundary layer. Specifically, the PIs plan to simulate photochemical production
and transport of tropospheric ozone over a period of one month and an area which
encompasses the eastern half of North America and the western Atlantic Ocean
(summer 1988), to compare simulated and observed rural and urban ozone
concentrations and to identify the causes of discrepancies between them, to
compare simulated concentrations of other species related to ozone production
with observations, to evaluate the sensitivity of the predicted concentrations
to uncertain model inputs, and investigate sensitivities to temperature, and to
optimize the design of a nested regional- scale model for selected rural and
urban applications.
