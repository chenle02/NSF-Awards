Americans have sought to use science and sovereignty to influence what new kinds
of organisms would live within their national borders. This interest has
involved the importation of promising exotic species, the creation of varieties
adapted to American environments, and the exclusion of alien pests. Drawing on
Alfred Crosby's metaphor of ecological imperialism, I call these concerns
"American desires for ecological&lt;br/&gt;independence." My project
investigates the history of these biotic dimensions of national self-
determination. Utilizing the extensive published and manuscript records produced
by horticulturists--a biotechnological network that has been the subject of
little scholarly research--I examine a series of critical events from the
Revolution to the present. These include the debates over the degeneration of
cultured Old World plants in North America, fears about the destruction of wheat
by the Hessian fly, efforts to create and define&lt;br/&gt;American fruits,
discussions regarding the forestation of the prairies, efforts to exterminate
completely such alien pests as the gypsy moth and the medfly, and contemporary
discussions plans to control biological invaders and to restore native
ecosystems. My focus is on the temperate humid regions of the continental United
States, but I also consider, as a contrasting case, the outlying tropical margin
of southern&lt;br/&gt;Florida. This project, integrating history of science,
technology, international relations, environment, and nationalism, will offer a
new perspective on the ways Americans have altered the continent's species in
the last two centuries. It will result in a book that will deepen public
understanding of the place of biotechnology, broadly conceived, in the shaping
of the American nation. It will also have a more focused impact on assessments
of environmental norms: a scholarly study emphasizing the diversity of
scientific perspectives and the uncertainties in decision-making will advance
reasoned and effective policies regarding migrating organisms.&lt;br/&gt;
