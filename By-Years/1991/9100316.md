This research is concerned with the study of new classes of graded algebras
including Sklyanin algebras, regular algebras and algebras related to quantum
groups. The goal is to understand their representation theory in geometric
terms. The principal investigator will study the finite dimensional simple
modules of Sklyanin algebras. He will examine higher dimensional Sklyanin
algebras for properties such as regularity and noetherian chain conditions. He
will also examine their properties from a deformation perspective. This research
is in the general area of noncommutative ring theory. The rings considered in
the project are of interest in many areas of mathematics including algebraic
geometry. Given a curve, one of these rings can be associated with certain
points on the curve. A better understanding of these rings and this association
will be useful in determining the geometry of a given curve.
