9522019 Stegeman Polymer opto-electronics has undergone rapid development in the
last five years and has shown considerable promise for photonics applications.
However, recent papers have shown that cumulative photodegradation of electro-
optic polymers poses a serious long- term problem. Large changes in both the
refractive index and waveguide losses have been measured in the near infrared
and communications regions of the spectrum in the prototypical molecule DANS. A
collaborative university-industry research team consisting of Alex Jen of
ROITECH, Seth Marder of Caltech and George Stegeman of CREOL at the University
of Central Florida will investigate these issues under a GOALI program. By
sharing facilities and expertise, this team will use both optical and analytical
chemical techniques to study both the major mechanisms responsible for
photodegradation and new approaches to minimizing their effects in the
communications bands. Accelerated optical testing will simulate device
performance over many years at typical device operating powers. Photodegradation
leads to changes in the molecular structure and optical properties. These
changes will be measured and correlated in well-known molecules such as DR1 and
DANS. Mechanisms such as trans-cis isomerization, and the oxidation and breaking
of bonds by incident photons will be quantified. Both linear and multiphoton
triggered events will be studied. New molecules designed to reduce
photodegradation effects will be designed, synthesized and evaluated. For
example, molecules with much narrower (than DANS or DR1) absorption spectra
placed strategically relative to the communications bands are to be
investigated. ***
