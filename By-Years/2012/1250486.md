Energy policies must be both durable and flexible in order to address economic,
environmental, and geopolitical challenges and to ensure national
competitiveness and security. The science of how to design durable policy,
however, is underdeveloped, with expertise fragmented and often overly
specialized. The American Academy of Arts and Sciences will conduct a workshop
to explore how energy policies can be designed to better manage the introduction
of new energy technologies. The workshop will pay particular attention to the
question of how to design policies that are sustainable over several decades yet
adaptable to new scientific and technological information.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshop participants will examine the conflict between
the need to provide consistent signals to stakeholders and the need to make
energy policy responsive to new information. They will discuss how to develop
effective evaluation approaches and will produce a multidisciplinary agenda for
future research. With representatives from academia, government, industry, and
nongovernmental organizations, the workshop will develop a deeper understanding
of how energy policies can encourage technological innovation and promote
sustainable resource use.
