This is a model, university-schools collaborative program for utilizing a cadre
of 100 elementary school teachers, who have participated in a three year Science
Teacher Institute at the University of California, San Diego. This project will
support these teachers with the design and delivery of staff development
programs in science education at the elementary school level as well as
selecting an elementary science curriculum for their school sites or districts.
The two-year project is a joint effort of the science faculty of the University
of California, San Diego, in cooperation with and in response to the needs of
the San Diego County school districts. The project includes materials and
technical assistance for these teacher leaders as they attempt to change the way
science is taught to young children in their districts. It is estimated that
over three thousand teachers will take part in the three to five day inservice
programs that these 100 teachers will design and implement in their districts.
The cost sharing for the project will be 22% of the NSF portion.
