ABSTRACT

This will be a broad program of research in geometric aspects of holomorphic
dynamics, Teichmuller theory, laminations, and related areas. The project
addresses central problems in these fields: The Local Connectivity Problem for
the Mandelbrot set and for Julia sets would help to give a thorough
understanding of dynamics for the complex quadratic family. The Renormalization
and Universality Conjectures concern fundamental rigidity features of the phase
and parameter domains for dynamical systems. The Regular or Stochastic
Conjecture would give a complete measure-theoretic picture of the dynamics of
unimodal maps. The Ehrenpreis Conjecture asserts that any two compact Riemann
surfaces have almost isomorphic compact coverings. The project would explore
further interplay between holomorphic dynamics, hyperbolic geometry, Teichmuller
theory, and the theory of laminations, as well as the interplay between real and
complex dynamics in one and two variables.

Dynamical systems theory studies evolution of various systems described by
differential equations or by the iteration of a single map. It has numerous
applications in celestial mechanics, statistical physics, fluid dynamics,
biology, and other branches of natural science. Holomorphic dynamics is the part
of dynamical systems theory that deals with iterates of complex analytic maps.
It has proved to be a powerful tool in understanding important models of real
low-dimensional dynamics. There are numerous interconnections between
holomorphic dynamics, geometric analysis, hyperbolic geometry, and the theory of
foliated spaces. Holomorphic dynamics also produces beautiful fractal objects,
such as Julia sets and the Mandelbrot set, whose intricate structure has
fascinated scientists for decades. All of this structure and its applications
will be further explored by the Stony Brook dynamics group.
