Funds are being provided to study the seismicity of an active continental
breakup in the western Woodlark Basin, offshore Papua New Guinea. Low-angle
normal detachment is a fundamental process in passive margin evolution but
conflicts with basic Andersonian tenet of frictional slip on faults. 24 to 35
degree low-angle slip planes are known in the continental crust of the Woodlark
Basin and provides an opportunity to test the ideas of low-angle seismicity. A
marine-land passive seismic experiment will be undertaken, focused on a region
of high-localized strain. Seafloor instruments will be arraayed to record
microseismicity and PASSCAL instruments will be deployed on surrounding islands
to record regional seismicity. ODP driling will provide additional constraints
on faulting.
