In this project, the P.I.'s will analyze data obtained on two cruises in the
Equatorial Pacific Ocean during winter, 1984, and spring, 1987, as part of the
TROPIC HEAT experiment. An unprecedented set of microstructure data was
obtained, including 10,000 microstructure casts, 8,000 kilometers of thermistor
chain tows, and several months of high-quality meteorological measurements.
Analysis will focus on a variety of important questions relating turbulent
dissipation, wind forcing, and internal waves in the equatorial environment.
