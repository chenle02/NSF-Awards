9728884 Stephen H. Forbes This research focuses on cooperation among
nonrelatives using theory that can be applied to both kin and nonkin based
social systems. Based on detailed studies of a single species, Lasioglossum
hemichalceum, several key characteristics that define cooperation in groups of
nonrelatives have been identified. These include a short life span for foragers,
a long period of dependency for offspring, and the need for the continued
presence of adults in nests to protect orphaned offspring. These key features
result in cooperation to attain "extended parental care". Individuals cooperate
in order to obtain future babysitters for their offspring should they die while
foraging. The investigators will examine these key characteristics in a
carefully chosen set of additional species in order to determine how general the
results with a single species may be. This work will be carried out using
careful field observations of the factors outlined above and molecular genetic
techniques to assess parentage and genetic relationships among group members.
Social cooperation is an important feature of animal biology. Most terrestrial
ecosystems are dominated by social species. Since the 1970s the study of social
insects has provided the basis for a change in the way we view social
interactions. In the past, two bodies of theory have focused on how cooperation
may have evolved. The first deals with how interactions among relatives may have
evolved and the second deals with cooperation among nonrelatives. This research
provides the opportunity to find a more general theory of sociality with some
potential for broadening our perspective on how social cooperation evolved.
