The role of myosin heads in the process of myosin and sarcomere assembly will
be investigated. Work in progress indicates that expression of myosin heads
lacking rod sequence disrupts sarcomere organization in the nematode,
Caenorhabditis elegans. Experiments are proposed to define regions of the myosin
head responsible for the muscle-disruptive effect and to determine the gate of
truncated myosin molecules. Transgenic nematodes expressing full-length myosin
or myosin head fragments will be produced. The motility and muscle
ultrastructural defects of control and experimental transgenic worms will be
compared. The smallest myosin fragment which disrupts muscle organization will
be characterized. %%% The contractile mechanism of muscle tissue consists of two
major proteins, myosin and actin, which are arranged (along with other auxiliary
proteins) in densely packed, highly ordered arrays termed sarcomeres, such that
linear arrays of myosin molecules (the "motor" for contractile movement, which
transduces chemical energy into mechanical energy) move along actin filaments
(which serve as the "track"), resulting in shortening of the sarcomere (and
hence of the muscle itself). This project is concerned with the role of the
myosin molecules in the assembly of the contractile apparatus. The power of
genetic manipulations will be employed to engineer nematodes with myosin
molecules bearing mutations at specific sites, to determine the functional
consequence of these specific mutations. An understanding of the structural
requirements for contractile machinery assembly is a necessary prerequisite to
biotechnological applications of biomolecular motors. Given the high degree of
conservation among myosins throughout the animal kingdom, it is expected that
the results obtained with the nematode model system will be generally applicable
to other animals.
