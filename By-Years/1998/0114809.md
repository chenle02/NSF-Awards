This research and educational program will address the quantum-mechanical
transport and storage of electrons and holes in ultra-thin, heteroinsulator
nanostructures.The nanostructures are comprised of an oxide-nitride-oxide
(ONO)gate dielectric.

This research focuses on the quantum-mechanical aspects of charge trapping in
ultra-thin ONO dielectrics. This project will employ a combination of novel test
structures,such as linear voltage ramp and charge pumping,o determine the
spatial and energetic distribution of traps in the silicon nitride and
oxynitride storage layers and in the Si-SiO 2 interfacial region on the opposite
side of the tunnel oxide. A variation of material parameters to examine
retention and endurance of scaled novel SONOS devices in the program (write) and
erase modes as a function of operational temperature. This research addresses
the incorporation of hydrogen and deuterium in the SONOS device to provide long-
term retention under extensiveerase/write cycling at elevated temperatures; it
will also address the effect of the gate electrode on the charge distribution
and long-term memory retention. Advanced fabrication techniques are used to grow
ultra-thin tunnel oxides and analytical characterization techniques, such as
AFM,TEM and angle-resolved XPS are employed to analyze the spatial and
compositional structure of these ultra-thin dielectrics. This research seeks to
understand charge trapping and storage in ultra-thin multi-dielectrics in
advanced semiconductor devices while offering a strong educational program and
link to industrial partnerships.
