9452145 Harmon The Department of Physics at ISU will renovate of its
introductory physics laboratories to improve quality and cost effectiveness and
to increase the technologic relevance of the program. The professional working
environment calls for familiarity in the use of computers to acquire and
manipulate data. Undergraduate laboratories can provide an excellent
introduction to data manulipation techniques with computers due to the relative
simplicity of the subject material. Recent developments in inexpensive analog
and digital computer interfacing equipment allow more flexibility in data
collection and analysis and increase the scope and variety of experiments
available for use in introductory laboratories. To take advantage of this, the
Department of Physics at ISU will establish a computer laboratory that will be
the first in the USA to utilize the new Intellecta Laboratory Interface and
software. This extremely sophisticated system is based around EXCEL for WINDOWS
and allows the user to easily use the full power of the WINDOWS environment to
design a laboratory or instructional environment. The hardware interface
consists of a number of A/D and D/A converters, counters, timers, etc. that
acquire data in and control processes from the WINDOWS environment. This allows
access to OLE (object linking and embedding), DDE (dynamic data exchange),
access to the protected mode of the 486 chip, availability of memory above one
megabyte, etc. and thus makes the most efficient use of the power of WINDOWS
platforms of the type requested.
