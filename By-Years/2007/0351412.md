To do a basin-wide test of the fixed hotspot model requires accurate and precise
radiometric ages that only now have become possible through improvement in
Ar40/Ar39 dating of altered submarine basalts. By re-dating existing samples the
investigators will generate a state-of-the-art Ar40/Ar39 age database. This
project will re-date 37 seamounts that fall within the 30-100 MA age range in
the Line Islands and the Louisville seamounts incremental heating Ar40/Ar39
dating, and measure Hf-Sr-Nd-Pb isotopes and major/trace element abundances to
characterize these basalts in terms of mantle source and stage of volcanic
activity. These data will be used to assess the fixed and moving hotspot models.
