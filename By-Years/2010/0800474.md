The research objective of this award is to develop a unified methodology for
multiscale coupled electromechanical analysis of nanoelectromechanical systems
(NEMS). The proposed approach consists of multiscale analyses for both
mechanical and electrostatic domains of NEMS. In this approach, NEM structures
are decomposed into substructures through a top-down hierarchical substructure
decomposition. Atomistic descriptions are employed to compute the mechanical
normal modes and electronic wave functions in the substructures where nano
effects, such as surface effects, quantum effects and electron-phonon
interactions, are significant. The atomistic descriptions are then incorporated
into mechanical and electrostatic continuum theories through a multilevel
component mode synthesis (MCMS) technique to generate a reduced-order system for
self-consistent coupled electromechanical analysis. This methodology will be
employed to perform computational analysis, design and optimization of
nanoelectromechanical devices. Computational tools will be developed and
provided to the public.

If successful, the results of this research will provide a novel methodology for
accurate and efficient multiscale multiphysics analysis of NEM structures to
achieve better understanding and prediction of the behavior of NEMS.
Computational tools developed in this research will facilitate the design and
optimization of future NEMS products. Online computational tools and web courses
will also be offered to enable remote online simulation and learning. Graduate
and undergraduate students will benefit through the multidisciplinary research
and gain exposure to a variety of engineering and scientific areas such as
mechanics, electronics, solid state physics, numerical analysis and computer
science. The collaboration of students to achieve the research goals will
provide them experience in interacting within a project team of various skills
and will positively impact their future careers.
