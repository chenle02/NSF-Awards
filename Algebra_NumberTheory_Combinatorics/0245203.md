This project is devoted to the study of moduli spaces of Azumaya algebras over
surfaces. As a first step we construct compactifications. A generalized Azumaya
algebra is a perfect object in the derived category of the surface, endowed with
a multiplication. It turns out that these objects can be used to give completely
canonical compactifications. There is also a natural way to define stability of
generalized Azumaya algebras (depending on some auxiliary choices). The result
is what we would like to call a GIT stack compactifying the moduli space of
Azumaya algebras. The project proposes to study these spaces and to use them to
define ``Donaldson type invariants''. In addition the geometry of the moduli
spaces will be studied for particular types of surfaces, e.g., elliptic surfaces
and K3 surfaces.

A complex projective surface can be viewed as a 4 dimensional space which is
endowed with a lot of additional structure. The most important of these is a
choice of a rotation map on the tangent spaces; it is a rotation over 90
degrees. A lot of research has been done to classify four dimensional spaces
which are endowed with such a structure. This is usually done by defining
invariants (for example numbers) of complex projective surfaces which can be
used to tell them apart. A very basic example are the Betti numbers, which are
dimensions of cohomology groups. To give you an idea, an element of the second
cohomology group corresponds to a 2 dimensional subspace of the 4-fold. Of
course we are not simply enumerating these; we use a coarser equivalence
relation (deformation equivalence). Here is a question: How many of these 2
dimensional subspaces have the property that the tangent space at any point is
preserved by the rotation that defines the complex structure on our 4-fold? Such
a subspace is called a complex curve on the complex surface. This question has
been much studied, and is related to the Hodge conjecture. However, in this
project we go the other way. Namely, we look at other objects: Complex
projective bundles over our 4-fold determine a degree 2 cohomology class as
well, and they are typically not those which can be represented by complex
curves. It turns out that by looking at all possible complex projective bundles
representing the given cohomology class we get a new space which, if we can
understand it, tells us a lot about the original 4-fold. All kinds of new
invariants of the original complex projective surface can be defined in terms of
these moduli spaces. It is the geometry of these moduli spaces that will be
studied in this project. There is a lot of techincal machinery that has to be
developed before we can begin the exploration of more geometrical properties and
part of the project will be devoted to developing this machinery.
