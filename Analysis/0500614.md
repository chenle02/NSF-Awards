0500614 Saff Conference

Abstract

The grant will support a US delegation of young Ph.D's and graduate students to
participate in the conference entitled "Computational Methods and Function
Theory '05," which will be held in Joensuu, Finland during the period June
13-17, 2005. The general theme of the meeting concerns the various aspects of
interaction between function theory and scientific computation. Indeed, there is
a synergistic relation between these subjects that will be further strengthened
by the conference. The individuals to be funded will be selected by a group of
outstanding senior researchers who plan to attend the conference. We expect five
new Ph.D's and three graduate students who hold great promise of becoming future
leaders in these fields of mathematics will be chosen to form the USA
delegation.

The conference is the fifth in a series, following CMFT'89 (held in Valparaiso,
Chile), CMFT'94 (held in Penang, Malaysia), CMFT'97 (held in Nicosia, Cyprus),
and CMFT'01 (held in Aveiro, Portugal). Another common theme of these meetings
is to foster the creation and maintenance of contacts between scientists from
diverse cultures.
