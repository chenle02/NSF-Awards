AST-0305833&lt;br/&gt;Baldwin&lt;br/&gt;Quasar emission lines offer a way to
trace the strongly evolving physical conditions in the central regions of young
massive galaxies. The gas in the Broad Emission Line Region (BELR) should reveal
the chemical evolution in the host galaxy from which it has fallen, and the
observed emission lines are not sensitive to the unknown structure of this
region. The BELR line strengths also reflect directly the rate of dynamical
evolution in the center of the host galaxy. The brightness of these lines means
they can be measured precisely even out to quite large redshifts, but they have
been hard to interpret. The PI will further check the interpretation methods he
has been developing for some years, and will run numerical experiments to
determine the best lines to use and to calibrate the use of iron abundances as a
chronometer, as well as to understand the true uncertainties in the derived
properties of BELRs. Armed with those results, optimized observations will
obtain high quality spectra of a carefully selected sample, and derive
parameters that can directly reveal early evolution at the centers of massive
galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will set up a strong public outreach
program through the Abrams Planetarium at Michigan State, using a flashy,
continuously running presentation with this research as a background, to inform
the thousands of annual visitors about cosmology, the birth of galaxies, and the
origin of the chemical elements. With this as a basis it should be possible to
produce a more widely distributed planetarium show that will reach an even
broader audience.&lt;br/&gt;
