This research is associated with a Presidential Young Investigator Award, and
is concerned with obtaining tools which are useful in the analysis and control
of systems containing significant uncertainty. These uncertainties are
characterized deterministically, rather than stochastically. The systems treated
can be linear or nonlinear and analyzed by either continuous time or discrete
time methods. The major application of the research is in the analysis and
control of aerospace and mechanical systems. Specific directions in this
research will consider the following situations, (1) the uncertainties satisfy
less restrictive structural conditions than presently assumed, (2) the complete
state of the system is not available for feedback, (3) there are delays in state
measurement or control application, (4) there are uncertainties in the dynamic
order of the system, and (5) the system is infinite dimensional in character.
