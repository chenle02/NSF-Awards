Research in mathematical physics will focus on the "inverse scattering
problem," in which, for example, one attempts to find the forces that act
between particles from the way in which the particles scatter each other.
Inverse problems arise in quantum mechanics, in the propagation of acoustic and
electromagnetic waves, and in other areas. Ability to deal with such problems
enhances one's ability to use experimental data to make inferences about the
underlying physics.
