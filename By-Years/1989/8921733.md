Low Temperature studies of collective behavior of liquid and solid 3He, mixtures
of 3He in 4He, and 4He films are proposed. The work will be conducted in a
variety of experimental environments including temperatures well below 1 mK,
magnetic fields greater than 7 T, and even liquid under rotation. The general
purpose of the work is to gain a deeper understanding of the nature of phase
transitions and collective quantum mechanics behavior in matter.
