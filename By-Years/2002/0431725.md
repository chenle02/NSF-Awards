As the Human Genome Project nears completion the need grows for functional
genomic analyses which in addition to the primary genomic sequence involve other
types of data such as gene expression measurements from microarray hybridization
experiments. Research in functional genomics involves a range of computational
problems including visualization, clustering, classification, regression,
knowledge representation, and predictive modeling. This project will touch on
each of these areas, but the primary focus will be on developing machine
learning techniques that learn to place genes into discrete functional
categories in order to simplify and render more tractable the problem of
inferring gene function from genomic data. To the end the PI will build on his
prior work which showed that a support vector machine (SVM) can be successfully
trained using DNA microarray expression data to recognize various gene
functional categories, and will develop methods for combining coding sequence,
promoter region, gene expression, and other types of genomic data in SVM-based
learning algorithms. The research will lead to improved understanding of the
ability of various machine learning techniques to recognize different types of
gene functional classes, and will also yield new techniques for learning
simultaneously from multiple types of data. Learning from heterogeneous data
sets is a core issue in artificial intelligence and machine learning; the
ability to combine knowledge from various types of genomic data is critical for
understanding the cell at the molecular level, and should lead to important
insights into gene function.
