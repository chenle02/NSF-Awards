Abstract

Award: DMS-0072591 Principal Investigator: Michael T. Anderson

Anderson and LeBrun both plan to study the global Riemannian geometry of low-
dimensional manifolds, with an eye towards the ramifications of these results
for smooth topology, algebraic geometry, and theoretical physics. Anderson will
continue work on Thurston's geometrization conjecture, and study relations of
this conjecture with global existence and singularity formation for vacuum
space-times in general relativity. LeBrun will study relations between
properties of the total scalar curvature functional and smooth topology, as well
as related problems concerning quadratic curvature functionals. In addition,
Anderson and LeBrun both plan to investigate topics in the geometry of
asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds, and relations with current issues in string
theory and the AdS/CFT correspondence.

Anderson's investigations are directly related to questions regarding the
physics of black holes and the shape and long-term evolution of the universe.
LeBrun's work studies fundamental questions arising from Hawking's quantum
gravity program, and relates the Seiberg-Witten equations of high-energy physics
to the study of gravitational phenomena.
