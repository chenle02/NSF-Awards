Nancy Makri of the University of Illinois is supported by the Chemistry Division
under the Information Technology Research program to advance the frontier of
quantum dynamics simulation by developing novel formulations to treat quantum
coherence effects in many-particle system dynamics. The development of such
propagation methods is important for simulating vortex formation in quantum
fluids, understanding and controlling energy flow in materials and molecular
nanostructures, and assessing the prospect of defeating decoherence that
currently impedes realization of quantum computing. This project will develop
approaches based on Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum dynamics,
including iterative procedures and real-time Monte Carlo techniques in
conjunction with minimally oscillatory propagators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research will allow for the first time accurate simulation of quantum coherence
effects in condensed phase processes, meeting a prime computational challenge of
current interest. The impact will extend to theoretical chemistry, condensed
matter physics, materials chemistry, and quantum information theory.
