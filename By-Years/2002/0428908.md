0428908&lt;br/&gt;Cheng&lt;br/&gt;This project will specifically develop a new
imaging SPR technique for microarray analysis of membrane proteins without
radioactive or fluorescent labels. The proposed waveguide surface plasmon
resonance imaging spectroscopy will retain the intrinsic high detection
sensitivity and label-free detection already available in the current SPR
technique. The new technique allows characterization of anisotropic properties
of the sensing interface, giving insight into structural changes of biological
membranes and membrane bound proteins upon activation.
