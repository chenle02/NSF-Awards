This project will test the possibility that bulk parameterizations of boundary
layer processes are adequate to resolve air-surface interactions in general
circulation models. This possibility will be tested by comparing results from a
global forecast model, with explicitly resolved surface to atmosphere transfer,
to the bulk flux approximations similar to those used in the Community Climate
Model of the National Center for Atmospheric Research. The tests will emphasize
boundary layer flows that flank the South American Andes Mountain ranges. This
work may lead to improved and efficient modelling of climate processes in which
air-surface interchanges are of principal importance.
