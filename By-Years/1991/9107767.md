The natural process of real-estate development, whether residential or
industrial or dam sites, tends to utilize the most easily developed sites first.
Thus, as the 21st century approaches, geotechnical engineers are increasingly
being challenged to provide satisfactory foundations for facilities to be
constructed on sites with poor or marginal soil conditions. This trend, combined
with improvements in hazard analysis, and the increased expectations of the
public for constructed facilities to be risk free, can be expected to increase.
It is especially urgent for existing structures founded on poor soils in
hazardous locations. The objective of this workshop is to provide a forum for
the exchange of knowledge and experience among experts with a wide variety of
viewpoints and perspectives on soil improvement, foundation remediation, and
geotechnical earthquake engineering. The specific goals of the workshop are: (1)
to summarize the current state of knowledge concerning soil improvement and its
applicability to foundation remediation for various geotechnical hazards,
especially those which are earthquake induced; (2) to identify and evaluate
current research needs and opportunities in these areas; and (3) to identify and
prioritize research needs in soil and foundation remediation. The participants
are experts in soil improvement, foundation remediation and earthquake
engineering, and come from industry, government and academia, thereby providing
a broad range of background and perspective on the topics to be discussed. The
workshop is to be held during July 1991 on the campus of the University of
Washington in Seattle.
