With National Science Foundation support Dr. Todd Disotell and his colleagues
will purchase an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer. This instrument is an automated
system used for the sizing, sequencing and quantification of nucleic acids. The
device integrates multicolor fluorescent labeling of nucleic acids with
capillary electrophoresis to size and quantitate DNA molecules. Two of the
advantages of using this technology to measure DNA include the use of polymers
in capillary tubes rather than gels and the use of fluorescent dyes rather than
radioactive isotopes for visualization. The instrument has a daily throughput of
up to 4200 DNA bases when used for sequencing and is fully automated, so that
once samples are prepared they are automatically loaded, run and analyzed
without additional user input. This is a great advantage over manual techniques
that need to be continuously monitored. The goal of the research is to
understand the processes involved in the evolution of higher primate species and
the instrument will be used to sequence multiple loci from large numbers of
individuals from select primate species. In particular the researchers will
focus on closely related Cercopithecines (guenons, macaques, mangabeys and
mandrills) and on two species of baboons which interbreed in a hybrid zone. The
project is especially interesting because it focuses on species that are just on
the cusp of evolutionary separation and therefore the work will shed light on
both the behavioral and biological mechanisms which serve to establish
interspecific barriers. Intellectually the project falls at the borderline
between population genetics and taxonomic analysis and serves to integrate
concepts from both areas. Acquisition of this instrument will speed research in
Dr. Disotell's lab and generate data of interest to many biologists and social
scientists. It will also assist in the training of students in the NYU and other
New York City university anthropology and biology departments.
