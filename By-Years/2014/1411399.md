The investigators in the collaborative proposal will make measurements of nearby
dwarf galaxies and compare them with theoretical simulations to constrain the
nature of Dark Matter in the universe. Broader impacts of the work include
training of graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher, and engagement of
under-represented groups toward careers in science. Visualizations of dark
matter simulations will be created for public outreach.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program aims to measure chemical and dynamical
structure of stars within the Milky Way's dwarf spheroidal satellites and
compare the measurements to simulations, in order to infer the spatial
distribution of dark matter in the least luminous galaxies. They will compare
observational results directly to the first suite of cosmological/
hydrodynamical simulations that resolve actual observables - stellar positions,
velocities, metallicities, and ages. The generation of mock observational
catalogs from simulations will allow dark matter and galaxy formation models to
be compared to data strictly in terms of observables. The wider ranging impact
of this project is to test the standard cold dark matter cosmological model.
