The echoes seen by high frequency radars consist of intense "coherent" signal
returns from "irregularities" in the ionosphere and weak "incoherent" returns
from the background thermal structure of the plasma. The latter echoes give the
plasma concentration, composition, electron and ion temperatures, and are due to
plasma waves from a variety of sources, including electrical currents flowing
through the plasma and gravity waves propagating through the neutral atmosphere.
A thin layer of echoes seen at mid-latitudes and now at the equator has not been
explained. The irregularities cause distortion and interference in short wave
radio communication, and in ground to satellite communication links. This award
is for radar studies at the Jicamarca Observatory in Peru. Measurements will be
made of irregularities and waves in the Mesosphere (50-85 km altitude) and in
the Lower Thermosphere (85-120 km altitude) to better understand the nature of
the mechanisms producing them.
