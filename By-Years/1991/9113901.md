The objective of this internship project is to develop a computer model that
will analyze and test cell loading rules within a chemical processing and
manufacturing environment. The methodology is driven by a schedule-based
materials requirement planning process (SB-MRP) to generate finite capacity
schedules as opposed to rough-cut capacity planning. The application environment
is unique in that this effort will be carried out subsequent to an in-house
Just-In-Time effort that focused on waste elimination. The applicability of SB-
MRP as an integration tool should result in useful generalizations for similar
environments.
