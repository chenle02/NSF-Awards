A grant has been awarded to Yale University School of Medicine to acquire an
electron tomography microscope for quantitative high-resolution imaging of cells
and nanomaterials in three dimensions (3D). With its impressive high resolution
(~5 nanometers) the new microscope will make it possible to visualize thick
biological sections and other objects volumetrically, and will be used by more
than 17 laboratories from 11 Yale departments. Specific focus areas will include
high-resolution imaging of neurons and synapses, vesicular traffic,
cytoskeleton, and nanomaterials, as well as the development of new methods of
image analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The grant will have a broad impact in the
Yale scientific community and beyond. It will help train students and
postdoctoral fellows in powerful new imaging techniques, forge new
collaborations across discipline boundaries, bring scientists from diverse
backgrounds together, create new partnerships with the private sector, develop
methodology to analyze and mine tomography datasets, and provide a strong
program for education and outreach to the local community (via links to local
high schools and Yale ?STARS?, SURF, Biostep programs). In all of these ways,
the award will support the scientific, educational, and diversity aims of Yale
University and the National Science Foundation. &lt;br/&gt;
