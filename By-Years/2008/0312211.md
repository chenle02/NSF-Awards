This Minority Post-Doctoral Research and Training Fellowship in the Social and
Behavioral Sciences involves four components which grow out of the PI's
dissertation research. The dissertation research is a study of how urban
inequality affects neighborhood mobilization at the neighborhood level in
Chicago from 1970 to 1990. In this project, the PI will use event data to
analyze the variation in mobilization rates for both protest and civic activity
in Chicago's neighborhoods. The first component is to do a qualitative study of
a small subset (four to six) of neighborhoods which (four to six) mobilized. The
second component is to collect data from a Boston newspaper to compare
mobilization rates to that of Chicago. Third, would be to combine voting data
with that of protest and civic action to see if there is any relation between
the three. Lastly, the project will undertake more advanced spatial and temporal
modeling than in the dissertation to examine various issues. These issues
include: 1) the diffusion of protest across Chicago; 2) what role the
urban/suburban dichotomy plays in collective action; and 3) how the ecology of
the city is related to the ecology of action and what that means for both the
study of collective action and urban poverty. This research and training will be
undertaken under the mentorship of Rob Sampson, who specializes in the
understanding of neighborhood dynamics and urban poverty. This project will
training a future researcher in the social and behavioral sciences who is
underrepresented in the sciences. It will increase our understanding of
collective action, political action, and inequality at the city level.
