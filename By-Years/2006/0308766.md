0308766&lt;br/&gt;Pincus&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This U.S.-Mexico award
will support a Symposium on Complex Fluids to be held in conjunction with a
larger conference on statistical physics in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, August
24-29, 2003. The meeting has been organized by Dr. Phillip Pincus, of the
University of California, Santa Barbara, together with Dr. Magdaleno Medina-
Noyola and Dr. Jaime Ruiz Garcia, both of the Institute of Physics of the
Universidad Autonoma de San Luis de Potosi. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The complex
fluids field is highly interdisciplinary, relying on insights from several
disciplines, such as physics, biology, chemistry, and engineering. On the
international scale, it has become a major area for applications and is of
increased relevance to the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, biomedical
engineering, and newly emerging nano-electronics and photonics efforts that use
soft matter components. Furthermore the corresponding development of
instrumentation and computational algorithms is vital. Both the United States
and Mexico have active program in complex fluids. This symposium will provide
increased visibility for the challenges and opportunities in the field as well
as enhancing specific US-Mexico cooperation. The Division of Materials Research
and the Office of International Science and Engineering are contributing to the
support of this activity. &lt;br/&gt;
