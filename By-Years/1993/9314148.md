9314148 Heegard The workshop brings together specialists in coding, system
theory, and symbolic dynamics. Recent results have shown how concepts in the
three fields are quite closely related. Each field has its own language and
viewpoint, which has posed barriers to sharing results and concepts. The
purposes of this workshop are to promote communication among researchers in each
of these three areas and to present cutting-edge research problems in each field
with the hope that cross-fertilization will promote progress. The workshop will
be held October 18-20, 1993 in Mansfield Massachusetts. The organizing committee
includes David Forney, Motorola/Codex; Chris Heegard, Cornell University; Brian
Marcus, IBM Almaden Research Center; and Mitchell Trott, MIT. ***
