This RUI project is a companion project to the RUI project CCR-9503601 (PI:
Belanger) of Northeast Missouri State University. (1) The first part of this
research project aims to better understand the properties and structures of
average-case NP-complete problems under randomizing reductions. Randomizing
reducibility is a powerful tool used to learn about average-case completeness.
In particular, the existence of isomorphisms between complete problems and the
structure of complete problems under randomizing reductions are studied.
Polynomial isomorphisms are explored in the setting of randomizing many-to-one
reductions based on recent results on the NP-isomorphism problem with respect to
random instances, which have explicit support for this goal. (2) The second
research topic is rankable distributions. P-rankable distributions were proposed
recently to capture the ranking of probability distributions, but they are not
directly comparable to p-time computable distributions used in the literature.
The goal here is to investigate whether p-rankable distributions can provide
harder instances than p-time computable distributions for randomized NP decision
problems and randomized NP search problems.
