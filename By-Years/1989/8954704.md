Acting on behalf of a group of academic, educational and public-service
organizations the University of California-Santa Barbara proposes to improve
aquatic science education in informal settings that include youth-service
organizations such as the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, YMCA, YWCA, Boys and Girls
Clubs and 4-H. The specific emphasis will be on the close interdependence
between humans and the aquatic environment and on the need for enlightened
social action in defense of that environment. The thrusts of the project will be
to establish the California Aquatic Science Education Consortium; to develop
multiple copes of sets of instructional materials on topic of aquatic science
appropriate for informal educational settings; and to develop a program for
training a cadre of trainers who in turn will train volunteers in the use of the
materials. The program has a significant potential for broader national
application.
