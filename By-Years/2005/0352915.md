AST-0352915/Gary, NJIT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Radio frequency interference
excision techniques will be developed that are applicable to radio telescope
arrays consisting of multiple small elements. The specific application is for
the future Frequency Agile Solar Radio Telescope, but the techniques will be
applicable to most multi-element radio interferometers. Undergraduate and
graduate students will be involved in the work, and the personnel conducting the
research are involved in multiple outreach activities with the urban area
surrounding the New Jersey Institute of Technology.
