The chemical identification of nanometer sized features and individual molecules
on solid surfaces is the focus of this research project. With the support of the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Hipps and his colleagues at
Washington State University, are using orbital mediated tunneling spectroscopy
in combination with scanning tunneling microscopy to examine the electronic
structure of large organic and organometallic molecular layers on metal and
graphite surfaces. The role of intermolecular packing and interface structure in
determining the electronic transport properties of these layers is being
examined. The information gained from these studies will provide fundamental
design information for molecule based electronic and opto-electronic devices.

As electronic devices shrink to the nanoscale and molecular scale, more
fundamental information about the electronic structure of these molecular
electronic devices is needed. This research project, in the laboratory of
Professor Hipps at Washington State University, uses orbital mediated tunneling
spectroscopy to obtain this electronic structure information about well
characterized molecular overlayers on metal and carbon surfaces. In addition to
the fundamental understanding obtained by these studies, an improved tool for
the electronic characterization of molecular electronic architectures will
result.
