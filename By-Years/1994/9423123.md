Caches and write buffers are becoming increasingly important to memory
hierarchy designs since they are the key components for bridging the widening
performance gap between microprocessors and DRAMs. This research studies the
details of memory-referencing behavior in contemporary uniprocessors such as
multiple referencing behavior . In particular, the research investigates the
fine distinctions that characterize data references with respect to their cache
and write-buffer behavior, and also studies possible architectural and
organizational enhancements that will benefit writes.
