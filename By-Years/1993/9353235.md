This is a conference will bring in 10 teams consisting of a classroom teacher,
a school librarian and a principal for a two day conference/workshop held just
prior to the annual meetings of the American Library Association and the
American Association of School Librarians. The conference will focus on
standards and hands on science with emphasis upon integration of the school
librarian and the classroom teacher in collaboration in science teaching. A
total of about 13 hours of involvement will occur during the conference. A
bimonthly newsletter will provide followup and networking for the conferees and
an additional number of teachers and librarians.
