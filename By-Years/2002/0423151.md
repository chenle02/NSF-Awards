This workshop entitled "Astrometry in the Age of the Next Generation of Large
Telescope" is scheduled for three days, October 18-20, 2004, and will be held in
the Visitors' Center of the Lowell Observatory, Flagstaff, Arizona. Attendance
is limited to about 100 participants from throughout the United States and
abroad. This is the first meeting since 1984 that has focused on narrow field
astrometry, primarily carried out from the ground, and the future of precise
astrometric measurements. Such fundamental measurements contribute to many areas
of astrophysics. There have been deep impacts from the Hipparcos mission and the
development of digital imaging cameras for astrometry. The next decade promises
even more scientific returns on the investment in advanced large telescope
technologies, if proper attention is paid to the specific requirements of
positional astronomy, but these requirements must be folded into engineering
designs and data pipelines now. Students will be encouraged to attend the
meeting. Proceedings for the workshop will be published in a timely manner and
all review talks and poster contributions will be included
