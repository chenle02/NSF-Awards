This project is part of a cooperative program to investigate the newly
discovered respiration-linked metal reduction by a freshwater bacterium. In this
unusual mode of energy metabolism iron and manganese are reduced under anaerobic
conditions. The companion project, DCB 89-17215, investigates the terminal
reductases responsible for metal reduction. This project supports one graduate
student who will attempt to isolate and characterize additional bacteria capable
of this unique type of respiration. This work will advance our knowledge of
cycling of metals in aquatic sediments and provide an interesting study of
biological diversity.
