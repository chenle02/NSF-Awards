The Organic Dynamics Program supports Professor Wesley G. Bentrude, of the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Utah, for his studies of free
radical and photochemical reactions of organophosphorus systems. Professor
Bentrude is exploring the use of three-coordinate phosphorus molecules as traps
for biradical intermediates and the selective diversion and functionalization of
free radical intermediates through new uses of phosphoranyl radical chemistry.
Fundamental aspects of the influence of electronic structure on the efficiencies
of triplet-sensitized intramolecular photorearrangements of allyl phosphite
triesters, cyclization and fragmentation reactions of radical cations of three-
coordinate phosphorus molecules, and the radical pair vs. concerted nature of
the photo-Arbuzov rearrangement are also under investigation. With the support
of the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Wesley G. Bentrude, of the Department
of Chemistry at the University of Utah, studies the chemistry of phosphorus-
containing molecules. Such compounds are found in a number of important
settings, with practical applications as antioxidants, fuel additives, and
antitumor and antiviral agents, and are also key intermediates in a number of
biochemical transformations. Through the discovery of new reactions of
phosphorus-containing molecules and elucidation of the pathways by which these
reactions occur, Professor Bentrude contributes to our fundamental understanding
of the chemistry of these important compounds.
