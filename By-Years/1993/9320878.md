9320878 Mahon This research investigation engages ideas about taxation and state
formation, in seeking to account for the pattern of tax reform and nonreform
across Latin America since the onset of the debt crisis in 1982. The debt
crisis, because it called for a large private-to-public transfer of resources in
order to fund increased debt service, directly or indirectly spurred fiscal
changes. Yet, not all countries reformed taxes substantially in this context,
and those that reformed did not do so in the same way or with the same results.
This study will explore hypotheses relating the degree and nature of tax reform
to international capital mobility, to a country's experience of economic crisis,
to international influences, and to the electoral cycle. The investigator will
retrieve relevant data in library research at William College, Yale University,
the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the Library of Congress. This will be
supplemented by interviews with tax experts at the IMF and elsewhere. The data
will include measures of tax revenue as a proportion of Gross Domestic Product;
the stock of overseas capital held by residents, as a proportion of gross fixed
capital formation; level of investment; inflation; GDP growth; and information
about formal communications with international financial institutions. The
research involves two pooled time- series designs, one with thirteen countries
and the other with seven, both over the fifteen year period, 1977-1991. This
research is especially relevant today, as Latin American governments face a
potentially sharp conflict between dealing with worsening social problems and
winning the confidence of international investors. Tax reform may be one way to
moderate this conflict. This investigation will deepen our understanding of this
aspect of state competence in Latin America. ***
