The heat shock response, defined as the rapid induction of heat shock proteins
(HSPs), was first described in 1962 by Ritossa in Drosophila. It has since been
shown that the response is ubiquitous in all living organisms, that it can be
elicited by a wide range of physiological and noxious stimuli, and that the
genes and proteins of HSPs are highly conserved through evolution. These
features underscore the importance of HSPs in biology. This laboratory has shown
that the heat shock response is attenuated in senescent human diploid
fibroblasts. Experiments are proposed to study the signal transduction mechanism
of the heat shock response and the regulation of this mechanism in cell aging.
Specifically, experiments are proposed to evaluate if cAMP and cAMP-dependent
protein kinase may participate in the regulation of heat shock gene expression,
and if so, whether this regulation is through the basal or the inducible
promoter element. The approaches to be used include: analysis of the effects of
expression vectors of cAMP- dependent protein kinase and the protein kinase
inhibitor on the basal and heat induced expression of the hsp 70 promoter driven
reporter gene; and determining the effects of cAMP-elevating agents on the
expression of the endogenous and transfected hsp 70 gene. The wealth of
knowledge of the molecular organization of the heat shock genes, the age-
dependent attenuation of this induction, and the acknowledged importance of cAMP
and cAMP-dependent protein kinase as a biological control mechanism are features
that make this system particularly useful in analysis of signal transduction and
gene expression. The long-range goal of this research program is to gain a
better understanding of the regulation and function of heat shock genes.
