The Division of Natural and Computational Sciences and Talladega College will
conduct a RCMS Program designed to prepare talented minority undergraduates for
graduate and professional school in science, engineering and technology fields.
More specifically, the objectives of the project re to: o increase the number of
highly qualified potential science majors entering Talladega College o Enhance
preparation and retention of Talladega science and pre-engineering students for
graduate and professional school o facilitate the entry of a greater number of
Talladega College students into graduate and professional school in science and
engineering fields To achieve the objectives, several elements categories of
activities are proposed, namely: o outreach and recruitment o bridge summer
program between high school and Talladega College o curriculum embellishments
and strengthened course sequences o summer and academic research at major
research universities: o strong counseling and advising o financial support
Through an intense outreach effort, talented minority high school students will
be recruited for participation in a four year comprehensive RCMS science program
involving the disciplines of Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science
and Biology, with dual degree option in geology and engineering. RCMS Scholars
will be provided with financial support consisting, in part, of tuition and
fees.
