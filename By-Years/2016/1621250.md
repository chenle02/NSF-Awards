The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) project will a new type of liquid-handling robot. Currently,
most liquid handling in biology research is carried out manually. Due to the
complexity and high cost of automated systems compared with the ease-of-use and
low cost of manual instruments, automation primarily benefits a few industrial,
high-throughput applications. However, new ideas and discoveries typically take
place on a much smaller scale, and, thus, the tremendous impact, by way of
repeatable science, promised by automation is diminished. This project provides
an easy-to-use tool, priced on par with manual pipettors, which may have an
immediate positive impact on biology research labs worldwide. By bringing
repeatable protocols and reduced complexity to the market, this project will
change the way biologists approach bench-top science, improving repeatability
and the rate of innovation in the life sciences.

This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop an automation platform for
laboratory liquid handling based on a miniature liquid handling robot controlled
by a new language to capture biological protocols. It fits like a lid on the top
of a microtiter plate, and it can accompany the plate for the duration of a
days-long protocol, even in the incubator, and carry out all or most of the
liquid-handling steps of the protocol. In addition, the accompanying software
will be designed to improve reproducibility and record-keeping in bench biology
work. The goal is to maintain precision volume dispensing while minimizing
cross-contamination and providing continuous monitoring and liquid management in
a miniature robot. This will require a robot moving precisely in four axes while
constrained to the approximate volume of a cup of coffee. The software will be
designed to create a general language for capturing biology protocols. This
project aims to improve laboratory standards and allow exchange of experiment
designs.
