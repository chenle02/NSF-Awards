The cell surface structures that mediate the activation of T lymphocytes have
been identified by genetic means. To extend our understanding of the function of
this complex of molecules, information on the physiology of interaction between
these structures and their ligand, antigen, must be developed. Identification of
the antigen binding sites possessed by the genetically identified structures
will be accomplished by utilizing an antigen that can covalently bind to such
structures when irradiated with visible light. Specifically, sulfo.SANPAH immune
T lymphocytes will be incubated with sulfo.SANPAH, irradiated, and the
sulfo.SANPAH labelled structures will be identified immunochemically. A similar
approach will be employed to examine antigen presentation. The information
derived will contribute fundamental knowledge basic to our understanding of the
ontogeny and regulation of the immune system. Since this research will be
carried out at an undergraduate institution, it will also provide undergraduate
students with exposure to research on a problem at the forefront of modern
immunobiology.
