This proposal addresses questions in ocean circulation by using theoretical
models and laboratory experiments. The primary issues concern the control of the
circulation by bottom contours and atmospheric forcing. The investigator will
consider the significance of abyssal overflows into a basin, the modification of
the near surface layer by ocean stratification, and the time dependent
adjustment of the circulation to changes in key parameters.
