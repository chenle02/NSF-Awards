The major question addressed by Dr. Berman's studies is how the brain processes
information given to it by the eyes. As scientists have learned more about how
vision occurs, it has become clear that there are separate systems for
processing particular types of information, such as pattern, color and motion,
which can be identified at all levels of the visual pathways including the
retina. In the retina, certain cells are specialized to detect particular types
of stimuli in the visual world. These cells send information to particular
regions of the brain which are specialized in processing the same type of
information. The two major types of retinal cells are the "on-center" cell,
which detects light objects on a dark background, and the "off-center" cell,
which detects dark objects on a light background. In the retina, these cells are
anatomically distinct, and each type is organized to allow it to "see" the
complete visual environment independently of the other type. The major goal of
Dr. Berman's work will be to learn how on-center and off-center information is
processed in the region of the brain which receives this retinal information,
the lateral geniculate nucleus. Dr. Berman will use anatomical and physiological
methods to study the detailed arrangement of these cell types in this nucleus.
This will provide basic information on how the brain processes information about
contrast, an essential function for normal vision.
