Extreme weather events such as hurricanes can have devastating impacts on
coastal ecosystems. The process of recovery from these events is likely
influenced by hurricane-driven evolutionary changes in the species that inhabit
these ecosystems. The effects of these evolutionary changes can be propagated
through food webs by interactions with other species. This project investigates
how evolutionary change in top predators influences the recovery of coastal
ecosystems affected by Hurricane Dorian â€“ a historically powerful storm that hit
Abaco, Bahamas on September 1, 2019 with maximum sustained winds of 295 km/hr.
The research will deepen our understanding of both the impacts of hurricanes on
coastal ecosystems and the pace and trajectory of recovery. This work will
facilitate our ability to predict effects of extreme weather events and to
manage vulnerable shorelines. Results will be shared with the local community
through collaboration with a Bahamian non-profit organization.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hurricanes are expected to exert natural selection on both
morphological and behavioral traits of the predatory brown anole lizard (Anolis
sagrei). In turn, we expect shifts in these traits to alter the effect of brown
anoles on arthropods and plants during the early stages of recovery from
Hurricane Dorian. These hypotheses will be evaluated by: 1) comparing lizard
populations pre- and post-hurricane to assess selection imposed on brown anole
morphological and behavioral traits, and 2) using replicated experimental brown
anole reintroductions to small islands. These experimental populations will
differ in morphological and behavioral traits, and will be used to investigate
how hurricane-driven trait changes influence the recovery of vegetation and the
reassembly of arthropod communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
