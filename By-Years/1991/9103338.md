This research is for design and evaluation of architectures suitable for fuzzy
logic applications. It uses a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) as a core
processor and adds a fuzzy logic instruction set. It also contains special
hardware functional units for fuzzy logic related operations. Simulation and
detailed prototype design will be carried out to evaluate various design
tradeoffs.
