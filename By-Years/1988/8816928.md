Collaborative project with Cornell, ORSTROM (a French research institute).
Project operates 10 ocean bottom seismometers in central Vanuatu (formerly the
New Hebrides). Project uses arrivals of clusters of earthquakes from Efate as
the seismic source for the obs' to determine the velocity/density structure of
the lithosphere. Project uses earthquake locations to determine the depth and
geometry of the subducting structure in the region. Investigates the broad zone
of earthquakes at the 60-80 km depth which lie west of the benioff zone of the
d'Entrecasteaux ridge.
