The PI and his collaborators, will continue their investigation of the relations
between periods and special values of L-functions. Specifically, those
pertaining to the conjecture of Bloch and Beilinson for elliptic curves and
those implied by Borel's theorem for a number field and their connection to the
Mahler measure of Laurent polynomials and the geometry of hyperbolic
3-manifolds.

The PI's research area is in Number Theory, a very old subject with connections
to every other conceivable area of Mathematics as well as Physics. It is
remarkable how the type of questions one would like to answer in Number Theory,
for example, can we write the number 1 as the sum of the cubes of two rational
numbers?, which at the time of Fermat (1600's) say, most likely had no direct
implications to everyday life, have evolved into highly relevant issues today.
In our current technology age, Number Theory is behind much of the safety of
common activities like, for example, shopping on the internet. The PI's specific
research concerns L-functions, certain analytic objects one associates to
questions like the one above, which are central to modern Number Theory and from
which one expects to, and often does, retrieve answers.
