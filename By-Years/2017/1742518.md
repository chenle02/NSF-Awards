With funding from the National Science Foundation's Scholarships in Science,
Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (S-STEM) program, the "NSF S-STEM
Scholarship Program: Computer Science Plus, Plus (CS++)" is providing support to
low-income students with demonstrated financial need and academic promise to
succeed in STEM disciplines at Middle Tennessee State University. The project is
funding 100 scholarships over 5 years for students who are pursuing bachelor's
degrees in Computer Science. A pipeline of activities will be employed to
recruit and retain academically talented students, improve academic performance,
inspire exploration of the CS discipline, instill CS career knowledge at an
early stage, encourage and provide help to land CS related internships, and hire
students with professional experiences as mentors for lower level
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CS++ project will study the impact of a
proposed new peer-mentoring program, which will leverage the group of CS majors
who work in the computing field as mentors for lower level CS majors. Research
will focus on the impact of this unique mentoring experience, which seeks to
engage younger students in networking and career building activities, primarily
through job shadowing and internships, providing real-world insight for the
younger students and stronger departmental connections for the working students.
Scholarship recipients will be provided a rich set of academic and non-academic
services to support their retention in CS. Additionally, the project will focus
on two problems identified by local analytics: (1) the low number and percentage
of female and other underrepresented minority (URM) CS majors, and (2) the poor
retention of lower level students, especially female and other UMR CS majors.
The overall success and impact of the CS++ program will be measured based on
enrollment and retention in the department.
