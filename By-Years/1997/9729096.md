Winglee, Robert AST 97-29096 While jets from young stellar objects are common
in regions of star formation, and recent theoretical and observational work
implies that jets are an integral and perhaps necessary component of the early
evolution of low-mass stars, the mechanisms that launch them are not fully
understood. Drs. Winglee and Bohm investigate the hypothesis that the jets are
the result of a time dependent interaction between the magnetic field and the
accretion disk around a typical young star. Their work builds on early
simulations that have corroborated the basic features of this launching
mechanism for jets, and produced a two-component outflow of jets and winds which
is in agreement with observations. Their work extends this model to a more
complete parameter space, and tests the model against a variety of existing
imaging and spectroscopic observations. The model makes predictions on the
velocity spectrum of the outflow, the time variability of the outflow
observables, and the correlation of these observed parameters with X-ray flares,
as well as ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) excesses associated with accretion
streams and disks, which can be tested against existing observations.
