Isotopic and elemental composition of groundwater are influenced by climatic
conditions at the time of recharge and are therefore potential indicators for
climate change. To date little work has been done to unravel climate information
contained in deep circulating groundwater. However, it has been successfully
demonstrated that in selected aquifers the isotopic composition of groundwater
and the concentrations of dissolved noble gases can be related to
paleotemperatures and/or past atmospheric circulation patterns. These studies
raised hopes that groundwater as an archive of paleoclimate may play an
important role in future climate research, but they also indicate that there are
still many open questions that must be addressed. This award supports a meeting
at Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory of Columbia University to explore the
potential and strategies for future paleoclimate research in this area.
