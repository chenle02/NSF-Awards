The Physics Department of Purdue University will provide research experiences
for twelve undergraduate students and two science teachers, continuing the
record over the past four years of providing enriching projects with physics
faculty conducting forefront research. Each participant will have his/her
individual project with a faculty mentor in one of the areas of active research
at Purdue, including astrophysics, nanoscience, particle physics, biological
physics, high energy nuclear physics, accelerator-based mass spectrometry,
geophysics, and condensed matter physics. The REU program aims to select ten
academically qualified students from across the country, plus an additional two
students from Purdue. Each year our goal is for more than half of the
participants to be women, and we strive to increase the diversity of the
participants by targeting appropriate schools and applicants. The Research
Experience for Teachers (RET) component will be fully embedded into the REU
program, but with an added focus of developing techniques for meeting new state
and national goals in science education. The Purdue program emphasizes a well-
rounded schedule of weekly tutorials for group experience with joint projects
for building experimental skills, weekly seminars with speakers representing the
diverse career paths for physicists, field trips to Fermilab and the Advanced
Photon Source (Argonne), plus a social schedule of canoe trips, ball games,
picnics, etc. The program culminates each summer with a research symposium, to
give each student professional experience in public presentation of research.
