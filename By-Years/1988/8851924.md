A Hewlett-Packard 5890A/5870B gas chromatograph with a mass selective detector,
including ion gauge, data system and software is being utilized in this project.
Nearly 80% of the student research in chemistry, biology and psychology is being
facilitated, with at least 60% of the science majors learning the principles and
some applications of this important analytical method. The young women are being
better prepared to enter graduate school and the work force in science.
Significant student research is being produced and disseminated through
presentations at professional meetings and in the appropriate technical
journals. The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources.
