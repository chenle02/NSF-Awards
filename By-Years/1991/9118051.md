The principal investigator will (1) evaluate the budget of the rare earth
elements, as well as U and Th, in the Wepawaug Schist of south central
Connecticut, and (2) develop techniques for precisely determining the prograde
temperature-pressure-time history of pelitic metamorphic rocks. This work will
help constrain the absolute time of formation of important minerals, and in turn
give geologists critical information needed to interpret rock ages and geologic
events.
