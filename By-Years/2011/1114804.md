The Hubbard Brook (HBR) Experimental Forest LTER project began in 1988, drawing
on a history of forest ecosystem research that began in the 1950s, and has the
continuing overall goal of improving understanding of the structure and function
of Northern Forest ecosystems and their responses to environmental change and
disturbance. This project will advance the conceptual and quantitative basis for
predicting fluxes of energy and materials and distributions of the biota under
the influences of environmental changes that are accelerated by the activities
of people. The project includes observational and experimental approaches, at
both small plot and whole watershed scales, and integrates biogeochemical,
geohydrologic, and biological approaches to understand the consequences to
Northern Forest ecosystems of air pollution, atmospheric deposition, and
regional climate change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project improves
understanding of the ecology and dynamics of Northern Forest ecosystems and
advances approaches for managing them effectively now and into the future. It
assembles and integrates unique long-term data sets that address the important
societal issues of forest management, air pollution and atmospheric deposition,
invasive species, and regional climate change. Its broader values also include
extensive research-based training, K-12 curriculum development and teacher
training sessions, and public outreach programs. The project provides scientific
syntheses, coupled with scientific assessment of alternative management
strategies, in formats readily available to the public, the media, educators,
and policy-makers.
