9417248 Turner This award supports a two-year cooperative research project
between Dr. Edwin Turner of Princeton University and Professor Masayuki Umemura
of the University of Tsukuba. This research will support a collaborative
theoretical investigation of the critical physical processes that affected black
hole formation very early in the history of the universe and of observations
that might further illuminate the issue. The researchers will focus on
hydrodynamics, concentrating on the possibility that massive black holes can
form directly during the initial collapse of protogalaxies at high redshifts.
The U.S. and Japanese investigators have all independently carried out research
programs in the focus area.. The team led by Dr. Turner will be concerned with
observations whereas Professor Umemura s group will concern itself with
numerical simulations. By combining these expertises, the two groups can achieve
a deeper understanding and more rapid progress than can either group alone. ***
