Hearing in mammals involves a remarkable structure called the cochlea. This
tiny coiled organ of the inner ear contains membranes and fluids in chambered
partitions, with a highly organized array of sensory receptor cells that excite
fibers in the auditory nerve to the brain. Motion of the eardrum is produced by
sound pressure waves, and these small motions are transmitted to fluids of the
inner ear, driving microscopic movements of the membranes, and stimulating the
sensory cells. New tools of anatomy, physiology, physics, and mathematical
modelling have allowed examination of the dynamics and "micromechanics" of the
inner ear, and increased our understanding of the structure and function of this
important organ. This conference will bring experimental work together with
theoretical work to promote interaction and full discussion of cochlear
mechanisms. This multidisciplinary, but sharply focussed approach has led to
past conferences of substantial impact. The immediate publication of the
proceedings will insure that the impact is broad as well as deep. Understanding
the peripheral mechanisms of hearing will help considerably in our understanding
of how the brain processes auditory information, and is likely in the long term
to lead to applied advances in fields such as audio recording, noise
suppression, hearing aids, speech analysis, and aspects of signal detection.
