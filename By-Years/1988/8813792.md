The proposal is a planning project that will hold a series of seminars to focus
on the special needs that women have in the study of calculus and mathematics.
The culminating event will be a faculty retreat and the writing of a report on
the faculty member's "shared experiences." The project will be at Spelman
College, a traditional black institution for females with strong academic
traditions. The program will include formal participation by the chairman of the
mathematics department at Agnes Scott College, a female institution with equally
strong academic traditions. The year will start with three seminars lead by
consultants with special expertise in the area of female studies in mathematics.
The consultants are: Elizabeth Fennema, Lenora Bloom and Rhonda Hughes. These
presentations and consultations should senistize the faculty participants to the
special elements of females studying mathematics. Three additional consultants
will assist with three later seminars that will concentrate on the role of
computers in the study of calculus. In the spring term, a pilot section of
calculus will use and investigate computer software specially designed to assist
in the study of calculus. Three undergraduate students will help with the
evaluation of the materials. The year will end with a two day retreat in which
the senior personnel and a graduate student will conetrate on the successful
experiences that the faculty members have had in their years of instructing
female students. With the help of the specialized consultants, the faculty will
be sensitive to the issues, able to recall and clairify their collected
experiences and compile a report of "successful shared experiences."
