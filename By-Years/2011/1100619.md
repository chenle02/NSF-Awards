The research objective of this award is to address challenges within sustainable
design by developing and validating a novel methodology that enables correlation
of product functions and life cycle environmental impacts. The new method
enables quantitative environmental impact measurements taken during downstream
product lifecycle stages to be projected onto the early design phase. The
research tasks include: 1) developing a new function-impact (FIM) and
process/material impact (PIM) method for allocating life cycle environmental
impacts to product functions during early design; 2) developing a probabilistic
model to study the uncertainties and subjectivity within the FIM in addition to
the uncertainties related to design decision making with regards to
sustainability; and 3) validating the FIM and PIM methods with real-world case
studies and integrate them with current industrial
practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will allow product
designers to develop a more proactive approach with regards to considering
environmental sustainability within the product life cycle. Possible
categorization of entire product systems in terms of environmental impact will
allow designers to reuse knowledge for developing greener products.
Dissemination of sustainable design practices to engineering students is among
the primary goals of this project. Students exposed to results from this
research will have the capability to practice state-of-the art environment-
friendly design and manufacturing tools as engineers and serve as proponents for
sustainable product development in their organizations. It is hoped that over
the long term, the research, education, and dissemination efforts conducted will
greatly facilitate a paradigm shift where sustainable thinking, including
materials and process, will be a natural part of the design decision making
process.
