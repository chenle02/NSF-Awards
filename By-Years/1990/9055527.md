This proposal will provide training over a three-year period to enhance the
teaching capabilities of two different groups of teachers, one with a background
in science, and the other with a background in the education of mildly
handicapped children. The participants are middle school/junior high certified
teachers of science or special education who teach science to children
classified as learning disabled or emotionally disturbed. The project includes
two waves of 24 trainees for three years in a summer program with follow-up
sessions during the academic year. Approximately 60% of the sessions are devoted
to content and the remainder to teaching methods and clinical experiences with
handicapped children. In summary, the project has potential for increasing the
teaching effectiveness of middle school/junior high teachers in science to
children with learning disabilities. Cost sharing equals 11% of the NSF award.
