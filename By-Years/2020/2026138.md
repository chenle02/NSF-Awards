The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve middle school Science,
Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) education. The project will create a
whole-classroom virtual reality (VR) experience for middle school students to be
exposed to topics interactively as a supplement to the existing curriculum.
While immersed in their very own 3D virtual treehouse lab, students will be able
to join other student labs and collaboratively explore a variety of scientific
concepts. This is facilitated by a teacher-oriented desktop and VR interface
that makes it possible to manage an entire class of students simultaneously
participating in VR activities. By leveraging the use of affordable standalone
VR headsets, and elevating VR beyond its current one-student-at-a-time use case,
the project will help launch virtual field trips for use in authentic learning
environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase II project will develop an
immersive multiplayer virtual reality (VR) learning game for authentic classroom
usage. The project will apply the advantages of a modular game design built
around self-directed goals to test a classroom-management system built to allow
an entire class of students to collaborate in or outside virtual reality. While
immersed in individual 3D virtual environments, students will be able to join
virtual spaces belonging to other students in order to accomplish shared goals
set by the teacher at a class level. The project also seeks to further the
general field of learning games, by applying the Universal Design for Learning
framework to its local goal of enhancing middle-schoolers' relationships to and
content knowledge of STEM topics. This permits the project to be a test-bed for
educational VR content design and interaction schemes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
