Abstract 93321093 Lubin This project is to develop, build and fly on a long-
duration balloon, to be launched from McMurdo, Antarctica, an experiment to
measure the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) anisotropy. The
instrument will make measurements on an angular scale of from 1O to 10O with a
sensitivity of T/T of a few parts per million. It will use four radiometers
using high mobility electron transistor (HEMT) hetrodyne receivers operating in
pairs with two frequency ranges, 25-35 GHz and 38-45 GHz. The result will be a
medium scale map of the CMBR over selected areas of the southern celestial
hemisphere. This project is an excellent complement to other CMBR measurements
being made at higher frequencies. This project is jointly sponsored by the
Office of Polar Programs and Division of Astronomical Sciences in NSF and also
by NASA. ***
