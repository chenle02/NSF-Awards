The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to Uber-ize and disrupt the home improvement
market. This project will increase market efficiency among homeowners and home
improvement contractors. The knowledge harvesting and case-based estimation
technologies from this project can be applied to a variety of industries in
today's knowledge economy, particularly those benefiting from socially
cultivated knowledge repositories. This project will promote undergraduate
student research and research collaboration at several universities in
Virginia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase I project explores the technical feasibility of delivering accurate
project estimates for the home improvement market by combining a case-based
reasoning approach with crowd intelligence. The project will advance the
research in computer science and social sciences. First, the project develops
and validates a cost estimation methodology that applies case-based reasoning to
a knowledge repository built and evolved by social efforts, through a cycle of
knowledge harvesting, organization, augmentation and calibration. Second, the
project will develop techniques in focused crawling, multi-document
summarization, cased-based reasoning, and advance the research in these fields.
Third, the project will develop and evaluate novel, mobile interfaces for
knowledge elicitation, augmentation and calibration. These exploratory results
will contribute to both computer and social sciences.
