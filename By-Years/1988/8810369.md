A double-pulsed Yag laser is to be acquired and utilized in an ongoing
experimental research program investigating turbulent flow characteristics,
instabilities, and transition to turbulence in boundary layers over flat and
wavy surfaces. Polymer addition and associated friction reduction effects form
part of the research, and finer details of the flows will become available
through this new visualization equipment.
