This project focuses on robust parsing of natural language input (in limited
domains). The research addresses the problems of portability, reliability, and
habitability. It outlines the development of a set of interactive tools which
provide, to both the linguist and the end-user, an accurate set of domain-
specific co-occurrence patterns. This set of tools will partly automate the
creation of the Domain Information Schema (DIS), namely the domain-specific
information required for processing a given domain. The same set of tools,
provided with a different interface for the end-user, will be used to support
interactive text entry.
