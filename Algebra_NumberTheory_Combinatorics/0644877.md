The PI proposes to conduct research on quasirandom analogues of discrete random
systems, both as tools for simulation problems and as objects of study in their
own right. Quasirandom simulation schemes often are just as fast as random
simulations schemes, and when applied to estimation problems typically give
smaller error. The PI's research will study such schemes, and will explore new
ways of removing the ``noise'' from random systems while retaining key features
of their average-case behavior, building on earlier work by the PI, Lionel
Levine, Yuval Peres, Josh Cooper, and Joel Spencer, among others. The resulting
non-random systems exhibit startling symmetry and unexpected structure that call
out for explanation.

Current technology depends heavily on simulation, and many existing methods of
simulation make use of randomness, whether or not the system being simulated has
a random element to it. This ``Monte Carlo Method'' has had huge success in the
past century. My work will explore the notion that in many cases, what makes
Monte Carlo work is not randomness per se but certain regularities that are
consequences of randomness. By bringing these regularities to the fore and
jettisoning randomness itself, one should be able to devise general methods of
simulation that are more accurate.
