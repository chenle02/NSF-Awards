With this award, the Massachusetts Bay Community College Research Integrating
Molecular and Environmental Science (RIMES) program will support ten
undergraduate sudents from diverse backgrounds as they conduct mentored
geoscience research during a summer 2008 field program at Souiffre Hills
volcano, Montserrat. This SGER award will initiate an expansion of the
successful RIMES program from its original focus - looking at the environmental
and ecosystem responses to the most recent volcanic eruption - to more
traditional geoscience research topics, including physical volcanology and
radiogeochemistry. The RIMES program addresses NSF and GEO's goal of broadening
participation in the geosciences, and provides a model program for engaging
minority scholars in this field.
