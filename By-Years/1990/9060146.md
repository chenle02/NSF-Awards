This research applies biochemical techniques to improving the growth and yield
of legumes. A superior nitrogen fixing Rhizobium strain is supported on the
surface of seeds with a matrix made of plant derived biopolymer inoculum
encapsulated with a semi- permeable membrane. The feasibility of protecting this
enriched inoculum, during seed germination and nodulation, from the hostile
microenvironment around the seed is studied experimentally.
