Over the past forty years, many studies have collected empirical data
documenting aspects of the locomotor behavior of anthropoid primates (monkeys
and apes). The results of some of this research have revealed unusual
characteristics in the form of quadrupedalism that primates display. This has in
turn led to suggestions of distinctiveness in primates among mammals in such
things as patterns of neural control of movement. However, based largely on data
for anthropoids only, such conclusions are premature without comparable data on
prosimian primates. The goals of the proposed study, therefore, are to undertake
a set of laboratory based studies concerning aspects of locomotor behavior among
prosimian primates in order to supplement the currently sparse empirical data
base, and allow comparisons with the better-documented locomotor behavior of
anthropoid primates as well as nonprimate mammals. The specific questions this
study will address include documentation of patterns of muscle recruitment
during quadrupedal walking, and analysis of substrate reaction force
distribution during quadrupedal leaping in Varecia variegata and Eulemur
rubriventer. The results of this research will add to a growing empirical data
base on primate locomotor behavior, permitting legitimate conclusions regarding
what is or isn't characteristic of the Order. Such information will contribute
to a more precise definition of what it means to be a primate, and what factors
were involved in the origins of the Order and its eventual dispersal and
diversification. The Stony Brook Primate Locomotion Laboratory continues to
serve as a major resource for student and senior researchers from around the
world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
