This project will primarily investigate the dynamical, chemical and coupling
effects of the quasi-two-day wave in the middle and upper atmosphere. The PI
will accomplish this task by first developing a set of analytical tools designed
to aid in the analysis of Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere-Electrodynamics
General Circulation Model (TIME-GCM) simulations. These tools, once developed,
will be incorporated into the model postprocessor, and made available to the
whole CEDAR community. Additionally, model simulations will be validated with
data from a set of Global-Scale Wave Model (GSWM) simulations, and data
collected from the world day observational period during January 1993. Once the
model simulations are validated, the TIME-GCM simulations will be analyzed to
unravel the complex interactions which occur in the middle and upper atmosphere
relating to the quasi-two-day wave.
