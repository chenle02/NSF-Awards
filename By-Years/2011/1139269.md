The MS PHD'S in Earth System ScienceÂ® Professional Development Program (MS PHD'S
PDP) is promoting the advancement of underrepresented minority (URM) students
and recent doctoral degree recipients in Earth system science (ESS) careers. It
provides URM undergraduate and graduate students with long-term exposure to,
interaction with, and increased participation in the Earth system science
community. This award is supporting one new cohort of 25 MS PHD'S PDP student
participants. MS PHD'S PDP activities address several obstacles to achieving
diversity in the geosciences, including: 1) lack of ESS career opportunities
awareness within URM communities; 2) small numbers of visible URM role models;
and, 3) small numbers of ESS-related programs at minority serving institutions.
The project builds on known best practices for successful STEM diversity
programs, which involve sustained interactions with students, mentoring by
professionals, exposure to educational and research opportunities. It focuses on
understanding and participating in the ESS professional community as a means to
strengthen eligibility, sense of belonging and achievement. MS PHD'S PDP
activities provide student participants with information regarding future ESS
funding; education and career opportunities; exposure to cutting-edge ESS
research and technology; and, on-going communication and mentoring support via
membership within the MS PHD'S PDP virtual community. During a capstone
leadership development week in Washington, DC, MS PHD'S PDP participants gain
valuable understanding about the operations and priorities of the Federal
agencies and related organizations that support ESS research and education.
