This action funds Laura Aiko Michelle Walsh of the University of California, San
Francisco to conduct a research project, entitled "Broadening cell sheet tissue
engineering," during the summer of 2012 at Tokyo Women's Medical University in
Tokyo, Japan. The host scientist is Dr. Teruo Okano.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is elucidating the determinants
of successful cell attachment and detachment from the polymer
poly-(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM), a thermoresponsive polymer that is used
to grow and detach an intact sheet of cells. This polymet has major applications
in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine but is also useful in learning
about basic mechanisms in cell biology because different cell types and species
have different behavior on this polymer. Therefore, understanding the parameters
of successful cell adhesion and detachment are very important to elucidating the
basic mechanism of cell behavior on the polymer, as well as broadening the
clinical applicability to previously incompatible cell types.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
