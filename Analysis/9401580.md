9401580 Catlin This award supports mathematical research directed at problems
arising in the field of several complex variables. The work focuses on three
problem areas. The first concerns Stein spaces of dimension n with isolated
singularities. It is proposed to investigate whether or not any relatively
compact subset can be mapped biholomorphically into an affine algebraic variety
of the same dimension. This is not necessarily the case if the singularities are
not isolated, thus the result would be best possible in this sense. The second
goal of the research concerns points of finite type on smoothly bounded
pseudoconvex domains. These are points on the boundary at which the tangent
space acts reasonably like Euclidean space. It is planned to show that at each
point a peaking function can be found. These are functions which achieve their
maximum (modulus) at the given point and nowhere else. Finally, it is planned to
examining smooth pseudoconvex compact CR-manifolds with strictly
plurisubharmonic functions. Then, work will be done to show that the manifold
can be extended to a smoothly bounded integrable almost complete manifold in
which the original appears as the inside boundary. Several complex variables
grew from the classical theory of functions at the turn of the century into a
separate and profound discipline of its own. The problems of interest are
significantly different from those which originally motivated the field: to find
that part of the one-variable theory which generalized to several. Most of the
generalizations turned out to be false. The subject now focuses on applications
toward understanding the geometry of higher dimensional spaces, partial
differential equations and certain parts of control theory. ***
