The research is to develop methods for pilot scale production and purification
of recombinant vaccinia-based vaccines for human uses and the design of small-
scale production plants appropriate for vaccine production. The general plan is:
Phase I-Construction of recombinant vaccinia strains; Phase 2-Selection of
appropriate host cells; Phase 3-Scale-up in bioreactors; Phase 4-Separation
procedures; and Phase 5-Engineering of small-scale production plant. The project
addresses the means by which practical production of vaccines may occur in
developing countries, as exemplified by vaccine against the disease
schistosomiasis. This project is one supported under Creativity Awards for
Undergraduate Engineering Students.
