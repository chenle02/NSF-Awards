This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop an empirical
model of the plasmasphere electron density distribution. The model will be
parameterized by solar wind conditions (interplanetary magnetic field, solar
wind speed and density) and by the location within the plasmasphere (radial
distance and magnetic local time). The project will use data from IMAGE
satellite's Radio Plasma Imager instrument and simulations performed with the
Dynamic Fluid-Kinetic model. The empirical model will be used to study
plasmaspheric refilling after magnetic storms and the physical mechanisms that
couple the plasmasphere to the ionosphere. The empirical model is likely to be
of use in the eventual development of a geospace general circulation model
(GGCM) which is one of the primary goals of the NSF Geospace Environment
Modeling (GEM) program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigator is a
recent Ph.D. and will be directing a graduate student and a postdoctoral
researcher who is a member of an under-represented group in scientific research.
