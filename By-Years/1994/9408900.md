9408900 Ho The plant hormone, gibberellin (GA), exerts regulatory roles in
several important physiological and developmental processes such as seed
germination and post-germination growth, stem elongation and flower induction.
Gibberellin and another hormone, abscisic acid (ABA), are known to regulate the
synthesis and secretion of several enzymes which are responsible for the
utilization of nutrients stored in cereal grains. The most abundant among these
enzymes are the starch-degrading alpha-amylases and the storage protein-
degrading proteinases. As the continuation of long term effort in elucidating
the mode of action of these two plant hormones, the effect of hormones on the
coordinated expression of alpha-amylase and protease genes will be studied in
the aleurone layers of germinating barley seeds. Specifically it is planned to:
1) analyze the cis-acting elements in the protease promoter that are responsible
for hormonal regulation, 2) investigate how GA and ABA regulate the
level/activity of this DNA binding protein, and 3) isolate and characterize cDNA
clones for "early" GA-induced genes whose expression has been suggested to be
important for later alpha-amylase and proteinase expression. It is hoped that
the information obtained in this proposed project will contribute to our
understanding of the molecular action of these hormones on gene regulation in
plants. ***
