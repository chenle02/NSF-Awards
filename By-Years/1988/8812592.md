An institute for atomic and molecular theory will be funded, with the
objectives of providing a point of focus for researchers in the field and of
training graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. The Institute involves a
graduate student and predoctoral program, a postdoctoral fellowship program, a
visitor program, permanent professional staff, and computer support for all the
above. The Institute will be a joint institute of Harvard University and the
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. This grant is to the Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory for the visitor program of the Institute. A companion
grant is being made to Harvard University for operating expenses and graduate
students engaged in research with Harvard faculty.
