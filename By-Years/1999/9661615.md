*** 9661615 ZHENG This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II is directed
towards optical materials which contain a distributed refractive index and are
used in lens design are called gradient-index (GRIN) materials which have wide
applications in optical systems. In this proposed research, we plan to integrate
the supercritical drying technique for the fabrication of axial GRIN glasses via
the layering of sol-gel solutions, since this technique has been proven to be
low cost and fast process. In addition, new glass compositions will be tested in
order to achieve good chemical durability. The principal application of this
AGRIN lens is in various optical systems. The use of axial GRIN lenses can
reduce one third of lenses. The proposed sol-gel layering technique is expected
to be universal and promising way to make low cost and designable axial GRIN
lenses in optical systems. ***
