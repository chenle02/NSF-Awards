Seed germination is a critical phase of the plant life cycle, both ecologically
and agriculturally, and is sensitive to both endogenous hormones and
environmental factors. A quantitative mathematical model has been developed to
characterize the responses of seed germination to abscisic acid (ABA),
gibberellins (GA), and water potential (psi). Single-gene mutations in tomato
(Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) resulting in deficiencies of ABA or GA have
contrasting effects on dormancy, germination rates, and sensitivity to reduced
psi. This project will utilize these mutant genotypes within the framework
provided by the mathematical model to identify the biochemical processes
controlling germination. Germination occurs when endosperm cell layers opposite
the radicle tip weaken and separate to allow embryo expansion. Cell wall
hydrolysis in this endosperm tissue and its relationship to germination rates
will be investigated. The composition of tomato endosperm cell walls will be
characterized, the substrates, products, and enzymes involved in cell wall
hydrolysis will be identified, and the relationship of cell wall hydrolysis to
tissue weakening will be critically analyzed in mutant and wild-type seeds.
Extending the mathematical description of seed germination to the physiological
and biochemical levels provides a powerful new method for studying the
integration of regulatory controls in plant development.
