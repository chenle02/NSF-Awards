The research objective of this CAREER grant is to build a physical framework
that explains the role of moisture transport in the Northern Hemisphere (NH)
summer circulation, including its variability and future change. A theoretical
framework connecting moisture transport by subtropical anticyclones, Monsoons
and baroclinic eddies to energy and momentum transports and the general
circulation will be developed. The framework will be used to 1) test and
understand the dynamical interactions of the NH summer circulation using
idealized numerical model simulations and 2) create process-based diagnostics to
validate the NH summer circulation in state-of-the-art climate models and
analyze and interpret projected future changes in the circulation and the
implications for wet and dry regions on Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
educational objectives are to engage teachers in climate research and to
incorporate physical concepts into secondary school earth science curriculum.
The educational activities involve collaboration with Columbia Secondary School
(CSS) a selective sixth- through twelfth-grade title 1 science, engineering and
math school. The activities will be coordinated with Columbia University's
Summer Research Program (CUSRP) for science teachers, an NSF supported program.
The educational activities will 1) engage secondary school teachers in science,
which has been shown to positively impact students and other teachers, 2)
address a national need to educate the public about climate change science
through the development of secondary school earth science curriculum that
synthesizes weather and climate within a unifying physical science perspective
and 3) encourage the participation of underrepresented minorities in climate
science.
