This project experimentally determines the nonstationary mechanics of pneumatic
tires. Some work has been done in this area previously but it has been based on
experiments of rolling tires loaded against a curved surface. This research
enables dynamic force and moment measurements to be made on rolling tires loaded
against a more realistic flat surface. The pneumatic tire is the primary
determinant of the dynamic behavior of motor vehicles. In addition, it exhibits
mechanical properties which have a major influence on the dynamic behavior of
castered wheels, such as the self excited oscillations of nose or tail wheels on
aircraft or of steerable wheels on motor vehicles. These measurements can
subsequently be used to improve the analytical tire dynamics model. The
experimental effort comprises fourteen steps of activity. Six of these involve
modification of the existing experiment facility while the remaining eight are
oriented to measuring tire dynamics characteristics.
