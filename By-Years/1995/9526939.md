9526939 White This grant is to support 50% of the travel costs of 4 U.S.
Scientists to the Geochemical Earth Reference Model Workshop to be held in Lyon,
France in March, 1996. The goals of this workshop are: to define significant
geochemical reservoirs, define the best estimates of elemental inventories of
reservoirs and fluxes between them, and their uncertainties, and incorporate our
best understanding of the physics of transport into one or more integrated
reference models of long-term geochemical pathways. The workshop will be unique
opportunity to break through traditional disciplinary boundaries, to foster
collaboration among geochemists and geophysicists with a wide variety of
backgrounds, and to take stock and define the current state of knowledge, and
lack thereof, about the chemistry of the Earth.
