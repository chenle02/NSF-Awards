This project investigates causes of women's under-represen- tation in science.
Data from five large surveys are analyzed to test hypotheses concerning effects
of early socialization, mathematical achievement, family duties, discrimination,
and other factors. Results will provide a more comprehensive view than
previously available of the pathways women and men take to scientific careers,
and the special obstacles which affect women's career choices.
