This research is a theoretical study of the gravitational lensing phenomena. It
will investigate the effects of lensing on the observed luminosity and spatial
distribution of quasars and BL Lacertae objects using an elliptical model for
the gravitational lens. In addition, state-of-the-art image processing
techniques will be combined with a new algorithm for the inversion of images
formed by a distribution of lensing objects to develop detailed models of the
lensing material.
