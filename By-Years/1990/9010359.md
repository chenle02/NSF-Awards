This proposal offers new insights into the relationship between task
characteristics and negotiation behavior. Negotiations frequently result in
suboptimal, inefficient agreements; negotiators could have reach other
settlements that all would have preferred. Unlike prior research, the focus in
this proposal is on the impact of perceptual and judgmental factors on the
process and outcome of negotiations. The research investigates how the structure
of negotiation tasks is determined by negotiator's cognitive characteristics.
Relatively slight differences in how negotiators evaluate the desirability of
potential settlements may result in distinctly different feasible settlement
spaces and efficient frontiers. Research will be conducted to asses the
behavioral implications of these different task structures. The research will
make use of both empirical and simulation studies, combining elements of
psychological, decision theoretic, and game theoretic approaches to the study of
negotiation. The objective of the proposal is to lead to greater understanding
of the structure of negotiation tasks and their impacts on negotiation processes
and outcomes. The results of this research will help guide the development of
computer-based negotiation support systems.
