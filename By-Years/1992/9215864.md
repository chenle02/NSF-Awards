This project is a planning study to develop a five-year plan for a
collaborative research program conducted by the Hazardous Substance Management
Research Center (HSMRC) at the New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark, NJ,
the Center for Process Analytical Chemistry (CPAC) at the University of
Washington in Seattle, WA, to perform research and develop and demonstrate new
technologies for the prevention, treatment and remediation of hazardous
substances. A key component of the research program will be the development and
application of innovative measurement technologies to improve process control
and monitoring, leading to optimization and cost-effective hazardous substance
management technologies. The proposed collaborative research program affords the
opportunity to link the facilities and capabilities of two National Science
Foundation Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers (I/UCRCs), each one
having a defined technical focus, along with their industrial partners, to
assist DOE's Environmental Restoration and Waste Management (EM) Program. A
unique feature of the proposed program is the ability to actively involve
industry in the program. Furthermore, this collaboration will be strengthened by
other ongoing CPAC and HSMRC research projects with DOE facilities, including:
Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories, Westinghouse Hanford and Savannah
River Sites, and (Battelle) Pacific Northwest Laboratories. The Principal
Investigators and colleagues have the experience and capabilities to perform
this study. The Department of Energy's Environmental Restoration and Waste
Management Program is providing the primary support for this project. The
Program Manager recommends the New Jersey Institute of Technology be awarded
$125,000 for one year for this project as partial funding. (The remaining
funding will be given as a unilateral award in FY93).
