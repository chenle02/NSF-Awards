This research is to provide the U.S. component of a joint US/PRC project to
monitor gravity changes in the Beijing-Tianjin- Tangshan-Zhangjiakon (BTTZ)
region of China. Gravity can be sensitive to tectonic distortion that causes
density changes and elevation changes at a station, but effects of ground water
elevation changes must be accounted for where stations cannot be situated on
low-porosity crystalline rock. None of the latter station types are available in
the BTTZ region. Therefore, a component of this research is to separate the
ground-water variations and to investigate their relation to earthquakes which
may be an important source of earthquake precursor information in themselves.
This research is a contribution to the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction
Program.
