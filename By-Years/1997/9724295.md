This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will assist the
Department of Chemistry at University of Iowa to acquire a 400 MHz nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a
number of areas including the following: (1) synthetic fluoroolefin chemistry,
(2) novel biologically active natural products from fungi, (3) organometallic
chemistry and reactivity of unusual iron porphyrins, (4) synthetic chemistry and
biology of novel nucleosides, nucleotides and nucleic acids, and (5) synthesis
of phosphonates and bis-phosphonates. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation
of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances,
characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-
art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier
research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such as
polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
