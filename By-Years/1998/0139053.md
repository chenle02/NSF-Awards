&lt;br/&gt;0139053&lt;br/&gt;Zhiqiang Cai, &lt;br/&gt;Purdue
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is about international
collaboration with researchers in Korea, focusing on the development and
analysis of new finitie element method using singular and dual singular
functions for both interface and elasticity problems and implementation of
multilevel methods for the resulting system of linear equations. From this
study, the application of the proposed method will be identified in the are of
fracture mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
