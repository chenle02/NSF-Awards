The goal of the proposed research is to develop a continuous non-invasive
technique to evaluate the kinetics of film removal in the cleaning process. A
study of the parameters influencing the removal of a film from a smooth surface
(e.g., film thickness, viscosity and density) in conjunction with the solvent
properties will provide insights into the mechanisms of contaminant removal. The
results of this research will be used to test the validity of earlier kinetic
cleaning studies. The extension of the proposed experimental methods to other
cleaning geometries will aid in a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of
contaminant film removal from smooth surfaces. Total internal reflection
fluorescent spectroscopy will be implemented to continuously monitor the removal
of a contaminant film from the inner surface of a cleaning cell. Indirect
measurement of rate of decontamination through continuously monitor the removal
of a contaminant film from the inner surface of a cleaning cell. Indirect
measurement of rate of decontamination through continuously monitor the removal
of a contaminant film from the inner surface of a cleaning cell. Indirect
measurement of rate of decontamination through continuously monitor the removal
of a contaminant film from the inner surface of a cleaning cell. Indirect
measurement of rate of decontamination through continuous measurement of
contaminant species in the effluent from the cell during cleaning process and
shear stress measurements will provide additional information about the kinetics
of the cleaning process.
