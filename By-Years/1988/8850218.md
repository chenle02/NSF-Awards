The Gallaudet University Honors Program will sponsor a four week, summer
residential program for a maximum of 15 pre-college, high potential, hearing
impaired students. The Gallaudet Summer Science Program would serve as a
prototype for presenting science as a career to students in this small, sub-
population of disadvantaged and disabled youth. The disciplinary focus of the
program is physics and engineering and projects will be organized as
competitions. Projects will range from solar collector design and construction
to evaluation of building energy load; from trajectory prediction to
construction of a standing framework. This pilot program is designed as a
prototype that would lend itself to other geographic locations in succeeding
years. (Gallaudet University has established regional centers at Flager College,
Florida; Eastfield College, Texas; Johnson Country Community College, Kansas;
Ohloney College, California, and Northern Essex Community College,
Massachusetts.) The program could be conducted at one or more of these locations
in succeeding years making the program accessible to a larger number of
students.
