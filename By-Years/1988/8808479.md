This project will study the capabilities of a new class of associative neural
memories (ANM) developed by the P.I. in prior work. These systems show promise
of expanded memory capacity and acceptable convergence. In particular, one
system, borrowing concepts from the Ho-Kashyap algorithm for pattern
classification, has outperformed the standard Hopfield and Kohonen ANM's in
preliminary tests. This project will institute a more comprehensive series of
tests, including diagnostic tests which will be used to guide the design of a
more powerful ANM. In developing new designs, the P.I. will pay special
attention to the similarity measures used in the various algorithms, to
multilayer designs, and to applications such as digital multiplication which
require high network capacity.
