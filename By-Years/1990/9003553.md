This grant is in the general field of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of reaction dynamics at gas metal interfaces. Professor W. Henry
Weinberg of the University of California at Santa Barbara will continue his
studies of the reactions of gases at well defined metal surfaces. The focus of
the current work will be the understanding of the details of the promotion and
poisoning of the dissociative adsorption reactions of nitrogen, oxygen and
carbon dioxide at ruthenium surfaces. Further studies with more complex
polyatomic molecules will also be done. Simulations of the reaction dynamics
will be accomplished to determine the effects of specific reaction channels in
the adsorption process. The results of this work will lead to an understanding
of the factors governing catalytic reactions and the thermodynamics of reactions
at the interface. Several related issues in reaction dynamics will be explored.
Molecular beam chemistry with the Ru(001) interface will be explored with
vibrational spectroscopy of the adsorbates, following the products of complex
surface reactions. Local surface coverage effects will be explored by studying
oxygen chemisorption on the Ru surface as a function of order in the monolayer.
Surface temperature modulation will be used to follow the reaction coordinates
and quantify the reaction rate coefficients of a branching unimolecular
dissociation reaction. Monte Carlo simulations of second order surface reactions
will explore compensation effects in kinetic parameters.
