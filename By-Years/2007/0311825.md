This project utilizes observations of extragalactic radio sources whose lines of
sight pass close to the Sun, and thus probe the solar corona and solar wind at
distances between 5 and 35 solar radii. These observations consist of Faraday
rotation and phase fluctuations recorded at radio wavelengths with the Very Long
Baseline Array (VLBA). The objectives of the analysis include, (i) determination
of the anisotropy of the solar wind turbulence, (ii) specification of its
intensity as a function of distance from the Sun, (iii) measurement of the speed
at which these irregularities propagate, and (iv) assessment of the small
spatial scale variations in the coronal magnetic field and density. The
overarching goal of this investigation is to better understand the role this
turbulence plays in coronal and solar wind dynamics, which in turn affects the
near-Earth space environment.
