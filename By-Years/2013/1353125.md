Technical description MicroRNA are small 20-26 nucleotide (nt) long noncoding
RNA that are effective biomarkers for a variety of diseases, including cancer,
heart, obesity, and mental illness. During the last two decades, it has become
evident that profiling 100s of microRNA (miRNA) molecules found in blood, urine,
and tissue can lead to early diagnoses before clinical symptoms appear. Today,
there is no inexpensive, reliable method for profiling microRNA that can be
translated to a clinic setting. Microarray is an inexpensive technology but not
reliable due to large background signal from nonspecific binding. The objective
of this proposal is to explore a novel electrochemical method for profiling
miRNA by measuring local redox reactions on a monolith electrode by simply
scanning a laser beam over various microarray binding sites. The electrochemical
(redox current) signal can potentially distinguish a perfect match between an
immobilized probe and a target binding, and no redox occurs on nonspecific
binding. The applied electric potential for the redox signal shifts when the
binding has a single mismatch relative to a perfect binding case. The "active"
biosensing based on the redox current has the potential to measure binding of
target analyte molecules to immobilized probes at a sensitivity of 1 atto-moles.
The electrochemical method to map local redox current density over an electrode
by laser scanning is called "Scanning Electrometer for Electrical Double-layer"
(SEED).

Non-technical description This proposal will develop a new way to sense small
pieces of nucleic acid chains that serve as biomarkers of multiple diseases
including cancer. The proposal will enable detection of several different
nucleic acid molecules simultaneously using electrical measurements.
Importantly, instead of having to create individual electrodes for each
biomarker, the authors will develop a way to detect all of the biomarkers for
one electrode. This project will result in simpler, more powerful and
informative way of analyzing biomarkers for human diseases.
