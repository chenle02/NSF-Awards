The University of the Sacred Heart will initiate a five-week, residential Young
Scholars project in the Life Sciences which will offer science enrichment
activities for 15 precollege students entering grades 9-12. This program will
emphasize research on environmental issues. The project focus is
interdisciplinary in nature and stresses the development of research skills.
Through lectures on scientific issues and contact with specialists, participants
will be presented with a broad spectrum of scientific careers and encouraged to
establish a career goal.
