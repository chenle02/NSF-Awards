This is an award under the Research Planning Grant program for women scientists
and engineers. The researcher will study the relationship between labor unrest
and industrial restructuring in the automobile, textile, and mining industries
in the twentieth century. She will extend her previous work on this topic to a
broader range of industries, construct a world-wide data base, and formulate
additional hypotheses as preparation for a subsequent, larger project that will
attempt to test a variety of hypotheses about the forces behind industrial
restructuring and relocation. This award will initiate research which should
shed important light on the forces that are transforming manufacturing and
employment in the modern world. As such this project has potential policy
importance in that it may help us understand under what conditions companies do
or do not decide to relocate or restructure. In addition to the scientific gains
and social importance of this research, this award will materially assist a
young researcher to prepare for a larger project, thereby contributing to the
strengthening of the national base of women scientists and engineers.
