With grant funds, the Northwest Indian College (NWIC) will document three highly
endangered languages by making digital video recordings of four speakers of the
languages. The intent of this RAPID (Rapid-response Research) grant is to record
the speakers and archive the recordings. Transcriptions and analysis of the
recordings will take place at a later date and in future projects. The languages
to be documented are Lummi, Saanich, Northern
Lushootseed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project promises to work with these
language speakers over a 12 month period, digitally recording high quality video
and archiving the results for later use. The broader impacts of this project are
the involvement of community members in the process as well as the eventual
development of language materials (a dictionary, reference and pedagogical
grammars) to serve the community of speakers and to inform the scholarly
community as well. &lt;br/&gt;
