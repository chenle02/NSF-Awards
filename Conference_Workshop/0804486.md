The Illinois State University will be host to an international conference on
vertex operator algebras and related areas on the occasion of Geoffrey Mason
60th?s Birthday. The conference will take place from July 7th, 2008 to July
11th, 2008. Approximately eighty participants are expected. There will be
approximately 22 talks by prominent mathematicians and physicists and
approximately 24 talks by rising young mathematicians. Among them, 8 talks will
be given by female mathematicians.

The aim of the conference is to present some of the new developments in vertex
operator algebras and related areas. The main aspects of this conference are
connections and interactions of vertex operator algebras with physics, Hopf
algebras, Infinite dimensional Lie algebras, group theory and number theory. A
major part of the conference will focus on bringing leaders in the fields
together with students, postdoctoral fellows and young academics in a
stimulating, engaging and mentoring environment. This conference will provide
opportunities for mathematicians and physicists in the areas to discuss the
recent developments in the fields and the direction of future research. Graduate
students and young researchers will gain better perspectives of what is going on
and what the important problems are in these areas.
