This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
"Conference on Inverse Problems" that will be held from June 18-22, 2012, on the
campus of the University of California-Irvine.

The purpose of this conference is to celebrate the seminal contributions of
Gunther Uhlmann to the study of inverse problems in both theoretical and applied
contexts. Uhlmann's work has had significant impacts on the theory of partial
differential equations and in applied science and engineering, including
applications to stabilization, identification and design of physical systems
(e.g., quantum control), image processing, mathematical finance, astronomy,
geosciences, medical imaging and nondestructive evaluation of materials, among
others. Speakers have been selected so as to address this diversity of topics.
The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students,
postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.
