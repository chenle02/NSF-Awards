A computing center equipped with microcomputers is established at Millikin
University for use in the sophomore- junior chemistry laboratory program. This
integrated, project- based and research-oriented laboratory program operates
with individualized "mini-research" projects, thereby offering students superior
learning and rapid growth in independence. Students use the computing center for
data acquisition and analysis, simulation and illustration, and for
computational chemistry projects. The center also allows the presentation of
calculational methods, including molecular mechanics, semi- empirical, and ab
initio, to an entire laboratory section at one time. The center allows the
students to apply these methods in individualized research-level activities,
working side by side, helping each other in a group setting. The center help the
students toward a smoother transition to graduate school and industrial
settings, attract the interest of potential majors, and provide an example of
innovative laboratory curriculum for other chemistry departments. The
institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
