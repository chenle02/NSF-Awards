This project builds on previous research by physics educators and cognitive
scientists and addresses an important instructional problem in science teaching:
how to facilitate the process by which students learn to connect real world
phenomena with scientific representations of the phenomena. The domain of focus
is geometrical optics and the main population of interest consists of pre-
service elementary school teachers. The project activities cover two major
areas. The investigations: (1) will develop a general template which will be
used for specifying an individuals's mental model about optical phenomena. The
template will be used to describe how the physics expert's and students' mental
models differ, and also to describe changes in a student's mental model during
various phases of instruction. (2) will develop and investigate the
effectiveness of an instructional strategy, based upon the psychological
principle of simultaneous encoding of information, to facilitate students'
ability to connect ray diagrams and optical phenomena. In this strategy ray
diagram representations will be simultaneously presented with the visual
demonstration of the related optical phenomenon. Finally, the investigators will
develop a videodisc with a myriad of examples of optical phenomena, and will use
the text and graphics overlay capabilities of a computer videodisc system to
implement the instructional strategy.
