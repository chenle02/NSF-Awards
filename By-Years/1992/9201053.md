Having prestige has important consequences because successful claims to esteem
often justify access to privileges, yet the concept of prestige has been
neglected in empirical studies of social stratification. This doctoral
dissertation project will study the processes of classification and aesthetic
evaluation among popular music artists in Quebec, empirically testing the
hypothesis that aesthetic judgment and artistic classifications define
boundaries between people and function as mechanisms for permitting and
prohibiting access to material and symbolic rewards. It will analyze how music
and musicians are classified into categories, which criteria are used in doing
so, and how prestige and artistic value are allocated among artists. Interviews
will be conducted, and multidimensional scaling techniques will be used to
determine to what extent the processes of artistic classification and evaluation
reflect the more general processes of social stratification between people
sharing a similar position in society and in the music industry. This project
will contribute to the advancement of sociological knowledge by using techniques
developed in studies of occupational prestige to create linkages between two
subfields of sociology, the sociology of culture and stratification. This
project also will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar
to continue to develop independent research skills.
