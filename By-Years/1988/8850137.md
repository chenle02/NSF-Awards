A science career awareness institute at Old Dominion University will offer
motivated students in grades 9, 10, and 11 the opportunity to explore a variety
of careers involving applications of physics. Emphasis will be placed on careers
in applied physics, engineering (civil, electrical and mechanical), physical
oceanography, chemistry, astronomy, computer science and mathematics, and
science education. This four-week summer residential program (with an academic
year follow-up) will; (1) provide class room enrichment experiences to enhance
the knowledge of participants in applied physics and (2) foster meaningful
interactions between participants and practitioners in the areas of applied
physics in lab activities, group discussions, etc. Groups such as women and
minorities that are underrepresented in science will have the opportunity to
interact with role models who are scientists and engineers. This project will
enhance participant appreciation for science, provide guidance in career
planning, and help participants assess their potential for success in fields
involving applications of physics.
