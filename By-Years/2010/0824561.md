This project will develop new microdevice (microfluidic) electrophoresis methods
to improve the separation and detection of metabolites unique to certain
cellular processes. Electrophoresis, a technique used to separate molecules
based on differential migration rates in an electric field, remains one of the
most powerful and widely used analytical tools in biology and in chemistry. The
modern capillary format, microdevice electrophoresis, offers numerous advantages
over the traditional slab gel, such as sensitive on-line detection, speed, cost,
and improved dissipation of joule heating. Microfluidic methods to analyze
estrogen metabolites will be created using two different strategies, free
solution and hydrogel immobilization. Both approaches will utilize competitive
immunoassays. The free solution microfluidic method will employ conventional
competitive immunoassays whereas the hydrogel immobilization strategy will rely
on the physical entrapment of antibodies specific for estrogen metabolites
within acrylamide gel plugs. Antigen specific hydrogels will be evaluated for
their ability to capture and concentrate estrogen metabolites at various
concentrations. Limits of detection and non-specific binding will be assessed to
directly compare the utility and diverse applications of the two methods.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are linked to its
potential to:&lt;br/&gt;1. train numerous minority graduate and postdoctoral
students in interdisciplinary research, &lt;br/&gt;2. enhance current outreach
activities designed to give economically and socially disadvantaged high school
students hands-on research experience, &lt;br/&gt;3. pioneer knowledge relating
to microfluidic electrophoresis, and&lt;br/&gt;4. revolutionize the speed and
resolution with which scientists can analyze macromolecules.&lt;br/&gt;
