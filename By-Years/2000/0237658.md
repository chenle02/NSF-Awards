The focus of this research is to develop an efficient general strategy for the
asymmetric synthesis of pyranoid functionality found in numerous natural
products. Malonate-derived anions will be added to chiral auxiliaries to produce
unsaturated lactones common to several important antibiotics, including
callystatin and leptomycin. Palladium catalyzed coupling will be explored to
couple the lactone subunits. The methodology will also be applied to hennoxazole
A, an antiviral marine natural product. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this RUI
award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the
research and educational efforts of Dr. Thomas T. Smith of the Department of
Chemistry at Williams College. Professor Smith will focus his work on the
construction of important anti-viral and anti-biotic substances. The educational
activities of the award will include teaching the art of organic synthesis to
undergraduate students at Williams College. &lt;br/&gt;
