Tetraodontiform fishes comprise a varied group of functional types, such as
puffer fishes, boxfishes, giant oceanic sunfish. Graduate student Elizabeth
Brainerd proposes functional and biomechanical performance tests on a variety of
these fishes in the field and in laboratory settings. Data will be gathered
using high-speed video recordings and electromyography (recordings of muscle
activation patterns), and will provide a clearer picture of their respective
efficiencies in defense, locomotion, and food gathering. The data acquired for
different fish species will be compared relative to their evolutionary
relationships in order to assess whether functional efficiency has increased
during evolution or remained static or decreased. The proposed dissertation
research is an ambitious and innovative study that will produce data of wide
interest to ichthyologists. The conceptual implications of the study are broad,
and the results will be of interest to functional morphologists and evolutionary
biologists in general.
