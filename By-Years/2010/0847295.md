This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this CAREER project, supported by
the Theoretical &amp; Computational Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
Prof. Edward Valeev of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University
together with his students and postdoctoral workers will carry out research on
the rigorous development of wave-function-based electronic structure methods
utilizing functions explicitly dependent on the interelectronic distances. This
"R12" technology will be extended to treat a wide range of chemical systems and
phenomena by combining with ground- and excited-state single-reference coupled-
cluster methods and general multi-reference wave functions, and adapting the R12
methods to the relativistic regime. The educational plan focuses on introducing
computer simulations into advanced undergraduate chemistry classes as well as
developing web-oriented workshops on modern scientific software development in
computational science.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This work addresses an important
problem that may make possible reliable computational studies of large systems
and very high accuracy studies of small systems, both of which are not possible
with traditional methods. The results should find application in many areas of
chemistry and beyond. The dissemination of the newly developed software to the
community free of charge will increase the impact of this work, since electronic
structure codes are already used by a significant number of practicing chemists.
The educational component can be expected to increase interest in computational
science early in a student's career, helping to address the shortage of
qualified computational scientists.
