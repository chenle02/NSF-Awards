The aim of this research is to gain an increased understanding about biochemical
mechanisms insects use to survive the winter. While many insect species are
known to overwinter in a state of diapause (dormancy) our understanding of the
biochemical changes that occur during diapause and permit this long-term
survival under adverse conditions is limited. Additional knowledge in this area
could lead to new biorational approaches for the control of some pest insects.
This proposal focuses on the regulation of the larval diapause of the
southwestern corn borer, Diatraea grandiosella. Since lipids serve as a major
reserve nutrient for survival during its diapause, the role of the lipids-
transporting protein, lipophorin, is being examined in diapause larvae. Although
lipids are known to be released from the fat body and transported in the
hemolymph to sites of utilization during diapause, little is known about how the
process of lipid release from the body fat occurs. The synthesis, processing,
and release of lipophorin from the fat body of non-diapause and diapause larvae
will be compared in a study and should substantially increase knowledge about
the relationship between lipophorin and diapause and provide new information
about how lipid reserves are sequestered and then mobilized to sustain insects
during a prolonged period of dormancy. Ultracentrifugal, electrophoretic,
immunochemical, radioisotopic, and electron microscopic techniques will be
employed to do the proposed experiments.
