The muonic molecular ions having He as a nucleus do not form bound states.
However, their resonant states play a role in muon catalyzed fusion. They are
considered scavengers of muons. At very high densities these resonances may
enhance the stripping of muons from muonic He when its kinetic energy has been
slowed down after (dt ) or (dd ) fusion. Quantitative investigation has been
slowed down because very little is known about these resonances. A variational
method, developed for the accurate determination of the (dt ) bound state
properties, is well suited for studying these resonances. Excellent resonance
energies and widths have already been computed for a number of resonant states
of (dt )+ below the n=2 threshold of (d ) and (t ). Preliminary calculations
indicate the existence of similar resonances in (.d )++ and (3Hed )++. The
proposed research will provide accurate positions, widths and other properties
of all these resonances.
