9411247 Kaufman ABSTRACT This project will advance the comparative study of
Mixe-Zoquean (MZ) languages, mainly through expanding the number of texts and
the amount of lexical data on most of these languages: almost all lack adequate
documentation in both of these areas. Due to the structure of the field
situation, we expect this project to lead to the development of a network of
scholars working on both descriptive and historical issues in MZ languages --
something that has been need for quite some time. Most of the grant funds are in
support of field work to recover new information on the modern MZ languages.
Some of the funding is devoted to epi-Olmec decipherment research (in which the
principal investigators have made the major breakthroughs), since the
interpretation of two intact epi-Olmec texts is making significant contributions
to MZ comparative linguistics. The work is significant in several areas. MZ
languages have grammatical properties of interest to current linguistic theory.
It has the potential to make a major contribution to early Mesoamerican cultural
and linguistic history; MZ languages were spoken by the Olmecs, and were
influential at the Olmec era and subsequently in affecting many other languages
in the area. It contributes to the ongoing decipherment of epi-Olmec writing;
the interpretation of its texts depends heavily upon MZ comparative studies,
which were crucial in the original decipherment. Finally, it includes a major
language salvage operation, helping to preserve an important part of the
linguistic heritage of the Americas. ***
