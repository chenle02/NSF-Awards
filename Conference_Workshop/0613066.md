The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Theoretical Biology and Biomathematics
is held every two years and has been running for more than 30 years. The primary
goal of the conference is to bring together established and young investigators
from a wide range of fields in quantitative biology to share new approaches and
discuss advances in this exciting and rapidly growing area of science. This
meeting continues the conference's long tradition of exceptional and
enthusiastic speakers presenting new research results at the frontiers of the
subject. The relatively small number of attendees and informal format of the
meeting provide an ideal setting for germinating new scientific collaborations.
This multidisciplinary conference is crucial for identifying new challenges and
directions in theoretical biology and the health sciences.

The format of the conference is nine formal sessions, each beginning with an
introduction to the field by the session chair followed by two or three invited
talks. In addition to the formal sessions, there are two afternoon poster
sessions. The session chairs and invited speakers consist of both established
leaders and energetic new researchers. Consistent with tradition, a wide variety
of topics ranging will be represented at this conference: noise in biological
systems, biological polymers and membranes, biological networks, cancer,
environmental stoichiometry, calcium dynamics, social insects, synaptic
plasticity and immunology. The breadth of topics cover many spatial and temporal
scales of biological phenomena, reflecting the theme of this year's conference,
``From Molecules to Networks.'' Invited speakers have been selected based on
their expertise and accomplishments, while trying to balance gender and minority
representation.

The broader impacts of this conference are numerous. Its multidisciplinary
nature fosters new collaborations between biologists and researchers from the
mathematical sciences. The conference provides an ideal setting for graduate
students and postdoctoral fellows to interact with leaders in the field of
theoretical biology. The breadth of topics represented at the meeting exposes
researchers to new mathematical and computational tools that are being developed
in fields different from their own. Last but not least, the conference provides
a collegial and inclusive environment that encourages the participation of women
and other groups that are underrepresented in science.
