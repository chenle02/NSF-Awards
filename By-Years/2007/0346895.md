This research has several goals related to Atlantic tropical cyclone/hurricane
climatology and projections: (1) Improvement of extended range seasonal Atlantic
basin hurricane prediction; (2) Intraseasonal (month-to-month) prediction of
Atlantic hurricane activity; (3) Development of probability forecasts for U.S.
hurricane landfall; and (4) Early December and early April prediction of El
Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Empirical/statistical prediction models will
be further developed and applied.

Broader Impacts: The PI's tropical cyclone forecasts are utilized by emergency
managers, insurance agencies, the media and the general public. His group's
forecasts turn the public attention towards the upcoming hurricane season and
its potential dangers. In addition, several risk catastrophe models utilize its
seasonal forecast as a factor in determining suggested insurance premiums. The
development of a more skillful ENSO prediction will benefit societal planning on
intraseasonal to interannual time scales.
