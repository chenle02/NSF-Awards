The Kentucky Science and Technology Council, Inc., through its Appalachian Rural
Systemic Initiative Leadership, will host a conference on research topics needed
in rural education, particularly in the disadvantaged Appalachian region. The
conference will bring together researchers, practitioners, community leaders,
parents, and others interested in rural education, to formulate a research
agenda, most likely conducted through a partnership with two regional research
universities.&lt;br/&gt;
