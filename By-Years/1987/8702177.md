This research investigates schemes for describing documents which can achieve
much higher recall and precision than existing techniques. The schemes use term
frequency in an optimal way, significantly more effective than the binary
independence model. The significance of this work is that the explosively
growing number of documents available to scientists, engineers, and researchers
in all fields can now only be handled effectively by computer systems. Current
indexing systems operate rapidly, but must be improved to accurately retrieve
the most relevant documents while retrieving very few irrelevant documents for
any given query.
