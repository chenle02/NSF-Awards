This grant provides funding for the development of adaptive hyperpath
equilibrium models for stochastic and dynamic transportation networks. These
models will capture both individual driver behavior and the equilibration
process that occurs across multiple drivers, and will represent the
heterogeneity in driver risk preferences. A three-phase approach is proposed
that addresses the behavioral foundations, the analytical formulation of the
hyperpath equilibrium, and the application to a network pricing problem. In the
first phase of the proposed research, an interactive web game will be used to
study the nature of adaptive routing behavior under multiple route choice
scenarios. The second phase builds on these results by developing a variational
inequality formulation to represent the routing behavior. The final phase
applies this model to develop adaptive congestion pricing
strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research
will result in a fundamentally new transportation planning tool that can assess
the impacts of travel information tools. The fundamental idea is that travelers
could use this information to change their driving behavior en route, perhaps
avoiding congested roadways based on the information received. The research will
model the system-level effects of many travelers receiving information and
behaving in this way, keeping in mind differences in their travel purposes and
risk tolerance. This model will also be used to evaluate how dynamic tolls
should be adjusted in response to system disruptions. Accomplishing these goals
will provide transportation planners with the tools to implement these
technologies in a way which is most beneficial to the traveling public. This
grant will provide the opportunity to expose multiple graduate students and
under-graduate researchers to cutting edge research in large-scale network
modeling, stochastic optimization and transportation economics. The PI?s will
also interact with several local community organizations and educational
programs to disseminate the results and insights to a wider audience.
