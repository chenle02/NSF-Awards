9707665 Werren Wolbachia are a widespread group of intracellular bacteria that
are found in the reproductive tissues of many invertebrates. These bacteria are
"inherited" through the eggs and alter reproduction of their hosts in several
interesting ways. For example, many strains of Wolbachia cause "cytoplasmic
incompatibility" an incompatibility between sperm and egg that causes
destruction of paternal chromosomes and prevents development of the embryo.
Wolbachia are of special interest because they may accelerate the formation of
new species, and are of wide interest as potential agents for insect pest
control and for studying fertilization and early development. Research here
focuses on the question "Are Wolbachia involved in reproductive isolation
between populations and species (i.e. are they a mechanism of speciation)?". The
proposed research will address this question in a series of laboratory and
natural population experiments By combining studies of natural systems and
experimental populations, this research should contribute significantly to our
understanding of the potential role of Wolbachia in causing reproductive
isolation, and the ability of Wolbachia to move between closely related species.
