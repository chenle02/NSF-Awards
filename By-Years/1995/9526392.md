9526392 Getting This grant provides $136,670 in support of the costs of
developing a technique to measure the absolute temperature of geological
materials at high-pressures in a recently developed gas-piston cylinder
apparatus at the University of Colorado. Specifically, the technique, entitled
Johnson noise thermometry measures the electrical noise generated in a resistor
(thermocouple) at elevated temperature. Due to the chemically inert and
hydrostatic environment generated in the argon gas- piston cylinder, delicate
and complex instumentation can be used in the cylinder to make corrections for
the effect of pressure on thermocouple emf thus enabling measurement of
temperature that is independent of the pressure. This development will
significantly expand the range of pressure (up to 6 GPa) for which calibrated
thermocouple temperature measurements can be made. ***
