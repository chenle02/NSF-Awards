This project is designed to continue the work of the American Physical Society
and the American Association of Physics Teachers in the establishment of Local
Physics Alliances. A number of Alliances, which unite high school physics
teachers and college physics faculty in a common effort, have been formed across
the nation as a result of a previous NSF grant which supported four major
workshops in different regions of the U.S. The current project will operate six
more workshops over a 42 month period with an early effort on a major urban
school district having a large minority population. In addition, an evaluation
mechanism will be designed to determine the effectiveness of existing Alliances
as a guide to the establishment of new ones. Cost sharing in the amount of
$57,951 is 15% of the amount requested from NSF.
