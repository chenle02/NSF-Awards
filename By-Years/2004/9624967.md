This project establishes an active research effort in microelectronic systems
architecture that enhances the undergraduate curriculum in Computer Engineering,
Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, and introduces students to new
computer architectures, new technology and microelectronic systems. The ideas
developed will be incorporated into the microprocessor and computer architecture
curriculum along with new cooperative learning techniques. The focus of the
research component is to devise and test Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP)
techniques and mechanisms. Programmable Logic Devises, such as FPGAs, are used
to implement rapid system prototyping of custom computer designs and are also
used to implement custom components in reconfigurable architectures. Engineers
and computer Science students are taught with highly participatory "active
learning" methods such as cooperative learning which stimulate student interest
and learning. By introducing students to teamwork in the engineering classroom,
learning is enhanced, fruitful networking relationships are developed and
students are able to adapt easily into other team environments. The rapid-
prototyping platform developed for this effort is used for several upper
division computer architecture and microprocessor courses and the cooperative
learning pedagogy serves a national model.
