Column wrapping with carbon FRP (CFRP) was used to strengthen rectangular
columns supporting the roof of Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport's Terminal 2E
after inadequate reinforcement against bursting forces was discovered during
construction. The terminal collapse of this year and doubts about its causes
have had international repercussions.

This project, with significant financial and in-kind help from industry
partners, aims at demonstrating that CFRP strengthening of prismatic members is
attainable for the case of large cross-sectional areas. The outcomes of this
work will have a broad impact as they will be used to validate prediction
algorithms used by design guides; determine the efficiency of confinement as a
function of the cross-section shape for large size columns; and provide answers
for immediate field problems.
