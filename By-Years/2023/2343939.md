The Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) program is a National Science
Foundation-wide activity that offers awards in support of junior faculty who
exemplify the role of teacher-scholars through outstanding research, excellent
education, and the integration of education and research within the context of
the mission of their organizations. This project awarded to a CAREER scholar has
the goal to identify and understand key factors that promote and hinder the
success of Latina STEM majors in higher education in Hispanic Serving
Institutions (HSIs) in Texas. The research findings will help to support
mentoring interventions to promote diversity in STEM across the country. The
project will involve undergraduate STEM students as mentors and as researchers.
This award is supported by the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-
Serving Institutions (HSI Program) program.

The study will employ qualitative methods, through a multicase study approach,
including interviews and focus groups, in examining the experiences of Latinas
STEM majors in HSIs. Student participants will be recruited from three
institutions of higher education in central Texas that are designated as HSIs or
Emergent HSIs. The influence of family history, socio-economic background,
family college experience, cultural and racial identity, and community influence
will be examined as part of a resilience experience. The study will investigate
mentoring strategies to improve students' perception of the social climate and
supportive experiences at their universities. The study of successful
experiences and barriers will guide the development of evidence-based mentoring
strategies and interventions that support resilience, persistence, and
graduation of Latina STEM majors.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
