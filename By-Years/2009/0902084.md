This award will help to support student attendance at the ACM-SIAM Symposium on
Discrete Algorithms (SODA) in New York City, January 3-6, 2009. SODA is the
major conference on the analysis of (discrete) algorithms in North America.
Nearly half of the attendees are students, for whom the conference serves as a
valuable educational experience, both in the technical content of the talks and
in the opportunities for networking that it provides. This award will provide
partial support to as many as thirty student attendees, covering registration
fees, shared hotel rooms, and travel.
