Processing and the mechanical behavior of aluminide intermetallics and their
composites will be studied. Liquid aluminum will be infiltrated into a perform
consisting of the reinforcing phase, fibers, particulates or powers of high
temperature component of intermetallic Ti, Ni, Fe. The matrix is formed by
reaction between the metal power and the aluminum. The research will explore
thermodynamics and the reaction kinetics associated with the synthesis, and the
microstructural and mechanical characterization of resulting materials at
elevated temperatures. The mechanical behavior studies will guide the processing
efforts.*** //
