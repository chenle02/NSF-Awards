Systems with distributed computation across open networks share many
characteristics with economies, with individual computational devices that are
largely autonomous and represent the self-interest of multiple users, including
both individuals and businesses. A fundamental challenge is to design useful
mechanisms to solve distributed problems in these open systems despite the self-
interest of individual agents. This work proposes a foundational study into the
issues that arise in computational mechanism design with computationally-bounded
agents. One component proposes the study of indirect revelation mechanisms, in
which agents are able to participate without computing, or revealing, complete
information about their preferences or local constraints. Another component
proposes the study of mechanisms that provide approximations to game-theoretic
desiderata, such as strategy proofness. In both cases, the research agenda calls
both for new theories and for new computational methods, that leverage the
theory constructively within systems. The broader impact of the work promises
the continued integration of game-theoretic and economic methods into
computational systems, with applications ranging from automated mediation in
e-marketplaces, to automated negotiation between devices in open systems. An
important component involves the development of innovative graduate and
undergraduate curricula, to help to educate students about problems at the
interface between computer science and economics.
