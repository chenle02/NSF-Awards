9218818 Kogoma Five investigators of the Department of Cell Biology with active
research programs in biomedical applications of molecular genetics and molecular
biology request funds for the purchase of an autoradiogram imaging system,
PhosphorImager 400E, to facilitate their research. Many experiments of these
investigators involve autoradiography of a number of flat samples such as
Southern, Northern, and Western blots; dot and slot blots; one- and two-
dimensional gels for separation of proteins; and CAT assays. Several experiments
that uniquely take advantage of the superior sensitivity and resolution that the
instrument offers are described. The data to be obtained from these experiments
are very difficult, if not impossible, to acquire by other means. Furthermore,
the instrument is expected to allow acquisition of data with much greater
precision and speed than the conventional X-ray film autoradiography. Thus, the
instrument will speed up progress on the research projects and permit a greater
contribution to the overall effort to solve the significant problems facing
medical sciences today. Although priority will be given to the participating
major users of this application, the instrument will be made available to other
investigators of this research community to maximize the usage and benefit of
the instrument.
