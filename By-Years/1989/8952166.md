This project will implement the second year of a four-year program to develop a
modern physics laboratory facility at Moorpark College. The laboratory
facilities will be used principally by physics, engineering, chemistry, electro-
optic, mathematics and biology majors enrolled in physics laboratory courses at
Moorpark College. The equipment will be integrated into the existing calculus-
based and trigonometry-based physics curriculums. The College will buy six
stations of x-ray diffraction equipment and six stations of electron diffraction
apparatus. Typically two students will utilize each station at a given time. By
running the x-ray and electron diffraction stations simultaneously, 24 students
can be comfortably accommodated in the laboratory facility at a given time.
Laboratory instructional materials are also provided with the equipment. A wide
variety of student experiments have been developed in areas such as E-M theory,
radiography, crystallography and radiation measurement. This wide range of
published experiments will allow laboratory instructors to tailor the
instructional sessions to the specific educational needs of the students. The
college will match the award with an equal amount of funds.
