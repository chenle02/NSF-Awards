: The research project is aimed at developing accurate as well as efficient
computational methods for large-scale simulations involving wave propagation in
bounded and unbounded domains. The resulting methods will enable improved
solution of countless engineering problems encountered in the fields of
acoustics, nondestructive evaluation, earthquake engineering, medical imaging,
wireless communications, oil exploration and landmine detection. Several aspects
of the project are significant: In the case of modeling wave propagation in
bounded domains, a new dispersion reducing technique is expected to bring down
the computational cost of frequency-domain simulations by several orders of
magnitude without sacrificing any accuracy. For transient (time-domain)
analysis, a combination of the dispersion reducing technique and some modified
time-stepping algorithms could significantly reduce the cost of analysis. The
proposed investigation will also include error estimation studies to enable
adaptive use of these algorithms for further reduction in computational cost.
Since standard numerical methods such as finite element methods are limited to
bounded domain problems, special methods are necessary to model wave propagation
in unbounded domains. Proposed are two new methods - one based on space-time
discretizations and the other based on continued fraction approximations. Space-
time techniques are showing promise in obtaining highly accurate methods that
are significantly more efficient than the existing methods of comparable
accuracy. Preliminary work based on continued fraction approximations indicates
the possibility of obtaining highly economical, yet accurate local absorbing
boundary conditions. Other aspects of this research include devising efficient
and stable schemes to couple unbounded domain methods with bounded domain
methods. It is expected that the computational cost reduction from the proposed
methods will enable accurate and detailed simulation of several important
physical processes involving wave propagation.
