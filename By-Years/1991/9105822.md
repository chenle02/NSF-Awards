This project studies the covalent modification of proteins by lipid moieties
(the newly recognized modification by long chain--15 and 20 carbon--prenyl
groups) that promote the interaction of proteins with cell membranes; the
overall aim is to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in this
prenylation and the roles that such modifications play in the targeting and
activity of the modified proteins. Biochemical and molecular biological methods
will be employed in pursuit of three aims: purification and characterization of
the "GG transferase", cDNA cloning of the transferase, and immunologic analysis
of this transferase, as these relate to mammalian proteins and membranes.
