This work is designed to develop and demonstrate a non- contacting sensor with
sub-micron precision and resolution. It will be capable of measuring three
linear and three rotational parameters, giving it six degrees of freedom
capability, while being located entirely on one side of the target. This device
will consist of several lateral effect photodiodes and several light sources
which will all be incorporated into a unique arrangement in a single package. No
such device exists today. This device, if successful, will be a significant
advancement in sensor technology and should be very cost effective. It will have
potential applications in a whole spectrum of manufacturing situations with a
major impact on Metrology and Inspection.
