Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grid computing is a very important
area for high performance computation and resource sharing. Computers can be
distributed world-wide to create a global cluster. This project adapts existing
material on cluster computing and existing graduate material on grid computing
(for example, from the University of New Hampshire and the University of
Melbourne in Australia) to introduce grid computing into undergraduate
curricula. Grid computing is applied not only to high performance scientific
computing but also to enhance business practices and to achieve cost saving. The
project addresses security and management issues in addition to application
programming issues, demonstrates how undergraduate institutions can provide
their students with grid computing facilities, and offers educators new course
materials for teaching grid computing.
