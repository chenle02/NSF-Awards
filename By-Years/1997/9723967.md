IBN-9723967 PI: Swadlow The undisputed role of the cerebral cortex in
perception, action and higher cognitive processes has led to an intense effort
to understand the functional properties of this tissue. Major goals of this
effort have been to understand the mechanisms whereby individual cortical
neurons obtain their unique repertoire of response properties and how ensembles
of cortical neurons interact to produce global perceptual and behavioral
capabilities. The proposed research is aimed at understanding the mechanisms
governing cortical function in the intact, awake thalamocortical somatosensory
system. This work is aimed at understanding the transformations performed upon
inputs to the cortex by the intracortical circuitry, the role of inhibitory
interneurons in producing these transformations, and how these transformations
lead to parallel and distinct efferent outflows. The activity of thalamo-
cortical projection neurons, cortico-cortical and corticofugal efferent neurons
and putative inhibitory interneurons will be simultaneously recorded, and
inferences of connectivity derived from these methods will be further tested
using microstimulation of presumptive presynaptic elements. Special emphasis
will be placed on elucidating rules governing the strength and specificity of
functional connections among the populations of thalamocortical and cortical
neurons under study. The data obtained from these experiments will offer a
unique view of the physiology of individual cortical neurons studied under
natural conditions, and will provide insight into interactive networks of
cortical neurons and their varied functional properties.
