Six underrepresented undergraduates will be involved in field and laboratory
research to determine the origin of three problematic glacial deposits in west-
central Minnesota. This study will employ provenance analysis of soils and tills
using; field pebble counts, sedimentary petrography, X-ray diffraction and
magnetic susceptibility to determine source area. Provenance studies are readily
accomplished at the undergraduate level yet remain the fundamental method of
studying glacial deposits in Minnesota. U.M.M., an undergraduate institution,
offers excellent facilities and close faculty contact. R.E.U. students will have
the opportunity to develop collegial ties with other undergraduates doing
geologic research and to serve as mentors, instructors and role models to
underrepresented high school students participating in college level research.
The research experience and the unique opportunity to interact with a scientific
community where underrepresented individuals are i the majority will break down
a number of traditional barriers and aid in the maturation of these students as
scientists. The culmination to the program, the "Friends of UMM REU" conference,
will provide students ;with the opportunity to present results and discuss ideas
with experts in the field.
