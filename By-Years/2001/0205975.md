AST 0205975&lt;br/&gt;Magri&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Christopher Magri, at the
University of Maine, will use the upgraded radar system at the Arecibo
Observatory to study carbonaceous main-belt asteroids (MBAs). He will use radar-
derived constraints on target shape, topography, rotation state, composition,
and near-surface roughness to define similarities and differences between the
various taxonomic classes containing dark objects and between carbonaceous MBAs
and other asteroids. This project, a continuation of NSF-supported research
carried out since 1999, is a logical outgrowth of Dr. Magri's
recent&lt;br/&gt;statistical analyses of MBAs detected prior to the facility
upgrade. Carbonaceous asteroids are thought to be relatively unaltered from the
primordial solids which condensed in the outer solar nebula; the outermost ones
probably have complex organic molecules on their surfaces. This is the first
time that large numbers of such objects have been detectable by radar. Hence,
Dr. Magri's work represents a step toward understanding the origin and evolution
of our solar system.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
