CCR-0310493&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Layered Approach to Securing Network File
Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Erez Zadok&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;File systems
protect important data, but existing file systems are not secure enough for
today's needs. Moreover, file system development is difficult. This project
investigates and develops an infrastructure for easy development of highly-
secure and efficient file systems, using an incremental, layered approach, with
a focus on network-based file systems. The main technique used is called
"stacking": a method for one file system to pass through the operations and data
to one or more other file systems. With stacking it is possible to intercept
file system operations and then control them as needed. Examples of file systems
that are being developed include strong transparent encryption, transparent
checksumming for integrity, versioning, transparent virus detection, load-
balancing, replication, sand-boxing, hooks for Intrusion Detection Systems
(IDSs), and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stackable file systems placement is
investigated for three different locations along the data path. (1) on clients,
offering end-to-end assurances; (2) on servers, enabling powerful IDS
capabilities; and (3) on intermediate proxies, transparently controlling file
servers with minimal site impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The significance of this
work is that it creates OS infrastructure that will allow future developers to
build highly-secure and efficient file systems easily; several working file
system examples are developed; and enhancements are investigated for general OS
support for secure file systems. This research and teaching will usher a new era
of secure file system development.&lt;br/&gt;
