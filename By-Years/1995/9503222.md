9503222 Garcia A three-year plan is proposed for the collection and study of
rocks from the southwest rift zone of Mauna Loa volcano, Hawaii. Many rocks from
this area are picrites and it is possible that the deep eruptions are a result
of density filtering of the magmas due to pooling of dense magmas deep within
the conduit system. The alternative is that the lavas exposed on the proposed
slump surface are older than subaerial lavas and therefore show a temporal
variation of chemistry of lavas. These lavas are particularly interesting
because they are the most Mg-rich lavas ever found on Hawaii or other similar
island and these glasses can tell us much about how the mantle melts and how the
melts are transported to the surface. ***
