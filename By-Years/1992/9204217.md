This award form the U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science Program will support
collaborative research in atmospheric sciences to be carried out by Dr. George
F. Smoot of the University of California, Berkeley and Dr. Thyrso Villela of the
Instituto Nacional Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE) at San Jose dos Campos, Brazil.
The project will map the southern sky as part of a program to make high quality
maps of galactic emission. This collaboration combines the acknowledged
expertise of he Berkeley group in studying cosmic background emission with the
access to territory and high gain equipment afforded by the Brazilian side. The
project will make spectral measurements of the differential and absolute sky
brightness over the 400 to 1000 MHz range first with 15 to 10 degree angular
resolution and then at higher resolution. These measurements will study the
spectrum of galactic, extragalactic and cosmic radiation. The study will provide
the basis for the next generation of high-precision measurements of the very
low-frequency spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) and
allow the reinterpretation of low-frequency CMBR spectrum measurements made over
the past decade. ***//
