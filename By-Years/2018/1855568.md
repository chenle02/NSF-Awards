This project involves developing new methods to study diffusions with
combinatorially structured state-spaces and is motivated by stochastic processes
that arise in population genetics and phylogenetics. Combinatorial structure
arises in these areas because one would like to model, for example, how the
genetic makeup of a population changes over time, or to develop processes that
move efficiently through the space of phylogenetic trees in search of the most
likely one for a group of organisms. One of the challenges in understanding
these processes is determining how changes to the combinatorial structure
accumulate over time. This project seeks to develop new methods for
understanding such processes when their behavior is driven by the rapid
accumulation of small changes. Graduate and undergraduate students will be
engaged in this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set partitions, integer
partitions, and integer compositions play a central role in the study of
combinatorial stochastic processes. Markov processes on set partitions and
integer partitions are well studied, but the theory for integer composition-
valued processes is not as well developed. This project will develop methods for
studying diffusion analogues of integer composition-valued processes, which are
interval partition-valued processes, with a focus on processes related to the
two-parameter extension of the infinitely-many-neutral-alleles diffusion model.
Using the connection between interval-partitions and continuum trees through
bead-crushing constructions, this project will also develop methods for
constructing continuum-tree valued diffusions. This project will develop both
pathwise constructions and analytic characterizations of these processes as well
as establish invariance principles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly
funded by Probability program and the Established Program to Stimulate
Competitive Research (EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
