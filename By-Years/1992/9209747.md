Experimental and computational studies of the effects of natural gas
composition variables on autoignition delay times will be carried out under
simulated diesel engine conditions in a constant-volume combustion vessel. Onset
of heat release and flame lumino-sity will be measured for experimental
determination of these delay times. In addition, the HCT program (an existing
one-dimensional hydrodynamic, chemical, and thermal computer code) will be used
to study the theoretical dependence of this delay time on natural gas
composition. Model predictions will be checked against the experimental results.
Finally, a Cooperative Fuel Research (CFR) single-cylinder Diesel engine will be
modified to burn compressed natural gas (CNG) and efficacy of these
modifications will be studied. Natural gas is an attractive alternative fuel to
diesel fuel since it has a low emissions potential and is readily available.
However, under compression ignition conditions, natural gas has poor ignition
characteristics relative to diesel fuel. Better understanding of the ignition
characteristics of natural gas and their dependence on gas composition (which is
somewhat variable) are needed to facilitate the use of this fuel in compression
ignition engines.
