A small area of the eastern Pacific, to the west of the Sierra Madre Mountains
of Mexico, is a favored location for tropical cy- clogenesis. Currently accepted
theories of tropical cyclone form- ation involve the preexistence of a cyclonic
disturbance in the prevailing easterly tropical flow, over an adequately warm
sea sur- face, as a necessary (but not sufficent) condition for the incep- tion
of hurricanes. Zehnder and Gall propose to continue to explore their hypothesis
that flow over the mountains of central Mexico provides, under suitable angles
of attack, cyclonic distortion of the flow downstream of the orographic obstacle
. Their previous research has shown that certain standing and slowly traveling
waves, interacting with the topography, are more active in years with above
average numbers of tropical cyclones in this region. They have also demonstrated
theoretically that such planetary-scale waves can generate a steady lee-side
trough of realistically small scale and trains of secondary traveling synoptic-
scale waves which may serve as the initial locations of tropical cyclones. They
propose to employ numerical model simulations as well as further analyses of
observational data sets, including one to be obtained in the area during the
summer of 1991, in their continuation of the research. The question as to why
tropical cyclones like to form off the west coast of Mexico is not only
interesting for its own sake. Its answer should also shed light on tropical
cyclogenesis in general, and could lead to improvements in hurricane
forecasting.
