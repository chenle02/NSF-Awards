Today imaging scientists are developing displays of images in 3-D, combining
several imaging modalities interactively, conducting research involving
computationally intensive solutions to problems such as studies of ultrasound
tissue characterization, and transmitting image, data, and audio signals in
networks at the local and regional levels. A description and demonstration of
the NSFNET capabilities and how research in the radiological imaging sciences
would be enhanced through access to this growing high speed, wide area, computer
network will be discussed at a two day workshop at the University of Illinois.
The meeting is to be organized by the American College of Radiology in
conjunction with the National Center for Computing Applications (NCSA) at the
University.
