A modern microwave laboratory for undergraduates is being developed. The primary
objectives of the laboratory are: (1) to develop a set of laboratory experiments
using modern computer- controlled microwave instrumentation for teaching
fundamental concepts in radio-frequency and microwave engineering, (2) to train
students in the use and limitations of modern measurements at radio and
microwave frequencies, and, (3) to develop a set of demonstration projects,
utilizing the graphics capability of microwave network analyzers, for enhancing
teaching-learning of radio frequency and microwave technologies. The benefits
include: (1) training microwave engineers needed by industry, and (2) increase
student interest in pursuing graduate studies in the electromagnetic/microwave
area.
