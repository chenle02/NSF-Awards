The investigators consider a class of problems in probability and statistical
inference arising from large-scale scientific investigations. Massive hypothesis
testing situations, with tens or hundreds of thousands of cases to consider
simultaneously, are treated using empirical Bayes methods, as an efficient
compromise between frequentist and Bayesian analyses. In a microarray
experiment, for example, an empirical Bayes False Discovery Rate approach helps
sift through thousands of z-values when searching for those genes of significant
interest. Special attention if given to the appropriate choice of the null
hypothesis, which may be quite different than classical text-book recipes.
Markov chain monte carlo tech- niques are analyzed using eigen decompositions of
the transition matrix to quantify how quickly initial conditions dissipate as
the sampling algorithm proceeds toward steady state. Advanced applications
involve implementing random sampling over curved manifolds in high-dimensional
spaces.

The general theme of this project is the development of mathematical methods of
genuine practical utility, both in probability and statistical inference.
Classical statistical methods were developed in a scientific world of small data
sets investigating individual questions. Modern scientific technology, like
microarrays, fMRI devices, and satellite imagers, now produce enormous data sets
that aim to simultaneously investigate thousands of possibilities. This project
proposes methods for dealing with the new scientific environment. New techniques
of statistical inference and probabilistic modelling are proposed, based on
recent experience in the biological, social science, and physical science
worlds.
