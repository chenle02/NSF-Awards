The Great Lakes Research Division of the University of Michigan will acquire
several items of oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared
use equipment. This equipment is maintained for use on or in association with
the R/V LAURENTIAN, a research vessel owned and operated by the University. A
substantial part of the ship's operating schedule during 1988 is in support of
NSF-sponsored research projects. The instrumentation will also increase the
capabilities of the ship and of the institution to support research and
engineering activities. The instrumentation includes: -A piston corer for
collecting core samples of sediments up to 15 meters in length for geological
and paleoecological investigations, and -a survey quality echo sounder for
profiling the bottom and for studying fish populations. The instrumentation
described above will increase the capability of the University to support NSF-
sponsored research and engineering projects. ***//
