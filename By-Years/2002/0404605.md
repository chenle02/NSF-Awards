This award by the Division of Materials Research to University of Missouri Rolla
(UMR) is to investigate the usefulness and reliability of a high-temperature
differential scanning calorimeter (HTDSC) to measure heat capacities and
enthalpies of transition materials at temperatures of 1500 degrees C or higher.
The investigation will measure the heat capacities of "unknowns" gold and ti-
tanium oxide, using standard calibration procedures, comparing them against
previously deter-mined values. The impact of sample heating rate, sample mass,
choice of cover gas, and sample holder material on the accuracy and uncertainty
level will be assessed, after recalibrating for each experimental condition. A
second phase of the experimental program will examine the ability of HTDSC to
measure enthalpies of transition, focusing on the enthalpy of melting of gold
and that of the alpha-beta transition in neodymium oxide (Nd2O3). Determining
the conditions un-der which the temperature and enthalpy change associated with
these transitions can be accu-rately reproduced will improve the usefulness of
HTDSC still further. The availability of HTDSC capability at UMR will facilitate
cooperation with other research facilities measuring high-temperature Gibbs
energies or enthalpies of formation of new ceramic or metallic phases.

This investigation will establish appropriate experimental procedures for high-
temperature dif-ferential scanning calorimeter (HTDSC) study of materials. In
addition, research studies by this award will enhance U.S. capabilities in high-
temperature research, and create a research protocol that can be used by
undergraduates and high-school students as well as graduate assistants. This
research will allow integration of HTDSC into existing programs at the
University of Missouri - Rolla (UMR) for undergraduate research and interaction
with high-school students.
