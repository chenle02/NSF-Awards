SSC-9350547 French River Education Center, Inc. N. Oxford, MA Hamadeh, Ann, Lou
Horner, Michael Fields, Bernard Brown, and Josephine Corro This project conducts
the "On DEC 2000" Summer Science Camp, a four-week science enrichment and career
exploration project designed for fifty Black and Pacific Islander inner city
seventh grade students. The project represents an alliance between the Boston
Public Schools and, among others, Digital Equipment Corporation in which
students participate for three consecutive summers. Students are exposed
initially to careers in chemistry, physics, astronomy, engineering, and
computing technology, through hands-on activities, guest speakers, mentors, and
field trips to area universities and colleges. Returning students will select
three of these courses for in-depth study in the second year, while third year
students enroll in the course that most interests them and devote the entire
summer to its study. New "freshmen" classes are recruited annually. Academic
year follow-up activities include after-school science clubs and a "Science by
Mail" program with the Boston Museum of Science.
