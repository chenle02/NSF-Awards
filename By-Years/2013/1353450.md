This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to commercialize
a force sensitive solution for touch applications that will overcome the
technical shortcomings of currently available technologies. The design utilizes
the sensitivity, size, and cost advantages of microelectromechanical systems
(MEMS) in a novel configuration to prevent overloading of the sensor for large
applied forces. The solution will enable truly force sensitive touch that is low
cost and highly sensitive. It will be operable with any object, including
fingernails, gloves, and styluses, while not being susceptible to environmental
factors that hinder current capacitive technologies, such as dirt and
moisture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this
project lies in the opportunity to disrupt the status quo in touch-based human
interface technology. Two decades ago, touch technology was primarily found
within ATMs and point-of-sale systems. More recently, the technology migrated to
other electronic industry verticals, including one of the largest and certainly
the fastest growing ? smartphones and tablet PCs. Consumer demand is driving an
explosion of applications in every vertical. There is increasing demand for low
cost, low power, more feature rich touch solutions. In addition, new user
experience benefits such as force sensitivity are constantly being pursued, yet
there is no viable solution yet on the market. Such a technology would be poised
to capture significant market share from existing technologies.
