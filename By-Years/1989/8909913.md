This project is directed towards basic understanding of quantum confined
semiconductor optical nonlinearities and demonstration of high-speed all-optical
devices. The materials that will be investigated under this program are Cadmium
Selenide and Cadmium Sulfide quantum dots and GaAs - A1GaAs multiple quantum
wells. By quantum dots, the investigators mean microcrystals of semiconductor
embedded in glass matrices with sizes that are comparable or smaller than the
exciton Bohr radius with a more uniform size distribution. They will investigate
thoroughly the magnitude and response time of optical nonlinearity in these
quantum dots and compare these quantities with their bulk values, will enable
them to determine whether quantum confinement in the dots results in enhancement
of the nonlinearity or speed of the material. The instantaneous nonlinearity
arising from exciton optical Stark effect will be employed to demonstrate high-
speed switching in a GaAs MQW directional coupler. Finally, they will attempt to
generate subpicosecond electrical pulses using virtual carrier excitation, and
then use these ultrashort electrical pulses to obtain subpicosecond switching in
a MQW nonlinear directional coupler via the quantum confined Stark effect.
