The theory of Sobolev spaces plays a fundamental role in many areas of
contemporary mathematics. Although it was created as a tool to study existence
and regularity of solutions to partial differential equations and variational
problems, the scope of applications goes far beyond that. The PI will focus on a
variety of applications of the theory to questions that arise in a natural way
in geometric analysis. More specifically the PI and his graduate students that
are included in the project will study approximation of convex and subharmonic
functions, the Liouville theorem for conformal mappings, Sobolev embedding
theorems in irregular domains, Sobolev spaces on metric spaces, approximation of
Sobolev mappings into metric spaces, the Lipschitz homotopy groups of the
Heisenberg group and the Gromov conjecture about Holder continuous
homeomorphisms of the Heisenberg group. The project, however, will not be
restricted to these topics. Many new questions will emerge and some questions
will have to be modified as a result of the
investigation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research lies on the borderline
of many areas of contemporary mathematics. When successful, it will create
bridges between different areas of mathematics such as analysis, calculus of
variations, topology, sub-Riemannian geometry, nonlinear elasticity and even
numerical analysis. An important part of the project is to train graduate
students and young scholars in these areas. The wide collaboration of the PI
will strengthen scientific partnerships of research institutions within the U.S.
and overseas. Results of the project will be made freely available as preprints
and will be published in journals. Moreover the results be presented in
conferences and lectures for the international audience.
