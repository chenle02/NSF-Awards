9304659 Pratt PIs will develop a high-resolution stratigraphic and geochemical
framework for the Lower and middle Cretaceous in northern South America, with
focus on the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary interval. These data are needed to
establish a regional picture of sea level change, primary marine production, and
biologic evolution in the Caribbean gateway between the Pacific and the
developing Atlantic oceans. Isotopic and geochemical data will be used to
calculate the total quantity of marine organic carbon preserved on this margin,
making it possible to assess the degree to which the equatorial region
influenced global concentrations of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the Cretaceous
atmosphere.
