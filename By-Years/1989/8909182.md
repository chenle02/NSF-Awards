Recent progress in the study of how we perceive black, gray, and white surfaces
has been based heavily on the insight that the retinal image is encoded in terms
of relative, rather than absolute, light intensities, or luminances. This
research will investigate two serious problems for models based on relative
luminance, known as ratio models. In one study, reports by observers in a
completely homogeneous visual field that grows either brighter or darker for an
extended period of time, at a rate too slow for detecting the change, will
indicate whether the visual system senses absolute luminance in the absence of
visible spatial and temporal change. The homogeneous visual field will eliminate
spatial changes in luminance and the gradual change of luminance over time will
eliminate the detection of temporal change. The hypothesis that only relative
luminances are encoded suggests the counter-intuitive result that under these
conditions the human observers will not be able to discriminate a very bright
field from a very dark field. Deduction of visual processes underlying surface
color perception requires a specification of whether relative or absolute
luminances, or both, are available to the visual system. In the second study,
observers will view various displays through a glass panel that reflects a
homogeneous sheet of light, known as a veiling luminance; their experience will
be much like looking through a fog. Although contrasts, or relative luminances,
are dramatically reduced under these conditions, observers are able to identify
gray shades correctly if the display behind the veil is sufficiently complex.
Systematic variation of the display will enable the determination of factors
that allow correct identification. These results should carry strong
implications regarding how relative luminances are processed so as to produce
visual experience of white and black surfaces.
