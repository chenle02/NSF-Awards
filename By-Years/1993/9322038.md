This award provides funds to establish an REU Site in the Department of
Microbiology of the University of Iowa. Emphasis will be placed on recruitment
and selection of women, minorities and students from non-Ph.D. - granting
institutions where opportunities for research are limited or nonexistent. The
nine students selected will be integrated into participating faculty research
teams and will be expected to perform in a manner similar to beginning graduate
students. The hands-on experience in the laboratory will be supplemented by
informal discussions and weekly seminars. A picnic, a conference for student
presentation of experimental results and a banquet at the end of the session
will also provide opportunity for social and scientific interaction. It is hoped
that students will be stimulated to pursue careers in science through this REU
program.
