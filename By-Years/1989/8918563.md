The calculation of marginal posterior densities is an essential component of
the application of Bayesian inference to data. This research involves the use of
the method of Gibbs sampling in the computation of these densities when they are
represented as integrals over spaces of extremely high dimension. Theoretical
issues addressed include the extension of the "ratio of uniforms" method of
sampling to multivariate distributions as well as accurate calculations of
expectations. The development of satisfactory convergence criteria will also be
attacked. In particular, a formal methodology that yields an automated decision
will be sought.
