Morphology patterns that appear in complex materials are intimately related to
their physical properties. Examples include lamellar, cylindrical, and spherical
patterns in block copolymers, neutral and charged Langmuir monolayers, and
smectic liquid crystal films. The investigator and his collaborators analyze and
predict morphology patterns based on mathematical models derived from first
principles of statistical physics. They develop techniques to deal with nonlocal
constitutive relations, singular perturbations, and critical eigenvalues. These
mathematical phenomena are proved to be the reasons behind self-organization and
pattern formation. The investigator finds effective reduction methods that
accurately simplify the original infinite-dimensional problems to manageable
finite-dimensional ones. The investigator also studies the dynamic phenomenon of
pattern nucleation in materials by finding and characterizing some unstable
solutions to the Euler-Lagrange equations of the free energy. The project
expands our knowledge of singularly perturbed variational problems. It enhances
classical theories such as Gamma convergence.

Complex materials, such as block copolymers, are used everywhere. The
polyurethane foams used in upholstery and bedding are composed of multi-block
copolymers known as thermoplastic elastomers that combine high temperature
resilience and low temperature flexibility. Common box tapes use triblock
copolymers to achieve pressure-sensitive adhesion. Block copolymers are blended
with asphalt in road construction to reduce pavement cracking and rutting at low
and high temperature extremes. This project seeks to deepen our understanding of
the mathematical theories underlying these systems. It produces effective
methods that characterize and predict the mechanical, optical, electrical,
ionic, barrier, and other physical properties of these materials. They help
today's synthetic chemistry technologies to produce exquisitely structured
materials to meet an ever rising demand from civil infrastructure and
manufacturing.
