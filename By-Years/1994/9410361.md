9410361 Salgado Liquefaction of cohesion's soil deposits is one of the major
sources of losses as a result of earthquake strong ground shaking. The objective
of this project is to develop a new methodology for determining the resistance
of soil to liquefaction, based on the fundamental dependence of liquefaction on
soil state. The soil state at a given site is determined from the results of
seismic cone penetration tests. Laboratory and field experiments, together with
published and other available data, are used to validate the proposed
methodology. This research project has the potential to advance the state of the
art and the state of practice by improving the level of accuracy in the
determination of the resistance of a soil deposit to liquefaction. This is a
Research Initiation Award. ***
