This award supports cooperative research in plant pathology to be conducted by
Ronald Brlansky of the University of Florida Citrus Experiment Station and Maria
Julia G. Beretta of the Biological Institute of Sao Paulo, Brazil. They will
characterize amorphous occlusions in citrus trees which have citrus blight in
Florida and declinio in Brazil. These diseases cause a loss of 60 million
dollars in the U.S. and 7 million in Brazil yearly through reduced water uptake
caused by amorphous plugging. These plugs are similar in the two diseases. The
chemical composition of the plugs will be determined which will help in the
search for a causal agent. This problem is clearly of interest to both countries
and therefore is a good example of how mutual benefits can be derived from a
collaboration between scientists from the U.S. and Brazil. Previous work has
resulted in progress on the enzyme degradation of the xylem occlusions and their
formation in the xylem tissues. The methodologies of both researchers will be
exchanged and both the blight and declinio compared to aid in the discovery of
the causes and to develop tools for the detection of diseased presymptomatic
trees.
