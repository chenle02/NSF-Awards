This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfields of photochemistry and surface reaction dynamics. The research
continues the Principal Investigator's studies of the photofragmentation, via
internally repulsive states excited by an ultraviolet laser, of molecules
adsorbed on metal and semiconductor surfaces. Photofragmentation, which
generates radicals important in surface reactions, can proceed on these surfaces
even in the presence of very fast (250 - 2500 femtoseconds) quenching of the
excited states by energy transfer to the substrate. The role of faster charge
transfer processes (5 - 50 fs) will be investigated by measuring the cross-
sections, photofragment velocity and angular distributions, and polarization
dependence for a series of small adsorbate molecules. Ultraviolet laser surface
photochemistry is an important new area of fundamental research which has
potentially broad applications in diverse technological fields such as
semiconductor processing, solar energy conversion, chemical catalysis, and eye
surgery. However, little is known about the fundamental mechanisms underlying
the photochemical reactions. Both charge transfer and electron attachment have
been identified as important reaction channels. Studies of the
photofragmentation of adsorbed molecules will provide a highly specific probe of
the dynamics of energy and charge transfer at interfaces.
