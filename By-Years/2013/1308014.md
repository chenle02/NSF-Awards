The objective of this research is to develop highly-integrated and ultrafast
spatial light modulators on the silicon nanophotonic platform. This modulator
will have a high modulation speed over 10 Gbit/s and a low power consumption
below 0.2 pJ/bit, and it can be manufactured at low cost by commercial silicon
microelectronics foundries. The approach is based on a novel perturbation-
induced diffractive coupling between the highly-confined optical mode in an
integrated resonator and the normal-incidence free-space waves. Silicon
photonic-crystal cavities will be employed, which have embedded p-i-n junctions
for electro-optic resonance tuning that leads to amplitude or phase modulations
of normal-incidence laser beams. &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research demonstrates
an entirely new way to optically access the integrated optical resonators. This
novel coupling scheme allows two-dimensional (2D) planar photonic circuits to
manipulate the propagation of normal-incidence optical beams, which bridges the
gap between the fast-developing integrated photonics technology and conventional
3D optical systems. &lt;br/&gt;The proposed device has the unique combination of
high data bandwidth and high integration capability. As the key element in a
free-space optical system, this device can potentially revive the interest in
free-space optical signal and data processing, which has been hindered by the
speed of SLMs in the past. The proposed research will be closely integrated with
classroom teaching and outreach activities where students learn through examples
from this project. Demonstrating the wide range of applications of silicon
photonics can help to attract or retain students, especially female and minority
students, to this field.
