This is an equipment request submitted under the activity Grants For Scientific
Computing Research Equipment For The Mathematical Sciences program. The project
involves the purchase of special purpose scientific equipment dedicated to the
support of research in the mathematical sciences. This equipment is required
jointly by several research projects and would be difficult to justify on one
project alone. National Science Foundation research equipment support is coupled
with discounts and contributions of equipment from manufacturers and significant
cost-sharing from the submitting institution. This project provides an example
of university, industrial, and government cooperation in the support of basic
research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will support research on
several projects, including the study of partial differential equations of wave
propagation, the study of classical groups and their Weyl groups including the
Kazhdan-Lusztig representations of the symmetric group, and the numerical
approximation of the special values of p-adic L-functions, the resolution of
plane curve singularities, and the calculation of rational points.
