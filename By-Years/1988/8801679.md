This project is concerned with the theory of modular representations of the
finite groups of Lie type, in which case the natural geometry is the Tits
building. Earlier work has established techniques for describing important
modules via generators and relations determined by the geometry. This research
will extend the class of modules to which the methods apply. These techniques
will be used to study the modular representations of the highly exceptional
sporadic simple groups. The study of groups arises from consideration of the
symmetry of physical and theoretical objects. The expression of these symmetry
transformations by means of matrices leads to group representation theory. This
project will develop representation theory by exploiting techniques from
combinatorics and discrete geometry.
