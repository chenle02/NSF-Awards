ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0305241&lt;br/&gt;G. Klinzing&lt;br/&gt;University of
Pittsburgh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is based on collaboration between
University of Pittsburgh and UTFSM, Chile. The PI is a leading expert in
pneumatic conveying. The goal of this project is to develop an improved method
for flow-regime identification and classification, not based upon visual
inspection. The approach is to modify an existing pneumatic conveying apparatus
at U. Pitt with pressure transducers that are able to detect the two-phase gas
flow pressure in a pneumatic conveying pipeline. Experimental data will be
analyzed to identify the 'finger print' pattern of the fluctuating pressure
signal that is associated with each type of flow regime. Experiments at U Pitt
and UTFSM will compliment each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is being
co-funded by the International Division and the Division of Chemical and
Transport Systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
