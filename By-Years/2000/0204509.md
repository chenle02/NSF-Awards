DMS-0204509&lt;br/&gt;Mark E. Feighn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work is
in the area of geometric group theory. &lt;br/&gt;A motivating question is:
Given a graph of groups G with some &lt;br/&gt;kind of restriction on the vertex
and edge groups, what can be &lt;br/&gt;said about G? For example, is G a non-
trivial free product?; &lt;br/&gt;does G split over the integers?; what is the
JSJ-decomposition &lt;br/&gt;of G? A focus will be on finite graphs of finitely
generated &lt;br/&gt;free groups. As an indication of progress along these
lines, &lt;br/&gt;with his graduate student Guo-An Diao, the principal
investigator &lt;br/&gt;has found an algorithm for determining whether a finite
graph of finitely generated free groups is a non-trivial free
product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topological spaces are often analyzed by cutting
them open &lt;br/&gt;and then considering the resulting simpler pieces. An easy
&lt;br/&gt;example of this is that if a circle is cut then an arc remains.
Analogously, groups are often studied by cutting them open along subgroups.
Since groups may be represented as symmetries of &lt;br/&gt;spaces, splittings
of groups and splittings of spaces are &lt;br/&gt;two manifestations of the same
construction. For example, &lt;br/&gt;the splitting of the circle above gives a
description of &lt;br/&gt;the integers. One of the most exciting developments
in&lt;br/&gt;group theory over the past 20 years is the description by
&lt;br/&gt;Rips-Sela of all splittings of groups over subgroups such
&lt;br/&gt;as the integers. Dunwoody-Sageev and Fujiwara-Papasoglu
&lt;br/&gt;have extended the types of splittings that can be described.
&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator will explore the extent to which
&lt;br/&gt;these descriptions can be made algorithmically.&lt;br/&gt;
