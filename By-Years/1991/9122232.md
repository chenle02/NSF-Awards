Regression is a widely used statistical technique in the social sciences, but
most regression analyses applied to spatially referenced data that take account
of latent spatial autocorrelation assume normally distributed error terms and
involve maximum likelihood estimation. In traditional statistical analysis this
situation results in a nonlinear structure, leading to estimation procedures
that require slow iterative solutions. This makes spatial regression
computationally intensive, thus slowing the dissemination of spatial statistics
and spatial econometrics techniques. This project will explore useful
approximations to this normalizing factor in spatial regression to simplify the
analysis of intermediate and large size data sets and to demonstrate the utility
of these simplifications. The approach will involve simulation experiments with
timing functions to evaluate the costs and benefits of reductions in numerical
intensity. Experiments will be conducted in a supercomputer environment. This
project will assist in the removal of barriers to the dissemination of spatial
statistical procedures, and it should reduce the numerical intensity normally
associated with the use of spatial statistics in social science research.
