The aim of the Summer Mathematics Program is to demonstrate the power of
reasoning to mathematically talented young people (between the ages of 13-18).
Directions for progress on the solutions of the problems in elementary number
theory and algebra are given by (1) lectures, (2) seminars, and (3) tutorials by
students counselors. Visits by mathematicians and scientists working "in the
field" and a program library help outline career choices.
