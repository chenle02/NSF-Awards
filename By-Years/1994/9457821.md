9457821 WEITSMAN Jonathan TITLE: Mathematical Sciences : NSF Young Investigator
Technical Narrative: This research, supported by a National Science Foundation
Young Investigator award, will be concerned with results and conjectures arising
in mathematical physics and the geometry of moduli spaces associated to Riemann
surfaces. It is intended to pursue specific applications of several techniques
arising in integrable nonlinear differential equations, three dimensional
topological structures and the cohomology ring of the moduli space of curves.
The research is potentially of an interdisciplinary nature with anticipated
applications to mathematical physics. The National Science Foundation Young
investigator award recognizes outstanding young faculty. This award recognizes
the recipient's strong potential for continued professional growth as a research
mathematician and for significant development as a teacher and academic leader.
