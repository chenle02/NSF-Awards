SCALE (System-Wide Change for All Learners and Educators) is a partnership
involving two major educational research and development groups: the University
of Wisconsin's Wisconsin Center for Education Research (WCER) and the University
of Pittsburgh's Learning Research and Development Center (LRDC). Building on
past collaborations, the partnership includes the Denver Public Schools, Los
Angeles Unified School District, Madison Metropolitan School District and the
Providence Public Schools, as well as institutions of higher education whose
preservice programs provide many new teachers to these districts.

SCALE encompasses the following five areas of work: 1. Implementing the best
current mathematics and science programs system-wide; 2. Creating state-of-the-
art science, technology, engineering and mathematics immersion projects and
implementing them system-wide; 3. Reforming preservice and in-service STEM
teacher education for teachers in the partner districts; 4. Creating mentoring
and guidance experiences for middle and high school students, especially women
and minorities; and 5. Implementing a comprehensive program of research and
evaluation

The partnership brings together mathematicians, scientists, social scientists,
and education practitioners to build a whole new approach to reforming preK-12
mathematics and science education. The partnership seeks to improve the
mathematics and science achievement of all students at all grade levels in the
four partner school districts by engaging them in deep and authentic science and
mathematics instructional experiences. The partnership is providing
documentation of what works and information about how to construct such a
partnership to a wide audience of policymakers and university and school
leaders.
