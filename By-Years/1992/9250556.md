This project develops an enhanced Hazardous Materials Training Laboratory to
provide technical capability and educational resources for educating Hazardous
Materials Technician Students in current one-year certification and two year
degree AAS programs. These resources upgrade the analytical capability in the
general hazardous materials management program and in mixed chemical/nuclear
waste characterization, storage, minimization, and disposal. The enhancements
assist in the integration of the hazardous materials training curriculum with
other on- campus analytical laboratories including chemistry, physics,
engineering technology, computer science, and electronics. This development
expands the practicum, hands-on experience in operation of hazardous materials
field instrumentation, and in test methods and standards including safety,
environmental remediation, and protection procedures and requirements.
