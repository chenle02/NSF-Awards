As a means to enhance technological literacy, attract more young people to
careers in engineering and contribute to the sustainment of the national
capacity for technological innovation, the Center for the Advancement of
Scholarship on Engineering Education (CASEE) of the National Academy of
Engineering (NAE) seeks to increase public awareness of the role of engineering.
Specifically, this project builds upon prior experience with previous workshops
that have explored the representations of engineers and engineering in films and
television in order to advance the implementation of a "prime-time" commercial
television series that highlights the positive roles of engineers in modern
society. This project will plan, organize, and convene a forum wherein 12
experienced producers, writers, and directors will devote one and one-half days
to discussion of key questions which will determine the viability of attaining
an engineering focused narrative television series.
