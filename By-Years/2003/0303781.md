This award provides funds to subsidize the travel and housing expenses of
students selected to participate in the eighth SIGART/AAAI Doctoral Consortium,
which will be held on August 10-11, 2003, in Acapulco, Mexico. The consortium
will be collocated with the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence
(NCAI), which will be held from August 10-15 in Acapulco. ACM/SIGART and AAAI
together organized the first seven Doctoral Consortia, which have also been
collated with either NCAI or IJCAI (International Joint Conference on Artificial
Intelligence). At the consortium, Ph.D. students who are doing their
dissertations on AI-related topics present their proposed research, and receive
feedback from a panel of established researchers as well as from the other
students. This provides the students with invaluable exposure to outside
perspectives on their work, at a critical time in their research, and also
enables them to explore their career objectives. This workshop contributes to
the professional development of young scientists who will lead this growing
field in the coming decades.
