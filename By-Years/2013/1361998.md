Through this award, funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Division of
Chemistry, Prof. Scott Rychnovsky and his research group from the University of
California, Irvine, are developing a straightforward method to assign the
absolute configuration of molecules. Complex molecules may exist in two possible
mirror-image forms, and the two mirror-image molecules interact with proteins,
carbohydrates and other biological molecules to produce different results. Most
modern pharmaceutical agents are composed of only a single mirror image molecule
with the best properties, and similarly natural products are isolated as one of
two possible mirror images. Assigning molecules to the correct mirror image
structure (configuration) is an important step in the developing new
pharmaceutical agents, studying new natural product molecules, and in
understanding their interactions with cells, animals, humans and other living
creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award supports development of the Competing
Enantioselective Conversion (CEC) strategy for assigning the configuration of
molecules. The new molecule is evaluated by measuring rates of reaction against
two enantiomeric (mirror image) catalysts or reagents. Kinetic resolution
catalysts are ideal because they react with high enantioselectivity, showing
significant rate differences between a matched case and a mismatched case. By
measuring the rate or conversion of an enantiopure molecule against the two
enantiomers of the reagent, the fast-reacting reagent can be identified.
Comparison with known examples allows the absolute configuration of the molecule
to be assigned. The program focuses on developing a highly sensitive method for
alcohols, a high-throughput method for alcohols, and an improved method for
amines. A new reaction is being investigated to assign the configuration of
oxiranes. The complementary methods that are being developed for amines,
oxiranes and alcohols will make the determination of absolute configuration a
straightforward process in organic chemistry.
