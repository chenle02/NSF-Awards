Building upon the current major thrust in manufacturing systems, a FMS (Flexible
Manufacturing System) is being constructed to allow students to study the
interaction of the many variables in manufacturing systems, such as
manufacturing lead time, work-in- process, scheduling, control structures, and
part programming. The current FMS has two major deficiencies. First, the only
machine tool in the systems is horizontal machining center. Therefore, the
system is limited to the machining of prismatic parts. Second, the machining
center is very complex and difficult for students to program. This project will
alleviate the deficiencies by adding a turning center and software that will
afford students the opportunity to program with minimal training. It will also
make the system more flexible by adding the capability to machine rotational
parts. The turning center will also function as a stand-alone machine tool to
illustrate state-of-the-art machining capabilities such as adaptive control
principles and machining parts requiring multiple tools or complex geometries.
The proposed project will directly impact every industrial engineering student
as well as other engineering majors who elect to study manufacturing.
