Generalized Lagrangian duality related to nonconvex multiple objective
programming will provide new techniques for generating efficient solutions.
Efficiency concept will be extended by incorporating the information about the
location of solutions with respect to a duality about the location of solutions
with respect to a duality gap. A complete characterization of the efficient set
of the bicriteria problem will be included.
