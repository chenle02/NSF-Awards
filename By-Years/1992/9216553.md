This project is designed to redress the scarcity of information on the
composition, structure and cycling of compounds of marine sedimentary organic-P.
Standard methods for isolating soluble organic-P are being coupled with
analytical pyrolysis of the insoluble macromolecular fraction of organic-P,
chromatographic (HPLC, GC) and direct spectroscopic (31P-NMR,MS) methods to
characterize organic-P compounds in marine pore waters and sediments. Chemical
structure and composition dictate whether organic-P compounds are labile or
refractory with respect to microbially mediated degradation, and control
recycling of sedimentary organic-P into the water column. Composition and
chemical structure will therefore, in large part, control the ultimate burial
rate of refractory organic-P. Construction of a material balance for the
sedimentary organic-P reservoir based on detailed compositional/structural
information of constituent organic-P compounds will permit documentation of the
remineralization of the labile versus the refractory organic-P reservoirs.
