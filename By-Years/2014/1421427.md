This project will bring STEM education to rural communities through local public
libraries. Museum quality exhibits labelled as "Discover Earth", "Discover
Technology", and "Discover Space" will spend 3 months at a series of locations
around the Nation. Twenty four medium sized libraries will be chosen for the
large exhibits and forty small libraries will be chosen for scaled down
versions. The project's intent is to provide exhibits in every state and to
reach as many under-represented individuals as possible. The significance of
this project is that rural areas of this country are underserved regarding STEM
education and since this segment of society is represented by 50-60 million
residents, it is important to reach out to them.

There is a significant segment of the Nation's population (50-60 million) that
is underserved by out-of-school learning venues such as museums and science
centers. An earlier phase 1 project demonstrated at 18 sites that rural
libraries and librarians could provide STEM education to community members
ranging in age from adults to children using these hands-on exhibits. Each
exhibit (earth, space or technology) includes information about the topic and
technologically enabled models to provide interesting and fun discovery
mechanisms. They use common layman friendly language that highlights the most
recent discoveries in each area. Each exhibit will be placed in the selected
library for 3 months during which the library will organize events to feature
and advertise the STEM learning opportunities. Another feature of this project
will be to determine the models of learning in library settings and as a
function of the demographics. The partners in this project that bring the
necessary expertise are the American Library Association, the Afterschool
Alliance, the Association of Rural and Small Libraries, the University of
Colorado Museum, Datum Advisors, LLC, Evaluation and Research Associates, the
Lunar and Planetary Institute, the American Geophysical Union, and the Space
Science Institute.
