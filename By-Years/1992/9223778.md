Impact-echo is a nondestructive test method for concrete structures which is
based on the use of transient stress waves. The usefulness of the method has
been demonstrated in previous research. This project outlines research to
determine the accuracy and precision of the method for measuring the thickness
of and depth of flaws in slabs. The research includes numerical, laboratory, and
field studies directed at determining what factors affect the accuracy and
precision of impact-echo measurements. A procedure for calibration of
instrumentation will also be developed. A tentative test procedure will be
developed and used in field work carried out in conjunction with the Federal
Highway Administration and State highway departments to determine new pavement
thickness. Results will be verified by sample cores. The knowledge and data
acquired from this project will be used to write a research report which will
lay the basis for developing a draft standard.
