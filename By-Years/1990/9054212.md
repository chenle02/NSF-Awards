Membrane technology is a state-of-the-art area critical to many of the
traditional and emerging engineering fields. It is important, therefore, that
undergraduate faculty be educated in the field of membrane technology in order
to integrate it into the engineering curriculum . Membrane processes are being
incorporated into the growing areas of biological engineering/biotechnology,
hazardous waste management, microelectronics production, specialty chemical and
biochemical production, biomedical engineering, and in the traditional chemical
and petroleum industries. This workshop is combining both the lecture and
laboratory components of this advanced technology providing participants with
hands-on experience. Workshop participants attend lectures on the fundamentals,
design and applications of membrane processes such as reverse osmosis,
ultrafiltration, microfiltration, electromembranes, pervaporation, gas
permeation and hybrid systems. The undergraduate faculty participants perform
experiments with state-of-the-art membrane systems and investigate actual
applications to industry. Several publications, a "white paper" and laboratory
manual result from the successful execution of this workshop. These publications
substantially broaden the impact of the project and significantly contribute to
improvements in undergraduate science and engineering education.
