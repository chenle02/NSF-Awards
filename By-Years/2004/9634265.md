9634265 Anand This study focuses on the development of accurate constitutive
equations for the interface between forming tools and surface textured aluminum
alloys of the compositions being considered for use in auto body applications.
Experimental measurements of the slip resistance of lubricated textured surfaces
will be used to validate new state-variable interface constitutive equations. A
computational procedure will then be developed which uses these equations in a
thermomechanical finite element analysis. The modeling will subsequently be used
to suggest optimal surface texturing for enhanced formability. The study will be
done in close cooperation with Alcoa. ***
