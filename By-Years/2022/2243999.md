California State University Monterey Bay (CSUMB) campus will host an Research
Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site focused on ocean and coastal sciences.
CSUMB, a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) with a strong undergraduate research
program, will serve as the hub of the Monterey Bay Regional REU program. In
addition to research opportunities at CSUMB, they will place students at five
partner institutions: &lt;br/&gt;Naval Postgraduate School, &lt;br/&gt;Elkhorn
Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve, &lt;br/&gt;Hopkins Marine Station of
Stanford University, &lt;br/&gt;Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, and
&lt;br/&gt;Moss Landing Marine Laboratory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program
leverages the scientific and educational assets of the Monterey Bay Region to
increase the diversity and number of students prepared for careers in Ocean
Science. The program will: 1) recruit participants with an emphasis on students
from underrepresented groups and those from research limited institutions; 2)
prepare students in advance of the 10-week REU for the rigors of undertaking
original research; 3) engage students in innovative research in Oceanography,
Marine Biology and Ecology, Ocean Engineering, and Marine Geology; 4) provide
rigorous research and professional development support for students during and
after the REU to maintain interest and involvement in the Ocean Sciences; and 5)
provide students with high caliber faculty mentoring across all phases of the
REU. Interns will have a wide variety of options for research experiences.
Oceanography topics include, Trace Metal Analysis, Biological Oceanography,
Internal Wave Dynamics, Ocean Analysis and Prediction, Ocean Modeling, Nearshore
Processes, and Coastal Circulation. Marine biology and ecology topics include
Marine Landscape Ecology, Marine Microbiology, Fish Ecology, Marine Physiology,
Population Genetics, Invasion Ecology, Conservation Biology, Thermal Stress
Physiology, and Biomechanics. Marine Geology topics include Coastal Erosion,
Sediment Transport, Seafloor Mapping, Biogeochemical Analysis, Sedimentology of
Upwelling, Biogenic Sediments, and Geomorphology of Coastal Environments. Ocean
Engineering topics include Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs), Autonomous
Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), Ocean Instrumentation, Computer Programming, and
Artificial Intelligence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This site is supported by the
Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU
program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
