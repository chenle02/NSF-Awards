Bacteria use DNA sequences called CRISPRs, together with CRISPR-associated (Cas)
proteins, to protect themselves from viral infections. These immune systems
enable microbes to remember, detect and destroy viruses using programmable
proteins that can be directed to attack any virus. The project goals are to
determine how these immune systems function and to train students who will
become future educators and scientific researchers.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding how CRISPR systems are able to target and
destroy foreign nucleic acids will provide deep insight into the diverse
mechanisms of RNA-controlled genome regulation in all domains of life. In
addition, mechanistic dissection of CRISPR systems has enabled CRISPR-derived
molecular machinery to be harnessed as powerful genome editing technology in
mammals, plants and bacteria. Through application of structural biology and
enzymology approaches, this project will continue and extend a highly productive
NSF-funded research program to determine how bacteria integrate new sequences
into CRISPR genomic loci and how the small RNAs derived from CRISPRs are used to
recognize and silence foreign genetic elements. The results of this project will
both expand fundamental knowledge and provide insights enabling development of
new biotechnological tools for gene editing and genome
manipulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
