California State University, Long Beach, will purchase a seismograph with tape
drive and falling-weight source, and supporting computing facilities to allow
completion of two field projects (one each semester) in the senior level
geophysics sequence. In the introductory geophysics (first semester), the
equipment will be combined with departmental holdings in gravimetry, magnetics
and electrical resistivity to conduct an engineering geophysics project, to help
identify recently active traces of the San Andreas fault near Mecca Hills,
California. In petroleum geophysics (second semester), the laboratory will use
seismic reflection studies, combined with gravity and magnetic work, to
characterize the subsurface geology in a producing oil field near Coalinga,
California. In both cases, students will help plan the project from available
literature, collect, reduce, and interpret data, and do some geological field
work to facilitate interpretation. Specific reduction techniques have been
chosen to supplement lecture and laboratory sessions A final comprehensive
report will be written by each student for each project.
