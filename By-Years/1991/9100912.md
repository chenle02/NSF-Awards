Professor Wayland E. Noland and other members of the Chemistry Department at the
University of Minnesota are being supported to conduct a Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1991-93, eight
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a
variety of research projects. Some of the research projects involve the
properties of micelles, far infrared spectroscopy, polymer science, and
synthesis of organometallic compounds and of antifungal agents. The program will
close with an all-day symposium at which students will present formal papers on
their research.
