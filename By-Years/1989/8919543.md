The research planned in this proposal is the development of algorithms and
knowledge representations which support the perceptual interpretation of events
by intelligent machines. Applications to perceptual capabilities of low-earth
orbit space stations are within the domain of this research. Multimedia computer
technology which permits the indexing and generation of video and audio will be
employed in the transformation of vision, sonar, and taction into visual and
aural interpretations. Eventually the investigator wishes to build a small
mobile robot with on-board sensors which will autonomously scan its environment
and move about.
