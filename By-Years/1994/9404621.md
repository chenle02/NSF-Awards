9404621 Zeeman The research covers aspects of dynamical systems theory applied
to population models of Lotka-Volterra type. These models occur in behavioral
sciences and ecology. The scope entails further analysis of their geometric and
convexity properties relevant to the dynamics. The research has potential
applications to the field of ecological rates of change. ***
