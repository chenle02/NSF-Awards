This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of California--Santa
Barbara in the purchase of a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. This acquisition will
enhance greatly the research in a number of areas including the following: the
design and synthesis of molecules which can function as sequence-specific
catalysts of nucleic acid hydrolysis, the preparation of superstructural
porphyrins, the development of reagents for diastereoselective and
enantioselective reductions, studies of organocopper chemistry, the development
of new synthetic methods in organometallic chemistry, explorations of the Diels-
Alder reaction, studies of diyl hydrogen abstraction reactions including
sequence-specific reactions of such species with nucleic acids, development of
the organic chemistry of substituted fullerenes, and the preparation and study
of organic polymers with unusual chemical and physical properties. A nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer is used to obtain information about
molecular structure (what types of carbon and/or hydrogen atoms and/or hetero-
atoms are present, what are the relative number of each type of atoms and how
are they connected to one another in the molecule) and molecular dynamics (how
rapidly are the various parts of the molecule moving). This instrument is
essential for any meaningful, modern synthetic chemistry research program.
