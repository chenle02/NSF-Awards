This projct further investigates a new potential process for dividing brittle
materials into smaller sections. This new method is the precision crack-off
process in which a small notch is placed at the location where a new plant
surface is to be produced and the notch is subjected to a high fliud pressure.
Current work is directed toward the design and testing of apparatus to improve
and further develop the process, as well as to gain a better understanding of
this new process. Relative to the previous work, this project will more
extensively investigate various brittle materials and other parameters.
