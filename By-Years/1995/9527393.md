This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of Nevada in Reno in
the acquisition of a high performance computer workstation cluster, consisting
of six HP 700J and two SGI Indigo 2 XZ workstations. This equipment will enhance
research in a number of areas including the following: (1) Theory of dynamics
and spectroscopy, (2) theory of plasma and intense radiation fields, (3)
chemistry of reactive intermediates, (4) theory of collisional activation, and
(5) many body theory of atoms and molecules. A workstation network of fast,
modern computer workstations is a new way to satisfy the computing needs of
chemistry departments. Such a `computer network` also serves as a developmental
environment for new theoretical codes and algorithms, provides state-of-the-art
graphics and visualization facilities and supports research in state-of-the-art
applications of parallel processing.
