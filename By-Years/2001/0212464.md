This project involves a three-year laboratory study on the nature of organic
aerosol surfaces in the presence of water vapor. Laboratory studies will be used
to quantify uptake parameters for several species at the gas/liquid interface.
The techniques to be used include: a) a droplet train fast flow reactor, b) a
bubble train reactor, and c) an aerosol mass spectrometer kinetics apparatus.
These techniques make it possible to extract basic quantitative information
necessary for modeling heterogeneous/multiphase interactions of gas phase
species with atmospheric droplets and aerosols. This effort will improve
understanding of heterogeneous chemical processes that take place on the surface
of atmospheric aerosols and contribute to understanding the influence of
atmospheric aerosols on human health and climate. Through REU supplements to
this award, undergraduate students will have opportunities to participate in the
research.
