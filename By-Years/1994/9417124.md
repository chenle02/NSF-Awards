Abstract Lubbock Methodist Hospital System - Howell R. Porter Connection to
NSFNET Proposal No. NCR-9417124 This proposal for connecting the Lubbock
Methodist Hospital System to the Internet will facilitate rapid, cost-effective
access to the vast array of resources and services available on the Internet for
faculty and students at the hospital. It will enhance the research and education
environment by connecting the hospital network to the network at Texas Tech.
Texas Tech is connected to the Internet and THENET, a regional network service
