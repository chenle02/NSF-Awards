This planning grant will lead to a proposal from the Alabama Science Teachers
Association (ASTA) and the Alabama Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive
Research (Alabama EPSC0R) to extend and expand the Chemistry for Elementary
Teachers (C4ET) to Physical Science for Elementary Teachers (PSRET). The
university has made a major commitment to the philosophy and content of the C4ET
and now wished to plan, develop, coordinate and disseminate a comparable
physical science approach through six university sites. The planning grant will
fund the formation of teams at each of the six Alabama sites and the
coordination of their work into a full proposal to the NSF. The grantee provides
cost sharing of 241%.
