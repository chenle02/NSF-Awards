Intellectual merit&lt;br/&gt;Enzymes are responsible for the many chemical
reactions that allow life to occur. To really understand how enzymes work, both
their three-dimensional shapes and the molecular motions that they undergo must
be studied. New information suggests that protein structure and movements are
connected in a very complex fashion, via "pathways" of amino acid residues. This
important issue will be studied in an enzyme from the bacterium P. aeruginosa.
This enzyme (called phosphomannomutase/phosphoglucomutase or PMM/PGM) helps the
bacteria produce polysaccharides and other sugar-containing products. Because
its three-dimensional structure has already been carefully studied, it is an
excellent system for investigating the complicated question of how structure and
movements are related. In particular, the project involves use of biophysical
techniques, including nuclear magnetic resonance, to create a detailed picture
of the molecular movements and fluctuations that permit the enzyme to perform
its catalytic reaction. These studies will help find the hidden pathways of
amino acids involved in these processes. Understanding these pathways may
eventually help researchers design new types of proteins, such as faster and
more efficient enzymes, that can be used in industry or medicine.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;These studies are at the
interface of structural biology, enzymology, and computational biology. Both
undergraduate and graduate students will participate in this work and gain
valuable experience in this emerging, interdisciplinary area. Special emphasis
for training opportunities will be given to women and minority students. In
addition, parts of the experimental studies will be incorporated into the
graduate level curriculum in the Biochemistry department, allowing many students
to gain insights into these important issues.
