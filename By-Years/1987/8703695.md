A new experimental approach to the problem of coherent long- range vibrational
transport of energy in protein alpha- helical segments is proposed. Previous
approaches have concentrated on the optical properties of the protein, the
carrier of the energy. In this method priority is given to making the initial
and final locations of the energy well defined. A time-of-flight measurement in
the picosecond regime then establishes whether the energy is transferred from a
donor to the acceptor with a significant probability, and, if it is, the speed
of propagation in the protein. Preliminary computations and experiments have
established the conditions under which transport by this mechanism should be
detectable. The proposal is to set up appropriately labelled protein segments
and a relevant model system and to make the experimental search.
