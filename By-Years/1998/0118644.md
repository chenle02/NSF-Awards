The rapidly emerging areas of nanoscale science and technology are focussed on
the design, fabrication, and characterization of functional objects having
dimensions at the nanometer length scale. New advances in this emerging area are
expected to have long range implications in a wide variety of different
scientific and engineering disciplines. The importance of nanoscale science is
growing worldwide and it is now widely recognized as a critical component to the
future growth of the US economy. The U.S. National Science and Technology
Council has identified this area as a major contributor to the 21st Century
science and technology workforce. As a consequence, former President Clinton has
made the National Nanotechnology Initiative a top priority within US funding
agencies. In response to the growing awareness of the importance of
nantechnology, many conferences are being organized worldwide to discuss the
latest advances. A travel grant is requested to allow approximately 12 US
scientists plus 10 US graduate students to participate and attend an important
international event, the annual Trends in Nanotechnology 2001 Conference
(TNT200I) - one of the premier European conferences devoted to nanoscale science
and technology.
