This project aims to study the basic properties of the random matrices whose
entries are basically independent. The main objective is the identification of
the eigenvalue densities, the local eigenvalue statistics and the eigenvector
distributions of many different classes of random matrix ensembles. The
ensembles considered in this project include Wigner matrix, generalized Wigner
matrix, band matrix, Erdos-Renyi adjacency matrix, non-Hermitian (i.i.d.
matrix), covariance matrix, generalized covariance matrix, finite rank
perturbation of Wigner or covariance matrix, the sum or/and product of random
matrix and deterministic matrix. Some open problems will be studied in this
project, e.g. Universality of covariance matrix, local circular law,
localization-delocalization transition of the eigenstates of band matrix,
distribution of the largest eigenvalue of correlation matrix and etc.



The rigorous analysis on the local statistics of random matrix will shed some
light on the nature of the highly correlated many body system. The works on
covariance matrix will bring collaboration between mathematicians and
statistician to better understand wireless communication, economic phenomenon
and population genetics. The works on band matrix aims to establish the
conducting properties of semiconductors and other disordered systems.
