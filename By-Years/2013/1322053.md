ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;06 August 2013&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
1322053&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Miami&lt;br/&gt;PI: R.
Findley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests four Shipboard Scientific
Support Equipment (SSSE) items for the R/V WALTON SMITH which is operated by the
University of Miami; namely a new trawl block, water weights, a computerized
maintenance system, and a bow thruster evaluation study. These items will either
improve safety or enhance the vessel?s science support capabilities.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The R/V WALTON SMITH supports federally
funded scientific research in the southern Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico
in order to expand human knowledge of the ocean environment. During operations,
the vessel routinely exposes graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing
oceanography. Pubic outreach is also achieved through real-time satellite
connectivity from ship to shore, open house events, and educational cruises. The
WALTON SMITH is scheduled to complete approximately 120 NSF sponsored days in
2013.
