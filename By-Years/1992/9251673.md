The capstone experience to the Applied Mathematics Undergraduate Program is
concentrated in a mathematics modeling course, requiring prerequisite materials
in computer programming, differential equations, linear algebra, and
mathematical statistics, followed by senior project courses. In these project
courses an industrial environment is simulated, attempting to give students the
best possible environment for professional positions as applied mathematicians.
This project is updating the existing laboratory resources with four high
performance IBM-compatible PCs, 80486 based, and two SUN SPARCstation machines,
including common industrial mathematics software. This enhancement to the
computer laboratory is allowing the institution to incorporate intense,
realistic computational assignments as part of the capstone experience in
undergraduate applied mathematics.
