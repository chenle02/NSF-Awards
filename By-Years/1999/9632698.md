A major research area, one evolving out of the principal investigator's long-
term work in nonlinear circuit theory, is the development of a rigorous
stability theory for the operating points of dc transistor circuits. A complete
solution (necessary and sufficient conditions for dc operating point stability
in nonlinear circuits) seems almost within grasp, and this research project
seeks to obtain it. Research on low-power circuits encompasses the design of new
low- power clock buffers, schemes for implementing circuits to achieve charge
recovery on a databus and the investigation of techniques for the design of low-
power practical circuits such as Viterbi decoders for CDMA digital cellular
applications. Another project concerns the development of new techniques for
multiplierless digital filter design, including the design of novel
multiplierless adaptive filters. Work will continue on new techniques for IIR
filter pipelining, a topic that shows great promise in providing more economical
structures (in terms of lower power-dissipation and IC-area requirements) for
DSP systems. In addition, research will continue in the area of video
compression, where a technique for rate-distortion optimization is being
developed. Finally, recent circuit design experience has made evident the need
for advances in logic simulation. The principal investigator's research has
already produced several simple ways to improve simulation efficiency and it is
expected that major improvements will be forthcoming through further vigorous
pursuit of this project
