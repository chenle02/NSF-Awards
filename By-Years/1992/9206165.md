An accurate and precise reference method for determination of dissolved organic
carbon (DOC) in seawater is a prerequisite to obtaining the accurate data
necessary to understand the role of dissolved organic matter in the oceanic
carbon cycle. This project has three basic objectives: (1) to develop a reliable
DOC reference method based on the sealed tube combustion (STC) technique, (2) to
use the STC reference method to evaluate the accuracy of direct-injection high
temperature catalytic oxidation (HTCO) and chemical oxidation methods, and (3)
to analyze ultrafiltered seawater by STC, HTCO, and chemical oxidation methods
in order to assess the effect of DOC molecular weight on oxidation efficiency.
Seawater samples will be collected at the U.S. JGOFS Bermuda Atlantic Times
Series (BATS Station using an established sampling and processing protocol. The
BATS Station provides an accessible open ocean site and the available time-
series data will provide a context for interpreting the results. This study will
be coordinated with a DOC instrument comparison being conducted by the U.S.
JGOFS.
