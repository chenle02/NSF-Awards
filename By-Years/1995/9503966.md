9503966 Gannon The focus of this work is to apply the concept of program
archetypes to the design of an Internet based electronic textbook on parallel
programming techniques. An archetype is an abstraction that captures the common
structural, computation, and communication features of a set of algorithms. This
concept, when embedded in an interactive hypertext environment, provides a new
approach to teaching about parallel programming as well as a software
engineering foundation for deriving new parallel programs from existing
applications. The archetypes work will be expanded to include new areas of
application study, including sparse matrix computation in adaptive finite
element problems as well as parallel algorithms in computational cosmology. A
second aspect of this project is to help integrate the work of these application
scientists and of the Indiana MetaText research team that is building electronic
textbook software. The goal is to build a MetaText archetype encyclopedia for
parallel programming. ***
