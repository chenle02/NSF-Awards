0401974 Haas A workshop will be conducted in the broad area of drinking water
treatment. The objectives of the workshop are: o to set an agenda for
fundamental drinking water quality control research over the next 5-10 years o
to define and delineate grand challenges in the field of drinking water quality
control o to assess the implications of developments in nanotechnology,
biotechnology and cyberinfrastructure to research on advancing drinking water
quality. The workshop will be held December 16-18 for a 2.5day period in Chapel
Hill, North Carolina, and will involve approximately 35 invited participants. It
is anticipated that there be five major "theme" speakers, whose charge will be
to discuss issues and concepts from outside the environmental engineering
community that may bear upon issues of advancing drinking water understanding.
The final report of the workshop will consist of a compilation of the research
themes identified by the workshop participants, collated and annotated by the
steering committee.
