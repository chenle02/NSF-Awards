The PI would like to study scattering amplitudes in quantum field theory by
using two recently developed mathematical theories: theory of mixed motives and
theory of cluster varieties. The PI wants to develop further the on-shell
approach to scattering amplitudes related to the geometry of Grassmannians, and
to find effective ways to calculate the scattering amplitudes. The PI wants to
study a Feynman integral description of the derived category of mixed real Hodge
sheaves. The PI wants to study canonical bases in representation theory and
geometry, and relate them to the mirror symmetry. He wants to continue his work
on moduli spaces of local systems on 2D-surfaces and its quantization, and
relationship with representation theory and mirror symmetry. The theory of
hyperbolic 3D-manifolds can be viewed as the study of certain local systems on
3D-manifolds with values in one of the simplest complex Lie group. He wants to
develop a similar theory for all complex reductive Lie groups, as well as its
quantum analog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the last years several
new ideas in pure mathematics had a big impact on theoretical physics, and vice
verse, many ideas coming from physics had a tremendous impact on pure
mathematics. In particular, the ideas of one of the most sophisticated areas of
mathematics, theory of motives, found its applications in the problem of
calculation of scattering amplitudes in quantum field theory - the data observed
in experimenters. On the other hand, the general idea of quantization found its
concrete realizations in many of areas of pure mathematics. The PI wants to
investigate several concrete problems of number theory, algebraic geometry, and
representation theory by using quantum dilogarithms, quantization, quantum
cohomology and Feynman integrals, and other tools inspired by physics. The PI
wants to pursue the newly found links between the quantum field theory and
algebraic geometry to find, in particular, effective ways to calculate the
scattering amplitudes.
