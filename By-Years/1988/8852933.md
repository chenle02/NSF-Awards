South Florida's unique subtropical flora and Dade County's large and highly
diversified horticultural and agricultural sectors naturally encourage the study
of plant biology at Florida International University. Although interest in
botany has been encouraging, the undergraduate program has suffered from the
absence of controlled growth facilities, as well as from the lack of equipment
necessary for rigorous laboratory courses in plant biology. This award will
provide funds to purchase small growth chambers and a simple video image
analysis system for experimental labs in plant growth analysis; a photosynthesis
system and diffusion porometers to use in labs on photosynthesis and
transpiration; and small rotary shakers to prepare plant cell suspension
cultures for use in tissue culture labs for beginning students. The grantee
institution is matching this NSF award with funds from non-Federal sources.
