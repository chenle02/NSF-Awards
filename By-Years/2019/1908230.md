Western Boundary Currents are among the most familiar features of the oceans,
the most prominent example being the Gulf Stream in the North Atlantic. This
award would provide support for a three-day scientific workshop on the
interactions between western boundary currents, the continental shelves they
traverse, and the associated ecosystems. The workshop will gather researchers
from Western Boundary Current-dominated shelf ecosystems around the world to
discuss the state of knowledge of subtropical continental shelf ecosystems and
to identify opportunities for initiating complementary research and modeling
programs to advance understanding of the role of these environments in the
global carbon cycle. Funding will support participation in the workshop of
students and international researchers. The primary product of the workshop will
be a paper synthesizing the results. The workshop is expected to stimulate
future research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
