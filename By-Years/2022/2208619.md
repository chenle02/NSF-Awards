The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Research
Innovation (SBIR) Phase II project is to reduce the economic, human, and
environmental cost caused by the current disconnect between an object and its
digital history. At the human level, consider hospital use cases: medical errors
are estimated to kill upwards of 90,000 people annually. Many of these deaths
can be traced to a disconnect in the flow of information: the wrong medication
goes to a patient, a surgical instrument is not properly sanitized, etc. These
errors could be prevented with a tag that is used to verify the identity and
status of an object at point of delivery. The proposed technology has
application potential across multiple industries: in the enterprise space,
companies are investing billions in serialization and augmented reality (AR) to
do everything from monitoring supply chains to speeding up manufacturing to
improving the cost and reliability of maintenance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to address an
unmet need to provide a technology that connects the physical and digital worlds
while offering the needed characteristics for specific markets. The proposed
tags provide a novel solution as a ubiquitous, unobtrusive, and cost-effective
link that seamlessly and securely ties a physical object to its digital
content/history, and a unified data storage/access framework. The technology
milestones are to increase read distance (from 4 cm to 16 cm) to address the
need to accommodate applications requiring longer read distances; to increase
volume tag manufacturing at a rapid but controlled pace and to continue to
develop next generation readers based on a prototype reader with co-axial
optics, where the read length can be adjusted with no changes to the optics or
detector. Based on need, the reader can be varied for specific market segments,
while relying on the same core optical and electronic sensing
technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
