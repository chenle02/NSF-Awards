This proposal is to conduct a US-PRC joint workshop on development of new
research opportunities for critical infrastructure protection. The focus will be
on needed enabling technologies, and the identification of possible candidates
for the purpose of demonstration and evaluation of these technologies,
particularly those that can be applied to protect infrastructures against
earthquake and other natural and manmade disasters in populated urban centers.
Special consideration will be given to two types of urban structural systems :a
building complex and a transportation network, against earthquake ground motions
and accidental and intentional blast loads. This workshop is jointly supported
the Ministry of Construction (MOC), National Natural Science Foundation (NNSF),
Beijing Science and Technology Committee (BSTC), and Beijing Municipal Education
Commission (BMEC) under the US-PRC Earthquake Protocol Annex III program.
