This award provides funds for the purchase of equipment that will be used to
interface two new germanium detectors (obtained by Auburn University) to a gamma
ray counting system at the Leach Nuclear Science Center at Auburn University.
The gamma ray counting system at Auburn is used primarily for neutron activation
analysis of geological samples, and the new detectors and counting system will
make it possible for the lab to detect and analyze for activated elements with
low energy photopeaks.
