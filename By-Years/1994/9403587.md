9403587 Dorman This experiment is designed to provide direct observational
constraints on the distribution of melt and the pattern of upwelling beneath a
mid-ocean ridge. Studies of electromagnetic and seismic wave propagation in the
mantle with arrays of oceanbottom instruments will furnish measurements that can
be inverted to find horizontal and vertical variations in velocity and
conductivity structure that can be used to test theoretical models of flow. An
array of 47 ocean-bottom seismometers will be deployed for six months on the
East Pacific Rise at about 17 degrees south to record teleseismic and regional
earthquake sources. P and S waves, as well as other bady wave phases and Love
and Rayleigh surface waves recorded by the array will be used to probe lateral
variations in mantle structure to a depth of 100 to 200 km and out to several
hundred km from the ridge axis. The main goal is to establish whether there is a
narrow region of high melt concentration and low seismic velocities directly
beneath the ridge axis and to map its vertical and horizontal extent. Another
goal is to constrain the pattern of upwelling. ***
