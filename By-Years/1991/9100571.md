This award provides funds to establish a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
Site program in the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of
Missouri-Columbia to provide research opportunities for students from other
institutions. The Department will work in partnership with a select group of
undergraduate institutions, including predominantly minority institutions, to
provide students with the kind of research experience only available at a major
comprehensive research university. This REU program will complement an
internship program for MU students funded through a grant from the Howard Hughes
Medical Institute. Faculty participant's research programs center on the theme
"Cellular, Molecular and Genetic Approaches to Biological Problems," and utilize
methodology raging from recombinant DNA technology, to immunocytochemistry, to
sophisticated electrophysiology. All participating faculty are personally
involved in their research projects, are well- funded, and have a history of
successful partnerships with undergraduates interns. While the research
experience is the cornerstone of the summer program, multiple and varied
opportunities for the students to develop their communication skills, and the
opportunity to present their research at local and regional scientific meetings
will be provided. Finally, a number of enrichment activities including seminars
by research faculty, an informal evening program "Science and Scientists," and a
panel discussion on selecting and applying to graduate schools have been
developed.
