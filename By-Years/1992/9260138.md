Recent concern over the depletion of the ozone layer has highlighted the need
for improved instrumentation for measuring solar ultraviolet light. The proposed
program would lead to the development of low cost detectors with spectral
sensitivities in the UV regions of current scientific interest. The detectors
would be based on fluorescent phosphor technology. In Phase I of the program the
appropriate inorganic fluorescing phosphors would be selected and their
efficiency and spectral responses fully characterized as a function of
temperature, grain size and layer thickness. The final mechanical and electronic
design of the detectors would be carried out in Phase II.
