This action establishes a new multi-institutional Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center for Friction Stir Processing. This Center will bring
together the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, Brigham Young
University, the University of Missouri-Rolla, and the University of South
Carolina. The Center will focus on addressing the needs of the aerospace,
aeronautic, energy, military, and commercial industries in developing this
emerging solid state metals joining and processing technology.
