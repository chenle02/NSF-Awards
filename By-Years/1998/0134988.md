This CAREER proposal requests support for an expansion of the Education/Outreach
pilot program based on QuarkNet with three-week summer workshops for high school
science teachers. In addition, there is a request for funds to build and test a
prototype high-level trigger and data acquisition system to upgrade the CDF Run
IIb data collection capability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A workshop for fourteen
Rochester-area high school teachers used funding from the QuarkNet initiative in
Summer 2000. Based on this pilot program, this proposal seeks to expand the
project by providing three-week workshops for local middle and high school
physics and physical science teachers with the goal of educating both teachers
as well as their students about modern particle physics research. There would be
lectures on particle physics as well as a plan to build cosmic-ray muon
telescopes. These telescopes would then be used in the high school classrooms
with student involvement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI has been heavily involved
in the high-level trigger and data acquisition system and the offline data
reconstruction effort for the CDF experiment at Fermilab. With the expectation
of Run IIb to increase the instantaneous luminosity by a factor of 2.5 and the
total data collected by a factor of 10, major upgrades in the data acquisition
and reconstruction systems are needed. This proposal requests funds to purchase
equipment to prototype and test a low-cost PC-based central analysis farm for
CDF.&lt;br/&gt;
