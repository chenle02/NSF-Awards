9408136 Rickett This one year award supports U.S.-United Kingdom cooperative
research on high solar winds with Andrew J. Lyne of the University of
Manchester. The objective of their research is to conduct joint interplanetary
scintillation (IPS) observations of the solar wind when the European space probe
ULYSSES passes above the Sun's south pole in summer 1994 and above its north
pole in summer 1995. These observations will be part of an intensive world-wide
campaign to observe the solar wind simultaneously at a wide range of distances
and latitudes so that temporal evolution can be distinguished from spatial
structure. The project takes advantage of the complementary expertise of the
U.S. and British investigators in solar winds and radio astronomical
observations, and provides access to the Merlin radio antenna array in the
United Kingdom. This array is especially well configured for IPS measurements.
The investigators will perform joint observations, data analysis and model
fitting. Results and interpretation will involve other U.S. and European
scientists. ***
