The Department of Mathematics at the Brigham Young University will purchase a
shared memory multiprocessor computer with high resolution graphics which will
be dedicated to support research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment
will be used for several research projects, including in particular: 1.
Numerical Simulation and Visualization for Nonlinear Dissipative Systems and
Singularly Perturbed PDE's. 2. Negatively Curved Groups. 3. Visualization and
Computational Problems in Number Theory. 4. Root Maps of complex Polynomial
Coefficients and Mechanical Solution Techniques for Large System Initial-
Boundary Problems.
