The principal goals of this project are to develop and evaluate new, high
resolution NMR methodologies for use in studies of the structure and dynamics of
biomacromolecules and to improve the performance of some of the most popular,
existing techniques. The research will focus on experiments designed to
facilitate the assignment of complex NMR spectra, to obtain distance constraints
for use in structural determinations and to simplify the task of identifying
critical information in the NMR spectra of molecular assemblies. NMR
spectroscopy is an extremely powerful tool in such applications and it is very
important to continue to improve the methodology to meet the increasing
challenges presented in biochemistry and molecular biology. NMR spectroscopy is
an invaluable tool for studying the structure and dynamics of biological
macromolecules and for probing the interactions involved in molecular
assemblies. For example, two- dimensional, high resolution NMR spectroscopy has
become the method of choice for determining the structure of small proteins and
nucleic acid fragments in solution. With the development of increasingly
sophisticated methodologies, including the use of isotopic labelling, and with
significant improvements in instrumentation, it is now becoming feasible to
obtain detailed information about molecular interactions in systems such as
drug-DNA, enzyme-substrate and antibody-antigen complexes.*** //
