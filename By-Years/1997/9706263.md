9706263 Hervig Melt inclusions allow the possibility of determining the
variation of volatiles in magmatic processes and provide greater analytical
resolution than bulk analyses. Using melt inclusions, it may be possible to test
current models of arc volcanism by looking at relationships between volatiles
and key trace elements. In this study, electron probe, SIMS, and FTIR
microanalysis of melt inclusions will be utilized to isolate the role of
volatiles and sediment-derived trace elements in melt inclusions in Nicaraguan
volcanoes associated with subduction regimes having high slab input.
