This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr. Lynmarie A. Posey's
Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Chemistry Award in support of her research
at Vanderbilt University. The research is concerned with the behavior of
solvated transition metal ions in a microsolution environment. Investigating the
details of the local microscopic forces between an ion and its nearest neighbors
presents an experimental challenge because the influence of the bulk solvent on
measurable properties often overshadows local effects. In this research, an
electrospray ion source coupled with mass spectrometry will allow divalent
transition metal cations to be isolated in a controlled solvent environment as
gas phase clusters, which can then be probed using laser spectroscopy.
Restriction of the local environment should reveal vibrationally resolved
electronic absorption spectra, providing structural information as well as the
strength of the metal-ligand bond and perturbation of the ligand by the strong
field of the ion. %%% The enhanced understanding of ion-solvent interactions
will challenge theoreticians to develop more accurate potential energy surfaces
and ultimately provide a foundation for learning how to manipulate the chemical
reactivity of solvated ions.
