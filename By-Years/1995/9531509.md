9531509 Chen This award supports a planning visit to China to develop a joint
research project on the evolution of material failure. The US PI, Dr. Zeng Chen,
is an assistant professor at the Department of Civil Engineering, University of
Missouri at Columbia. His expectation from the research planning visit is to
define a program of cooperation with an important, well-equipped laboratory in
China, the Laboratory for Non- linear Mechanics of Continuous Media, within the
Institute of Mechanics. This lab has a large interdisciplinary group exploring
metal failure responses at different scales based on the kinematics of
deformation mechanisms. This research should contribute to better understanding
of the micromechanics of material failure and to improving failure prediction.
