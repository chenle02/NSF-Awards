Vladimir Mandelshtam of the University of California Irvine is supported by the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program for research to apply the
variational Gaussian wavepacket (VGW) method to Lennard-Jones clusters, water
clusters and fullerenes in order to assess the importance of quantum effects in
clusters. Equilibrium data such as the equilibrium structures and thermodynamic
properties will be calculated for the clusters. The research includes a second
component in which Mandelstam will collaborate with an experimentalist to
develop and extend his Filter Diagonalization Method (FDM) for 3-, 4- and 5-D
NMR experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mandelshtam's filter diagonalization
approach has great utility in multi-dimensional NMR signal processing, and the
spectral analysis code resulting from this project will be distributed free to
NMR researchers worldwide. It is expected to reduce NMR experimental times and
possibly make certain multidimensional NMR experiments newly feasible. Software
previously supplied by the PI is used by thousands of researchers. The extension
of this technique should have a large impact on the accurate rapid processing
and filtering of any multidimensional spectroscopic signals.
