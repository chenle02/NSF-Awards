Wah This research targets efficient distributed computing through intelligent
scheduling of application programs. The approach has three components: compiler
development, measurement of system loads, and automated learning of optimal
scheduling policies. Compilers are modified to extract control and data
dependencies from applications programs, emit performance monitoring code, and
allow partitioning into processes with predictable resource requirements. A
neural network model is being developed to characterize system loads based on
ready list lengths, I/O traffic, and network congestion. Finally, an automated
learning system will tune scheduling policies to balance system loads using the
predicted and measured application program requirements.
