9322738 Kustin The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary research project
between Dr. Kenneth Kustin of Brandeis University and Dr. Miklos Orban of Eotvos
University, Budapest, is to examine oscillating chemical reactions in three
major areas. First, a number of systems involving bromite ion, formaldehyde,
molecular oxygen and both homogeneous and heterogeneous transition metal-
catalyzed reactions will be studied for possible new oscillating reactions.
Second, mechanistic studies will be performed on several oscillatory systems and
related subsystems including permanganate reactions and sulfur-containing
reactions. Finally, research will be carried out on reactions in which spatial
patterns and chemical waves occur. These studies will probe Turning patterns,
the effects of magnetic fields on chemical waves and the design of new chemical
systems that show pattern formation. The combined results are expected to lead
to new advances in basic chemical kinetics and, potentially, to applications in
biological and industrial processes. This project in chemical dynamics fulfills
the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading
experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents
and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
