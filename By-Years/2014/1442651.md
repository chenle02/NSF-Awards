The main objective of this 1-year RAPID project is to re-deploy the Mount
Washington (MW) Neutron Monitor (NM), which will subsequently allow the project
team to: (i) re-integrate it with the global NM network; (ii) provide data to
the world-wide cosmic-ray and heliospheric communities; (iii) with the Durham
NM, re-create one of the rare pairs of stations immune to anisotropy effects
present during a GLE (Ground Level Enhancements) onset; and, (iv) resume the
long-term heliosphere monitoring of the galactic cosmic ray (GCR) intensity for
multi-cycle modulation studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The re-deployment of the
MW NM would also provide an educational experience for the students of the
Berlin High School Vocational Program. The erection of the shack at the summit
is a term project for several students in the School. Furthermore, undergraduate
students at the UNH will participate in the re-deployment effort. They will
participate in ethernet cabling, instrument assembly, testing, software
integration and the longer term effort of joining the Mt. Washington data from
2006 and earlier with the current data. The research and EPO agenda of this
project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning,
diversity, and interdisciplinary research.
