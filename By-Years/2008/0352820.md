Professors James Callis, Thomas Daniel, Martin Gouterman and Gamal Khalil of the
University of Washington are supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
and Fluid Dynamics and Hydraulics Programs to develop the use of pressure
sensitive-paint to study the dynamics of insect flight. The goal of this Small
Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) is to map the pressure over an insect's
wings in flight. The idea is to utilize a biocompatible, phosphorescent dye
painted on the wings of a honeybee to report on the tiny pressure changes that
evolve at high speed. A bank of violet LED's is used to excite the dye and a CCD
imager captures two sequential images synchronized to the light source
modulation. The instrumentation is first being tested in a wind tunnel that
shows unstable flow around a square cylinder and, secondly, using a propeller
system at low rotational velocity. While computational fluid dynamics
calculations by others have predicted surface pressure maps over insect wings
during flight, this data would provide some of the first experimental
measurements for comparison.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The remote measurement of
small pressure variations utilizing this spectroscopic-based method could have
applications not only in understanding insect flight, but also for aerodynamic
design of rockets, or micro air vehicles, for example. The work has implications
for national security as well as space exploration, and many other possible
applications.
