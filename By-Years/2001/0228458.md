The investigators will study plasma patches and blobs in the night-side
ionosphere using multiple instruments and modeling. These large-scale
enhancements in ionospheric electron density have deleterious effects on
navigation, communication, and surveillance systems at high latitudes. The
primary observational technique to be applied in the study is ionospheric
tomography using a network of five beacon satellite receivers along the west
coast of Greenland. This is a collaborative effort involving the University of
Texas (UT) at Austin and Southwest Research Institute (SwRI). SwRI investigators
will provide model simulations of the polar cap ionosphere during patch event
time intervals. UT Austin investigators will analyze the data from the beacon
satellite receivers. The study will emphasize complete and detailed analyses of
selected patch events to identify the origin and evolution of these structures
in the high latitude ionosphere. The primary motivation for studying patches and
blobs is to be able to specify and predict the large amplitude and phase
scintillation effects on operational systems.
