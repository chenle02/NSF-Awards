Stochastic integration is a very useful analytic tool in applications of many
models to real life. In recent years, the classical theory of stochastic
integration has been generalized to other cases. This makes it possible to use
more general models. This research will continue to study stochastic integration
with the help of some special techniques called the decoupling inequalities. In
the standard setting of a stochastic integral, the integrant and the integrating
stochastic process are independent. Decoupling inequalities mainly try to handle
the lack of such independence by separating the independent part and bounding
the remaining part. This research will study stochastic integration with respect
to infinite dimensional stochastic processes with the help of the decoupling
inequalities. It will also study the applications to U-statistics.
