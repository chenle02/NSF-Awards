The Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve of Stanford University provides resident
and visiting investigators with research opportunities in a diverse array of
vegetational habitats. The size and spatial arrangements of these different
habitats are constantly changing in response to climate variations. Dr. Peter
Vitousek proposes to install a microcomputer-based image analysis system at the
Jasper Ridge Preserve, with which aerial survey photographs of the Preserve can
be analyzed. The Preserve's library of aerial photographs, combined with its
meteorological database, will provide an excellent foundation for studying the
impact of climate change on vegetational distributions. The proposed equipment
purchase will have a significant impact on resident and visiting scientists at
the Jasper Ridge Preserve. A variety of research projects will benefit from this
state-of-the- art image analysis system. Many of the relevant research projects
deal with ecosystem responses to climate change, which is a topic of national
importance.
