'Smart' materials that respond to external stimuli, such as a change in
temperature, pH, ionic strength, light exposure, or electric field, are the
subject of a large body of research for applications that range from artificial
muscles to sensors to the delivery of therapeutics. This project will
investigate the stimuli-responsive behavior of oil-in-water droplets stabilized
by polymer-covered gold nanorods (rod-shaped nanometer-sized gold particles, Au
NRs), which are responsive to temperature, salt concentration, and light. Dr.
Hongwei Duan, an expert in assemblies composed of polymer-covered particles, at
Nanyang Technological University in Singapore will served as the host for this
research. Placing special materials, such as Au NRs and polymers, at the oil-
water interface of these droplets will afford new materials that hold great
promise as highly functional, responsive systems.

Assembling polymer-nanoparticle composites into two- or three-dimensional
structures affords properties distinct from the individual components that are
broadly interesting for chemistry, physics, engineering, and biology. This
project will involve the incorporation of salt- and temperature-responsive
zwitterionic polymers onto Au NRs. The versatility of polymer chemistry lends
itself to easily combine stimuli-responsive functional groups with moieties that
facilitate cross-linking and binding to gold into the same polymer, while Au NRs
are ideal components of smart materials due to their biocompatibility and
inherent ability to convert light into heat. The nanocomposites will be
assembled at the oil-water interface, on droplets, and subsequently cross-linked
into mechanically robust capsules. The response of these assemblies to external
stimuli (i.e. salt, temperature, and light) will be studied by optical
microscopy and by surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). To demonstrate the
utility of these capsules for encapsulation, the uptake and release of a dye
will be monitored. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the
National Research Foundation of Singapore.
