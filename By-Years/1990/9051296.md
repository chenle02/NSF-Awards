This project is implementing the use of the infrared spectrometer and the
computer in both the chemistry classroom and laboratories. Activities include
the use of the IR spectrometer to analyze organic compounds prepared by
students, the use of the IR to enhance students' understanding of infrared
spectroscopy, and the use of the computer to collect, analyze, and store
infrared spectra data obtained by the students, as well as information obtained
through the use of the gas chromatograph and various chemical experiments. The
computer is also used in the classroom for simulations. The project has
significantly upgraded the organic chemistry program by introducing routine use
of the IR spectrometer and computer. It has allowed students to become better
acquainted with the sophistication level of laboratory work and research, and
has improved the educational process of the entire chemistry program. The
institution contributed to the project in an amount equal to the NSF funds.
