The principal investigator will develop specific probability models for
testing, evaluating and applying classifications. Classification is the method
of constructing classes of similar objects. The established models for this
purpose are mixture models, modal models, and for evolutionary classification,
generalized Markov models. The investigator introduces a new class of
probability models, product partition models, that have wide application in
classification, both for evaluating and selecting classifications, and for using
classifications in prediction. He also considers more specialized probability
models for devising significance tests for the existence of clusters, and for
reconstructing evolutionary trees.
