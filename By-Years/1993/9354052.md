9354052 Shapiro Teacher Education Addressing Mathematics and Science in Boston
and Cambridge (TEAMS - BC) TEAMS-BC is a collaboration of Harvard University,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Wheelock College, University of
Massachusetts-Boston, Boston Public Schools, and Cambridge Public Schools. The
collaborative is addressing the weaknesses in the preparation of elementary,
middle, and secondary science and mathematics teachers by (1) involving
university and college science and mathematics faculty, along with education
faculty and teachers, in the cooperative development of science and mathematics
courses in teacher preparation programs; (2) emphasizing teaching for
understanding and integrating content area and effective instructional
practices; (3) creating ten Professional Development Schools which cooperate
with the teacher preparation programs - four elementary, two middle, and four
high school - with special emphasis on mathematics and science, training mentor
teachers in the enquiry, hands-on, case study based approach being developed;
and (4) establishing seminars at schools for teachers and university faculty to
discuss problems in teaching effectively. Other emphases of the project are the
recruitment of minority students to teacher preparation programs, creation and
promotion of area business-academic-school partnership programs in which both
pre-service and in-service teachers will participate in the application of
mathematics and science in business and industry and use this knowledge to
develop pedagogical materials for classroom use; and coordination with major
mathematics and science initiatives in Boston and Cambridge.
