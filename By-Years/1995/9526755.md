9526755 Neckers The PI's program focuses on laser initiated photopolymerization
and technologies thereby enabled. The overall goal of the work is to understand
all steps of the complex processes from the light absorption and disposition of
the excited states formed initially from photoinitiators and coinitiators
through the chain of reactions leading to solid photopolymer. The immediate
plans are to develop photochemistries which can be used at optimal photospeeds
at longer wavelengths (&gt;600 nm with emphasis on systems which function at
&gt;670 nm). To develop initiator systems soluble in silicon acrylate and
fluorocarbon acrylate monomers. To understand the structures of the crosslinked
polymers formed in photopolymerizations and to relate this to photoinitiator
chemistry/photophysics. To continue synthetic studies in non-oxygen containing
silane monomers, to develop photomethods for forming solid photopolymers from
silane monomers and prepolymers; and to engage in the synthesis/development of
initiators which function in non- acrylate, silane monomer systems. %%% This
research should aid in laying the foundation for manufacturing of next-
generation microelectronic circuits through development of new photosensitive
resist materials and catalysts. ***
