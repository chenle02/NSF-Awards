This Innovation Corps project will focus on extending the boundaries of
quantitative phase imaging (QPI) developed by the PI to high-impact applications
including neuroscience, cancer imaging, and cell membrane biophysics. The
PI/team intend to build an "alpha unit" prototype of the QPI technology.

If successfulu, the proposed technology has the potential to provide affordable,
fast and accurate instruments for the medical community; and to offer improved
quality setups for industry. The main features the proposed technology provides
are: noninvasive, label-free, quantitative, nanoscale, and 3D imaging.
