Acoustic signals are produced by a variety of animals in various contexts.
Calls may isolate species prior to mating and thus are instrumental in
understanding the mechanisms of speciation and in testing hypotheses in
evolutionary biology and behavior. Additionally, acoustical signals have been
useful to the scientist in distinguishing species that could not be told apart
using external features. Thus signals are important tools for identification and
classification of organisms. The test organisms for these studies will be
Prokelisia planthoppers. Their mating behavior and the mechanism of sound
transmission will be researched. Calls of geographic populations will be
compared to understand signal variation and the parts of the calls which confer
specified will be studied. The planthoppers are strongly associated with their
host plants, since it is the food source and also likely the channel of
transmission for communication among individuals. Because of their plant
feeding, the planthoppers are an economically important group and particularly
because many transmit plant pathogens. Thus knowledge of their mating behavior
and signalling is essential in designing effective control measures.
