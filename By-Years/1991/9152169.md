A 250 MHz FT NMR spectrometer with 1H and 13C detection and variable temperature
capability is being acquired for use in beginning organic chemistry, seven
advanced laboratories and undergraduate research. Students perform various 2-D
and relaxation time measurements for structure determination and conformational
analysis. The availability of off-line processing increases the number of
students able to gain firsthand experience with the instrument.
