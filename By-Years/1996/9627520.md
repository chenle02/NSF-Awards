This action funds a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellowship
in Biosciences Related to the Environment for 1996. The fellowship supports
research and training in the area of prokaryotic genetics. The title of the
research and training plan is "Identification of genes involved in environmental
and physiological stress resistance of Pseudomonas fluorescens." Soil bacteria
grown to stationary phase in culture are more tolerant to environmental and
physiological stresses than are exponentially-growing cells. Sigma factor serves
as a central regulator of stationary-phase gene expression in E. coli. This
study focuses on Pseudomonas fluorescens in which a gene coding for sigma has
recently been cloned. Genes preferentially expressed by P. fluorescens in
stationary phase will be identified. These studies will expand the current
knowledge of genetic factors involved in bacterial stress response and
contribute to our understanding of the molecular basis of interactions between a
soil bacterium and its physical environment.
