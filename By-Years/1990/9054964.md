The goal of this three year project is to provide each isolated school district
of Hawaii with teachers who are capable of supporting the teaching of hands-on
inquiry based physical science units. Resource Teachers, who are high school
teachers with excellent science backgrounds and an interest in working with
young children, will be identified. They will be educated over a two year period
on how young children learn science and the new curricular materials that are
available to support instruction. During two consultive summers these Resource
Teachers, supported by the project staff, will conduct five weeks of inservice
training with elementary school teachers who have been identified as leaders in
their schools. They will also support these teachers as they practice the new
methodology in special summer science camp settings. During the school year
these elementary Lead Teachers, with support from the Resource Teachers, will
practice the new units of instruction. In the second and third year of the
grant, supported by the Resource Teachers, the Lead Teachers will teach their
colleagues about the new units. As a result, by the end of the grant period,
each cluster of schools will contain one high school science teacher who can
function as a Resource Teacher for all of the elementary school teachers in the
district and two Lead Teachers per building who can provide special support for
the other elementary school teachers in their building. The cost sharing will be
38% of the NSF portion.
