9353234, PI-Foots: A consortium of Houston school districts and key
stakeholders, led by the Houston Independent School District, will perform a
self study to determine the present state of mathematics and science education
and prepare an implementation plan to reform the K 12 SMT education system. The
self study and the development of the implementation plan will be directed by a
Governing Board (GB) consisting of the Mayor, superintendents of the
participating districts and other key leaders. The GB is responsible for
implementing policy decisions and developing community awareness and support.
Data gathering and analysis, and obtaining community and other stakeholder input
will be directed by a Steering Committee (SC) appointed by the GB. The SC will
include representatives of the school districts, government and other
stakeholders. The SC will carry out the self study using ad hoc subcommittees,
paid consultants and information provided by various school district offices. It
will then develop policy recommendations and the implementation plan for
consideration by the GB.
