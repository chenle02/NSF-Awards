NASA's Information Systems Office has recently established a NASA Science
Internet program to coordinate and consolidate several discipline - oriented
networks in order to promote better access to space - acquired data. NSF's
Division of Networking and Communications Research and Infrastructure (DNCRI) is
responsible for NSFNET for the purpose of improving access to supercomputers and
encouraging greater and more effective communication and collaboration within
the scientific and engineering research community. Since the network user
communities of NASA and NSF largely overlap, it is advantageous for the two
networking implementations to be coordinated in order to minimize duplication of
facilities, reduce duplicate and wasteful effort, and control overall costs.
Accordingly, the NASA Information Systems Offices has agreed to host several
planning conference for their network programs which would be highly
interdependent on coordination and cooperation of NSFnet implementors. NASA will
plan the logistics of these meetings and assist in the preparation of the agenda
and advance materials. It is expected that these planning conferences will
include other federal agencies in addition to NASA and NSF, specifically, the
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the Department of Energy
(DOE).
