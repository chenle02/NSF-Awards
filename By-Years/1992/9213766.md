The objective of this faculty internship is to develop more useful and
efficient containers for the applied research problems associated with the
movement of huge volumes of mail across the United States and around the world.
Research activities include container design issues and a wide array of
containerization problems. The long-term goal is the development of a family of
compatible containers to handle a wide variety of different types of mail under
various environmental conditions. This research impacts numerous material
handling issues with applicability to distribution and manufacturing operations
in general.
