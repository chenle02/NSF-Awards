This project continues the development of an interface between 3D numerical
simulations of colliding black holes and an approximate description of the
merging black holes as a single distorted black hole (close limit
approximation). The successful development of the interface would allow the
evolution of the black hole collision to continue through the plunge phase
through the final ringdown phase.&lt;br/&gt;The simulation of the two stages
would allow estimates of the waveform and radiated angular momentum and energy
to be made. These estimates would represent a useful first step in producing
information useful to gravitational wave detectors and could be used to cross-
check similar studies using different 3D codes and interfaces.
