AST-0307335&lt;br/&gt;Stockton&lt;br/&gt;Semi-analytic models based on the
standard cold dark matter (CDM) theory suggest that most elliptical galaxies
formed between redshifts one and two, with the most massive forming most
recently. However, there are observations which sit uneasily with this picture.
Although some questions can be addressed by careful and detailed examination of
local ellipticals, it is nevertheless crucial to have observations of galaxies
at high redshifts with populations of stars that were already old at the epoch
corresponding to those redshifts (simply called 'old galaxies'). The centerpiece
of this project is acquiring images of a significant and representative sample
of old galaxies at redshifts between 1.5 and 2.5, and possibly also in the range
3:4 to 3:8, using adaptive optics (AO) on 8-m-class telescopes to deliver
resolutions three to four times better than can be obtained with the Hubble
Space Telescope. Emphasis is on infra-red imaging, starting with fields for
which deep optical data already exist, to yield volume density, clustering
properties, and the distribution of morphologies. Identifying and determining
physical properties for the most luminous old galaxies over a range of redshifts
will place new constraints on theories of their formation and early
evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integrated into this proposal are procedures to
ensure wide and timely dissemination of the results, both within the scientific
community and to interested lay audiences, and the project will provide material
for both undergraduate teaching and general public
outreach.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
