The investigator has generated four monoclonal antibodies that bind to basement
membranes in peripheral nerve and cardiac and skeletal muscle, but do not
recognize any epitopes in the central nervous system. These antibodies interfere
with neurite growth in vitro. The location of these determinants and their
functional activity suggest that these antibodies recognize constituents
important for allowing successful axonal regeneration in the peripheral nervous
system. The PC1C5 antigen is of particular interest since this antibody does not
bind to the Schwann cell basement membrane in sections of sciatic nerves from
homozygous dystrophic mice (dy/dy); all other antibodies tested (34 in total) do
stain Schwann cell basement membranes in dy/dy mice. The objectives of the
research are to: 1) test the PC1C5 antigen for its ability to promote neurite
outgrowth; 2) obtain partial amino acid sequence for this antigen and look for
homology to other previously characterized proteins; 3) screen cDNA expression
libraries with the four antibodies or with synthetic oligonucleotide probes
based on the sequences obtained in objective 2; 4) compare the molecular
differences between PC1C5 antigens synthesized by Schwann cells and muscle
cells; 5) screen libraries from various normal and dy/dy tissues with probes
obtained from expression libraries in objective 3; and 6) generate Schwann cell
lines from normal and dy/dy mice in an attempt to provide an in vitro model for
the dystrophic mutation.
