This Small Business Innovation Research project is to develop a novel two-stage
hydrolysis and fermentation process for conversion of purified cellulose to
ethanol. The process would be part of a larger biomass refining system in which
lignocellulosic biomass would first be fractionated into a hemicellulose /
lignin stream and a purified cellulose stream. The specific objectives of this
project are to identify optimal conditions for simultanous saccharification and
fermentation of partially hydrolyzed cellulose to ethanol and to evaluate the
economics of the overall process. The commercial application of this project is
in the area of biomass processing. The successful completion of the tasks in
Phase I and the follow on Phase II project is expected to lead to economically
viable production of fuel ethanol and industrial chemicals from biomass.
