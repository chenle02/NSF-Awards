The focus of this research is development of new methodology for the synthesis
of moderately complex monofluoro organic compounds which are useful for probing
chemical and biological properties. The general use of four recently prepared
fluorinated synthetic units will be investigated to determine their scope and
applicability in the synthesis of fluorinated materials, including fluorinated
nucleosides, fluorinated butenolides and furans, and fluorinated analogs of
natural products. The synthesis of two new fluorinated units will be carried
out: a chiral 1,3-oxazoline will be prepared for use in the synthesis of chiral
2-fluorocarboxylic acids, and two isomers of the 2-fluoromuconate system will be
prepared for use in the inverse electron demand Diels-Alder reaction. %%% With
this Renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of
Dr. Timothy B. Patrick of the Department of Chemistry at Southern Illinois
University at Edwardsville. Professor Patrick will focus his work on the
development of new methodology for the synthesis of moderately complex
monofluorinated organic compounds which are useful probes of chemical and
biological properties.
