9512807 Sen Description: The US-Indo Workshop, "Deccan Trap Volcanism and its
Impact on Climate", will take place at the Mahabaleshwar hill station from
January 25-30, 1996. The co-organizers are Gautam Sen, Florida International
University and K.V. Subbarao, Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. The Deccan
Trap giant lava formation marked the end of the Mesozoic (Dinosaur) era and the
dawn of the Cenozoic (Mammal) era. There is worldwide interest in studying the
origin of Deccan Trap lavas and the impact of this major event on the earth's
climate and ecology. The workshop will access the current state of Deccan Trap
research, identify research priorities, and form working groups for the
appropriate research areas. Scope: The event is locally sponsored by the
Geological Society of India. Indian participants include the National
Geophysical Research Institute, the Physical Research Laboratory, and the
Geological Survey of India. NSF will provide support for six key U.S.
participants who are considered critical to the success of the workshop.
Proceedings will be published. ***
