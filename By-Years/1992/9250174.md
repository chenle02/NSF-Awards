The new equipment (phase contrast microscopes, microscopes equipped for
fluorescence, photomicroscopy, and video analysis) will permit an upgrading of
the cell biology laboratory in three specific ways: (1) New experiments and
exercises are now possible. These include but are not limited to, a microscope
techniques exercise, detailed analysis of amoeboid and flagellar (ciliary)
movement, cytochemistry, protoplast isolation and manipulation, and muscle
contraction. (2) The new equipment will permit the inclusion of student projects
as a focal point for the course. (3) Several current experiments will also
improve by allowing for greater image resolution, fluorescent staining of
certain cell components and quantitation. These experiments include mitosis and
cell cycle analysis, flagellar regeneration studies, cytoplasmic streaming
analysis, and plant nuclei isolation. The microscope equipment will have the
largest impact on Cell Biology students. In addition, the Developmental Biology
course and the Senior Research course will benefit.
