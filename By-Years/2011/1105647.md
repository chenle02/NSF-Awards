In this project, the principal investigator proposes to develop a deeper
understanding of isometry groups of homogeneous spaces by evolving Riemannian
and Lie structures to look for highly symmetric Riemannian metrics on a given
homogeneous space. The hybrid techniques used lie at the intersection of
Riemannian geometry and Geometric Invariant Theory and are motivated by
geometric evolutions like the Ricci flow. In the presence of a transitive
nilpotent group of isometries, the proposed techniques have been successfully
employed by the principal investigator to show that Ricci soliton metrics on
nilmanifolds have maximal isometry groups. The principal investigator proposes
to develop this approach in the more general setting that the transitive group
of isometries is solvable to achieve similar results for Einstein and Ricci
soliton metrics on solvmanifolds. Similar questions on compact nilmanifolds will
also be addressed. As several of the proprosed problems can naturally be
rephrased in the language of Geometric Invariant Theory, this avenue will be
explored as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is devoted to the
fundamental problem in geometry of finding a best shape for a given object. The
objects of interest are homogeneous spaces, which are spaces having the property
that every point looks the same as every other point. These spaces serve as
basic examples across many branches of mathematics and have been a source of
inspiration in modern geometry for over a century. Although homogeneous spaces
have been tirelessly explored, there are still many fundamental questions that
have not been resolved. The principal investigator will address this question of
finding preferred metrics, aiming to show that Einstein and Ricci solitons
metrics are the most symmetric choice of geometry on a fixed homogeneous space,
when they exist.The PI will continue his work, supervising undergraduate
research and attracting graduate students for area of research. The project has
the potential to provide attractive and challenging opportunities for the
undergraduate and graduate students of his university through the study of the
Ricci flow on solvable Lie groups. The PI will continue his work, supervising
