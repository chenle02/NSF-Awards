Abstract

Proposal number: 0335554 Title: Cyber Trust Point Meeting PI: Gerald Masson,
Johns Hopkins University

The Johns Hopkins University Information Security Institute (JHUISI) will host a
Cyber Trust Point Conference on the Johns Hopkins University Homewood campus in
Baltimore, Maryland, August 13, 2003 - August 15, 2003. The purpose of the
meeting is to convene the set of Principal Investigators funded under the NSF
programs that will be brought together under the Cyber Trust umbrella, including
the Trusted Computing program, the Data and Application Security program,
security aspects of the Embedded and Hybrid Systems program, and security-
related work under the Network Research program. The meeting will encourage
synergy among the researchers and research projects by means of planned
technical sessions and opportunities for informal discussion. The participants
will also produce a report on research topics related to theme topics that will
be identified by NSF. To encourage broad participation and help establish NSF's
role as a leader in Cyber Trust, the first full day of the the meeting will be
open to other interested researchers, industry, and government participants, up
to the capacity of the hall.
