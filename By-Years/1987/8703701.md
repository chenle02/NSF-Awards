The proposal addresses the development of inexpensive, high performance polymer
composites for structural applications, such as automotive body panels, with
improved impact resistance and damage tolerance. In particular, it deals with a
novel processing technique of producing self-reinforcing polymer composite with
highly controlled orientation of the reinforcing phase, namely, the liquid
crystal polymer (LCP) formed in-situ in a thermoplastic matrix. The proposed
research addresses some fundamental issues involved in the development of
polymer melt blends. It is expected to advance the science base and offer new
technological opportunities.
