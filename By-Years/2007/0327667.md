This award provides funding to the Johns Hopkins University, Engineering
Research Center for Computer Integrated Surgical Systems and Technology (CISST)
for the support of the Southern California RET (SoCalRET)program to develop a
regional Research Experiences for Teachers (RET)program in the Los Angeles area.
This project puts into place an infrastructure that will continue the
development of the regional site model for the NSF/Engineering RET program that
was piloted in the Washington/Baltimore area during 2002 and will extend the
model to ERCs in the Southern California area and their local, urban school
districts and community colleges.
