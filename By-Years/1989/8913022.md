In order to study the energy input to our upper atmosphere, radiation from the
different atoms and molecules is viewed from both ground based as well as space
borne observing platforms. To analyze these data requires basic information on
how easy it is to get light emitted by these constituents under various
excitation conditions. This study is both a laboratory and theoretical study to
determine the absolute electron cross- sections for all of the important
electronic transitions of molecular oxygen in the 4-10 ev. energy loss region.
Differential cross-sections will be measured by a modulated crossed-beam method
and the dissociation products will be identified. These results will be analyzed
by an extensive configuration interaction calculation to obtain potential energy
curves and dipole transition moments from a large number of states.
