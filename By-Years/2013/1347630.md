This award will support student travel to The Fourth Annual ACM Conference on
Systems, Programming, Languages and Applications: Software for Humanity (SPLASH
2013). The conference is being held in Indianapolis, Indiana during October
26-31, 2013. SPLASH includes OOPSLA, one of the flagship ACM SIGPLAN
conferences, as well as many co-located events: Onward!, Wavefront, the Dynamic
Languages Symposium, SPLASH-E (Education), the International Conference on
Generative Programming: Concepts & Experiences, the International Conference on
Software Language Engineering. SPLASH also includes a program of tutorials,
posters, demonstrations, a Doctoral Symposium, and an ACM SIGPLAN Student
Research Competition. Supporting student travel to attend professional
conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. The funding
provided will enable broader student participation, especially by those without
adequate support at their home institution, and will help build the next
generation of programming language and software engineering researchers.
