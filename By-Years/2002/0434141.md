Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We intend to co-organize an IUTAM symposium on
"Size Effects on Material and &lt;br/&gt;Structural Behavior at Micron- and
Nano-Scales" with Hong Kong University of &lt;br/&gt;Science and Technology. The
symposium will cover the front research in areas of &lt;br/&gt;vital interest to
the US. NSF support will enable a larger US participation by &lt;br/&gt;young
researchers, women and minorities and provide them opportunities to
&lt;br/&gt;establish world-wide contact. They will have the benefit of seeing
the larger &lt;br/&gt;context in which their work is a part. The US delegates
&lt;br/&gt;for support will be nominated by a panel of three from broad
technical &lt;br/&gt;community. Supporting participation of international
conferences is a direct mechanism of NSF to promote collaboration of US
researchers with their Asian counter parts and the education and development of
young US researchers, especially women and minorities.&lt;br/&gt;
