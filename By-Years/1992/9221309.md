The Rocky Mountain Institute of Software Engineering is coordinating a workshop
on architectures for process-sensitive engineering environments, to be held
September 22-24, 1992, in Boulder, Colorado. The workshop's purposes are: obtain
a good understanding of architectural issues for process- sensitive
environments, compare alternative existing architectures, and develop a general
"game plan" for future work. Participation is by invitation only, with attendees
chosen to assure a balance of practitioner and researcher viewpoints as well as
a balanced participation from industry, government and academic organizations.
All attendees will be required to prepare position statements addressing topics
identified by the workshop organizers. Most of the workshop will be devoted to
working-group discussions of the topics; occasional presentations and periodic
plenary sessions will be held to foster cross-fertilization among the working
groups. A report on the workshop will be broadly disseminated throughout the
software engineering community. This report will augment the results of other
process and environment related activities such as the Software Development
Environment Conferences and the International Software Process Conferences and
Workshops.
