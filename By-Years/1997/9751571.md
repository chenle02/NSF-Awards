This project is creating an interactive teaching laboratory for students in
elementary statistics which is improving the curriculum by increasing data-
analysis potential, proving access to resources on the World Wide Web, enhancing
possibilities for cooperative learning, and encouraging the development of
communication skills. Gateway computers are being networked using the V-Net
Interactive Training system which allows the instructor to monitor, interact
with, or display the work on any individual station from a control station. The
course also taps into resources available on the World Wide Web, for example
Chance News, and a variety of real-world data sets. The course emphasizes
problem-solving and critical thinking skills by making extensive use of a
professional quality statistical software package. Students are being required
to communicate the results of their statistical inquiries using both written and
oral formats. This data-driven course emphasis and the variety of classroom
experiences made possible by V-Net is providing better preparation for students
in statistics-intensive majors and exposing students in teacher education
programs to a wide variety of learning experiences. Student laboratory exercises
and project results are being made available on the project's we` page. *
