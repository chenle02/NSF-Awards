Under this Presidential Young Investigator Award (PYI), the following studies
will be pursued: (1) Dynamic response of linear and nonlinear secondary systems,
(2) Reliability of systems with uncertain parameters, (3) Identification and
optimization of complex systems, and (4) Vibration reduction of dynamic systems
These studies are aiming at improving the understanding of the dynamic behavior
of complex structures with subsystem components and the seismic design of such
structures. This project is initiated in FY 88 and will run for five years.
