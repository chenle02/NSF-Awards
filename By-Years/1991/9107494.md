Three detection systems which have been developed in part at the University of
Denver will be further developed and investigated in terms of their ability to
determine the flux of species to and from the atmosphere. Long-path UV (LPUV)
spectroscopy will be coupled with long-path IR (LPIR) spectroscopy and used to
determine the fluxes of various species. A fast response in-situ total sulfur
monitor will also be optimized for response speed and sensitivity. It will be
used for flux studies by means of the eddy-correlation technique. Some of the
flux studies will be carried out in collaboration with the NCAR ASTER facility
and Argonne National Laboratory. An atmospheric pressure flow system, free
radical detector has been developed which is shown to respond to concentrations
of HO2 and RO2 radicals. This apparatus, named PERCA (PEroxy Radical detector
using Chemical Amplification) has been shown to respond to a number of
hydrocarbon and oxygenated hydrocarbon peroxy radicals up to C8. Using the
PERCA, further studies will be conducted to overcome the inability to obtain
stable calibrations.
