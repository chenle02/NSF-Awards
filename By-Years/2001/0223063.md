Kauai Community College will assess its STEM curriculum, infrastructure, and
evaluation procedures and determine a course of action to strengthen STEM
instruction through the integration of curricula and research. Central to this
effort is a pre-technology project-centered learning community to help address
barriers that prevent entry of native Hawaiians into STEM-based career
pathways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research activities will serve as foci for the
enhancement of STEM curricula and infrastructure. This approach will engage
students in research and strengthen institutional partnerships with private and
public sector organizations offering enhanced internship opportunities. An
assessment instrument to track project outcomes and the success of STEM
graduates will also be developed. &lt;br/&gt;
