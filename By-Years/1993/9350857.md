This is a proposal to create a modern, distributed, visually oriented computing
environment to support undergraduate computer science instruction. The
environment will encourage experimentation with algorithms and programs.
Students exposed to algorithm animation techniques in the classroom will be able
to use this software to explore the properties of algorithms on their own in the
laboratory. Through such experimentation, students will discover properties of
algorithms by themselves, leading to deeper understanding of the basic building
blocks of all software. A suite of state-of-the-art graphical tools will assist
the students in designing, analyzing, implementing, debugging, and testing
complex programs. By using powerful analysis tools, students will be able to
discover the structure of existing large programs. Other tools will assist them
in developing complex programs better and faster and ensure that they are
thoroughly tested. The skillful use of such tools leads to major increases in
both software quality and programmer productivity. Hypertext-based tools with
powerful searching capabilities will give instant access to documents in a large
technical database, which includes on-line documentation, classnotes, and
tutorials. The environment will consist of an array of networked UNIX
workstations and servers supporting powerful graphical user interfaces, and
appropriate software to facilitate the experimentation envisioned in this
project. Integration of this environment into our curriculum will give our
students a better understanding of fundamental principles and practical
techniques available to produce quality software and better prepare them for the
requirements of computer professionals in the 90s.
