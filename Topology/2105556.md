The Principal Investigator seeks to increase our understanding of mathematical
shapes, called manifolds, which are of particular interest to both physicists
and mathematicians. One important class of manifolds are those that are
everywhere positively curved or flat. The term "positive curvature" refers to
curving like a sphere; a very large sphere is approximately flat, and so has a
small but positive curvature. On the other hand, a very small sphere has a very
large curvature. This project will focus on these objects through international
collaborations, as well as through undergraduate research projects.

The PI's work is motivated by the recent breakthrough of Goette, Kerin, and
Shankar on finding metrics of non-negative sectional curvature on so-called
codimension one biquotient foliations. These spaces generalize the well known
cohomogeneity one manifolds, and all have a decomposition as a union of two disk
bundles glued together along their common boundary. The PI will work on
developing a method of classifying such objects. This includes studying the
classification of non-simply connected biquotients, as well as developing
obstructions at the level of cohomology for a manifold to admit such a
structure.
