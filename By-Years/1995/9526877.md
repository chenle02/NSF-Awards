9526877 Lesher Funds are requested for a 1 year pilot project to prove the
concept that magmatic amphiboles in komatiitic, ferropicritic, and tholeiitic
flows and sills in the Archean Abitibi-Pontiac region of the Superior Province,
Canada, and in the lower Proterozoic Cape Smith fold belt of the Circum-Superior
Belt, Canada, can be used to constrain the H2O contents of the parental melts
form which they formed and the ultimate source of the H2O. The project will
involve: 1) detailed petrographic analysis of magmatic amphibole in peridotites,
pyroxenites, and gabbros from mafic and ultramafic flows and sills; 2) detailed
chemical analysis of magmatic amphibole and, if possible, other hydromagmatic
phases such as phlogopite and apatite for major an minor trace elements
(including Cl and F) in selected samples by electron microprobe at the
University of Alabama; 3) analysis of high-purity amphibole separates for O and
H isotopic composition by mass spectrometry at Indiana University; 4) analysis
of carefully selected amphibole grains in situ for H isotopes by ion microprobe
at the Centre de Recherches Petrographiques et Geochimiques, Nancy.
