The overall goal of this project is to develop a distributed data management
system for Arctic Marine Geology and Geophysics data. It would provide
flexibility to data contributors by serving as either a data repository for PI's
who are unable to disseminate their data via the worldwide web or a portal for
PI's who wish to maintain their own archives.

For researchers wishing to access arctic data, the overarching goals of this
project are to: o Provide rapid access to raw and processed data, especially
data that presently are not supported at traditional data repositories such as
the National Geophysical Data Center (e.g., SCICEX sidescan and phase-difference
bathymetry, USCGC Healy SB2112 amplitude and backscatter data). o Provide access
to metadata, contact and reference information. o Establish standards for data
archival, documentation and presentation. o Promote collaborative research and
multidisciplinary studies, thereby fostering new scientific insights.
