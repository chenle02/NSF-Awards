The goal of this project is to understand how developing nerve cells make
connections with muscles, and to determine how those connections alter their
properties as a function of activity. There is evidence that developing nerve
connections are refined during development by activity mediated mechanisms. The
influence of activity on changes in nerve ending size and projection patterns
will be examined by use of mutations that disrupt the ability of neurons and
muscles to generate normal electrical activity. These changes will also be
investigated by the use of toxins that specifically interfere with nerve and
muscle electrical activity. To observe the development of the nerve muscle
connections, and their responses to experimental manipulations, time-lapse video
movies will be made of the living nerve endings maintained in semi- intact
cultures. These experiments will elucidate several fundamental features of
normal nervous system development.
