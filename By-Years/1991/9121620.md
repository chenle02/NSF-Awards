The proposal MAX '91 plans to study solar activity during the period of solar
maximum 91-94 with emphasis on coordination of observations from existing
facilities, as well as from new balloon, rocket and ground-based
instrumentation. Alan Kiplinger has acted in the capacity of Max '91 Coordinator
and has conducted three major worldwide campaigns in the last few years. He
supported several rocket flights, and set up a near- real-time solar computer
data base at NOAA's Space Environment Laboratory. The investigator proposes to
continue to carry out coordination of the Max '91 program during the remainder
of solar maximum by operationally supporting several new major campaigns, rocket
and balloon flights and "target of opportunity" campaigns. This support includes
distributions of Campaign Announcements with planning information,as well as
Campaign Summaries which provide plots and lists of solar activity and
compilations observations conducted worldwide. The Coordinator also proposes to
continue to develop new products and data bases which can be used by and
distributed to the scientific community. An example is development of a digital
archival system to capture 5,500 digital images per day from the five fulltime
U.S.A.F. SOON observatories located around the world. These data should become a
significant cornerstone of observations for studies of flares triggering, flare
build-up and energetics, as well as active region evolution. A vigorous pursuit
of independent research by the Coordinator has proven to be beneficial to Max
'91 as well as to his long-term research goals. Accordingly, a variety of
studies with the High Speed Ho Camera system also are proposed. These studies
include new observations of impulsive flares in pursuit of electron time of
flight effects. Other proposed studies include optical observations of
formations of active filaments, microwave spike bursts and an upgrade of the
system to obtain measurements of linear polarization in flares with a temporal
resolution of 0.4s.
