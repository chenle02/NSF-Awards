This five-year project would develop nine multi-media professional development
resources that will enhance PreK-8 teachers' understanding of how to employ
instructional strategies from the field of literacy in developing students'
scientific understanding. Four of the modules will be resources on specific uses
of literacy in the science classroom; four will be case studies offering
examples of best practices, including video components from the classrooms of
master teachers. The 9th module will provide an introduction to the theoretical
underpinnings and research studies that support linking science and literacy.
The PI, an expert in K-6 science instructional resource development, and her
colleagues from EDC lead a development team that includes experts in child
development, second language learning, literacy acquisition and science content.
