AST-0302153&lt;br/&gt;Metevier, Anne&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr.
Metevier is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to
carry out a program of research and education at the Center for Adaptive Optics
(CfAO) at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Her research will focus on
characterizing the galaxy populations of distant groups with the goal of
advancing our understanding of the physical processes that govern galaxy
evolution. At high redshifts, galaxy groups are essentially an unexplored
density regime, yet they are key to our understanding of galaxy evolution, as
they bridge the density gap between the comparatively well-studied galaxy
cluster and field environments. Dr. Metevier will define a catalog of galaxy
groups at a redshift of about 1, and then measure constituent galaxies' masses,
structural parameters, and star formation characteristics. She will then relate
these measurements to the physical processes which may be affecting them by
comparison with theoretical predictions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Metevier will
also work with under-represented community college students. She will develop
and teach an astronomy laboratory short course at Hartnell College, a local
minority-serving institution, with the goal of providing students with a
knowledge base and experiences highly relevant to CfAO research. Beyond the
short course, she will continue to advise the students through the CfAO's Paired
Mentoring Program and recruit them for the CfAO's Summer Internship Program.
