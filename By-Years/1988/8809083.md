Measurements of the density matrix for collisionally produced H atoms for
electron transfer collision of H+ on He will be continued. By fully modeling the
collision region and calculating the transition amplitudes of the Stark-mixed
hydrogenic states, the n=3 density matrix with 14 independent parameters,
associated with the newly formed hydrogen atoms, can be fit to the measured
signals. Significant improvements in the measuring apparatus and in the analysis
associated with the fit of the density matrix to the optical signals will be
utilized in the further measurements. The resulting changes have so far produced
measured values of the density matrix that are in striking agreement with
theory, for the most part. Important differences do remain, and further tests
and extension are warranted-especially for the n=2 manifold and for the
differential measurement. Because of significant, recent advances in atomic
theory the measurement program is now directed toward a detailed understanding
of differences and similarities between the calculated density matrix and the
measured one.
