Many organic compounds, including both polar and nonpolar substances, are
adsorbed by marine sediments. Adsorbed organic substances determine the
physicochemical properties ofmostparticle surfaces in natural waters.
Further,adsorptionaffects thr rate of decomposition of organic
substancesbybacteria. The proposed research will investigate theadsorptionof the
amino acids alanine, glutamic acid, lysine, andleucine:several alanine peptides,
and the monosaccharide glucose. Thegoals are to determine which organic
constituents ofsedimentsadsorb amino acids, the effects of adsorption
ondecompositionrates, and the mechanisms of adsorption. THeapproach willinvolve
both field studies on fresh, intactsediments andlaboratory experiments with
extracted sedimentorganic matter.The results of these studies will help answer
thequestion: Isadsorption responsible, in part, for variation
indecompositionrates of different organic substances? Doesadsorptioncontribute
to differences in decomposition rates of thesameorganic compound in sediments of
differing composition?
