Rockford Diamond Technology, Inc., proposes to study the diffusion of n-type
impurities and the formation of p-n junctions in diamond. The parameters of
prospective n-type dopants: position of impurity levels in the diamond band gap,
diffusion coefficients of impurities, solubility, electrical activity, influence
of impurities on the mobility of charge carriers, and p-n junction
characteristics will be determined.
