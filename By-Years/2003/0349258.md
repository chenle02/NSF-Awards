This CAREER award supports research by Dr. Christopher J. Levy of Kansas State
University to synthesize a series of helical transition metal complexes with
different morphologies and to identify systems that produce stable single-
stranded mononuclear helices. These complexes will be applied as catalysts for
asymmetric oxidation reactions involving hydroxylation, epoxidation, and
sulfoxidation. The long-term objective is to develop systems that are effective
for inexpensive substrates and environmentally benign oxidants under mild
conditions. Understanding the processes of helix formation and catalytic
oxidations will be addressed through rigorous mechanistic investigations.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational plan utilizes a case study approach to
chemistry teaching that will challenge students and promote critical thinking
about the role of chemistry in society. Open house activities and displays
directed at the general public will communicate the relevance, methodology, and
solutions of green science and highlight the important contributions of the
chemistry faculty. These same themes will be developed into a lecture, directed
toward high school and community college students, which will be part of an
existing university outreach program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This career
development plan synthesizes the ideals and practices of green oxidation
chemistry into a coherent program of education and research. A core objective is
to educate the scientific and general communities about the goals, benefits, and
progress of green chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
