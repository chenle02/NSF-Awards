This is a theoretical study of the high pressure properties of candidate mantle
phases in order to better constrain the chemistry and mineral composition of the
mantle. Several important and basic questions will be addressed, including: 1)
phase transitions in SiO2 stishovite that would lead to extreme shear elastic
softening, 2) possible high temperature phase transitions in MgSiO3, 3) bonding
characteristics of iron in high pressure oxides, 4) search for new candidate
high pressure-high temperature phases, and 5) physical properties of mantle
phases. A combination of the following theoretical techniques will be used: a)
first- principles electronic structure calculations using the Linearized
Augmented Plane Wave (LAPW) method, b) ab initio model methods that make
assumptions about bonding and ionicity but are many orders of magnitude faster
than LAPW, c) hybrid "constrained potential models" that correct the ab initio
models to give better agreement with the first-principles calculations, and d)
lattice dynamics, molecular dynamics, and Monte Carlo simulations using these
potential to obtain temperature dependent properties.
