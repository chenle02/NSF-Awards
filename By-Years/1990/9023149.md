The purpose of this research is to develop compounds as tools to study opioid
receptors. These receptors are proteins which are responsible for both the
beneficial and the undisirable effects of narcotic analgesics such as morphine.
However, not all opioid receptors are identical and this has complicated the
study of this receptor group. Since the demonstration of these multiple opioid
receptors about fifteen years ago, numerous compounds have been prepared in
attempts to differentiate the receptor types. To further complicate the issue,
endogenous morphine-like substances have been isolated from animals. These
compounds, opioid peptides, are fragments of other proteins and appear to be
involved in a number of physiological functions including pain sensation. This
research involves the preparation of derivatives of one of the opioid peptides,
dynorphin. This opioid interacts with kappa-opioid receptors which are distinct
from morphine receptors. The study of kappa opioid receptors may lead to the
development of better nonaddictive analgesics. The opioids are synthesized
containing 'affinity labels' which cause the synthetic opioid to permanently
bind to the receptor. In this way, any neuroscientists or pharmacologist may use
these new peptides to differentiate between the various types of opioid
receptors.
