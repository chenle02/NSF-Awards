Proposal Number: ECS-9732940 Principal Investigator: Yang Zhao Title:
Development of Diode-Pumped Tunable Mid-Infrared Laser Using Co-Doped II-VI
Crystals This proposal describes a one-year activity in which the PI will
conduct a preliminary investigation of a Co-doped ZnTe laser pumped by a low
cost and reliable AlGaAs laser. The emission wavelength will be in the 3 to 4
micron range in the infrared region. The major advantage of this approach is the
utilization of the high power and relatively low-cost AlGaAs pump laser. If
successful, this system will provide a compact, tunable source with good
reliability. Potential applications include bio-sensing and pollution control.
It also has the potential to open up a new field of transition metal doped II-VI
semiconductors as lasing media.
