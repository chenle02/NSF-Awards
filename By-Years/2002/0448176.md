Why do university students exit courses capable of solving difficult
&lt;br/&gt;analytic problems (e.g., calculate current in a complex circuit), but
&lt;br/&gt;are unable to explain the same content conceptually (e.g., which
light &lt;br/&gt;bulb is brighter in such a circuit)? Which educational
activities &lt;br/&gt;address this challenge and
why?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building on the well-established foundations of
physics education &lt;br/&gt;research that have focused on student cognition,
curriculum design and &lt;br/&gt;course practices, this research program
establishes another perspective &lt;br/&gt;from which we may understand student
learning in physics: one that &lt;br/&gt;emphasizes learning in context. That
is, how and what students learn &lt;br/&gt;depends not only on traditionally
conceived content but also upon the &lt;br/&gt;formation of tasks, class
environments, and broader institutional &lt;br/&gt;structures in which the
content is embedded. Such a perspective begins &lt;br/&gt;to explain a host of
research questions, such as the one listed above, &lt;br/&gt;and is directed at
understanding sustainable and scalable models of &lt;br/&gt;reform in physics
education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project coordinates two levels of research
on the role of context &lt;br/&gt;in student learning: the level of individual
students and the level of &lt;br/&gt;course activities. Many of the associated
research questions are new in &lt;br/&gt;physics (e.g., examining the effects of
having students teach others in &lt;br/&gt;order to learn) while others augment
existing lines of research (e.g., &lt;br/&gt;the role of computer simulations in
the classroom). Collectively, these &lt;br/&gt;investigations provide a
framework for understanding each of the &lt;br/&gt;individual research studies,
as well as the portability of the results &lt;br/&gt;of these studies to other
environments. Furthermore, their coordinated &lt;br/&gt;outcomes will result in
meaningful models of context in student &lt;br/&gt;learning, which will serve as
the foundation for long-term research in &lt;br/&gt;this area. This research is
designed to improve educational practices &lt;br/&gt;in physics and to better
understand how to make them sustainable and &lt;br/&gt;scalable.&lt;br/&gt;
