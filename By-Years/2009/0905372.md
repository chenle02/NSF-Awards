Probabilistic and decision-theoretic planning, which operates under conditions
of uncertainty, has important applications in science and engineering, but such
stochastic methods have been under-utilized because these planners do not scale
to large, complicated problems.

In contrast, the past decade has seen tremendous scale-up in deterministic
planning techniques, which do not directly address the same challenges of
uncertainty head on. This project provides a systematic framework for exploiting
this progress in deterministic planning technology - be it classical, temporal
or partial satisfaction planning problems - in stochastic planning as well, by
novel adaptation of theory and/or methods of determinization, hindsight
optimization, and machine learning.

This project is helping to bridge the traditional divide between deterministic
and stochastic planning communities, and it is bringing stochastic planning
technology to real-world applications.
