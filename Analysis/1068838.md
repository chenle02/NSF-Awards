The PI will explore and apply logic, set-theoretic and combinatorial methods to
the geometry of Banach spaces. The isomorphic classification of the complemented
subspaces of the spaces of p-power integrable functions, especially those
contained in some nice subspaces, will be considered. Necessary and sufficient
conditions for bounded linear operators from these spaces to factor through
spaces with simpler and better structures will be studied. The investigator will
also study operators from spaces with certain asymptotic structures.
Characterizations of subspaces and quotients of separable Banach spaces with
shrinking unconditional basis and subsequences of unconditional sequences will
be investigated.

Banach space theory is about vector spaces in which there is a very natural
notion of distance. These spaces are of fundamental importance in many areas,
including mathematical models in quantum mechanics. The understanding of the
geometry of Banach spaces has been and will continue to be useful in many areas
of mathematics and engineering. In particular, the use of logic, set-theoretic
and combinatorial methods will provide rich information about the geometric
structure of Banach spaces.
