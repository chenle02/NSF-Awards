This project in cooperation with the continuing NOAA sponsored STACS program
will measure the seasonal variability of the North Brazil Current and underlying
flows in the deep western boundary undercurrent. The retroflection of the flow
in the surface layer will have important consequences for the transport of heat
from the southern to northern hemispheres. The field program will use a free-
falling instrument , PEGASUS, to directly measure the currents from surface to
bottom at each of the oceanographic stations.
