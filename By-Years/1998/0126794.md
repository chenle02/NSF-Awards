Engineering - Materials Science (57) We have developed a textbook and
accompanying CD-ROM for a course in materials specifically designed for non-
science majors. This work builds on the success of a course developed at
Washington State University for non-science majors that addresses the manner in
which materials impact society on a regional, national, and global scale. The
course "Materials: The Foundations of Society and Technology" is targeted at
third and fourth year undergraduates and is a "capstone" course in our General
Education Curriculum. This textbook is based on the extensive notes we have
prepared in developing the course and on research we have undertake under the
auspices of this proposal. The textbook has been written in such a way that it
can readily be used by the general college population. To assist faculty that
decide to teach similar courses at their own institution we have developed a CD-
ROM. Our CDROM has links to important educational and informational resources.
In addition it contains homework problems and suggested assignments as well as
background information regarding basic engineering and scientific principles.
