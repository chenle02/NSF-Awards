As artificially structured materials shrink towards dimensions where quantum-
mechanical effects become paramount, and the inter- connections between optical
and electronic devices increase, the understanding of optical/transport
interactions will be a fundamental tool with which to enter the next century in
electronics. By combining optical and transport measurement techniques with the
fabrication of novel structures, one will investigate phenomena such as
electron-electron and electron-hole coupling, edge-state conduction and one-
dimensional quantum transport, electron crysallization, electron-hole
condensation and the thermodynamic properties of reduced-dimension systems.
