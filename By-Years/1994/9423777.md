94-23777 Zang This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project
investigates a novel 2-Dimensional Spatial Light Modulator (2DSLM) utilizing a
photochromic protein. Two-dimensional light modulators are key elements in many
optical signal processing architectures. Phase I showed the feasibility of using
bacteriorhodopson (BR) as a nonlinear Fabry-Perot modulator in a new 2DSLM. BR
is an organic molecule that exhibits a large optical nonlinearity, can be
inexpensively produced, and can be cast as a thin film polymer. Phase II will
examine an asymetrical reflection-mode Fabry-Perot design, produce mutated BR
with optimized properties, and construct an integrated device. Design
specifications are expected greatly to exceed those of currently available
spatial light modulators. Results of these studies will be used in design of a
large-scale process to be demonstrated in Phase III under private sector
support. Commercial applications of this BRSLM technolgy are expected in optical
pattern recognition, e.g., fingerprint identification, in optical information
processing, in neural networks, in incoherent/coherent image conversion, and in
holographic interconnections.
