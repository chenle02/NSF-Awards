Data on natural populations and biological field station's habitat are a
valuable resource, if properly managed and cared for. Successful data management
requires field stations to take advantage of advances in technology, and to
support staff at field stations. This project will support a workshop to be held
April 22-26, 1990, at the Kellogg Biological Station, as a sucessor to a similar
workshop held in 1982. The purpose will be to assess the progress that has been
made since the earlier workshop, to share and disseminate information, to
recommend standards and protocols to aid collaborative research and to propose
new directions for which pilot programs might lead the way. The workshop will be
co-sponsored by the Organization of Biological Field Stations (OBFS) and the
Southern Association of Marine Labs (SAML), and will represent the diversity of
sites and the various stages of development of data management systems in these
two groups. Approximately 40 representatives from field station and marine
laboratories will be invited to participate in one of three working groups: 1)
Data Administration, 2)Database Standards to Facilitate Collaborative Research,
and 3)Computers and Software for Data Management. A report of the workshops
conclusions and recommendation will be made to the National Science Foundation,
and distributed to the institutions constitution OBFS and SAML, as well as to
other interested scientists.
