Flowers exhibit remarkable variation in form, affecting how pollinating insects
recognize them, but the evolution of that form is not well understood. The mints
and their relatives are a good group in which to study the evolution of floral
shape, because there have been many changes from radial symmetry to bilateral
symmetry and back. This project will test the hypothesis that (a) a major shift
from radial symmetry to bilateral symmetry within the mint relatives correlates
with extra copies of floral symmetry patterning genes, and changes in gene
expression; (b) a return to radial symmetry occurred by diversification of the
same genes.

Mints and their relatives are commonly used as ornamental plants for their
spectacular flowers; they will thus provide an excellent backyard example for
the education of the general public on evolution and development, and plant-
insect interactions. Additionally, the project will involve the training of two
undergraduate students.
