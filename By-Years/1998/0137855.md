Two high-school algebra modules will be developed consistent with current
research on student learning. Each module will span from four to six weeks of
classroom instruction; incorporate the use of technology; and include a
curriculum unit, teacher guide, assessment materials and materials to support
community-based mathematics literacy events. One module will use the "Road
Coloring Problem" to introduce students to functions and lay the groundwork for
matrix multiplication. The other module will use games to enhance students'
mathematical understanding, and will help students learn polynomials and
introduce elementary counting and probability concepts. The materials will
embody a pedagogical approach whereby mathematics emerges from students' careful
observation and systematic analysis of familiar events that are mathematically
rich. Teachers using the materials will form professional communities by
collaborating online. The materials will be pilot- and field-tested in several
geographically and demographically diverse sites. The project will have
formative and summative evaluation components.&lt;br/&gt;
