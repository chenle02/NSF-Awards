This research will study convergence properties and implementation details for
several types of iterative methods for solving systems of linear equations on
sequential computers and on the BBN Butterfly parallel computer. It will examine
ways to dynamically determine the number of inner iterations that should be
taken in a "nested iterative method," and provide convergence conditions for
such methods. Block chaotic algoritms will also be investigated. The question of
distributing the computational load in a parallel computing environment is
crucial. The proposed research should give insight on this issue.
