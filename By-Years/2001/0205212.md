This project focuses on compiler-enabled power-aware architectures. Its purpose
is to leverage static program information in smart ways, to reduce power and
energy consumption in both embeddded and general-purpose architectures. We
follow three key general ideas to achieve this goal: (1) we use static
information to throttle processor resources, (2) we incorporate architectural
features to directly support static compiler managed modes of operation, and (3)
we leverage speculative static information in addition to the predictable static
information to support (1) and (2).

We have demonstrated, in a number of processor architectural domains, that our
approach is feasible, and can be easily implemented, and that considerable
energy savings, beyond what would be possible with circuit and architectural
techniques alone, can be achieved. We estimate that our techniques if combined,
can give an additional 30% or more energy savings compared to state-of-the-art
low-power designs, while not significantly affecting performance.
