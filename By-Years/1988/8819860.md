The Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) at the University of Chicago supports
interactive and interdisciplinary materials research, primarily in the condensed
matter sciences, organized into three principal thrust areas. There is a strong
emphasis throughout on collaborative research between experimentalists and
theorists. The surface dynamics thrust includes research on adparticle dynamics
and surface reactivity, and on surface phonon spectroscopy and overlayer
dynamics. The thrust on disordered materials includes work on lower dimensional
disorder a variety of systems, glassiness and glassy dynamics, and order-
disorder and structure in oxides. Research on dynamical patterns and
solidification has developed into a third major thrust area in the last few
years. It addresses the dynamics of pattern formation and dynamical evolution at
liquid-liquid and liquid- solid interfaces and in simple dynamical systems where
the work is concerned with the analysis of fractal attractors generated at the
onset of chaos in convective flow. The MRL also provides seed funding for new
faculty and high- risk research, and supports continuing research in high-
resolution analytical microscopy related to several other areas of the overall
program. Funding is also provided for the development, operation and maintenance
of central research facilities. The program currently involves 21 faculty
members, 5 professionals, 23 graduate students, and 6 students in "Research
Experience for Undergraduates." The University of Chicago MRL is directed by
Professor Sidney R. Nagel.
