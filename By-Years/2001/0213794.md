Vegetation classification is critical for resource mapping, conservation
planning and ecological monitoring. This project will provide the information
infrastructure, VegBank, that will include field plot data, the plant taxa used,
the community classification, and mechanisms for proposing changes. Vegetation
plot records support not only classification, but also most research in plant
community ecology. A working prototype of a system for acquiring, searching and
disseminating field plot records for classifying North American vegetation has
been developed and is available on the web. VegBank is a collaboration of four
institutions that represent major data sources and users. VegBank will be
expanded and tested as a robust, public system for use by the broader plant
ecology community. The plant and community classification modules will provide a
technical solution for taxonomic ambiguities. The module will be populated with
data from collaborating groups. Sharing and replication of data will enable
several databases by allowing for linkages that would make an international
network supporting distributed queries. A plug-in tool will foster future
development by the user community. All of the data will be web accessible.
