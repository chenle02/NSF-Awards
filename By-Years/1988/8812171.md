This research project investigates a protein complex that is found only in
retinal photoreceptors. The complex is composed of a phosphoprotein of 33,000
(33K) daltons and two proteins (beta and gamma transducin) which have been shown
to participate in the visual transduction process. Association of beta-gamma
transducin with the 33K protein and the ability of light to trigger the
dephosphorylation of 33K suggests that the 33K/T beta-gamma complex may act to
modulate the phototransduction process, particularly in mammalian
photoreceptors. The PI will focus on the light-modulated
phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle of the 33K protein. Phosphorylation of
the 33K protein may modify interactions between the 33K protein and the beta-
gamma subunits of transducin or it could alter the functional activities of the
33K/T beta-gamma complex. These studies are significant in a broader sense
because transducin belongs to a family of homologous GTP-binding proteins
(G-proteins) that are involved in signal transduction in a variety of tissues.
In each tissue, a receptor for an extracellular signal, e.g., light, hormone or
neurotransmitter, is coupled to a G-protein which regulates cellular function.
It is still unclear how G-proteins are down-regulated, but proteins which may be
analogous to the 33K/T-beta-gamma complex seem to be involved. Understanding the
mechanisms which regulate the visual process is a major goal of this project,
and each increment of accomplishment provides insight into how phosphoproteins
interact with the family of G- proteins and, thereby, influence the many
cellular functions which G-proteins mediate.
