Rutgers University has been awarded a grant to expand, streamline and increase
the functionality and adherence to community standards in the Ocean
Biogeographic Information System (OBIS). The work will add a biological modeling
service, a genetic information service, a taxonomic name service, environmental
mapping and enhanced GIS services to the system. It will also incorporate an
intelligent schema mapping tool to streamline the integration of new databases.
To further facilitate integration, the Distributed Generic Information Retrieval
(DiGIR) protocol will be modified for OBIS and a DiGIR portal will be
established to further facilitate inclusion of much more data through federated
searches of distributed databases.
