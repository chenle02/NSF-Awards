This award will support an experimental plasma-based study of how large-scale
flows may emerge from small-scale turbulence in rotating systems. The behavior
of fluid-like media in rotating stars and gas giant planets, in the oceans and
molten cores of rotating Earth-like planets, and in plasmas with strong magnetic
fields is profoundly affected by the forces associated with the overall rotation
on the medium itself. These forces lead to the emergence of well ordered, slowly
varying sheared flows. Theory predicts that all such systems share the same
underlying origin of the sheared flows via a quantity known as the potential
vorticity. In a rotating fluid, for example in geophysical, planetary and
stellar systems, the potential vorticity is given by a combination of the local
fluid vorticity and the planetary rotation itself. The experimental study
supported by this award will make the first-ever attempt to directly test the
role that potential vorticity plays in the formation of sheared flows in
turbulent magnetized plasmas and will have broader implications for future
development of fusion energy sources. The experiment will be performed on the
COMPASS plasma device in the Czech Republic, and the subsequent data analysis
will be carried out by upper-division undergraduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide an experimental test of
the theoretical prediction that turbulence-generated shear flows appear in
magnetized toroidal plasmas due to the effects of a strong Lorentz force, and as
such follow similar underlying nonlinear dynamics to that responsible for shear
flow formation found in the atmospheres of planets and stars due to the effects
of the Coriolis force. Should this experiment demonstrate that this is the case,
it would provide a strong link between these two seemingly disparate physical
systems. Should the result show that the prediction is in fact incorrect, it
would then force a fundamental rethinking of the theory. In either case, the
outcome will impact our understanding of self-organization processes in
turbulent fluid and plasma systems. This award is supported by the Division of
Physics with additional support from the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities
and the Office of International Science and
Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
