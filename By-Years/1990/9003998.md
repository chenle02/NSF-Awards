This is a post Loma Prieta earthquake (Oct. 1989) investigation project in
learning from this damaging event. This project concentrates on the seismic
performance of elevators during the earthquake and relates this learning to the
current elevator code requirement. A damage survey indicates that the Loma
Prieta earthquake has caused extensive elevator damage, although the design
details that contributed to the problems are not known. It is clear that seismic
switches, optional in California but required for the National code, did not
performed as intended. This earthquake provides an opportunity to identify the
deficiencies of current elevator codes and improve our understanding of the
seismic performance of elevators. Several buildings that experienced elevator
damages will be selected to represent a range of configurations, structural
systems, types of elevator equipment, and locations. A detailed inspection of
elevators will be made based on damage details from expert interviews. Code
provisions will be evaluated in light of observed damage and changes suggested.
Finally, the malfunctions effecting the performance of seismic safety devices
will be evaluated. This study will upgrade the current code requirements
governing the seismic safety of elevator systems.
