In this project, Dr. Henryk Struszczyk of the Institute of Chemical Fibres,
Lodz, Poland, will cooperate with Dr. W.C. Glasser of Virginia Polytechnic
Institute and State University, Dr. V.L. Chiang of Michigan Technical
University, and Dr. R. Narayan of Purdue University, under the U.S.-Poland Marie
Sklodowska-Curie Joint Fund to research "New Directions for Lignin Utilization."
The researchers will study new directions of lignin utilization as a source for
modified polymers production as well as in a form of polymeric carriers as a
matrix for preparation of controlled release pesticides suitable for
agricultural application. Lignin, a by- product of producing wood pulp, is now
mainly burned as an energy source, but this produces toxic sulfur dioxide gases
harmful to the environment. The researchers believe lignin could serve as a
source of new products, especially polymers. This project in chemistry fulfills
the program objectives of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading
experts in the U.S. and Poland to combine complementary efforts and capabilities
in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality,
reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
