This award provides funds to the Department of Psychology at The Pennsylvania
State University to establish a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site.
Eight undergraduate psychology majors with an interest in the biological aspects
of experimental psychology will be recruited to participate in this program at
the completion of their sophomore year. An effort will be made to attract a
majority of minority students using the techniques and contacts which have
enabled the Department to train 40 minority Ph.D.s since 1969. The students
selected will work as apprentices with one of five members of the faculty, all
nationally known for their research and all highly experienced at training
graduate students and undergraduates who have gone on to graduate school. Last
year these same five faculty members received a large equipment grant from the
U.S. Department of Education. Therefore, the facilities available in these
laboratories for research and training in psychophysiology are the equal of any
university in the country. Faculty mentors will work full-time with these
students during the summer after their sophomore year, gradually exposing them
to all aspects of psychophysiological research. Students will begin an
independent experiment during the latter part of the summer and complete it with
the help of their Penn State mentor during their junior year. Near the end of
their junior year the students will present their research at a department
colloquium.
