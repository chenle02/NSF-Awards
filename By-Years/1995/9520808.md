William Gelbart is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to continue his studies involving statistical mechanics of
fluid bilayers, lamellar phases, vesicles and liposomes. Four specific topics
will be addressed: 1) inter vesicle electrostatics and lateral charge
inhomogeneities; 2) structure and free energy of bilayer fusion intermediates;
3) coupling between micellar shapes, sizes, and long-range ordering in
concentrated surfactant solutions; and 4) response of lipid bilayers to tension,
with and without incorporated surfactant. A combination of formal Poisson-
Boltzmann theory and computer simulations using molecular dynamics and Monte
Carlo techniques will be used in this research. This work impinges directly on
several strategically important areas of research including an understanding of
cell membranes and drug delivery systems.
