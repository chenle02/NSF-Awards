This grant provides the U.S. membership contribution toward core support for the
International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) for calendar years
2016-2020. IIASA is an independent, non-governmental, international research
institution devoted to interdisciplinary, policy-oriented research. It is
located in Laxenburg, Austria. Its research agenda focuses on systems approaches
to the analysis of the interconnected and interdependent challenges raised by
global transformations in the environmental, economic, technological and
societal spheres. IIASA offers a neutral venue for conceiving and analyzing
strategies for cooperative action on common problems in a globalized, rapidly
transforming world. IIASA is supported by a network of nongovernmental National
Member Organizations (NMOs) in 23 countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IIASA's
Research Plan for 2016-2020 describes nine research programs: Advanced Systems
Analysis (ASA); Air Quality and Greenhouse Gases (AIR); Ecosystem Services and
Management (ESM); Energy (ENE); Evolution and Ecology (EEP); Risk and Resilience
(RAR); Transitions to New Technologies (TNT); Water (WAT); and World Population
(POP).
