Scott The investigator and his colleagues organize the Third International
Conference On Spectral And High Order Methods (ICOSAHOM), held at the University
of Houston, Houston, Texas, June 5 - 9, 1995. The development of high
performance computers has made spectral and high order methods one of the most
important techniques in modern scientific and engineering computation.
Presentation of recent research concerning high order methods has an
increasingly important role in scientific computing. Applications are being made
in a variety of fields, including chip design, fluid dynamics and others. The
first ICOSAHOM was held in 1989 in Italy, and the second ICOSAHOM was in June
1992 in Montpelier, France. With a long periodicity of 3 years, ICOSAHOM plays
the role of an "international congress" for the subject and provides an
opportunity to coordinate and stimulate research in spectral and high order
methods. This conference focuses on numerical methods for the accurate solution
of partial differential equations. Such equations arise in simulating
manufacturing processes and designing new products, from automobiles and
airplanes to computer chips. Highly accurate solutions are needed because
current design and processes have reached a refined state that requires
extremely accurate and efficient simulations to remain competitive. This need
has driven the development and use of high-performance computers themselves, as
well as of specific algorithms for them. The aim of this conference is to bring
together leading researchers, both established and younger scientists, in this
increasingly active and highly interdisciplinary field to survey and review the
current state of research.
