This award supports research in the area of finite group theory. The principal
investigator will study "fixed point" problems, including cases where the
operator group is not solvable. He will look into the character theory of finite
groups with many normal subgroups, using character factorization techniques
among others, to reduce questions about arbitrary finite groups to questions
about finite (almost) simple groups. He will also look into the theory of the
finite almost simple groups, extending and refining his results on the maximum
length of chains of subgroups and Schur index formulas, among others. A group is
an algebraic structure with a single operation. It appears in many areas of
mathematics, as well as, physics and chemistry. The fundamental building blocks
of finite groups are finite simple groups. One of the major results in
mathematics of the past decade is the classification of the finite simple
groups, the proof of which would require 10,000 to 15,000 journal pages. This
research goes beyond the classification theorem to provide further information
about finite groups.
