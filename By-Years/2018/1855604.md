Rigorous analysis of microscopic probabilistic models enhances our understanding
of the mechanisms governing hydrodynamic flow, crystal growth, magnetism, and
wave propagation. It also informs smarter design of materials with customizable
properties. This project aims to develop a robust understanding of these
macroscopic phenomena, using fundamental concepts from single-particle diffusion
Laplacians and Dirichlet energy forms on a wide variety of state spaces,
including networks, trees, and fractals. An integral part of this project will
involve promotion of, and training in, probability and statistical mechanics
through the PI's teaching and research with undergraduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the analysis of
interacting particle systems on state spaces which need not possess spatial
symmetries, but are bounded in the metric determined by electrical resistance.
The PI will carry out, on these resistance spaces, rigorous derivations of
nonlinear (Stochastic) Partial Differential Equations as scaling limits of
empirical observables in the weakly asymmetric exclusion processes. Emphasis
will be on the role played by the parameters governing the bulk exclusion as
well as the boundary Kawasaki dynamics, leading to macroscopic phase transitions
and nonlinear effects. The PI will utilize novel functional inequalities,
algebraic identities, coarse-graining methods, and analysis of (S)PDEs to
establish limit theorems. The overall goal is to obtain a self-consistent
understanding of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics on large-scale networks,
through a combination of probabilistic tools and non-smooth global
analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
