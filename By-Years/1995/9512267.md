This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at Creighton University acquire a 300 MHz NMR
Spectrometer with variable temperature control and broad-band detection
capabilities. The research activity to be supported includes: (1) extended
conjugate addition chemistry; (2) Structural/conformational studies of ring-
expanded nucleosides; (3) Si-Csp interactions in silylalkynes; (4) The
reactivity of S2 with organometallic complexes; (5) Mechanism-based inactivation
of phospholipase A2; (6) Synthesis of calcitonin gene-related peptide, (7)
Synthesis of bicyclic octahydroisoquinolines as thromboxane A2 antagonists, and
(8) Synthesis od saturated and bicyclic dopamine receptor ligands. Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to the
chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to
identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within
molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists
who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are
useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
