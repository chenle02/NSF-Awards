This proposal is the result of two years of planning to integrate a hardware
concepts experience within the software oriented coursework in computer science.
Too often students are given the impression that software development is
associated with data handling that leads only to calculations, reports, and
printouts or visual displays of one form or another, with little or no
appreciation for the fact that computers must often monitor and control physical
processes as well. We are therefore proposing an integration of external devices
and embedded software into instruction in a range of courses rather than just
those that would normally include this. The general theme is to create multiple
experiences with the integration of hardware and software concepts throughout a
number of the courses in the undergraduate curriculum (all of which are either
required or advanced technical electives in the major). The plan is to acquire
the hardware for this project, set it up and test it with respect to inclusion
in our target classes, then implement and refine this infusion of
conceptual/practical material into our classes with significant gains in depth
and understanding as the thread is followed through the classes from one level
to the next. Each of the investigators has special contributions to make to the
overall project, including an enormous amount of quality instructional
experience. They form an effective support component to ensure that the range of
activities planned are completed. The team is compatible, enthusiastic, and
motivated. The hardware systems for the project have been carefully selected for
potential use in the broadest range of classes from beginning programming
principles to advanced system software and real-time systems.
