The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a traffic safety data analytics platform that will help reduce
the injuries, property damage, trauma, and environmental impact caused by
wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVCs). According to public insurance and US DOT
sources, over 1.3 million WVCs occur every year in the US, causing over $20B in
losses for insurers, DOTs, and freight haulers. Preliminary statistical analysis
indicated the effectiveness of a novel statistical model in predicting the
likelihood of encountering a large animal on a roadway, and the likelihood of a
collision. Extensive customer discovery with public safety managers, auto
insurance claims managers, truckers, and passenger drivers, indicated widespread
and financial and safety needs to reduce WVCs. Commercialization of the proposed
technology as a service will enable public safety managers to understand risk
factors in their districts, and preemptively and selectively deploy safety
countermeasures for drivers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based
on the development of a suite of statistical analytics algorithms that predict
the likelihood of a driver witnessing an animal on the road, the likelihood of
hitting the animal, and the potential severity of the collision (property
damage, light injury, serious injury, or fatality). These proposed risk models
fuse data feeds from historical crashes, past and predictive weather data, and
road and surface data. The proposed technology also includes internet of things
(IoT) devices, called RADs: Roadside Animal Deterrents. The proposed algorithms
may determine where to install the RADs, and also evaluate changes in crash
statistics over time. The technology may enable public roadway managers to keep
their roads safe, maintained, and properly operating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
