The proposed workshop will be a unique, interdisciplinary gathering of academic
scientists and knowledgeable indigenous community members to share observations
and discuss explanations of changing river and lake ice conditions in Interior
Alaska. This workshop developed out of continued concern expressed by Interior
people about the changing nature of lake and river ice in their regions and the
dangers this poses for winter travel and subsistence. This workshop has the
potential to be a model for developing synchronism between the scientific
community and local experts in designing research on issues of mutual interest
and concern. In addition, it is the intention of the organizers to stimulate
interest among Arctic researchers in the recently announced NSF crosscutting
priority area Human and Social Dynamics in the emphasis areas of Agents of
Change and Decisions Making and Risk.
