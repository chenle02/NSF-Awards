9308635 Winford Abstract Continuing debate about the structure of creole
Tense/Modality/ Aspect (TMA) systems has emphasized the need for more precise
and thorough analyses of particular creoles to elucidate issues such as the
degree of similarity among creoles and their implications for theories of
creolization. The longstanding view that creole verb complexes are organized
around three core categories - Anterior (Tense), Irrealis (Mood) and Non-
punctual (Aspect) - has come under increasing challenge in recent years, as our
knowledge of these language has grown. This research focusses on the semantic
and syntactic organization of the TMA systems of two Caribbean creoles -
Belizean and Sranan (Suriname). The main purpose of the investigation is to test
the extent to which the TMA systems of these creoles share a common organization
and set of categories, and in what ways they conform to the so-called
"prototypical" Creole TMA system which some scholars believe to owe its origin
primarily to the influence of language universals in creole genesis and
development. This is related to the broader hypothesis that creole grammar
directly reflects Universal Grammar. The study will investigate the forms which
encode the TMA categories of each creole, their characteristic distribution in
various types of predicate structure, and their combinatory possibilities. The
investigation will concentrate on the most conservative or "basilectal" variety
of each creole. The data on which the analysis will be based will be collected
from a sample of subjects in at least one rural community in each country using
recordings of natural speech, and direct elicitation techniques, including
questionnaires. The analysis will then be used to test the validity of claims
concerning the uniformity of creole TMA systems and their implications for
creole genesis.
