This is a proposal to conduct an exploratory test of the assumption that
different test development procedures for creating achievement tests in two
languages elicit different kinds of thinking in students, different kinds of
development processes when applied to science and mathematics, and insights on
how to streamline a costly process. Traditional translation procedures raise
concerns that they do not capture student thinking associated with the second
language and culture as much as they do the translator's thinking. The approach
to be explored (CAD) takes into account the finding that student performance is
highly sensitive to wording and context. Thus, as items are developed
independently for say English and Spanish versions the developers try them out
on students and get together to discuss the wording as it relates to language
and culture of the students. The CAD or Concurrent Assessment Development is
proposed as a promising strategy for assessment that captures student thinking
without a lessened cultural and language bias while maintaining fidelity to
psychometric principles and a structured shell or test specification guide used
by both the new CAD approach and conventional translation approaches.
