9502795 Osisanya Wellbore instability in shale formations is a costly problem in
the oil and gas industry and difficult to assess because it is time- dependent.
One of the keys to maintaining wellbore stability in shale formations is the
ability to reduce mechanical aggravation of the shale which can initiate
wellbore instability during the drilling operation. There are at present no
systematic means to monitor on-site the combined effects of the mechanical
aggravation and drilling fluid rheology. Wellbore stability models currently
applied in the industry cannot account for the wide range of shale compositions
encountered while drilling, and they do not account for changes in the
rheological parameters of the drilling fluid caused by the dispersion of shale
cuttings. The proposed research will develop a systematic approach for solving
wellbore instability problems at the well site. The approach will be based on
correlating results from time-dependent well site shale dispersion and swelling
tests under atmospheric conditions to similar results developed in the
laboratory for various shales under simulated downhole conditions. The
correlations will be used to develop rheology/hydraulics programs. The
corresponding educational plan includes design curricula including a Socratic
approach, and incorporating practical experience into course content and
lectures. ***
