0413746 Coale This award to San Jose State University in California provides
support for the acquisition of oceanographic instrumentation to be used on R/V
Point Sur operated by the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories. Specifically,
support is recommended to acquire a 75 kHz phased array acoustic Doppler current
profiler to upgrade the vessel's capability to measure ocean currents. This
acquisition provides a significant upgrade to the vessel's capabilities, and is
expected to be used by most researchers using R/V Point Sur in their research
during 2004 and future years. ***
