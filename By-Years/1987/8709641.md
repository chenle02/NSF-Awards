In this research Nygaard will study Galois representations of Siegel modular
forms of degree 2 and weights 3, at first in the special case of level 4 but
hopefully later on in more generality. The motives occur in the cohomology of
Siegel modular varieties but are exposed in the cohomology of some much simpler
3-folds. These 3-folds are constructed using the theta formulas of Riemann and
are simple complete intersections of quadrics. As a consequence of the existence
of these motives we find Andrianov L-functions as factors in the Hasse-Weil Zeta
function of the Siegel modular 3-fold. Modular forms are analytic functions
which encode number theoretic information allowing the researcher to use the
deep tools of analysis to solve number theoretic functions. In this research
modular forms attached to objects in algebraic geometry further enrich this
technique. The P.I. poses some very exciting problems and will surely be
successful in his endeavors.
