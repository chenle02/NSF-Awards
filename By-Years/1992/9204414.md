This project involves the analysis of number theoretic algorithms. Specifically,
the following three problems will be studied: o Determined explicity bounds
useful in the analysis of certain number theoretic algorithms under the
assumption of the extended Riemann hypothesis. o Determine and precisely analyze
the worst-case and average-case behavior of some algorithms for computing
greatest common divisors. o Precisely analyze and compare several prime number
sieves, including Pritchard's sublinear wheel sieve. Undergraduate students will
participate in this research by helping in the design and implementation of
algorithms associated with the last two problems listed above.
