Changes in cell-cell adhesion play a critical role in embryonic development.
There are numerous examples in development in which cells undergo a transition
from an epithelial (strongly adherent) state to a mesenchymal (weakly adherent)
state, and vice versa. Clearly, an understanding of how such
epithelia/mesenchymal transitions are regulated is necessary for a proper
understanding of tissue formation in embryogenesis. Epithelial/mesenchymal
transitions generally result from inductive events in the embryo, so signal
transduction via cell surface receptors is likely to play a role in the process.
Pagliaccio (Pag) is an Eph-class receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that is
expressed in Xenopus embryos in a highly localized set of tissues, including a
subset of cranial neural crest cells, which are mesenchymal in nature. When Pag
catalytic activity is activated ectopically in early embryos, cells
disaggregate. The hypothesis to be tested in the proposed project is that the
normal function of Pag in Xenopus embryos is to negatively regulate cell
adhesion, thereby playing a role in effecting epithelial to mesenchymal
transitions. The hypothesis will be tested by examining the cellular effects of
Pag catalytic activity. Experiments will be performed to determine whether
epithelial cells (both in culture and in embryos) in which Pag has been
activated adopt a mesenchymal phenotype, express mesenchymal-specific markers,
and exhibit a rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton.
