One of the most important situations where chaotic behavior occurs is in systems
with transversal homoclinic points. Moreover, this is almost the only instance
for which the presence of chaotic dynamics can be rigorously established. In
this project Professor Palmer and Kocak will 1) Enlarge the class of equations
where the existence of transversal homoclinic points can be proved rigorously;
2) Develop numerical methods for the detection of transversal homoclinic points
in specific equations; 3) Analyze the accuracy of numerically computed orbits of
dynamical systems, and investigate the role of hyperbolicity therein. The
mathematical development will provide insight into the behavior of physical and
biological systems in which seemingly random dynamics are actually governed by
deterministic natural laws.
