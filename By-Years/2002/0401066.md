Dr. Huterer is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship
to carry out a program of research and education at the Center for Cosmological
Physics at the University of Chicago. The dominant theory behind the recent
discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe involves a mysterious
component called dark energy. The nature of dark energy and the physics
mechanism responsible for its existence remain one of the central questions of
cosmology and particle physics. Dr. Huterer's research program will both explore
existing and develop new mathematical methods aimed to understand properties of
dark energy. In particular, Dr. Huterer will (1) study theory uncertainty in
weak gravitational lensing, leading to the derivation of theory accuracy
requirements for upcoming observational surveys, (2) build phenomenological
models to help explain why dark energy becomes dominant only at low redshifts,
and (3) propose new methods for studying dark energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr.
Huterer will also carry out an educational program of interactive lectures and
activities, tailored specifically for urban middle school students at North
Kenwood/Oakland Charter School on Chicago's south side. Dr. Huterer will help to
develop curriculum for a cosmology unit as part of the school's General Science
program, organize and teach after-school science labs, and mentor students on a
weekly basis. Dr. Huturer will also help to organize the annual Yerkes Summer
Institute workshops at Yerkes Observatory in Wisconsin, in which the majority of
participants are urban Chicago high school students.&lt;br/&gt;
