This project is designed to determine the effects of small alloying additions
on the mechanism of high temperature creep cavitation and intergranular
fracture. A model nickel-20% chromium alloy containing trace additions of
cerium, boron, zirconium and magnesium will be used in this study. The specific
research objectives include: (1) determination of the effects of trace elements
on high temperature creep flow, cavity nucleation, intergranular fracture, and
ductility; (2) determination of kinetics, mechanisms of grain boundary sliding
and of stress relaxation phenomena by means of internal friction; measurement of
cavity nucleation rates and associated parameters particularly with
determination of surface free energies. The results will be analyzed and
compared to models of cavity nucleation, creep rupture time and ductility.
