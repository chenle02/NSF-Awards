This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project will develop and
deliver an indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) active pixel focal plane array (FPA)
capable of phase sensitive detection. The FPA will be sensitive to the short-
wave infrared (0.9 `m to 1.7 `m) making it suitable for use with eye safe
lasers. Each pixel of the FPA will act as a lock-in amplifier allowing the
imager to detect low power modulated signals in the presence of high background
illumination. &lt;br/&gt; This functionality will be useful in search and rescue
operations by enabling detection and location of a low power signal beacon. In
tracking applications it will dramatically reduce the power of the eye-safe
laser required for operation in a sunlit background. Important commercial
applications include near infrared spectroscopy. The phase sensitive imaging
technology that will emerge from this program will represent a substantial
advance and will be applicable to all spectral bands. &lt;br/&gt;
