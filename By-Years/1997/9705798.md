Most people agree that Euclidean space is flat and that the Lebesgue measure in
Euclidean space is doubling (i.e the volume of the ball of radius 2r is bounded
above by the volume of the ball of radius r). Toro will investigate the
relationship between these two notions: flatness and doubling. She will show the
extent to which these two concepts are deeply intertwined. One of the main goals
of this project is to show that there exists an equivalence between the doubling
properties of a measure and the flatness of its support. Some of the questions
discussed here fit naturally into the framework of free boundary regularity
problems with weak boundary conditions. In order to address the questions
described in this proposal tools from partial differential equations, harmonic
analysis and geometric measure theory are needed. The ideas discussed here
belong to a larger project that intends to establish that weak notions of
regularity are for many purposes sufficient to answer basic questions in
analysis and geometric measure theory. Free boundary problems arise naturally in
physics and engineering. The free boundary may appear as the interface between a
fluid and the air, or water and ice. In the filtration problem, which studies
how water filtrates from a dam made of a porous medium (say earth), the free
boundary separates the wet part from the dry part. Many people are concerned
with the question of the regularity of the free boundary. In this proposal the
investigator addresses the question of the regularity of the free boundary for
the obstacle problem. This problem has been studied by Alt and Caffarelli among
others. Their hypothesis restrict the sort of obstacles that can be considered.
In this project a larger class of obstacles is allowed with the hope that the
potential results will cover a broader spectrum of physical problems.
