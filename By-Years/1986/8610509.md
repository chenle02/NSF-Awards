This project involves experimental and theoretical transport property studies
along with associated phase equilibrium studies by classical and NMR techniques
to provide fundamental information useful in the development of carbon dioxide-
Enhanced Oil Recovery techynology. The project focuses on NMR imaging of
multiphase flow through porous media. Fundamental transport properties measured
are: the high pressure viscosities, diffusion, and self-diffusion of carbon
dioxide-hydrocarbon model systems at high pressures. The development of new
relationships between macroscopic thermodynamic transport properties and NMR
responses such as spin-lattice (T1), spin-spin (T2), and spin density parameters
are in order.
