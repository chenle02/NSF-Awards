This dissertation project is a study of the co-management of the Porcupine
Caribou Herd in Canada. The focus of the research is on community involvement in
co-management decision making and its relationship to the sustainability of
human-caribou relations. Shared Native-government authority in resource
management is addressed with common property theory and the sociology of
organizational democracy. This dissertation will study how the implementation of
co-management has changed decision making at the community level, what factors
influence community involvement and management outcomes, and how community
members evaluate their involvement. Methods for data collection include
participant observation, semi-structured interviews and the analysis of
community documents.
