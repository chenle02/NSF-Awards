This project will investigate a crucial aspect of the integration of technology
into financial market architecture: the automation of the trade execution
process itself. The output from the project could be of substantial practical
benefit, possibly helping to lead to necessary changes in the ways U.S. capital
markets are structured. Information will be collected on the workings of the
algorithms in automated markets that determine prices and quantities from offer
information. These systems and existing trading practices will be compared with
sets of theoretical benchmarks.
