The TransLight project proposes to build on existing connections developed over
the past 7 years. TransLight has two major components proposed separately:
Translight/Starlight for connections in Chicago, New York, and Amsterdam, and
TransLight/PacificWave serving connections between Seattle and Los Angeles and
key countries around the Pacific Rim. This proposal deals specifically with
Pacific Wave (PW). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal funds equipment and
services to support multiple "landing points" on the West Coast for high speed
connections to the Pacific Rim. Specifically, exchange points at the Pacific
Northwest Gigapop in Seattle, and the "LAAP" exchange point in Los Angeles.
These points-of-presence will support the homing of two 10-Gigabit per second
circuits connecting Australia's R&amp;E communities through Hawaii, with
physical connectivity at the exchange points allowing flexible uses and sub-
layer configurations ranging from the network layer down to the physical layer.
Through these connection services, the U.S. R&amp;E community will have high-
speed and robust connectivity from the U.S. mainland through Hawaii and to
Australia. The proposal claims their approach is based not just on backbone
connectivity, but end-to-end connectivity to lead with new technologies and
stimulate collaborations, especially with leading domain scientists at end
sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
