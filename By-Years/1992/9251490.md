This project will equip a departmental computer graphics laboratory with several
color workstations. This will enable the department to make computer graphics a
regular part of the computer science curriculum, to use advanced color graphics
in other courses in computer science and mathematics (such as discrete
structures and complex analysis), and to offer students doing independent work a
facility well suited to research in computer graphics.
