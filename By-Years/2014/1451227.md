The 10th International Conference on emerging Networking EXperiments and
Technologies (CoNEXT) will take place December 2-5, 2014, in Sydney, Australia.
This award provides support for 10 US-based graduate students to attend this
conference. Participation in conferences such as CoNEXT forms a central part of
the graduate school experience, providing students with an opportunity to
interact with more senior researchers and exposing them to leading-edge research
in the field. ACM CoNEXT stands unique in its emphasis on interactions between
networking researchers at an international level, and attending CoNEXT presents
an excellent opportunity for US graduate students to connect with the thriving
international research community. As in past years, CoNEXT 2014 will include a
special student workshop, allowing students to present present their work in
progress, receive feedback on their work, and obtain valuable experience in
writing and presenting technical papers. The support enables students, who would
otherwise be unable to attend to participate in the main conference and
associated workshops at CoNEXT 2014.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
integrates research and education of students through exposure to a premier
technical meeting in computer networks and communications. Students will have
the opportunity to observe high-quality presentations and interact with senior
researchers in their field, both in the main conference and the associated
workshops, and their inclusion will have a positive impact on the quality of
their research. Women and other minorities will be especially encouraged to
participate. The CoNEXT conference has developed into a top-tier international
conference, presenting a tremendous opportunity to students to expand their
knowledge of the field.
