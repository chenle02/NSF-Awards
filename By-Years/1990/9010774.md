This research addresses the communication structure of MIMS (multiple
instruction, multiple data) distributed memory parallel computer systems. The
goal of this work is to develop fault tolerant structures for high capicity, low
latency interprocessor communication that significantly reduces the system
complexity from current interconnection techniques. The proposed method to
achieve this objective is through the incorporation of optical interconnections.
Data packets are routed through intermediary nodes in current distributed memory
systems. The latency incurred at each step due to the buffering, address decode,
routing and transmission is significant. Care must be taken by communicating
processes so the latencies are not severe. Self-routing single-step optically
interconnected communication structures can be designed through the
incorporation of agile laser diode sources and wavelength tunable optical
filters in a wavelength division multiple access environment. This allows
multiple high-bandwidth channels on a single physical link.
