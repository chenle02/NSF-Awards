9503904 Menendez This specialized high resolution double monochromater will
benefit several research groups conducting fundamental materials research that
is technologically important. The instrument will be used to develop new
semiconductor characterization techniques such as stress-induced optical- phonon
energy splitting in silicon-based devices, the study of damage in gallium
arsenide structures, the characterization of semiconductor materials for visible
light emissio, the measurement of acoustic-phonon energies, and studies of
isotopic and crystal field phonon splittings in fullerene solids. This work is
expected to provide a detailed picture of phase transitions in these materials
and will make a substantial contribution to the investigations of fundamental
problems in solid-state physics such as localization.
