The research is on linking tools for formal verification of IC designs and those
to those used for simulating and fabricating the designs. The PI is working with
a verification environment (Hol), a set of design tools based on a hardware
description language (Bolt), and a simulation language (Nova). Research being
undertaken includes: (1) find a theoretical basis for the translation between
the behavioral (verification tool) and structural (design tool) models; (2)
develop a formal semantics for Bolt and embed the formal semantics into the Hol
system; (3) develop common abstraction mechanisms for Bolt and Nova; investigate
parameterized, generic models for circuits to serve as a guide to translation
between the verification model and the design tools; develop software for
carrying out the combined design and verification process.
