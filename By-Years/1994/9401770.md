9401770 Batiza This award provides partial funding for the acquisition of an
inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) system to be installed and
operated in the School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology at the
University of Hawaii. The institution is committed to providing the remaining
funds necessary for the acquisition. The instrument will be used to measure the
concentration of elements and isotopes in a wide variety of natural solid and
fluid samples. Approximately 30 research scientists will make use of the
instrument's rapid and accurate chemical analytical capabilities in their
research. Their research includes projects in the general fields of: (1) mid-
ocean ridge processes, (2) processes in active back-arc basins and island arcs,
(3) mantle plumes and hotspots, (4) deep interior of the Earth, (5)
extraterrestrial materials, (6) marine mineral deposits, (7) marine particulates
and sediments, (8) atmospheric particulates and sediment trap materials, (9)
hydrothermal processes, and (10) Ocean drilling related research. ***
