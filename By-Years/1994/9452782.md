9452782 Zollman A series of units is created for use in high school physics
courses that provide a way to learn quantum mechanics without detailed knowledge
of higher level mathematics. The topic is introduced by discussions about and
experiments related to quantum devices, such as scanning tunneling microscopes
and tunnel diodes, that are rapidly finding their way into modern technology.
The approach will include hands-on activities related to the devices as part of
exploration activities in the materials. The units will combine written
materials, interactive computer programs, computer simulations, and digital
multimedia.
