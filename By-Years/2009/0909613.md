This project involves the use of the cascade cyclization reactions of the highly
unsaturated benzannulated enyne-allenes as a key step for the synthesis of bowl-
shaped (buckybowls) and basket-like (buckybaskets) polycyclic aromatic
compounds. The overall strategy involves first constructing precursors
containing multiple tetrahedral sp3-hybridized carbons. The presence of these
tetrahedral sp3-hybridized carbons causes several parts of the molecules to be
in close proximity to one another, allowing further connections to form carbon-
carbon bonds by mild solution-phase chemistry leading to buckybowls and
buckybaskets. A success of the proposed synthetic schemes would provide easy
access to a variety of such compounds not readily accessible by other methods.
In addition, helical heteroaromatic compounds will also be synthesized for
helical supramolecular assemblies and asymmetric
catalysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award the Organic and Macromolecular
Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Kung K. Wang of the
Department of Chemistry at West Virginia University. Professor Wang's research
efforts have focused on the use of unsaturated systems for the construction of
nonplanar organic molecules having unusual architectures. Many of these
molecules could possess interesting material properties or biological
activities. Successful development of the synthetic methodology will have an
impact on the manufacturing processes of the chemical and pharmaceutical
industries.
