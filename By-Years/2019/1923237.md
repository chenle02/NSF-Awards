The travel award supports US participation in the 13th Scientific Committee on
Antarctic Research (SCAR) International Symposium on Antarctic Earth Sciences
(ISAES). Ten interdisciplinary themes are identified including solid earth and
ice interactions, changes in the Southern Ocean, evolution of Antarctic life,
and the history of the Antarctic Ice Sheets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
will provide partial support (airfare and meeting registration) for ~ 25 US
participants enabling them to travel to Incheon, Republic of Korea and attend
the SCAR International Symposium on Antarctic Earth Sciences in July 2019.
Preference will be given to applicants who are students and early career
scientists. The call for applications will be broadly disseminated to encourage
participation by underrepresented groups in the sciences. ISAES is a unique
opportunity for US scientists to present their work to an international
community and address fundamental Antarctic Earth Science questions from an
interdisciplinary perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
