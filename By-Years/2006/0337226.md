Geometrical and material heterogeneities in faults have long been viewed as a
crucial feature affecting earthquake behavior. More recently, the role of stress
heterogeneities has begun to be recognized as a potentially central feature,
particularly with the demonstration that stress heterogeneities alone already
can produce a remarkably rich and complex set of earthquake-like behaviors on
uniform planar faults. What is missing is an understanding of how the two types
of heterogeneities, the static geometrical and material heterogeneities, and the
dynamic stress heterogeneities, might combine and interact to produce even more
realistic behavior.

This research seeks to further develop a line of modeling which extends
elastodynamic simulations to nonplanar geometries. Specifically, the aim is to
develop simulations of rough fault geometries. By studying long sequences of
events on the faults, the dynamical attractor develops, and thus the interaction
of stress heterogeneities with any geometrical heterogeneities can be examined.
As well as developing the technology, we are applying the model to a set of
observations, including normal stress effects, rupture initiation and
termination, and aftershocks. These applications have relevance to understanding
friction better, improving long term hazard estimation based on segmentation,
and short term hazard estimation based on aftershocks.
