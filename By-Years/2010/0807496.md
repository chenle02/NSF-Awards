This team will develop a new numerical scheme for following the transfer of
radiation through the gas within and around galaxies. They will combine methods
that have worked successfully in problems of stellar atmospheres with the
adaptive mesh refinement code ENZO that is adapted for cosmological simulations.
ENZO has been made available for community use. Unlike previous radiation-
transport solvers, this new scheme will treat scattering exactly using
accelerated Lambda iteration with the short characteristic method. Non-LTE
effects (those inconsistent with the approximation of local thermodynamic
equilibrium) in the transport of Lyman-alpha photons will be included. Radiation
will be coupled to hydrodynamics using an operator-split approach. The code
would be used to model the physical state of the gas between the galaxies early
is cosmic history, as it is ionized by primeval stars, and by the active nuclei
of galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All three of the team members will work with
graduate students on this research. The ENZO code is public, and the new
transport solver will be released to the scientific community. &lt;br/&gt;
