This research studies the details of oblique plate convergence in the Sumatran
portion of the Sunda Arc, Sumatra, Indonesia, through analysis of seismic data
from small and moderate size earthquakes of the last 25 years. The proposed
analysis of seismic data, collected at great cost over the years, is state of
the art. The seismic results, especially from the wedge above the subducted
plate, will then be compared with GPS measurements from the area made under
support from other programs. The results of this work should be of great
importance to oil and mineral exploration onshore and offshore in Indonesia. The
work has direct application to the earthquake hazard in the Indonesia area, and
by analog, to the northwestern US, thus being a contribution to the National
Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
