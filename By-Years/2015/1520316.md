The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to combine solar electricity generation and
solar water heating into a single system, in a way that increases efficiency and
reduces the total cost of both solar heat and solar electricity. This has the
potential to make solar water heating financially viable in much of the United
States for the first time since the 1980's, while simultaneously improving the
financial viability of solar electricity. In addition, solar heat energy is
cost-effectively stored in on-site hot water tanks, providing a means of using
solar energy without impacting the nation's electric
grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase
I project will advance knowledge of solar concentration optics by introducing a
novel optical system that uses non-imaging optics and opto-mechanics to highly
concentrate sunlight. The photovoltaics (PV) industry has put tremendous
downward pressure on the cost of installing stationary flat panels on commercial
rooftops, but existing solar concentration optics systems do not take the form
of stationary flat panels and cannot leverage these cost reductions. This
project will develop an optical system that fits inside a stationary flat panel
of the same size and weight as a traditional PV panel, and thereby benefiting
from the falling cost of PV installation. The project is a cross-functional
integration of several cutting-edge fields, including non-imaging optics,
advanced optical materials, precision opto-mechanics, embedded controls, and
rapid prototyping. Its objective is to determine the technology's real-world
efficiency. It is anticipated to demonstrate peak sunlight-to-electricity
efficiency of 25% and water heating efficiency of 45%, for a combined efficiency
of 70%. This represents a technological leap forward over the 15%-21% efficiency
of today's solar panels.
