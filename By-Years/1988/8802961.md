The University of Puerto Rico proposes the establishment of a Center for
Tropical and Carribean Research. Researchers at the Center will study the
following areas: Tropical Marine Natural Products, Tropical Terrestrial ecology,
Geology in the Caribbean, and Natural Hazards Mitigation. The tropical marine
ecosystems of the shallow and deep water of Puerto Rico are noted for their wide
environmental and biotic diversity. Similarly, Puerto Rico, along with Hawaii,
has the only other tropical rain forest in the United States. Puerto Rico is
also located within a seismically active plate boundary. All of the factors
provide a logical rationale for Puerto Rico's multidisplinary approach to
research. The Center will be used to motivate minority students at all
educational levels to consider careers in science and engineering. In addition,
the Center will develop strategies to strengthen partnerships with industry and
other major research institutions. This project meets the major goal of the
Minority Research Centers of Excellence (MRCE) program: to increase the minority
presence in science and engineering by making substantial resources available to
upgrade the research capabilities of the most productive minority institutions.
The project will at the same time enable this institution to use research as a
tool to increase the effectiveness of related science and engineering activities
for minority groups in its region. The Center will accomplish this by providing
opportunities for faculty and students at the University of Puerto Rico and
other nearby institutions with sizable minority student enrollments to engage in
meritorious research that leads to publications in refereed journals.
