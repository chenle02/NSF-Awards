This project examines the natural patterns of hydroclimate variability in the
Mediterranean Basin using tree-rings, historical and paleo climate data, and
modeling. The researchers will use a spatially intense multi-century to
millennial-length gridded reconstruction of hydroclimate variability from North
Africa to create a Mediterranean Basin Drought Atlas (MBDA) which would be
compatible with similar atlases for other areas of the Northern Hemisphere. The
analysis of climatic and paleoclimatic data will help identify potential
linkages of Mediterranean climate variability with large-scale patterns of
atmospheric and oceanic variability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts
include international collaboration and outreach, the creation of the MBDA for
the wider science community, and research of relevance to water supply issues.
