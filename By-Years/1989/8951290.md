The new freshman curriculum melds separate courses in mathematics, statistics,
computer science, chemistry, physics, graphical communication, and engineering
design into a sequence of three, twelve (quarter) credit courses. The new
curriculum emphasizes major themes: rate of change, accumlation, work/energy,
conservation, and force, which appear in each of the disciplines. Computer
workstations are envisioned as a unifying and enabling tool with which students,
freed from manual symbolic manipulation and calculator-limited number crunching,
will explore relationships among disciplines, develop problem formulation
skills, and attack realistic problems. The grantee provides funds for this
project that are more than an equal match for the NSF award.
