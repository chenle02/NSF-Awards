Education Development Center, Inc.(EDC), in collaboration with the American
Society for Cell Biology (ASCB), will organize a conference designed to
encourage and support the participation of ASCB members in pre-college science
education reform. This conference will provide a unique opportunity for a group
of scientists to come together with science educators, teachers, school
administrators, and other scientists already deeply engaged in precollege work
to explore the nature of hands-on inquiry science teaching and how practicing
scientists can contribute to national science reform. The conference precedes
the annual meeting of the ASCB in Boston, Massachusetts. Its intensive three day
program is designed for maximum of thirty participants and will include a mix of
experiential sessions, presentations, panels, and discussions. A report
summarizing the conference activities and findings will be produced and
disseminated to the full membership of the Society and to other scientific and
educational audiences. The cost sharing for the conference will be eighteen
percent of the NSF portion.
