This project focuses on the verification aspect in the development of reliable,
fault-tolerant, distributed protocols. High-performance computing technology,
such as distributed real- time systems, high-performance memory systems, wide-
band I/O systems, modular operating systems, high-speed network interfaces,
commodity workstation clusters, and the like, is reliant on an underlying layer
of distributed software (often implemented in hardware), which consists of
suites of protocols for check-pointing, communication, coordination, data
distribution, recovery, and synchronization of distributed components. These
protocols provide a critical software layer for high-performance computing
systems. Having such a standardized layer is crucial to interoperability,
portability,scalability, and reusability of existing software. Unfortunately,
developing reliable software for distributed environments is a notoriously
difficult task. Here reliability refers to pre-committed real-time performance,
dynamic reconfigurability, security, robustness, and high assurance. The
difficulty in producing reliable distributed software is twofold. First,
designing reliable distributed software is extremely challenging. Not only does
the software have to be free from programming errors, but it also has to be
resilient against hardware and software faults. Second, because of the
nondeterministic behavior of distributed environment, it is very difficult to
verify that the software meets its desired specification. The focus of this
project is on the study of algorithms and data structures applicable to the
verification of programs. It draws upon ideas and results from logic, graph
theory, and automata theory, combining both theoretical and experimental
aspects. ***
