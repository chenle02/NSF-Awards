*** ABSTRACT 9660961 Chang This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
project will develop a polarization independent (PI) wavelength division
multiplexing cross-connect (WDMC) for all-optical communication network. At the
core of the WDMC is a multiport acousto-optic tunable filter switch (MAOS). The
salient features of the MAOS include: (a) a single device with multiple optical
ports and a single electrical control input; (b) low drive power, narrow
passband and low sidelobes; (c) capable of simultaneously and independently
switching optical signals at different wavelengths and space division
multiplexing (SDM) channels; and (d) scalable to a large number of channels and
wavelengths. During Phase I, a feasibility model of the PI MAOS will be built
and demonstrated. The system performance and limitations of the N x N WDMC using
the MAOS as the building block will be analyzed. The MAOS can be used as a gain
equalizer for WDM amplifiers, to add a drop switch, and most generally, as a
wavelength routing cross-connect for wideband fiberoptic communication. ***
