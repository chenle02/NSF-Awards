Computerization of the Humboldt State University Vascular Plant
Herbarium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The collection of dried, mounted plant specimens
held in the Humboldt State University Vascular Plant Herbarium provides the most
complete and up-to-date documentation of the flora of the Klamath Bioregion.
This region, encompassing the corners of northwest California and southwest
Oregon, is one of the richest botanical areas in western North America with
&gt;3,500 species, and yet remains poorly documented and explored. This project
will employ undergraduate students over a three year period to enter habitat and
geographical data from the ~ 90,000 herbarium specimens into an on-line
searchable database. The specimen records will then be incorporated into larger
databases maintained by the Consortium of California Herbaria and the Consortium
of Pacific Northwest Herbaria, and made available to the public via their
existing web portals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On-line access to our specimen data
will be invaluable to the state and federal biologists who monitor the many rare
and endangered plants indigenous to the extensive public lands of the Klamath
Bioregion. Specimen data will also assist those engaged in tracking and
curtailing the spread of potentially harmful exotic species. Because most these
specimens are not duplicated at larger herbaria, resource managers will now have
access to critical information regarding the geographical distribution and
habitat preferences of this region?s diverse flora.&lt;br/&gt;
