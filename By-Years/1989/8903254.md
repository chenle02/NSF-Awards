Nitrogen-fixing organisms are especially vulnerable to oxygen damage due to the
oxygen sensitivity of nitrogenase and to the strong reducing conditions required
to fix nitrogen. In legume root nodules, oxygen toxicity is minimized by action
of special defense enzymes including superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase,
monodehydroascorbate reductase and other enzymes of the ascorbate-glutathione
cycle. The main objectives of this research are to characterize the enzymes
involved in oxygen defense, to determine the subcellular localization of these
enzymes, to determine if these enzymes are nodule-specific, and to examine the
criticality of the link between oxygen defense and nitrogen fixation.
Enzymological studies will involve purification and 2-D gel electrophoresis
followed by immunological detection. Purified enzymes will be used to prepare
antisera for immunological detection of subcellular localization using both
light and electron microscopy. Ineffective nodules will be examined for
deficiencies in oxygen defense enzymes. Plants with effective nodules will be
grown in root atmospheres of various oxygen concentrations and the response of
nodule defense mechanisms will be monitored.%%% Legumes provide a substantial
portion of the world's protein without requiring nitrogen fertilizer. The
enhancement of nitrogen fixation in these, as well as other crop plants, is an
attractive alternative to increasing reliance on nitrogen fertilizers. In order
for such improvements to come about we must understand both the biochemistry and
physiology of nitrogen nodule physiology. This research investigates the enzymes
responsible for minimizing oxygen toxicity in these nodules. A better
understanding of these enzymes may allow for their manipulation which may, in
turn, increase crop yields. Furthermore, they may be required for the future
development of new nitrogen-fixing associations in crop species.***//
