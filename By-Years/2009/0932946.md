(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Desert dust aerosols impact the climate
and biogeochemistry. This project seeks to improve our understanding of the
spatial and temporal variability of desert dust and desert response to climate
and human perturbation. It will address the following two questions i) What is
the spatial and temporally varying distribution of desert dust aerosols, with
uncertainty estimates? ii) How have desert dust aerosols changed over the past
130 years and how will they change in the future? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
investigator will: i) improve the simulation of desert dust in the National
Center for Atmospheric Research's Community Climate System Model (CCSM),
including the capability of modeling mineralogy, ii) compile available
observations of mineral aerosol, including in situ elemental aerosol data,
visibility data and remote sensing data over desert dust regions, iii) combine
modeling study with observations using statistical approaches to provide an
estimate of the range of uncertainty in sources, distributions and deposition
that is consistent with available observations for the current climate, iv)
provide model estimates for the locations and type of data where more
observations would be most valuable, and v) provide improved model estimates of
preindustrial to current and future mineral aerosols, as well as the resulting
radiative forcing and climate response (with
uncertainties).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project include
i) improvements in the aerosol formulation in the CCSM, a community model; ii)
improvements in our understanding of desert dust aerosols; iii) the training of
graduate and undergraduate students, iv) wide dissemination of results and
findings in conferences, workshops and refereed literature.
