This project will acquire a facility for state-of-the-art small/wide angle X-ray
scattering (SAXS/WAXS) instrumentation for research, research training, and
integrated research/education activities at the University at Buffalo (UB), The
State University of New York (SUNY). The SAXS/WAXS instrument
probes&lt;br/&gt;differences in electron density within a sample. Analysis of
the data obtained provides structural details at length scales ranging from 0.2
to 100 nanometers. Examples of information to be obtained from SAXS/WAXS are (i)
size and shape of polymers, proteins, and nanoparticles in solution, (ii) non-
uniform (two-phase) structure of materials, and (iii) crystalline periodic
structure of surfactants, polymers or nanocomposites. The SAXS/WAXS instrument
will support high quality scientific research in nanostructured materials
and&lt;br/&gt;related topics, which will result in important advances in the
fundamental understanding of several methods of synthesis of nanoparticles and
nanostructured materials and in the self-assembly of such nanoscopic building
blocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the proposed work will be of two
types: (a) societal impacts and improvements in quality of life due to long-term
implementation of the science and technology developed in commercial
applications; and (b) education and outreach impacts. In education and outreach,
the proposed instrument will be used by numerous graduate students in their
thesis research, as well as by undergraduate researchers. The instrument will
also be used in formal science and engineering courses. Faculty involved in this
proposal will continue their outreach efforts to underrepresented minority
students at the high-school, undergraduate, and graduate levels. Finally, this
facility will be made available to local industry, thus fostering intellectual
connections between industry and academia and contributing to the
local&lt;br/&gt;economy.&lt;br/&gt;
