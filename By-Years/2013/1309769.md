In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, Alexandru Asandei of the University of
Connecticut will develop new methods towards the controlled synthesis of
fluorinated (co)polymers with complex architectures. First, convenient reaction
conditions for the small scale polymerization of fluorinated monomers will be
explored, and novel initiating methods, such radical generation directly from
(fluoro)alkyl halides or hypervalent iodides, will be studied. Second, the
development of catalyzed iodine degenerative transfer controlled radical
polymerization of vinylidene fluoride to obtain "living"-like, narrow molecular
weight distribution fluoropolymers will be examined. Third, the utility of the
proposed chemistry will be demonstrated via the synthesis of well-defined,
fluoromaterials with complex architectures. The broader impacts include advanced
training for graduate and undergraduate students, collaborations with high
school teachers on the development of a workshop with hands-on experimental work
related to polymers and nanotechnology, dissemination via social media of the
demonstrations developed in the workshop, and the broad dissemination of
research results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polymers are long chain organic molecules
and are found in many facets of everyday life that utilize plastics, including
food packaging, structural materials for automotive and aerospace
transportation, and lightweight electronic devices. Polymers that contain the
element, fluorine, (fluoropolymers) are versatile specialty plastics used
anywhere from nonstick coatings, pipe liners, and O-rings for rocket engines to
materials for fuel cell membranes. This research seeks to advance our knowledge
in the synthesis of fluoropolymers and could lead to new types of advanced
materials for a wide range of applications.
