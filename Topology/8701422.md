Long plans to examine several interrelated questions in the theory of low
dimensional manifolds and group theory. The specific problems concern general
hyperbolic 3-manifolds (whether their fundamental groups can be subgroup
separable), the particular case of hyperbolic surface bundles over the circle
(same question, and other specific questions related to the behavior of the
entropy and volume functions), and cobordism of surface automorphisms (whether
there is an algorithm to determine when a lamination is a limit of discs). These
problems are related to Long's established interests in several classical
problems in the theory of hyperbolic manifolds and knot and surface cobordism.
Geometric topological investigations such as these develop methods for analysing
qualitative properties of geometric objects, e.g. knottedness. In some contexts
understanding these properties is every bit as valuable as understanding rigid
metric properties.
