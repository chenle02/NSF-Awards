This proposal is for an equipment grant to replace and upgrade the computer
hardware of UCLA's multi-user Center for Computer- based Behavioral Studies
(CCBS). The software capabilities of the CCBS facility are currently limited by
the operating system associated with the PDP 11/84 minicomputer that services
the facility. Purchase of new computer hardware is needed to convert to a UNIX-
based system that will increase the capacity and flexibility of CCBS as a multi-
purpose facility. Basic social science research projects to be supported by the
new system include a program of research on small-group communication networks
and information exchange; a computer-controlled factorial survey assessing
perceptions of climate change and environmental policies; and a computer-
assisted telephone survey of mutual perceptions of ethnic minorities.
