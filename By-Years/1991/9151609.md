These funds will provide for the acquisition of equipment necessary to teach a
junior/senior level plant physiology course. An upper level cell biology
laboratory course will also benefit from this grant. In this course students
will conduct plant physiology experiments with plants culturally significant to
them or plants of African origin, but not to the exclusion of other plant
species. Students are required to design and run an experiment as a special
class project and report the results in the form of a scientific presentation.
The course will emphasize plant biochemistry, water relations and mineral
nutrition, growth and development, and photosynthesis. Environmental aspects of
plant physiology will be demonstrated as well. Therefore, we are requesting a
centrifuge, spectrophotometer, shaker, balances, pH meter, laminar air flow
hood, a growth chamber, and a thermocouple psychrometer. The presence of this
equipment in our undergraduate program will facilitate the teaching of plant
physiology, enhance our capabilities for undergraduate research, and influence
the career choices of our students.
