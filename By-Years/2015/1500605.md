Karuk is a language of the Karuk Tribe, a federally-recognized tribe situated on
the middle course of the Klamath River in northwestern California. Karuk is well
known for its complex accentual system such as the rules in English (PHOTOgraph
versus photoGRAPHic), its unique patterns of word and sentence formation. Thus
more data on this language will help with understanding more about its
grammar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Susan Gehr of Humboldt University, along with a
Karuk Language Program Coordinator and 20 community participants, will create an
archival repository of Karuk materials, making them searchable and accessible in
perpetuity. The materials to be archived include data from the Karuk Tribe's
Language Program and materials donated by community members. These unique data
will then enrich current knowledge of this highly endangered
language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While there are just five elderly known fluent
speakers of the Karuk language, there is an active community of Karuk people
documenting the fluent speakers of Karuk and publishing Karuk texts, audio and
video. Gehr will hold four workshops where she will share state-of-the-art
techniques in archiving and preservation methodologies to community members with
the view to supporting sustainable archiving practices in the community. The
project will not only create infrastructure in the Karuk community, it also
provided an example of how to do this with community. This project will also use
best practices from the archival profession to produce a freely available
collection guide for the Karuk language materials created and collected by the
Karuk Tribe's Language Program.
