This research addresses the creation of efficient algorithms for incrementally
re-placing and re-routing small portions of a VLSI circuit to correct problems
such as signal integrity, speed and high heat density that have been discovered
therein via simulation. The challenge is to quickly re-layout only the affected
portion of the circuit, while minimizing any layout changes of the much larger
unaffected part of the circuit in order to capitalize on the enormous resources
and time already spent on the physical design of the chip, to retain the already
optimized features of the design, and to meet time-to-market
requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algorithms for both regular VLSI chips and
field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are being addressed in this project. For
the incremental placement problem, a min-cost network-flow based algorithm is
being investigated using both deterministic and probabilistic edge costs. In the
incremental routing realm, the following areas are being researched: (a)
Algorithms for constraint-driven "bump-and-refit" (this allows exploration of
solution spaces with different sets of constraints like upper bounds on the
increase in net lengths and/or delays, on the number of vias, and on crosstalk
coupling). (2) Performing incremental global and detailed routing in one
consolidated framework in order to obtain better optimized routings. (3)
Incremental Satisfiability (SAT) methods and their application to incremental
routing. (4) Various additional issues and solution techniques needed for
incremental routing of VLSI circuits.&lt;br/&gt;
