This research project resides in the field of geotechnical engineering and
groundwater resources. The problem addresses the efficiency of near surface
aquitards (a relatively impermeable layer comprised of glacial sill or alluvial
silt) to retard the entry of hydrocarbons into shallow confined aquifers. The
proposed effort involves the study of the pattern and parameters of immiscible
(non-mixable) fluid flow near the interface between two strata with moderately
dissimilar permeabilities (hydraulic conductivity). A hydraulic gradient causing
lateral flow is implanted in the lower, more permeable stratum. The effects of
relative permeability and varying artesian pressure on the movement of immisable
fluids at strata interfaces and the resulting vertical distribution of the
containment within the aquifer are the central focus of this investigation. The
subsurface environment will be modelled in a clear rectangular container as a
confined aquifer. To simulate localized contamination of the confined aquifer,
the penetration of an immisicible fluid (probably kerosene for safety reasons)
will be permitted to penetrate a small area of the aquitard. This study will
extend flow analysis to stratified subsurface environment subject to flucuating
flow pressures and velocities which better approximates in-situ conditions.
