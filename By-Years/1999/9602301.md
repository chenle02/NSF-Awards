Saint Joseph College, located in Connecticut, was founded in 1932 to assist
women in obtaining higher education. Constructed in 1936, McDonough Hall, home
to Department of Natural Sciences, remains as initially constructed without any
modifications. Dedicated research and research training facilities are
unavailable for faculty and students to pursue their research interests. ARI
funds will be used to convert an outdated laboratory into a modern undergraduate
research and research training facility for students in Biology, Chemistry, and
Environmental Science. An existing instrumentation room will be remodeled and
reconfigured to accommodate additional research equipment. Current spaces used
for research and training activities will be relocated and consolidated in the
new laboratories. Renovations will include the demolition and removal of all
existing benches, fume hoods, sinks, and lighting, and the installation of new
plumbing, ventilation, fume hoods, and other fixed equipment. Interactive space
designed for cooperative research will enhance discussions and facilitate
multidisciplinary research among students and faculty. Both labs will be in
compliance with ADA and safety regulations. It is anticipated that more students
will be exposed to science as they see firsthand research being conducted in the
renovated space. Upon completion, it is projected that the number of students
that can be accommodated in the new labs will increase three-fold. This project
is integral to the Department's efforts in delivering a quality undergraduate
research program, and will have a significant impact on the undergraduate
research experience at St. Joseph College.
