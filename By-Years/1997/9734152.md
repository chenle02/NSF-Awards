Many database applications today are no longer I/O bound but memory bound -
during transaction processing applications, the CPU wastes approximately 80% of
its cycles waiting for fetches from memory. Thus a 5 fold speed up is possible
if cache misses are eliminated entirely, and with clock speeds continuing to
grow, the available speed up will grow as well. Thus the goal of this research
is to build significantly faster database management systems (DBMSs) by (1)
developing analytical models of the interaction between different database
structures (i.e. indexes, tables) and the memory hierarchy, (2) identifying
those structures that are causing the most stalls, (3) synthesizing new
structures and algorithms that are more "cache friendly", and (4) verifying the
new designs through low level performance studies on a real system. The results
of this project will help ensure that database performance scales with the ever
increasing speed of processors and density of memory chips. The educational goal
of this project is to develop a project based curriculum for database systems.
Instead of using a scaled down "teaching" system, students learn to use and
extend commercial DBMSs through standard interfaces like JDBC and OLE DB, which
gives them practical skills as well as teaches them to write and debug code that
is part of a large complex system.
