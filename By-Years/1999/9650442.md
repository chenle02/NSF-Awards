This project concerns the purchase of an atomic absorption spectrometer, which
has the capability of both flame and graphite furnace atomization. This
instrument can be used in a wide variety of introductory courses, both major and
nonmajor, as well as in upper division courses and undergraduate research.
Because atomic absorption is such a widely accepted method, students are
learning how modern instruments are used in analytical and environmental
laboratories in the 1990s, including computer interfacing and control.
Specifically, experiments are planned for the Environmental Chemistry and
Perspectives in Nutrition nonmajor courses; Equilibrium and Analysis and General
Chemistry (Accelerated) Laboratory science major introductory courses; and the
Inorganic/Physical Chemistry Lab, Instrumental Analysis, and student/faculty
research projects in the upper-division courses. It is important that both
introductory and advanced students get first-hand experience with this
instrument in order to understand the advantages and limitations of the atomic
absorption method. The graphite furnace enables detection of many elements in
the parts per billion to trillion range, which is the level of occurrence of
trace metals in many environmental and biological samples.
