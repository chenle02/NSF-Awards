The propose is to build an experimental software system to test the feasibility
of mathematically formalizing physically realizable microprocessor architectures
and to test the feasibility of mechanically checking the correctness of system
software written in microprocessor machine language for such microprocessors.
Although in principle such formalization and checking are possible, they are
widely suspected to be practically infeasible. However, a few recent experiments
do demonstrate that a new approach of directly formalizing a machine
architecture as a mathematical function in a mechanized logic offers promise. A
substantial fraction of a commonly used processor has been formalized and
several machine code programs have been rigorously checked mechanically. The
initial prototype of the system will be used (a) to test the feasibility of
proofs of compiler correctness and (b) to explore the development of a
formalized programming environment for system software, with focus on such
issues as formalizing memory management and rigorously demonstrating performance
figures. The experiment will involve formalizing, in a mechanized logic, the
user instruction set of several commonly-used microprocessors, and will also
involve formalizing the semantics of some system traps. The work will explore
new areas in formalization, including cache consistency, memory protection, and
interrupts. The machine architecture issues of proving correct high level
language compilers. will also be explored.
