offer a series of five one-week Engineering Education Scholars Workshops - "New
Century Scholars: Teaching, Learning, and Your Academic Career" ( one each
summer, beginning in 1998. These workshops are designed to help new engineering
faculty from around the country understand learning and teaching practices which
support effective learning among all students. The workshops are also designed
to help faculty integrate this knowledge with other forms of scholarship,
recognizing the multiple demands for faculty productivity, so that they will be
able to practice effective teaching.
