This is an exciting and timely project on international financial institutions.
The project continues to develop a general theory of international financial
institutions as a response to the imperfect ability of contracting agents to
enforce international agreements. This theory provides new insights into such
important issues as the international debt crisis. The investigator's past work
in this and related areas is responsible for a number of valuable insights into
international finance. He is capable of continuing this research. The limited
incentive to enforce agreements with foreign agents constitutes a significant
imperfection in world capital markets. Various institutions that are engaged in
the international transfer of resources have emerged as a partial response to
this imperfection. Banks, multinational corporations, and reserve and vehicle
currencies are three examples. The contribution of this project comes in
developing a general theory for these institutions. In particular, the
reputations of these institutions may allow their equity owners (or central
banks, in the case of reserve currencies) to enter into contracts that are self-
enforcing. The reputation of a private bank, may allow it to make credible
commitments to repay deposits and to penalize borrowers in default. A
multinational corporation may be able to enter into long-term relationships with
creditors and employees, and to provide a more efficient level of product
quality than would be possible for an anonymous individual agent. Finally, some
governments may more credibly promise to desist from imposing the inflation tax
than others. The ability of particular national economies to support
institutions capable of undertaking these tasks can be related to fundamental
aspects of their dynamic behavior derived from intertemporal preferences and
technologies.
