0225528&lt;br/&gt;Maloberti&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The generic autonomous platform
for sensor systems, GAP4S, project aims at the development of a basic platform
for sensor systems with on-board micro-battery remotely rechargeable via a
MicroWave (MW) signal, full-duplex wireless Radio Frequency (RF) and MW
communications, power-aware and reliable protocols. The sensing modules will
ensure mobility without demanding huge communication and processing bandwidth.
Moreover, the wireless interconnection shall be responsible for getting and
supplying data and power in a reliable, secure, programmable manner. Power will
be wireless received (microwaves) by the module, transformed, stored in an
integrated battery. Power consumption of all the electronics will be reduced
significantly with respect to present levels and the functionality will be
managed on the basis of the amount of energy available and received. The sensor
nodes will be in the footprint (with medium radii, e.g., 100 m) of a (mini)
base-station that will be the entry point of a wider communication
network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will experimentally demonstrate the
co-integration of multi-sensors (optical and humidity) with a general-purpose
analog interface, a digitally programmable data converter, and a smart power
management section. Moreover, the project will integrate a SiGe RF uplink module
with optimum control of the transmission power and with data recovery from the
MW powering flow. Also, the project will identify and implement power-aware and
reliable protocols that span across the wireless sensor network and the existing
network infrastructure, namely the Internet. The feasibility of on-board multi-
GHz antenna will be verified.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
