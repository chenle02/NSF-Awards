The proposed project belongs to the field of dynamical systems, which is the
study of long-term trajectories of movements that take place over time in a
geometric space and are governed by a fixed set of mathematical rules. The
theory of dynamical systems has its roots in celestial mechanics and has become
an important tool in many other scientific fields. The proposed research deals
with the question of whether a given dynamical system has rigidity properties,
namely whether different trajectories must display a lot of common patterns. The
principal investigator will conduct research on the topic, collaborate with
other researchers, work with graduate and undergraduate students, and
disseminate ideas developed in the project. The principal investigator will also
organize seminars and conferences. In particular, the principal investigator
will organize a series of research workshops for undergraduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will try to determine properties of
certain classes of dynamical systems of group theoretical or number theoretical
origins. One of such classes are actions on smooth manifolds by higher-rank
commutative groups or by lattices in higher-rank semisimple Lie groups. These
actions are often expected to have rigidity, a phenomenon characterized by the
scarcity of invariant structures under the action. Another proposed line of
research is the study of some special cases of the Mobius disjointness
conjecture. These include certain distal topological systems and other systems
whose trajectories have strict patterns in sufficiently long term. The
approaches in the proposed research will use ideas from ergodic theory, smooth
dynamics, representation theory and number theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
