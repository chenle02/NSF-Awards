This standard grant will provide partial support for two graduate students to
supervise the construction and commissioning of the ICEBall-2 mini-orange
spectrometers within the Gammasphere array, a premier detection system used by a
large consortium of nuclear-structure physicists. This large gamma-ray detector
array is used to study the complex level structure of nuclei in order to
understand the underlying nuclear structure. The mini-orange spectrometers allow
measurements of internal conversion electrons, which result from electromagnetic
transitions between levels for which there is no change in angular momentum,
which typically arise from interband transitions. Observing these transitions
thus allows a more complete understanding of the level schemes. The research
using this device will be performed at the ATLAS facility at Argonne National
Laboratory.
