9316972 Kundu This effort continues research at the University of Maryland
centered around the study of solar flares using radiowave techniques. The
investigators will use observations made by the Very Large Array (VLA) of the
National Radio Astronomy Observatory, and the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland
Millimeter Array (BIMA) at Hat Creek. The investigators will compare the
observed magnetic structure of sunspot-associated microwave sources with model
computations and determine the vertical and horizontal components of the
magnetic field at specific locations in the low corona. The study will also make
use of X-ray and EUV data obtained by the Yohkoh satellite. The combined data
will be used to estimate the electron temperature and magnetic field in coronal
loops, and the temperature and density structure of the active region in three
dimensions. VLA observations of flares at multiple centimeter wavelengths will
be used to study the structure and cause of flaring. The BIMA observations will
provide high spatial resolution measurements of flares at millimeter
wavelengths. In particular, the millimeter imaging observations of MeV electrons
will be used to study gamma ray sources sizes, structures and locations. The
similarity of time profiles of impulsive emission by MeV electrons will permit
us to analyze the fundamental characteristics of the acceleration mechanism
responsible for MeV electrons. The delay of millimeter emission relative to cm,
hard X-rays and gamma rays will provide important information on electron and
proton acceleration. Additionally, the investigators will search for nanoflares
and acoustic waves in the Sun's chromosphere and study chromospheric and coronal
heating.***
