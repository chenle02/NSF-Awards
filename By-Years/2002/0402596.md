This project is expanding an existing project to add six new schools to this
distance-learning effort to teach electronics courses to students in remote,
rural high schools. This expansion enables the investigators to reach
significantly more students and to validate the emerging distance-delivery model
on a broader scale. The project is providing professional development for
teachers in the selected high schools, most of the equipment and supplies
required for student participation, internships and field experiences for
students and teachers, dual enrollment options, and a model for offering
technical and specialized curricula in a very cost-effective way. An outside
evaluator is assessing the impact of the project on student interest in and
preparation for technical and scientific occupations and the effectiveness of
the distance-learning model. Dissemination plans includes presentations at
regional and national conferences, publication of a paper in the ITEA Journal,
and discussions with targeted state agencies.
