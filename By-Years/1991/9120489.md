In this project in Experimental Physical Chemistry, Professor Donald W. Setser
of Kansas State University will study gas phase reactions involving well-defined
quantum states of both reactant and product molecules. Laser excitation
techniques permit selective excitation of reaction pathways along excited state
potential surfaces. As a new initiative, transition metals reacting with
halogens and with oxygen will be studied by flow reactor methods. %%% It is now
possible to steer the course of chemical reactions by using lasers to direct
atoms and molecules to desired initial energy states. The work of Prof. Setser
(Kansas State University) greatly advances the state of this technique, widening
the scope of "steerable" reactions to include metals important in catalyis.
