The principle investigator has requested travel funds to attend the
International Symposium on Biophysics of Extracellular Potential Fields. The PI
is presently funded in the BRAH Program and this travel will benefit his
research. He has been invited to deliver the opening lecture at the Symposium.
This meeting should be well attended by east european scientists and therefore
is particularly noteworthy. In addition he will attend Bulgarian Academy of
Sciences and other institutions in Sofia. He is also planning to visit the
Biomedical Engineering Division of the Department of Electrical Engineering at
Twente University of Technology (The Netherlands). Funding is recommended.
