9732887 Sankar Numerical and analytical models, guided by the understanding of
the physics, are developed to predict the effects of translaminar reinforcements
(TLR) on the fracture toughness of composite laminates. The effectiveness of the
reinforcements is characterized both at material scale and structural
scale.These studies aid in the design of laminated structures including the
selection of TLR materials and their areal fraction. ***
