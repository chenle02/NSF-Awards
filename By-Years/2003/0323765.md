In simulating the resource cycles in general queuing networks, the system state
can be represented by integer arrays. Running these simulations amounts to
increasing and decreasing the values of elements in these arrays at specific
event times. The dynamics of many of these simulations can be formulated as
linear and mixed-integer programs. The solutions to the mathematical programs
are identical to the state trajectories generated by running the simulation. The
variables in these mathematical programs are the event times. Relationships
between system events constrain these event times. The objective of the
mathematical program, like in a system simulation, is to execute events as soon
as possible subject to the constraints imposed by the logic and dynamics of the
system. The project objective is to produce a methodology for modeling discrete
event dynamic systems as combinatorial optimization problems. The approach is
derived from a simulation modeling technique that was developed in an ad-hoc
manner to solve specific large-scale engineering problems. This research will
study the theoretical and practical foundations of this modeling methodology in
a generic context.

Many complex systems, including health care delivery, transportation,
communication and production systems, can be effectively modeled as undergoing
discrete changes that take place when particular events occur. These systems can
be simulated by scheduling events on a computer that mimic the occurrences of
these events in the real system. In this research, discrete event systems will
be modeled using the optimization tools and techniques of operations research.
This will allow the rich theory and algorithms of mathematical and stochastic
programming to be applied to the modeling and analysis of this large and
important class of dynamic systems.
