Many animals generate both intra- and extracellular calcium granule complexes in
one or more of their tissues. Functions for these granules include the buffering
of pH changes, storage of calcium, and binding of heavy metals as a
detoxification system. Drs. Silverman and Dietz have found calcium phosphate
based concretions located extracellularly in the connective tissues of the gill
in freshwater unionids, and these concretions can amount to 50% of the gill dry
weight. The five species examined to date demonstrate concretion mobilization
during reproduction. The PIs have documented that during the mobilization of
concretions, calcium is passed into the water channels of the gills and
incorporated into the shells of developing embryos. This strategy of maternal
nutritive support of (technically externally brooded) invertebrate larvae raises
many questions of general interest. Specifically, the present proposal is aimed
at understanding the mechanisms of synthesis and mobilization of the concretions
and the mechanisms by which calcium is stored and then transferred to the
embryos during shell formation. Elucidating the regulatory role of the
concretion organic matrix, the inorganic structure of the concretions, and the
cells producing concretions will lead to a better understanding of intracellular
biomineralization processes in general. Calcium granules are produced in the
gills of freshwater clams. These granules are composed of calcium and phosphate.
The cells that produce the granules have been identified and are a good model
system for intracellular mineralization processes. Drs. Silverman and Dietz will
study the organic components of the granules, the inorganic structure of the
granules, and the cells involved in mineralization. The PIs will study the
regulatory role of organic molecules on the mineralization process.
Understanding the mechanisms of clam calcium granule formation may lead to a
better understanding of the biological processes involved in formation of
mineralized structures.
