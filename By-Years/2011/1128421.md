The US-Finland Workshop on Wireless Networks will be held in the Finland Embassy
in Washington DC from May 16 to May 17, 2011. There will be approximately 20 US
participants and 20 Finland participants. The objective of this workshop is to
bring together experts in the field of wireless networking from the US and
Finland, as well as funding agency representatives from the NSF, the Academy of
Finland and Tekes, to discuss future research and education collaboration
between the two countries. This proposal requests funds to support 10 US
participants, which will include researchers at various ranks, and will
represent various demographics and races including individuals from under-
represented groups. The workshop is expected to result in the formation of a
long-term research and education collaboration between US and Finland in the
field of wireless networking.
