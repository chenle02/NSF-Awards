A new formal laboratory environment for the introductory computer science
curriculum is developed. The infrastructure for this environment and the focal
point of the effort on this project is a unique software system, DYNALAB, that
supports extensive experimentation in computer science. DYNALAB consists of a
comprehensive library of expertly constructed Pascal programs, a program
animator, and a user interface that makes DYNALAB accessible to the novice.
Students are able to retrieve programs from the library and execute them through
the program animator. Pertinent program execution dynamics are displayed under
user control, including current line of execution, variable and parameter
values, recursive stack mechanisms, statement counts, memory cell counts, and
others. DYNALAB serves as a national model for computer science departments that
are beginning to incorporate formal laboratories into the introductory
curriculum. A series of laboratory manuals replete with experiments based on
DYNALAB and DYNALAB itself are the products of this project.
