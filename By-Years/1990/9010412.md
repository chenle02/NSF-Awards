Automatic garbage collection enhances programmer productivity by eliminating
many of the low-level concerns associated with explicit reclamation of dynamic
objects, by protecting programmers from having to deal with subtle bugs that
result from dangling pointer problems, and by allowing programmers to select
simple algorithms that might otherwise be rejected because of the perceived
complexity of managing the dynamic creation and destruction of many short-lived
objects. The research pursued in this project focuses on: - generalization of an
existing real-time garbage collection algorithm to deal effectively with
arbitrarily long strings of characters and with arbitrarily long arrays of
pointers to other objects. Overlapping substrings and array slices would also be
supported. - design and prototype implementation of a CPU-independent memory
module that executes the generalized real-time garbage collection algorithm in
parallel hardware while application programs run on the host CPU. - analytical
and empirical evaluation of software and hardware prototypes to determine worst-
case and average performance of particular memory management operations. -
development of general techniques to help programmers analyze their real-time
programs in order to pÄ±lace upper bounds on the programs' memory requirement and
on the times required to perform particular memory operations.
