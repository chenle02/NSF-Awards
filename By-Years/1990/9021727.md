This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to the University of Detroit for the
renovation and repair of the Chemistry Building which houses the research and
research training activities of the Chemistry Department. This building was
constructed in 1926 and last renovated in 1965. The ARFMP grant of $200,000 and
$254,400 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize these
research and research training facilities. This project will address the need to
improve the current research infrastructure by modifying the space, electrical
and ventilation systems, and the hood capacity and other furnishings of three
outdated laboratory areas. These modifications will result in the creation of
three new laboratories meeting current health and safety standards which will be
used for (1) chemical characterization and testing, (2) physical measurement and
computation, and (3) polymer synthesis. This award contributes to the
infrastructure of science and engineering by providing an improved environment
for the conduct of research and for the training of undergraduate and graduate
students in a department with a particular commitment to local outreach programs
that are making a clear impact upon the recruitment of students, including
minority students, into chemistry. The renovation will encourage gifted minority
students to go into the fields of science and engineering at the University of
Detroit which has a significant enrollment of Black students.
