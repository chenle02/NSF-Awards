A class of cells found in the nervous system, though not nerve cells themselves
is called glia, from their early presumed adhesive glue-like role to hold cells
together. These glial cells are now known to be important for many aspects of
normal function in the brain. Glial cells and their associated products
participate in fundamental interactions which underline the development and
organization of the nervous system. Insects are widely used as model system for
development, and in insects the first antigen associated with glial cells was a
glycoprotein compound called glionexin or GX, identified in the cricket.
Features of its distribution, spatial and temporal expression, and preliminary
functional tests suggested GX is involved in neural development as an
adhesion/recognition molecule. This work uses antibody probes and microsequence
analysis to screen genetic cDNA libraries from embryonic crickets and adult
Drosophila flies, where we have a lot of genetic information, to isolate and
sequence the gene encoding GX. Identification of the gene will allow new tests
for function of this compound, which in turn will be important for understanding
the complex interactions that guide nerve cell outgrowth during development and
regeneration. The work may lead to better understanding of the evolution of cell
adhesion macromolecules, and will have impact on developmental biology as well
as neuroscience.
