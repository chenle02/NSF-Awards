This project is modernizing and expanding the laboratory component of an
introductory course, Physics of Light and Color. This course is designed to
provide both a quantitative and qualitative understanding of light, color and
visual phenomena to students whose chosen professions make extensive use of
these concepts and techniques. Such professions as graphic arts, fine art,
photography, science education and others increasingly require knowledge of
diverse optical processes and phenomena as computer generated additive color
mixing and holography. This project permits acquisition of modern
spectrophotometers with reflectance accessories. Two color graphics processors
are being used for generating up to 256 colors. Five holography kits allow
creation and examination of holographic images. Using such equipment students
obtain hands-on experience and develop a deeper understanding of the scientific
and technological aspects of color processes and holography. This understanding
and appreciation are enhanced by the use of up-to-date, easy to use, reliable
instrumentation. The University is matching the award with an equal amount of
funds.
