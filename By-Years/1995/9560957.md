This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project will investigate plasma
polymerization as an alternative to spin coating of organic anti- reflective
coatings (ARCs). In this method, the ARC will be formed directly on the
substrate to alleviate the problems associated with spin coating. Phase I will
focus on achieving defect-free, highly conformal coatings on semiconductor
substrates using existing plasma-depositable polymer materials and processes. IC
manufacturers have consistently pursued the use of larger wafer sizes and
smaller device features to improve product yield, reduce unit cost, and increase
on-chip computing power. Reducing substrate reflectivity to less than 1% during
photoresist exposure will be critical for maintaining dimensional control at
these feature sizes. Spin coated ARCs offer excellent reflectivity control but
are limited by uniformity, defectivity, and conformality problems stemming form
the spin coating process. The long term goal of this work is to introduce a
turn-key ARC product package containing: (1) a dedicated deposition tool, (2) a
set of plasma-depositable polymer materials designed specifically for ARC
applications, and, (3) processes for depositing organic ARCs on a variety of key
device structures. The availability of high performance organic ARCs is critical
for the successful implementation of deep UV(248 and 193 nm) microlithographic
processes by U.S. and foreign chip makers over the next 10 years. The
international market for deep UV ARC materials is estimated to grow to $25 MM by
2005. The proposed effort will build a technology platform for assuring the
availability of organic ARC processes after the usefulness of spin coated ARCs
has been surpassed.
