9500211 Wilhelm This award provides funding for research that will establish a
science base for optimizing integer programming formulations of large-scale,
flexible assembly design problems. Design decisions that will be addressed
include prescribing system configuration, for example, flexible lines or focused
factories; strategic aspects such as selecting machines; tactical aspects such
as assigning tasks to machines, selecting tooling and prescribing tool
changeovers; and interfacing with operational issues such as model sequencing
and lot sizing. Specific research objectives are: integrated, state-of-the-art
branch and cut implementation; effective facet generation approach;
computational testing to evaluate the approach; and collaboration with industry,
assuring relevancy and facilitating technology transfer. If successful, this
research will lead to an advanced technology base for assembly by devising new
methods to assure design robustness, incorporating recent advances from the area
of assembly sequence planning, dealing with relevant aspects of design, and
assuring a generic solution approach that can be tailored to application-
specific features. In addition, this research could lead to fundamental advances
in the field of integer programming, improving the capability to solve a broad
range of engineering problems in manufacturing and related areas. ***
