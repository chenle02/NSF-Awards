The Biotechnology Institute, through its Minority and Indigenous Fellows program
will conduct a conference for 40 minority and indigenous students and faculty
(Fellows) and their mentors preceding the 2003 Biotechnology Industry
Organization's annual international convention in Washington, DC. The program is
designed to broaden the information base of research students who are unfamiliar
with industry practices, so that they are better prepared to make important
career decisions. Faculty Fellows have opportunities to interface with industry
colleagues to become better prepared to advise their students and to create
greater opportunities for their students in terms of internships and
collaborations. The two-day conference provides a deeper grounding in new and
emerging technologies, industrial entrepreneurship, and curriculum development
in biotechnology, and related sciences. Fellows are provided with insights into
the practical aspects of biotechnology business, such as the process of drug and
device development, staging of companies, organizational features, R&D drivers,
future prospects, impacts of new technologies, regulatory issues, transitioning
to commercialization, and product cycling. The Biotechnology Institute is
committed to increasing the involvement of underrepresented groups in
biotechnology and related scientific fields. This year, the Institute is
expanding the scope of the program to include a core of researchers from the
biotechnology industry who will make a one-year commitment to act as mentors and
participate with their Fellow at the two-day conference and at the BIO
Convention. The mentorship provides a rich resource of contacts and
opportunities for faculty and student Fellows.
