The University of North Carolina at Charoltte is planning to join the
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) entitled "Center for
Safety, Security, and Rescue Research Center (SSR-RC)" which is a multi-
university center comprised of the University of Minnesota (lead institution),
the University of Denver and the University of Pennsylvania. The Center focuses
on conducting integrative, multi-disciplinary research in autonomous systems to
improve homeland security and emergency response. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed site will enable industry-oriented and application-grounded research
projects, and will pose unusual opportunities for leveraging the research
strengths and diverse expertise of the faculty in robotics, computer vision,
multimedia data processing, networking, interactive visualization, cyber
security, and nursing care in the College of Computing and Informatics (CCI),
College of Engineering (COE), and College of Health and Human Services (CHHS) at
UNC Charlotte. The proposed new site will, therefore, align its mission with the
existing centers mission on SSR and also extend the scope of SSR to healthcare
and manufacturing, focusing on injury prevention, patient care, and assistive
care for the elderly. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed site will develop SSR
technologies useful for key industries, and facilitate fast technology transfer.
The partnerships forged via the proposed site with industries will directly
impact economic development and job creation. The PIs state they would create
opportunities for student training through the IUCRC site's industrial research
projects; and broaden participation via existing STAR Alliance, REU Site
programs and outreach to high schools and the general community at large.
