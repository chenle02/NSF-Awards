The general goal of this project is to develop generative models for images of
natural scenes, as well as associated algorithms for unsupervised learning of
such models from natural images. The learned models can then be used for image
representation and pattern recognition. A particular class of models
investigated in this project are the compositional sparse coding models, where
the images are represented by automatically learned dictionaries of templates,
and each template is a compositional pattern of wavelets that provide sparse
coding of the images. The PI and collaborators also investigate related models
where the templates are inhomogeneous Markov random fields whose energy
functions are defined by the sparse coding wavelets. Image understanding is at
the hearts of many modern technologies. It is also a major function of human
brains. The key to image understanding is automatic discovery of patterns in the
images. The goal of this project is to develop methods for learning dictionaries
of patterns or "visual words" for representing images of our environments. The
learned dictionaries can be very useful for image understanding and object
recognition.
