Why are events with emotional significance remembered with particular
intensity? Current evidence suggests that the autonomic activity that
accompanies emotional experiences in a way that facilitates later recall. A
popular paradigm for investigating this phenomenon is the conditioned heart rate
deceleration that occurs to a stimulus that has become frightening because of
previous association with pain or suffering. With this NSF award, Dr. McCabe
will investigate the changes that occur in neuronal firing as stimuli change
meaning from neutral to frightening and then as they lose their significance
through desensitization. He will use sophisticated neurophysiological techniques
to record from single neurons in two brain areas simultaneously. The information
he gains from studying changes in the firing patterns in these two areas will
identify the steps involved in the neuronal coding of emotional meaning. This
kind of information is crucial for the development of therapies designed to
reverse the effects of early emotional trauma and also to control the abnormal
autonomic reactivity that occurs in many cardiovascular diseases. It will also
prove important for the design of neural nets for information processing,
storage and retrieval.***//
