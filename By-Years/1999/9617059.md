The principal interdisciplinary task of this project is to place contemporary
non-Archimedean mathematical theory within an historical and conceptual context
- within an intellectual tradition in which certain conceptual problems have
been posed and various historical attempts have been made to solve those
problems. The project is concerned with the Robinsonian foundations of non-
Archimedean analysis. Its purpose is to relate non-Archimedean mathematics to
its `archaeology, ` which is of considerable intrinsic historical importance and
of conceptual significance for science studies. Non-Archimedean mathematics
holds out the promise of providing an exciting tool for analysis of a wide
variety of classical conceptual problems of great historical significance in
natural philosophy and the philosophy of mathematics. It is important to
investigate to what degree this promise can be fulfilled. History has shown that
such a contextualization of a formal theory can sometimes play a stimulating
role in its further mathematical development as well as in the development of
possible scientific applications of it
