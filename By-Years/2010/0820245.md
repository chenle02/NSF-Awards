Title: Certification of Medical Device Software

PI: Jens Palsberg Co-PI: Majid Sarrafzadeh

A medical device should not crash or confuse. A device crash can be anything
from inconvenient to life threatening, while confusing device behavior can lead
a user to draw an incorrect medical conclusion. While rigorous testing will
remain essential, new approaches to design, implementation, and certification
have great potential to increase our confidence in medical devices. At the end
of the rainbow in this research area lays a design for certifiability paradigm
in which programmers think of certification from day one and create designs and
code that can be certified by static error checking tools. The project's goal is
to develop languages and tools for designing, building, and certifying medical
device software in elegant and powerful new ways. The project focuses on a
common class of medical devices called medical monitoring devices. The
investigators envision a certification tool that can meet challenges related to
space bounds, soft-real-time response, life time, and meaningful results. The
project's goal is to take a major step towards design for certifiability and to
bring closer the day when the FDA will use static error checking tools
frequently and routinely. One of the outcomes of the project will be open-source
versions of medical device software, along with implementations of the new
language and certification tools. The result is a platform for experimenting
with software for medical devices that may open up new possibilities for
researchers.
