A collaborative research effort between the University of Washington and
University of New Mexico is initiated with this 1- year research award. The
research will combine two ongoing studies on the same site and provide a unique
opportunity to develop research leading to an extensive analysis above- and
belowground for a forest ecosystem. The current studies are hypotheses
concerning the effects of manipulating resource availability (water and/or
nitrogen) on several aspects of carbon allocation between primary production and
secondary metabolites for above- and belowground tissues. The preliminary
research in this 1-year proposal will allow the design of experiments to test
how manipulating resource availability should cause shifts in: above- and
belowground biomass, turnover of fine roots, seasonal patterns of fine root
production nutrient resorption from senescing tissues, quality and quantity of
secondary metabolites in foliage and roots, and mycorrhizal biomass and
turnover. These changes should affect ecosystem processes of herbivory,
decomposition, and net ecosystems production. The collaborating investigators
have excellent individual records and are known to perform well in a
collaborative context. Facilities are excellent as is the field research site.
