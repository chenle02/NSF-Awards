9420628 Boriakoff Dr. Boriakoff and his colleague, Dr. T.V. Smirnova, will
pursue a proof-of- concept investigation of a new observational technique for
measuring the interstellar magnetic field. The field is measured in the
direction of pulsars, and the advantage of this new technique over the
traditional method of measuring Rotation Measure are much higher accuracy and
the absence of need of calibration of the antenna system.
