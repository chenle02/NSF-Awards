9623412 Schmid A CAREER award supports research and education related to
manufacturing tribology. In the research arena a two-phase flow model will be
developed and validated for coolants/lubricants in metals deformation processes,
such as ironing. The model is based on an application of the Reynolds equation
independently to the oil and the water components of the two-phase emulsion and
it then couples them via identical pressure gradient and viscous interaction
terms. In the educational arena the multi-disciplinary approach to design for
manufacturing will be emphasized. ***
