ABSTRACT Song-Ying Li Li is investigating several problems in harmonic
analysis, complex analysis and non-linear partial differential equations. His
project includes the Corona problem in several complex variables. Li will
consider Hankel operators, commutators, composition operators and the complex
Monge-Ampere operator. Li is focusing on the existence, uniqueness and
regularity of solutions of complex Monge-Ampere equations on smoothly bounded
weakly pseudoconvex domains. These results can be directly applied to the study
of the boundary behavior of Kahler-Einstein metrics. The project of Li is aimed
at developing both the theory and application of harmonic analysis, complex
analysis and partial differential equations. The theoretical part of the project
is concerned with several important problems in these fields. The main problems
of this project are strongly related to control theory, mathematical physics,
especially quantum mechanics and approximation theory. The theory of systems
control can be directly applied to Electrical and Computer Engineering and
approximation theory can be used to deal with problems in signal processing.
