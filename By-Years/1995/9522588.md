9522588 Duncan This grant provides $34,650 as partial support of the costs of
acquiring a continuos CO2 laser microprobe extraction system for 40-Ar/39-Ar
geochronology. The extraction system would enable this laboratory to analyze
microgram sized samples thus allowing for single crystal 40-Ar/39-Ar age
determinations and analyses of melt and fluid inclusions. Such a system would
allow these PI's to expand their research on the timing and duration of flood
basalt volcanism, age determination for recently erupted Mid Ocean Ridge Basalts
(MORB's), lunar chronology, dating of mineral separates from flood basalts and
deep-sea fans and single crystal tephrochronology. This laboratory serves as a
regional facility for Ar/Ar geochronology and provides analytical support for a
diverse graduate and undergraduate student community. ***
