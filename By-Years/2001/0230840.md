Tufts University is partnering with four schools in the Malden school district
in Massachusetts on the Tufts Engineering the Next Steps (TENS) project that
focuses on engineering. The primary goals of TENS are: 1) to raise teachers'
knowledge of, comfort with, and capability to teach engineering and algorithm
design, 2) to increase all students' engineering knowledge and skills, 3) to
increase fellows' appreciation for and knowledge about K-12 formal education,
teaching, and outreach, and 4) to develop a grade 5-12 community in four schools
that is supportive of innovations that integrate engineering and algorithm
design. The TENS project focuses on engineering and builds upon an existing GK12
project that worked with a suburban district to explore whether and how teachers
might integrate engineering into their classes. The broader impacts of this
project include expansion of this successful project into a more diverse
setting; good dissemination plans; good university-K-12 collaboration; and an
adequate training program. The fellows and teachers work as partners that
recognize, capitalize upon, learn about and slowly develop some of the expertise
that the other party possesses. This project is partially supported by funds
from the Directorate for Engineering&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title of Project:
