This project focuses on microbial colonization and survival within one of the
newest and most hostile lakes on the planet: Laguna Caliente in the active Poás
volcano in Costa Rica. The creation of nascent, sterile, aquatic environments on
Earth are exceedingly rare; thus, this research is a novel approach in studying
how microbial life can colonize and evolve in a new lake. The project increases
our understanding of habitability on early Earth and Mars, which experienced
equally harsh hydro-volcanic settings with repeated sterilization events. This
extreme aquatic environment on top of an active volcano can reach boiling
temperatures, is more acidic than battery acid, and experiences frequent
eruptions. This research analyzes a time series of samples collected since the
sterilization event utilizing existing protocols. DNA sequencing results will
establish colonization and ecological succession through time. The laboratory
work and subsequent analyses is led by a female undergraduate student. A public
lecture on ‘microbiology at the extreme’ is planned to disseminate novel
research results and the implications for early life on Earth and Mars.

This research explores microbial dispersal, colonization, and ecological
succession in a hostile environment by examining the time-series distribution of
Acidiphilium bacteria across an active volcano. The Poás volcano summit crater
lake was created after the sterilizing magmatic activity waned, allowing the
nascent lake to form in late 2019. Since then, aseptic sampling of the lake
fluids and lake bottom muds has occurred on a roughly two-month cadence,
establishing a time-series of samples. Laboratory investigations of the samples
include 16S rRNA NextGen sequencing and downstream analyses to determine
community characteristics through time to address colonization and community
evolution. Metagenomics results are used to probe genetic adaptations that
confer survival in this harsh environment, including functional pathways to
reduce the effects of toxic metals, such as the extremely high concentrations of
arsenic. Identified potential metabolic pathways are being compared to chemical
energy estimates derived from co-sampled lake fluids. The results of this study
provide baseline data to address the timescales for colonization and the changes
in community characteristics through time for one of the newest and most dynamic
lakes on Earth. These findings have direct implications for early microbial
survival on Earth with significant implications for the early evolution of life
on our planet.
