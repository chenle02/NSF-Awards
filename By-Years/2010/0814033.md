This workshop is concerned with planning new research agendas for developing
digital tools for the humanities and arts as well as creating sustainable
repository infrastructures and organizational mechanisms to curate and grow tool
resources as they are created. Both of the organizing institutions are part of
an international network of digital humanities centers Called centerNet, with
representatives from over 100 centers world wide. The need to develop
computational resources for cyberscholarship in the humanities and arts for
scholarship in these areas has been widely recognized and their effectiveness
proven. Because of the complex data involved and interpretive methods used in
humanities research applications are complex and advance computation and digital
technologies.
