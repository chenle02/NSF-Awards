The University of Hawaii at Hilo is a geographically- isolated, minority-serving
institution with a principal focus on undergraduates. The primary objectives of
this ADVANCE project are to conduct data collection, examine trends in the data,
recommend policy changes and disseminate relevant information all related to the
status of STEM women faculty on their campus. To accomplish these objectives,
several relevant strategies are proposed that include surveys, focus groups,
institutional data analysis, establishing a web page, and forming a peer group
of existing ADVANCE institutions. It is noted that the PIs specifically intend
to explore the ways in which the needs of STEM women faculty on their campus and
the elements of their institutional climate are different from institutions
well-represented in the ADVANCE portfolio (e.g., large, research intensive,
predominately white). They provide measureable goals to increase the
representation of women to 40% and increase representation of women in
leadership to 25%.
