The floor of the ocean is formed by the injection of magma into rifts or
spreading centers along the mid-ocean ridges in a process that has been
continually occurring for millions of years. In places the mid-ocean ridges are
offset by transform faults. The geometry of spreading centers changes slowly
with time through poorly understood processes of rift propagation. This proposal
requests funds to extend recent work on the kinematics of propagating rifts to
the more general case of nontransform offsets to try to obtain a description of
ridge behavior. The PI's propose to expand a model of the nonsteady behavior of
a failing rift tip by repeated jumps to incorporate possible nonsteady behavior
by both rift tips in an overlapping geometry. present model cannot describe the
offsets commonly known as overlapping spreading centers (OSC's) where both tips
seem to jump.
