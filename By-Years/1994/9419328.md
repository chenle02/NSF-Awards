9419328 Young Partial support will be provided for the U.S. Delegate to the
Council of the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC) which serves as the
principal international organization responsible for coordinating international
scientific research and related scientific programs and activities dealing with
the full range of Arctic issues. IASC is charged with developing and
coordinating international multidisciplinary Arctic scientific research
programs, especially those requiring collaboration between the natural and
social sciences and the IASC Council meets annually to oversee IASC activities.
The U.S. Delegate to the IASC Council works closely with the U.S. National
Committee for IASC and interested Federal agencies to assure that U.S. Arctic
science interests are effectively represented in IASC. This support will cover
partial costs of the Delegate's participation in IASC; a small U.S. contribution
to the central operating costs of IASC; and the publication of an IASC report on
global change in the Arctic.
