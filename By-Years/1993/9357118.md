This NSF Young Investigator Award from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the
work of Professor Dearden at the University of Texas at Arlington. Intrinsic
molecular recognition properties of crown ethers and related ligands for metal
and molecular ions will be investigated in the gas phase using ion cyclotron
resonance and tandem mass spectrometric techniques. Use will be made of the
matrix-assisted laser desorption and electrospray ionization techniques. The
specific areas concern (a) the identification of crown ether / alkali metal
host-guest systems, (b) singly-charged alkaline earth monohalides and ammonium
cations, (c) chiral host-guest systems, (d) biological ionophores, enzyme /
substrate systems, and cyclodextrins. %%% With this NYI award Professor David D.
Dearden's will conduct gas phase studies to determine both the intrinsic factors
and the role of solvation in governing molecular recognition. By eliminating the
effects arising from solvents and counterions, the interaction between hosts and
guests can be probed directly. This work will make use of matrix-assisted laser
desorption and electrospray ionization techniques, enabling a greatly extended
range of masses detectable by mass spectrometry. This work aims to develop
chemical and spectroscopic probes to determine 3-dimensional ion structures.
