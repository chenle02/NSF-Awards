This project is designed to correct the deficiency of nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) instruction in the teaching laboratories. A 200-MHz NMR
spectrometer, dedicated to undergraduate laboratory instruction, is being
connected by ethernet to an existing silicon graphics server, one of a network
of computers maintained for undergraduate instruction. Students in Introductory
Organic Laboratory, Organic Honors Laboratory, Physical Chemistry Laboratory,
Advanced Instrumental Methods Laboratory, and Undergraduate Research have hands-
on experience with this instrumentation. Spectral data can be transferred from
the spectrometer to the server, and students can analyze these data from
computer terminals located in one of the instructional computer laboratories. By
this procedure, students spend only that amount of time operating the instrument
necessary to collect data and yet are able to spend as much time as necessary
analyzing the data from computer terminals without occupying the instrument.
This important analytical instrument thus serves a much larger body of students
than it would if students also occupied the spectrometer while analyzing the
data that they have already collected. This project also makes available on the
server several molecular modeling and spectral simulation programs so students
can calculate exchange rates from NMR lineshape analyses and evaluate energy-
minimized models in terms of their consistence with NOE and J-coupling data.
