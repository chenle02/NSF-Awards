9357387 Bailyn The PI will pursue research in the areas of compact binary stars
and globular star clusters. Compact binary stars are systems in which one
component is a white dwarf, neutron star or black hole. Often mass from the
companion is transferred to the compact object producing a variety of energetic
phenomena. The PI plans to observe these systems at a variety of wavelengths to
establish their properties. They can then be exploited to learn about unique
physical phenomena in the intense gravitational field of the compact object.
Although most of the stars in globular clusters are explained by the theory of
stellar evolution, a small minority have unexpected characteristics. These
anomalous objects are thought to be the result of binary star evolution or
stellar collisions. The PI will investigate such objects with the goal of
understanding the relationship between the dynamics of the clusters and the
evolution of the stars in them. ***
