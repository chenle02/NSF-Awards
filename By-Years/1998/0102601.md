The goal of this research is to investigate the generation and magnetic trapping
of ultracold molecules in laser-cooled gases and in Bose-Einstein condensates,
the interactions between ultracold atoms and molecules, and the possible
formation of a molecular condensate. This will be accomplished with single color
or Raman photoassociation of atoms in a laser-cooled or Bose-condensed Rb-87
gas, and with a Feshbach resonance in Rb-87. Molecules will be detected with
resonant multi-photon ionization, which can be both sensitive and state-
selective. In addition, nonlinear atom-optical methods could be used to probe
the molecular state. Atom-molecule collision rate&lt;br/&gt;measurements will be
carried out, and these may yield evidence of new kinds of ultracold collision
resonance phenomena. Precise measurements of the stimulated Raman free-bound
lineshapes will provide further information. The limitations to coherent atom-
molecule interconversion will be investigated. Bose condensation and molecule
formation in a tightly confining optical trap in which excitations are
suppressed will be investigated. An optical trap will also be used for the
Feshbach resonance studies and to study a Rb-87 spinor condensate. Finally, an
effort will be made to generate a molecular condensate with free-bound
transitions from an atomic condensate, and to investigate its properties and its
interactions with the atomic condensate.&lt;br/&gt;
