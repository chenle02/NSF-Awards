In this proposal funded jointly by the Divisions of Chemistry and Materials
Research, McCullough will synthesize and characterize novel conducting organic
polymers and oligomers designed to yield predictable, oriented structures using
self-assembly, ion-binding, and/or biomimetic assembly methods. The self-
assembling, conducting systems are based on oligomers and polymers of thiophenes
or pyrroles with functionalized side chains. Information about self-assembly in
electronic and photonic oligomeric materials will result from study of the
synthesized oligomers. The electrical, structural, and non-linear optical
properties of each of these new oligomers and polymers will be examined in
detail in order to focus on strategies for the design and control of structures
and properties in advanced materials. The research performed in this work is not
only of fundamental interest, but it also forms the basis for exciting new
technology for the coming century. Among the electronic and photonic
applications of the materials to be examined in this project are optical
modulators, imaging materials, light-emitting diodes and displays, smart
windows, and nanoelectronic and optical devices.
