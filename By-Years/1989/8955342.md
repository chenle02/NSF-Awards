The Computer Museum proposes to initiate a Computer Exhibits Kits Program whose
goal will be to foster a better understanding of computer science and technology
among the general public. The program proposes to develop and disseminate nine
different kits, each consisting of a computer program, documentation,
educational materials and, in some cases, specialized hardware. Other museums
and science centers will be able to purchase these well tested kits at modest
cost and implement them on personal computers to create exhibits for visitors
ten years old and older. Strong support from other institutions suggests that
the program will reach twenty million visitors a year.
