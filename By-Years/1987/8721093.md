This award will provide partial funding toward the purchase of an x.ray
diffractometer analysis system to be housed in the Department of Geological
Sciences at Southern Methodist University. The instrument will replace a 1966
version that is no longer working properly and is outdated completely in its
capabilities for modern research. The x.ray diffractometer laboratory will be
maintained as a cost center within the SMU Institute for the Study of Earth and
Man, a research unit which includes the departments of anthropology and
geological sciences. X.ray diffraction techniques are standard tools for
identifying and characterizing solid matter encountered in anthropological and
geological research. Institute projects which will make immediate use of the new
equipment include research in metamorphic petrology, origin of carbonate cements
in sedimentary rocks, ocean phosphates, sources of clays for Taos area ceramics,
and source areas for African hornfels artifacts.
