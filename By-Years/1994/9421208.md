9521208 Edwards Reproductive behaviors are essential for the survival of all
species. Testicular hormones are required for reproduction, and hormones
activate mating in males by actions that increase the sexual responsiveness of
males to females. For many species, sexual status is communicated by odors, and
olfaction makes an important contribution to sexual arousal in males. Dr.
Edwards proposes to examine the neural pathways through which the olfactory
system and populations of hormone-sensitive neurons in the brain regulate male
reproductive behavior. Neuroanatomical techniques will be used to identify
androgen-sensitive neurons and neurons active during mating. Special attention
will be given to a brain region that includes the zona incerta and central
tegmental field. Restoration of mating in castrate males by incerta/tegmental
testosterone implants can show the importance of the region for the hormonal
regulation of copulation. Large lesions of the incerta/tegmental continuum
eliminate mating. Studying the effect of small lesions to this region can help
identify neuronal cell fields essential for copulation, and provide a foundation
for studies designed to reveal the projection systems through which androgens
exert their effects on reproductive behavior. Because the studies include
measures of sexual behaviors (erection, sexual approach towards a female), they
have relevance for understanding how male reproductive behavior is represented
in the organization of the brain in many species, including man.
