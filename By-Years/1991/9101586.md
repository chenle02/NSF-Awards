The overall objective of the project is the development of a comprehensive
control system for turning centers, based on reliable process models, the
sensing and processing of multiple process monitoring signals, and the
intelligent control of the system in response to limiting factors and
disturbances. The emphasis is on the development of intermediate products and
solutions in the areas of design, manufacturing, and control. Analytically
deterministic models including process control and machine tool dynamics, act as
the link between the top-down expected process parameters used to set sensors
thresholds and the bottom-up information flow of extracted and interpreted
sensor data. The comprehensive strategy is designed to augment the
controllability and reliability of the machining process through a multi-model,
multi-sensor system which increases the quantity and quality of process
information. The system demonstrates input control evaluating process parameter
specifications as well as output control determined by the condition of the
workpiece or process outputs conveying disturbance-type limiting factors. This
project is a step in the process of moving to unmanned manufacturing.
