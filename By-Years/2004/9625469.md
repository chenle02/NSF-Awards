ABSTRACT EEC-9625469 There is an increasing need for integrated industrial
relevant research addressing building interior environments and energy
efficiency. The United States has been among the leaders in research in these
areas but has lagged behind Europe and Japan in the implementation of the
research results. This planning grant will provide funding for a planning
meeting to determine if companies will support the research program and the
viability of a Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for the Built-
Environment at the University of California, Berkeley. The research proposed for
industry's consideration at the planning meeting will address: 1) Laboratory and
Field Studies of Task/Ambient Conditioning (TAC) Systems, 2) Development of
Field Methods to Evaluate Indoor Environmental Quality, 3) Development of an
Advanced Human Thermal Comfort Model, 4) Design Tool for Thermal Assessment of
the Local Environment (DTALE), 5) Took Kits for Improving Building Operation and
Energy Performance, 6) Development of Improved Software for Thermal Analysts of
Windows and Construction Assemblies. The Principal Investigator and his
colleagues are nationally recognized researchers in their fields and are
eminently qualified to administrate this planning meeting.
