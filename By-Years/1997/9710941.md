This award from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of the Division of
Chemistry provides partial support to enable the participation of five or more
graduate students at the 1997 Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) Meeting.
This is a biennial international meeting and represents the largest
international forum for dissemination of information on SIMS. Students will be
invited to present their research. The meeting is held under the auspices of the
American Society for Mass Spectrometry. Scientists from industry, government and
academic institutions are attracted to the program and will provide students
with broad exposure to all aspects of SIMS. Topics will include the following:
surface analysis, developments in instrumentation, depth profiling,
semiconductor applications, metallurgical and geological applications, and
fundamentals of sputtering. This award enables participation of graduate
students in the 1997 Secondary Ion Mass spectrometry (SIMS) Meeting. The
conference provides a broad view of scientific activities involving SIMS.
