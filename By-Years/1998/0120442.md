This proposalwill design, build, test, and evaluate a long base line navigation
system that can serve several deep-ocean vehicles simultaneously. Current
transponder based navigation methods for use in underwater vehicles such as
Alvin, Jason, and ABE can only serve one vehicle at a time. The work proposed
will augment standard transponders to include a precision clock and control
circuits so that the transponders may be operated as accurately timed beacons.
This will enable any number of vehicles to calculate their position using data
obtained from passive tracking. The proposed system will improve productivity in
the conventional expeditionary mode as well as enabling multiple vehicle
navigation as part of a seafloor observatory network. To ensure a smooth
transition with present operations, the PI's propose to retain conventional
transponder capabilities on the beacons. Thus, a deployed net will always remain
able to operate in the current transponder mode if only one vehicle is in use.
