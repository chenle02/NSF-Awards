9404773 Chen The primary objective of this proposal is to study certain free
boundary problems which describe geometric motions of hypersurfaces, to analyze
the asymptotic behavior of certain evolution equations and systems describing
interfacial phenomena, to connect the solutions of the free boundary problems
with the asymptotic behaviors of evolution equations or systems, and to develop
numerical schemes calculating the solutions to the free boundary problems. In
the study of free boundary problems, the research will place particular emphasis
on a Hele-Shaw free boundary problem , which is to find the motion of a
hypersurface such that the normal velocity of the motion is equal to the jump
across the hypersurface of the normal derivative of a function that is harmonic
in the domain complementary to the hypersurface and whose boundary value on the
hypersurface is equal to the mean curvature of the hypersurface. In the study of
the asymptotic behavior, the research will aim at the Cahn- Hilliard equation
modeling the phase separation and phase coarsening phenomena in a binary alloy,
and at the phase- field model describing the temperature and liquid-solid phase
changes in a solid/liquidation process. This project deals with differential
equations of applied mathematics. Techniques of functional analysis and geometry
will be used to analyze these equations. Since the problems studied here are
very basic in mathematical and physical sciences, the methods developed in this
project can be applied to many other currently active research areas and
consequently advance the knowledge of interfacial phenomena. In particular,
applications of this research can be made to advanced materials research. ***
