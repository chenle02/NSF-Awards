Research will be performed on fundamental and relevant problems in the areas of
cosmology and galaxy formation. Emphasis will be placed on improving models for
the global star formation rate in disk galaxies and developing this approach to
be applicable to the early evolution of disks and to protogalaxies. This will
enable one to predict their luminosity, spectral and chemical evolution. A
second investigation will be of the angular anisotropy of the cosmic microwave
background radiation in open cosmological models. Small deviations from
anisotropy are inevitable and probe the origin of the large-scale structure in
the Universe; detailed predictions are necessary to compare with experiments.
The Principal Investigator is recognized as one of the world leaders in
theoretical cosmology and extragalactic astronomy.
