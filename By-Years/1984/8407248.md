This research will follow a novel approach for assessing remaining life in an
existing simple-span, steel girder highway bridge. The objectives are to develop
a method for obtaining a quantitative assessment of the deterioration in a steel
bridge caused by corrosion, and to develop testing procedures for estimating the
remaining life in the most highly stressed material in an existing steel bridge
without jeopardizing that life. The investigation will be based on tests of
bridge beams that have been taken out of service after performing for more than
50 years. Both axial fatigue testing of small specimens and testing of entire
beams will be conducted. To quantify the effect of corrosion, the fatigue
strength reduction factor will be calculated using a form of Neuber's rule. The
testing procedure for estimating remaining life will be based on using salvaged
beams to establish how the fraction of life remaining varies between specific
locations. Full-sized salvaged beams will be tested.
