The research focuses on the study and control of strong field processes via the
application of a variety of ultrafast laser pulses, including attosecond pulses,
intense high harmonic pulses, and few cycle pulses in the infrared and mid-
infrared wavelength regimes. The short duration of the pulses and the strength
of the applied fields mean that accurate calculations require a nonperturbative
solution of the laser-matter interaction, which is achieved by direct
integration of the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. All of the calculations
envisioned are directly relevant to ongoing collaborations between the principle
investigator and three experimental groups at the forefront of strong field
physics.
