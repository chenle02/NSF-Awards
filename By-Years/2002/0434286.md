Game consoles, with price points below $300, performance rivaling or exceeding
that of PCs, and graphics capabilities recently found only on high-end
visualization supercomputers, are the vanguard of yet another computing
generation . computing on toys. Moreover, market forces and fierce vendor
competition (e.g., among Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony) continue to fuel
technical innovation and performance improvements on these game platforms,
creating research and development incentives and deployment opportunities in new
domains. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This proposal outlines a research plan to assess
the utility and performance of game systems for both scientific computing and
high-resolution visualization. This assessment of game systems will be based on
development of a suite of adaptive performance analysis tools that support both
offline and online performance optimization and their application to a suite of
scientific and visualization codes. This effort leverages proposed Red Hat and
NCSA software enhancements to PlayStation2 Linux software. In addition we
currently are negotiating with Sony to acquire and deploy a large PlayStation2
cluster at NCSA for experimental assessment and scientific visualization.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Our computing on toys software research plan focuses on
three areas: (a) offline, multilevel performance instrumentation of applications
and system software, (b) online, adaptive selection of multi-version code
execution, and (c) experimental assessment using large-scale scientific
applications and visualization software. New hardware performance measurements,
instrumented scientific and graphics libraries, and performance derivatives, all
integrated with our SvPablo performance analysis infrastructure, will provide
the requisite data to move iterative performance tuning from an ad hoc style to
one based on intelligent feedback and suggestions. The offline version of this
SvPablo extension will accept performance metrics from hardware, software, and
library instrumentation and generates suggestions for tuning locations and
options using a fuzzy logic rule base that embodies performance
&lt;br/&gt;tuning suggestions for the Sony PlayStation2. &lt;br/&gt;
