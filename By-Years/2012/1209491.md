This action funds Raymond Seekell of the University Of Notre Dame to conduct a
research project, entitled "Innovation of a novel lubricant through biological
capture," during the summer of 2012 at Soochow University in Suzhou, China. The
host scientist is Dr. Zexin Zhang.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to examine and understand the
glassy dynamics of confined hydrogel-biopolymer thin films. From these studies,
functional lubricious polymeric coatings and lubricants are being developed
through biomimetic design. The research involves assessing how a biopolymer
affects the dynamics of suspensions hydrogel particles under confinement.
Previous studies have looked at the effect of confinement on homogeneous
systems, where colloids are only interacting with like colloids. While these are
ideal systems, they are not representative of natural systems, which could have
extensive applications from bio-lubrication, drug delivery to novel material
synthesis for energy storage and conversion.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
