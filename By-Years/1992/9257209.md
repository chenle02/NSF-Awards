My research will include two thrusts (1) 2D vertical- cavity laser arrays with
ultrahigh (terahertz)bandwidths for optical communications, interconnections
among computers, and real-time optical signal processing, (2) Aluminum-free
lasers to achieve high reliability for applications in optical- pumping and
optoelectronic integration. Specific work includes the design, fabrication and
theoretical analysis of novel devices and examination of systems
implementations.
