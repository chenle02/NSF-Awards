The processes by which parents inculcate cultural values and behavioral norms
has been the focus of scientific inquiry for decades. Consequently, the family
literature is replete with comparisons between different families in order to
identify those characteristics (e.g., ses, ethnicity, family composition,
parenting style) which differentiate socialization outcomes in children.
Critical examination suggests, however, that this "traditional" focus may be
misplaced, since variation in outcome occurs largely within, rather than
between, families. Put another way, children from the same family are as
different from one another, in behavior. personality and intelligence, as are
children from different families. One means by which we can understand
differences within families is to consider the social constructions , (i.e., the
meanings assigned to and interpretations made of interactions), that individual
members bring to the socialization which takes place within the family context.
In this research each member (i.e., individual parents and children) of 100,
two.child nuclear families will participate in a series of questionnaires and
individual interviews. The principal investigator will obtain information
regarding individual perceptions or constructions of the family, its composite
subsystems (i.e., the spousal relationships, the sibling relationship and
parent.child relationships), and socialization. Multivariate analyses will be
used to examine how individual perceptions of the family environment, including
perceptions of within family subsystems (such as sibling and spousal
relationships) differentiate the socialization outcomes for children in the same
family. The investigation will extend the existing literature on family
socialization to consider the reciprocal influence of multiple family subsystems
(i.e., parent.child relationships, the sibling relationship, the spousal
relationship), on individual perception and experience of the family environment
and socialization. It will provide a complement to observational and
sociological studies of the family, by focussing on the psychological level at
which such processes occur.
