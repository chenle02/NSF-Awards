The origin and subsequent evolution of the Earth and other planets in our own
and other solar systems is dictated by several factors including original
composition and the melt behavior of the constituent phases. However, estimates
of the melting temperature of Earth's mantle, which comprises more than three-
quarters of the Earth's volume and nearly two-thirds of its mass, remain
controversial and elusive. The conditions at which the mantle melts and
solidifies is especially important for understanding compositional
heterogeneity, which constrains deep structure and mixing and is crucial for
inferring the thermo-chemical evolution of the Earth, from planetary accretion
and the magma ocean, to continental growth, the formation of the oceans and
atmosphere, and the current state of the core-mantle boundary.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The melt behavior of one of the most abundant minerals in
the mantle, ferropericlase (Mg, Fe)O, at high pressures will test hypotheses on
Earth's formation and elucidate the geochemistry of the deep mantle. Experiments
conducted at pressures corresponding to depths greater than ~1200 km suggests
that an ideal solid solution behavior becomes more eutectic-like with increasing
pressure. The experiments will be studied by 2-dimensional mapping of
temperature, composition and texture of sample materials placed under the
extreme high-pressure, high-temperature conditions of the Earth's early mantle
as produced by a laser-heated diamond-anvil cell, in order to identify the
conditions at which melting occurs and its subsequent influence on the
composition and morphology of the molten and surrounding regions. Additionally,
this experimental investigation will help constrain current temperatures of the
Earth by estimating the temperatures at the core-mantle boundary.
