An expanded laboratory featuring Macintosh IIci computers running Mathematica is
being used to implement a major revision of the first-year calculus sequence.
First-year calculus now focuses more on powerful mathematical ideas and less on
computational algorithms; some important topics, such as infinite series and
differential equations, receive more emphasis; and the sophisticated software
allows more experimentation and exploration.
