The objective of this research is to develop a new manufacturing process for
fabrication of glassy metal matrix particulate composite materials, and to
advance the fundamental understanding of the relationships between material
properties/function, processing conditions and micro-structure. The approach is
to mix glassy (amorphous) metal powder with crystalline metal powder, heat the
powder blend up to the point where the glassy metal becomes viscous, and then
force them together to remove void space and achieve good inter-particle bonds
under high pressure and mechanical shear. Particle blend consolidation will be
achieved by warm equal channel angular extrusion. A theoretical modeling effort
will be done in parallel with the experimental investigations to deepen our
knowledge of consolidation, microstructural stability and failure mechanisms of
glassy metal particulate materials and help guide improved strategies for
fabrication of advanced glassy metal matrix composites.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is important because it will pave the way
for the manufacture of a new class of very strong advanced engineering
structural materials for a variety of civilian and military applications
including light weight transportation vehicles. The project will combine
experimental work with modeling studies to improve the understanding of the
micro-structural mechanisms responsible for the mechanical failure of such
materials and enable the design/manufacture of better composites for engineering
applications. The project will have an impact on K-12 and college students in
that short teaching modules and several laboratory demonstration experiments
will be developed for presentation to students to build their interest in
engineering. &lt;br/&gt;
