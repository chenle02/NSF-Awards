This award will enhance and strengthen the interactions between the
statisticians and social scientists at UCLA. THis interaction will be directed
through support for graduate students and equipment. This group of researchers
will focus on five areas of research and teaching: introductory statistics
teaching, simultaneous equations and latent structure analysis, secondary
structure analysis, multilevel analysis and hierarchical data structure, and
computational and computer intensive statistics. The activities of this group
represents a cross disciplinary approach to problems at the interface between
statistics and social sciences, where the substantive disciplinary questions
drive the development of statistics.
