This project helps fund the purchase of a transmission electron microscope (TEM)
and an image analysis unit. This new scope meets four needs: (1) to replace an
old, outdated and no longer manufactured TEM; (2) to develop a new,
interdisciplinary biology/chemistry/geology course for undergraduates; (3) to
enhance existing courses and student research projects by using present-day TEM
technology which includes routine image processing operations; and (4) to
explore program alternatives for attracting majors into the sciences. Students
are learning more than simple, morphological examinations; they have the
opportunity to learn, by hands-on experience, the use of the modern analytical
and image processing operations that current TEM's routinely perform.
