The principal investigator will conduct experiments designed to assess near-
equilibrium mineral-fluid reaction kinetics at elevated temperatures and
pressures. The experiments will combine recently developed isotopic doping
techniques with flow-thru approaches to better constrain the role of fluid
chemistry and temperature on the rate of mineral dissolution and precipitation
when chemical affinity of the reaction is near-zero. Results will be applied to
hydrothermal alteration processes and submarine geothermal systems.
