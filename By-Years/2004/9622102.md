Abstract DMS-9622102 Wang This proposal is concerned with problems of the
existence, qualitative properties, and multiplicity of solutions as well as
bifurcation branches of solutions for some model equations of nonlinear elliptic
problems including a nonlinear Neumann problem and a semilinear Schrodinger
equation. Using these model equations we shall develop some general and
systematic methods and approaches which can be used for more general problems.
The proposal will use variational and topological techniques to develop
analytical results for the problems concerned. Partial differential equations
form a basis for mathematical modeling of the physical world. The problems in
the proposal arise from a variety of areas of applied sciences. The role of
mathematical analysis is to provide qualitative and quantitative information
about the solutions, answering questions about uniqueness, multiplicity, shape
and growth.
