Center of Integrated Nanomechanical Systems
(COINS)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this
program is to develop and integrate cutting-edge nanotechnologies into a
versatile platform with various ultra-sensitive, ultra-selective, self-powering,
mobile, wirelessly communicating detection applications. The success of this
mission requires new advances in nano-electro-mechanical devices, from
fundamental building blocks to enabling technologies to full device integration.
The research approach combines five major thrusts that strive to push the limits
of utilizing nanotechnology in Energy, Sensing, Mobility, Electronics, and
Communication. Each of these areas encompasses research projects spanning the
full spectrum of basic through applied levels. Deliverables include key advances
in each research area as well as new approaches for integrating these advances
together into a single, mobile sensing platform. An example includes the recent
construction of a fully self-contained radio system with integral single-atom
mass detection capability built out of a single carbon
nanotube.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the program will lead to
enhancements in environmental monitoring technologies that open new
possibilities for detection via substantially better spatial and temporal
resolution, for example the tracking of air- and water-borne pollutants and a
better understanding of the impact of source emissions on ambient concentrations
and human exposure. The mobile platform has the potential to fundamentally
change the way one responds to proliferation events or serious natural
catastrophic events by providing much more accurate information on conditions,
allowing for improved countermeasures and security. The research components of
this program are highly leveraged to prepare, recruit, and retain the nanoscale
science and engineering workforce; to increase the participation of
underrepresented minorities and women in nanoscale science and engineering in
both industry and academia; and to increase the general public?s awareness and
understanding of nanoscale science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;
