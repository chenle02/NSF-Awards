Interactive rendering is crucial to virtual design and prototyping of large
engineering models. This research will produce techniques to significantly speed
up the rendering of surface models on current graphics systems. The emphasis
will be on novel algorithmic improvements in processing and rendering of large
models. The effectiveness of using analytic surfaces and other higher order
representations of large models will also be investigated. Such representations
contain more information than polygonal representations, but take less space to
store. Recent improvements in efficient tessellation and rendering of parametric
surfaces have opened up new possibilities for speeding up the rendering of large
surface models. This research will use and improve these results. In particular,
it will result in the following: - Higher-order and hierarchical representations
tessellated on- line into a small number of triangles, based on the user's
position - Efficient visibility processing of surfaces - Interactive rendering
of dynamically changing surfaces - Improved sampling of surfaces for the
generation of textured polygonal approximations - Configurable system that
adjusts rendering speed and quality without requiring user input - Algorithms
that scale well with both available computing resources and model size - A
unified framework that allows various techniques to inter-operate and results in
combined improvement in the state of the art The project also includes design
and installation of new computer graphics courses and laboratories in the
computer science department at the Johns Hopkins University. Significant
interactions between the classrooms and laboratories are planned. The usenet and
the world wide web will be widely used to augment the classroom teaching. In
addition, seminars and informal meetings will be organized to discuss research
in computer graphics.
