Stixrude 9614790 This is a renewal proposal to continue theoretical studies of
iron and iron alloys under conditions of the earth's core. The PIs plan to
expand their work into the evaluation of time- dependent properties of the core,
electromagnetic properties of iron, and the properties of iron alloys. They will
also continue to investigate the phase stability of iron, including the melting
curve which is crucial for constraining the temperature of the core, and the
sub-solidus phase diagram, necessary to infer the crystalline structure of the
inner core. ***
