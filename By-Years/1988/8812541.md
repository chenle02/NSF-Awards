This is a continuation and final phase of Dr. Susumu Honjo's Black Sea project,
a key component of a major international oceanographic expedition. Sediment trap
and core samples will be analysed to quantify the seasonal and spatial variation
in the particle flux in the Black Sea. Samples that were collected in the summer
of 1988 will be stored and distributed to other participants of the Black Sea
project. The final sediment trap samples will be collected in August 1989 from
the Turkish R/V Piri Reis. These samples will yield data on the annual flux of
biologically inactive material.
