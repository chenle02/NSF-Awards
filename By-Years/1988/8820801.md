This award will support the mathematical research of Professors Kim and Roush
in a branch of ergodic theory called symbolic dynamics. A symbolic dynamical
system is a collection of two-way infinite strings of symbols from a finite
alphabet satisfying a formation rule that specifies which symbols are allowed to
follow which as one moves along the string. Two such systems are equivalent if
there is a well-behaved bijection between them that respects the operation of
shifting. A central theme in this area is the classification of symbolic
dynamical systems with respect to various forms of equivalence. Symbolic
dynamical systems have recently found widespread application in the modeling of
data transmission. The principal investigators will study strong shift
equivalence over the positive integers, over the rationals, and over general
rings, and strong sofic shift equivalence over the rationals. They will also
consider automorphisms of shift dynamical systems, in particular periodic
points, enumeration of automorphisms, and subgroups of the automorphism group.
