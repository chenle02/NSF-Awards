The Association for Women in Science (AWIS) proposes to organize and host a
series of meetings focused on sharing best practices for gender equity. This
project will bring together institutional transformation experts, as well as
various constituencies from community colleges and national laboratories for the
purposes of disseminating cutting research findings, fostering networking and
informing new research directions and paradigms in the social science and
organizational change disciplines. The goals of this organization are well
aligned with the mission of the ADVANCE Program. As such, it is ideally suited
to serve as a catalyst in increasing the representation of women in the academic
STEM disciplines.
