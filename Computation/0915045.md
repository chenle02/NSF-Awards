The mathematical problems arising from poromechanical models are challenging.
Even linear models are mathematically and computationally demanding because they
require the simultaneous solution of the equations of elasticity and those of
fluid mechanics. More complex models may also account for electromagnetic,
chemical, or thermal effects, in which case Maxwells equations, equations
describing chemical reactions, or an energy equation must also be solved
simultaneously. Difficulties arise from the fact that equations for common
models have some degree of degeneracy and more complex models may involve
nonlinear equations, multiple spatial scales, complicated boundary conditions,
and nonlinear interactions. The investigator and his students will study
poromechanical models analytically (existence and uniqueness), develop and
rigorously analyze finite element based methods for approximating solutions of
various model problems in poromechanics, and derive a-priori and a-posteriori
error estimates. They will advance the underlying mathematical theory and the
science of computer simulation of large-scale, complex, coupled, multi-scale
phenomena.

Poromechanics is the science of energy, motion, and forces and their effect on
porous material and in particular the swelling and shrinking of fluid-saturated
porous media. Modeling and predicting the mechanical (or the electro-chemo-
thermo-mechanical) behavior of fluid-infiltrated porous media is of great
importance since many natural substances, for example, rocks, soils, clays,
shales, biological tissues, and bones, as well as man-made materials such as
foams, gels, concrete, water-solute drug carriers, and ceramics are all elastic
porous media. The studies conducted by the investigator and his students have
applications in a variety of unrelated fields, from geomechanics (ground failure
of water-saturated sediments, electroseismic prospecting for oil and natural
gas, or underground storage of hazardous waste) to pharmacology, material
science, and biomechanics (in particular, the study of bones, corneal swelling,
hydrated tissues, and intervertebral discs). Students involved in the project
will be trained in the mathematical modeling and computer simulation of large-
scale, complex, coupled, multi-scale phenomena.
