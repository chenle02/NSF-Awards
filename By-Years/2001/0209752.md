0209752&lt;br/&gt;Romanowicz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports an upgrade
to the computational equipment in the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory and
within the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at UC-Berkeley. Equipment
to be purchased will include a multi-CPU SunFire server with expanded RAM, a
multi-CPU Beowulf cluster of Intel PCs, a RAID system, tape backup system,
multiple SunBlade workstations, a large format printer, and various network
switches and Ethernet cards. UC-Berkeley will share equally in the cost of this
upgrade. &lt;br/&gt;Multiple investigators including Romanowicz (global
tomography), Burgmann (geodesy/tectonics), Dreger (earthquake seismology), Manga
and Richards (geodynamics), and their students, will immediately benefit from
these upgrades. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
