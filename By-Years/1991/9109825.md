How is a preschooler's emotional expression socialized? This research will
investigate individual differences in pre-school children's expression and
understanding of emotions. Studies will explore parental socialization of
emotions in 3 1/2 year old children. The planning grant will provide an
opportunity to improve the methodology and test the feasibility of various
measures of modeling, coaching, and contingency. After the planning grant
activity has been completed, there will be a follow-on proposal for a
longitudinal, comprehensive test of a model predicting how socialization about
emotions affects the young child's understanding and expression of emotions.
