This project is concerned with several questions in commutative algebra. This is
a field that studies solution sets of polynomial equations. Understanding
solution sets of polynomial equations is of fundamental importance in many
sciences, in engineering, and in other disciplines as well. Most of the
questions that will be investigated deal with the nature of the solution sets:
some are questions that have been unresolved for a number of years, but for
which recent advances provide the likelihood of a solution; others arise
naturally from new developments in the area. A number of projects are connected
with local cohomology theory: this theory often provides the best answers to
basic questions such as the least number of polynomials needed to define a
solution set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The projects on local cohomology theory
include algorithmic aspects, as well as structural properties such as support
and injective dimension. There is a special focus on local cohomology modules of
polynomial rings and hypersurfaces over the integers: this stems from the fact
that there is a canonical homomorphism from the integers to any ring, and this
makes local cohomology modules over the integers, in a sense, universal; this
viewpoint has proved useful in recent work of the PI and collaborators. The
project will also investigate local cohomology over the integers. The research
will further develop the connections of local cohomology with prime
characteristic numerical invariants such as the F-pure threshold, and will study
the composition series of local cohomology modules over rings of differential
operators.
