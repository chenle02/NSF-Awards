Professor Nibler is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program in
a continuing investigation of the properties of molecular clusters probed by
nonlinear optical techniques. The work spans the size range from dimers to much
larger clusters and addresses issues ranging from dimer structure and
spectroscopic properties to the study of nucleation, growth, and surface and
bulk properties of larger condensates. Large clusters of molecules, such as
nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and acetylene, are being probed by
stimulated Raman scattering and coherent antistokes Raman scattering at various
distances from the source nozzle of a free jet expansion. Both vibrational and
pure rotational spectra are being produced, yielding information on the
evolution of the cluster expansion and the condensation processes occuring. Work
continues on Raman probing of dimers of nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen; these
are important dimers whose centers of symmetry make them inaccessible
spectroscopically except through use of Raman techniques.
