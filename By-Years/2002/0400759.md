This award provides partial support for purchase of a nutrient analysis
equipment package consisting of an automated ion analysis instrument with an ion
chromatograph system. The instrumentation will benefit the research programs of
six investigators who analyze nutrient levels in a variety of environments,
including soils, bogs, fens, streams and forests, and investigate nutrient
transport in a variety of plant types. &lt;br/&gt;The Harvard Forest is a 1200
ha rural field station, laboratory, and classroom in central Massachusetts that
has served as a center for research, education, and training in forest biology
and ecology. It is the research focus of a National Science Foundation-funded
Longterm Ecological Research (LTER) project that integrates terrestrial,
aquatic, and atmospheric studies of the historical and modern changes in the
forests of New England. Studies range from organisms to ecosystems to coupled
systems. These studies provide multiple opportunities for education and training
at the undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate level of students from Harvard
and other universities, and from nearby small colleges and community colleges.
