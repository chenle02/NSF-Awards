Aspects of Digital Libraries The Digital Libraries research has brought together
researchers from computer science, communications, library and information
science, psychology, linguistics, and from the disciplines in which digital
libraries are being created, including the sciences, social sciences, arts, and
humanities. Digital Libraries are a prime example of large societal problems
that bring human & technological resources to bear on their solutions. Many
social aspects of digital libraries need to be addressed, as we come to
undertand the full range of issues they encompass. This research workshop will
focus on two social problems that are urgent in developing the National and
Global Information Infrastructures: Information Needs: Identifying real
information needs and developing digital libraries to mee those needs. End User
Searching And Filtering: Designing digital libraries in which it is possible to
find the right information in a glut of information. These two problems have
been chosen because they are urgent, enough research exists to frame them but
not enough to solve them, and the work on these problems is scattered across
multiple disciplines that need to be brought to form a research community.
