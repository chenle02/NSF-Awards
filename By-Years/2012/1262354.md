This REU Site program for Tire Engineering is a multidisciplinary research
program for undergraduate students. This site will train 10 undergraduate
students each year by providing them with research as well as hands-on training
that will help them with their future education as well as career opportunities.
The students are subjected to all aspects of tire engineering and are provided
with individual challenging research projects that include conceptual,
theoretical and numerical design and analysis, and hands-on components in state-
of-the-art research laboratories. The individual research projects are
integrated into an interdisciplinary, team-based environment where research
results will be used to prove a hypothesis. Talented community college and
university undergraduate students, particularly underrepresented and women, are
recruited to conduct research in this field. Through this REU Site, a diverse
program is created and students are motivated to continue their studies towards
a bachelor degree (for the community college students) and a graduate degree
(for the university students). This project is fully supported by the National
Science Foundation Division of Engineering Education and Centers.
