Almost all off-the-shelf industrial simulators of the process of filtration in
porous media utilize the linear Darcy's approximation of the momentum equation.
On the other hand, deviations from the assumed linear relationship between the
pressure gradient and fluid velocity occur even at low Reynolds numbers, and in
porous media containing fractures. Though these deviations are commonly
attributed to inertial forces, the actual nature of this phenomenon is not
adequately understood. The objective of this project is to arrive at a model
that transforms current understanding and prediction of fluid flow in
heterogeneous porous media. Approaches and methodologies from partial
differential equations, computational fluid dynamics, and differential geometry
are deployed to attain this goal. The models and methods involved include the
following: a family of generalized nonlinear flow models, which spans existing
models and forecasts new ones; a mathematical theory of the nonlinear Darcy
equation where the permeability tensor depends on the gradient of pressure; a
thorough study of the dynamics and robustness of the equations; analysis of
solutions to Navier-Stokes-Forchheimer equations; applications of the methods of
differential geometry to nonlinear hydrodynamic flows; a mathematical model for
coupled flows in discontinuous fractured media; computational methods to
investigate the stability and convergence of the multigrid algorithm for
coupling nonlinear multiphase flows in highly irregular porous media.

This project aims to better understand the complex phenomena of fluid
filtration observed in nature or arising in modern technology and industry. The
work provides a novel theoretical and numerical framework to explore a wide
class of nonlinear flows in porous media. The methodology is based on modern
research in nonlinear partial differential equations, real analysis and
geometry, as well as new numerical methods in computational fluid dynamics. The
mathematical models and methods are novel, and their applications are not
limited to nonlinear fluid filtration in porous media. The research is
integrated in educational programs spanning various special topics. The results
of this project are disseminated not only through professional meetings and
journal publications, but also through a network of collaborations and
partnerships with industrial and reservoir engineering companies interested in
employing the tools developed in the course of the project. On a larger scale,
results of the project bear on the prediction and evaluation of complex bio-
hydrodynamic processes in the lumen and arterial walls, transport of
microorganisms in soil, new techniques for image processing, and management of
the nation's groundwater and energy resources.
