9317066 Burbank PI and RA will continue to characterize Miocene Shadow Valley
basin, SE California, formed "piggy back" above a low-angle detachment fault.
Further work will address proximal and distal margins of the basin--sedimentary
thickness, character and chronology. Ultimate goal is a new end-member model for
supradetachment basins, and high-resolution chronometry of major and minor
tectonic episodes.
