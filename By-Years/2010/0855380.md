The US-Cameroon International Workshop on Mathematical Biology will take place
at the University of Buea in Cameroon, Africa, from May 15-17, 2009, in
conjunction with the First International Conference on Mathematical Sciences to
be held from May 12-16, 2009. The workshop will bring together mathematicians,
applied mathematicians and mathematical biologists from the US, Europe, and
Central and Sub-Saharan Africa in order to exchange information and ideas among
participants; promote research that will lead to effective new mathematical and
computational methods and techniques for science, engineering, industry, and
society; and provide opportunities for future collaboration with scientists and
mathematicians in Cameroon and Africa at large. Special emphasis is being placed
on providing opportunities for junior faculty and graduate students to
participate, as well as women and individuals from groups who are
underrepresented in mathematics, including students and faculty from
Historically Black Colleges and Universities. This grant is co-funded by OISE
and DMS.
