The project addresses the issues of tracking and modeling of human motion.
Robust tracking algorithms will be developed that do not require manual
initialization and are capable of tracking over many frames without failure.
These trackers will then be applied to archival video footage, to produce a rich
corpus of historically-significant motion data. A combination of manual
labeling, state invariant detection, and temporal co-occurrence analysis will be
utilized to parse motions into sequences of movements. The generated library of
learned motions can then be applied to a diverse set of applications, including
robot control and computer animation. The education part of the project calls
for development of a curriculum for figure tracking and motion modeling that is
self-contained and accessible to students and researchers in the areas of
computer vision, robotics, computer graphics, and biomechanics. An outreach
program will be initiated that will target the machine learning and computer
animation communities.
