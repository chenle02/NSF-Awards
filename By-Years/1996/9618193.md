9618193 Hirsch The Core Plus Mathematics Project (CPMP), which was previously
funded to develop materials for the first three years of high school
mathematics, is developing materials for a fourth year. The fourth-year course
builds on the first three and continues the preparation of students for college
mathematics, including those who will become professional users of mathematics,
and for direct entry to the workplace. Materials for three one-semester courses
are being developed. The first semester course is intended for all students, the
second course for students who intend to take calculus, and the third for
students who do not intend to take calculus. The third course will emphasize
discrete mathematics, probability, and statistics. A longitudinal study is being
conducted that follows students whose preparation in middle school mathematics
is based on one of the NSF-supported, comprehensive middle school curricula and
who then study high school mathematics using CPMP or another of the NSF-
supported, comprehensive high school curricula. The study also looks at the
performance of students during the first year after completing high school.
