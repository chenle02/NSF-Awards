This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
the use of a highly sensitive technology to measure the amount of trace metal
ions presented in water or other liquid samples and the eventual development of
portable instrumentation. This novel approach to detection is effective,
sensitive, selective, inexpensive, hazard-free, and truly portable. The system
uses an innovative high-resolution bi-cell surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
detector combined with anodic stripping voltammetry to achieve detection of
ultra-low concentrations of trace metal ions in water. The device based on this
technology can be used as a laboratory instrument as well as a portable device
for field evaluation of water quality. Further, it could be used as a clinical
diagnostic tool for detection of toxic metal ions in blood or saliva
samples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This effort will provide an accurate determination
of trace metal ions in water. This technology could have a significant impact
for protection of the environment. The ability to determine what is hazardous in
the environment is very important.
