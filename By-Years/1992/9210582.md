A new mathematical formulation will be investigated to model concurrent
decision-making in design. Parametric models, initially developed solely to
study changes in optimized quantities as problem parameters are locally
perturbed, will now be examined in a broader design and manufacturing context.
Motivation is provided by recent results on large parameter deformations in the
field mathematical optimization. The research effort examines the theoretical
properties of a new formulation, and examines the use of two different
algorithms to solve the models numerically. Successful treatment of the research
case studies will show how the concept of model optimality integrates the design
and manufacturing decisions in concurrent engineering.
