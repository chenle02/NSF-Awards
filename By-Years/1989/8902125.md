In solving decisionmaking problems, both human and artificial decisionmakers use
scales of measurement based on subject judgements to choose among alternative
courses of action or to select optimal strategies. With this in mind, the
investigator is attempting to understand in a systematic way the limitations
that properties of scales of measurement place on the conclusions one may
meaningfully draw using such scales. He is studying such limitations for
conclusions from the solutions to problems of optimization, from averaging or
merging techniques to combine individual judgements, from relative scores used
to choose among alternative technologies or alternative heuristics, and from
models used for solving practical problems involving resources allocation,
communications, transportation, technology assessment, etc. An important aspect
of the work concerns the implications of these limitations for the use of scales
of measurement in problem solving by human or artificial problem solvers. The
investigator will attempt to develop the theory of meaningful statements and to
study various theoretical questions about the theory of scales of measurement
which underly its use in the analysis of practical decisionmaking problems.
