The development and practical application of microbial pesticides for the
control of bacterial and fungal pests has been severely limited by the variable
efficacy observed in field trials. This project will improve our understanding
of the molecular basis for an observed biological control phenomenon, from both
a genetic and ecological perspective. The key genetic elements in the
biosynthetic pathway of an antifungal (Afu) compound, produced by a rhizosphere
Pseudomonas, have been identified. The Afu compound is potentially a valuable
biocontrol agent for pathogens of cotton. Fusion of the regulatory operons
involved in the synthesis of this antibiotic to strong promoters may create root
colonizing bacteria that produce the compound in far larger amounts than occurs
naturally. Efficacy may also be improved by determining the environmental
conditions which optimize expresion of Afu genes. The influence of pH, soil
temperature, moisture, C-N source, cotton cultivar, and selective nutrients on
antibiotic biosynthesis will be ascertained. These and related efforts in this
research will make possible the selection and design of biological pesticides
for possible use in crop management after appropriate testing to assure
environmental safety. The investigators have the expertise to assure completion
of the laboratory aspects of this project. Facilities at Advanced Genetic
Sciences, Berkeley, California, are excellent. This project does not include
field trials; these must await approval through regulatory channels. The Ecology
Program recommends funding of this Phase II project which stems from a Phase I
funded via the 1985 SBIR solicitation.
