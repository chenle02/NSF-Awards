Lowell Observatory and Northern Arizona University propose to extend their
recent Collaborative Agreement to establish the National Undergraduate Research
Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona to include a program for twelve
gifted/talented high school juniors/seniors. These students will be introduced
to the basic principals and practice of astronomical observation under the
direction of teams consisting of practicing, established astronomers at Lowell
and NAU and two Arizona high school teachers. The following Young Scholars
Program is designed to achieve the following goals and objectives: To provide
ten gifted high school juniors with a three-week, intensive array of activities
designed to introduce them to the fundamentals of astronomical theory and
practice. The activities should also enhance their appreciation of science,
mathematics, and engineering, in general; to introduce these students to the
many astronomy related opportunities available; and to provide students with a
serious consideration of the scientific method in context of astronomical theory
and practice as well as relevant issues related to the philosophy and ethics of
science.
