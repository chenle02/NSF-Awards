There exists a need for dependable, rapid, high performance microsensors capable
of performing in a liquid environment and capable of detecting change in liquid
properties such as density, viscosity and change in molecular composition.
Microwave acoustic wave technology offers one of the most attractive methods to
realize these types of microsensors. Shear horizontal type waves excited by
interdigital transducers (IDT) such as the Bleustein-Gulyaev (BG) wave, or the
surface skimming bulk wave (SSBW) or plate modes appear suitable for liquid
sensor applications. This research will include in-depth theoretical and
experimental studies of acoustic wave liquid-phase-based chemical sensors. The
analysis will provide design equations to realize a new class of inexpensive,
sensitive and rapid detectors. Prototype sensors will be implemented with or
without selective, sensitivity enhancement film coatings. The various chemical
systems which will be studied include crystals (C-6 and C-12 sugars,
polysaccharides) dissolved in aqueous solution, ligand with metal ion, dilute
concentration of metal and acid/base titration. A complete evaluation of the
sensor effectiveness such as detection limits, sensitivity, reproducibility and
response time will be made.
