9403470 Taylor The objective of this proposal is to develop a state-of-the- art
imaging system that utilizes a new type of CCD detector to obtain two-
dimensional temperature and intensity maps of short period gravity waves. The
instrument will be capable of up to 10,000 simultaneous measurements of
mesospheric temperature with high signal-to-noise ratio. The measurements will
be made over a large area of sky and will have sufficient spatial and temporal
resolution to investigate short period gravity waves in unprecedented detail.
