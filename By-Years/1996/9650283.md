This project is developing a real-time, interactive flight test program based
on an active Flight Test Engineering program being conducted at the University
of Florida (UF). Using a Cessna 172 aircraft configured with a unique
instrumentation system, participants are performing airborne experiments at UF
and doing much of the data reduction and analysis in real time on board the
aircraft. Part of the project involves sending video and other sensor data from
the aircraft to classrooms at four universities using video-conferencing, so
that the classes may actively participate in a real-time flight test. Each group
has the opportunity to act as "mission control" and direct the experiment at
least once. All of the schools are in simultaneous video and voice contact with
the other stations and in voice contact with the aircraft during the
experiments. Member schools are developing and proposing additional flight test
experiments.
