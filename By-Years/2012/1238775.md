The Department of Mathematical Sciences at Tennessee State University has as its
goal to develop and implement an applied mathematics program, which is designed
to fill the gap between mathematics and other STEM areas. This will be achieved
using a set of strategically constructed interventions that include, but are not
limited to development of new courses and curricula related to applied
mathematics, institutionalization of a new concentration in applied mathematics
for undergraduate mathematics majors and enhancement of research experiences.
Collectively, these strategies are expected to increase the overall number of
mathematics majors at the institution by 10%, and build the science capacity and
infrastructure of the institution such that the mathematical and technological
skills of the entire undergraduate population are enhanced. As such, Tennessee
State University is uniquely poised to contribute to diversifying the US STEM
workforce.
