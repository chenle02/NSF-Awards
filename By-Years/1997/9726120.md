Circuit simulators are often used to analyze non-electrical problems when it is
noted that such a problem has an analogous electrical description. This is
certainly the case for micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). But it should be
noted that circuit simulators have been greatly optimized over the years for the
analysis of large transistor circuits, and cannot be used to simulate MEMS
designs. In fact, general purpose simulators, such as SCEPTRE, have fallen into
disuse. This research explores the possibility of a MEMS-specific simulation
tool, with a focus on the questions: 1. Is nodal formulation and traditional
circuit simulation the best way to simulate MEMS? 2. If not, is the potential
improvement significant enough to justify a specific tool? A prototype simulator
in MATLAB is being built to demonstrate concepts. This borrows from prior work
on circuit simulation. Applications of algorithms, such as Asymptotic Waveform
Evaluation (AWE), and successive chords for nonlinear iteration, are being
investigated for simulation of MEMS.
