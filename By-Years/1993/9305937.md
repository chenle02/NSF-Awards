This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, is concerned with the surface chemistry of small alkyl radicals on well
characterized surfaces. Professor Stair has developed a novel radical source
which is used to produce and deposit alkyl radicals on well characterized solid
surfaces of molybdenum and iron. The oxidative and radical coupling chemistry of
the adsorbed species will be explored using a variety of ultra-high vacuum
spectroscopic probes. Studies of the detailed dynamics of radical adsorption
will also be carried out. %%% One approach to the understanding of the complex
surface chemistry of hydrocarbon catalysis is to investigate the detailed
surface chemistry of possible reaction intermediates. This research project uses
this approach by preparing radical alkyl intermediates and depositing them on a
well characterized surface. The chemistry of these intermediates is then
examined, providing a detailed understanding of the mechanism of hydrocarbon
catalysis.
