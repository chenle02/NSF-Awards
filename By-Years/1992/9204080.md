The objective is a new understanding of the origin of the earliest Mollusca and
related invertebrates. Recent advances in the study of sclerite-bearing animals
from the Cambrian provide an opportunity to investigate the relationship between
primitive spiculose molluscs (aplacophorans and chitons) and related soft-
bodied phyla (annelids, nemertines, sipunculans). These Cambrian fossils appear
to bridge some of the morphological gaps between living phyla and to suggest how
mineral skeletons might have first evolved within the Mollusca. We intend to
obtain 18S rRNA sequences from living spiculose molluscs in order to test
whether aplacophorans are the most primitive living molluscs or are secondarily
simplified. Furthermore, we plan to investigate the crystallography of
polyplacophoran plates to test the hypothesis that chiton crossed-lamellar
aragonite is different from and therefore not homologous to the crossed-lamellar
structure of the shelled (conchiferan) molluscs. At the same time we intended to
compare the microstructures of molluscan spicules with a variety of sclerites
extracted from Cambrian limestones. This work is expected to provide new
insights into the early history of the Mollusca and the evolution of the Metazoa
as a whole.
