This grant is to support the high resolution measurement of x and gamma rays
from both the sun and supernova 1987a on two balloons which are to be launched
from South Pole Station during the austral summer of 1989-1990. The work has
several goals: 1) To study nucleosynthesis in the supernova. 2) To study
electron and ion acceleration processes in solar flares. 3) To search for cosmic
gamma ray bursts, cyclotron radiation and gravitationally red-shifted position
annihilation lines. The detectors are large, liquid nitrogen cooled, segmented
germanium crystals. They are actively shielded, and will provide high resolution
measurements from 15 keV to several MeV. The balloon flights are expected to
last for 5-20 days. It is hoped, but not required that the payloads can be
recovered. This proposal is a precursor to the solar flare studies that are
expected to be proposed as part of the MAX '91 campaign.
