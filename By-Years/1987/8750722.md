Valpariso University will purchase a 16-inch telescope made by DFM Engineering,
along with a photoelectric photometer, spectrograph, and microcomputer for data
acquisition and reduction. A dome and pier are presently available. The
telescope will be used by undergraduate students for viewing and for research
projects. Particularly, they will undertake a program of photoelectric
photometry of short-period eclipsing binary stars. The students would plan an
observing program, obtain measurements of the light variation of the two stars
in their orbital cycle, reduce the data to a standard form, and analyze the
light curve to obtain orbital and physical properties of the stars. This program
would give the students excellent experience in all of the phases of a research
project. The results could be presented in scientific meetings and published.
