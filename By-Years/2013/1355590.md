This award will renew funding of WiscSIMS as a National Facility for Stable
Isotope Geochemistry. The lab has been funded by NSF as a National Facility
since 2008. WiscSIMS has optimized an IMS-1280 large-radius, multi-collector ion
microprobe for analysis of stable isotopes (including Li, C, N, O, Mg, Si, S,
Ca, and Fe). WiscSIMS has developed unique capabilities for precise and accurate
analysis of isotope ratios from small to ultra small spots. The ability to
analyze small spots (1-10 micron) in situ from microscope mounts allows data to
be put in context with imaging and other forms of analysis. Over 50% of
instrument beam-time has been devoted to earth science and NSF-supported
projects. Thus far, over 206 scientists have worked with WiscSIMS from 60
different universities and research institutes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A wide
range of research is conducted at WiscSIMS. The three most common areas are
Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology &amp; Geochemistry; Cosmochemistry &amp;
Astrobiology; and Low Temperature Geochemistry &amp; Paleoclimatology. The
applications of these new in situ capabilities are potentially transformative in
many areas of geochemistry. During the next three-year funding cycle, research
to be conducted at WiscSIMS will help resolve long-standing paleoclimate
questions, especially in proxy records of rapid climate change where
conventional techniques cannot resolve short time periods. The broader impacts
of this project include new applications of stable isotope geochemistry to
problems of societal concern; public education; and SIMS/geochemistry training
at undergraduate to post-doc level, including under-represented groups. Forty-
five students, including 20 women, used WiscSIMS in thesis research during the
past 3 years. WiscSIMS hosted the Hi-Res Paleoclimate Workshop in 2013 and
proposes to host Hi-Res2015.
