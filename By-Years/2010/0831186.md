Regardless of whether sensors are used just for observations or as the basis for
actual responses, the trustworthiness of sensor data becomes critical when
important decisions are based upon these data. Unlike traditional networked
systems, sensor networks also take measurements of physical phenomena.
Traditional information assurance, which focuses on the integrity of data, does
not cover all of the sources of errors that might arise in sensing data. In
fact, sensor data can be corrupted at the environmental level, whether through a
natural loss of calibration or through a deliberate perturbation of the
measurement environment by an adversary. These sources of errors, which affect
the process of measurement (PoM), are unique to sensor networks and cannot be
addressed through the usual network-centric methods. Hence, to complement
traditional information assurance services, defense mechanisms are needed to
protect the sensor network from PoM errors. Only when a trust wrapper surrounds
sensor measurements should applications make decisions or take actions with
important implications.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research consists of
two aspects: corruption research and assurance research. For the former, the
team will conduct a thorough threat analysis by cataloging the set of PoM errors
that may be introduced for a variety of different sensors. For the latter, the
team will augment the existing programming stack for sensor networks by
developing a suite of measurement assurance tools. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Developing methods that give sensor networks a natural immunity to
PoM errors will allow sensor applications to have a greater chance for success
and wider spread use.&lt;br/&gt;
