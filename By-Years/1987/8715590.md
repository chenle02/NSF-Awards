The role of electronic and atomic fluctuations and their manifestations in
structural and electronic order will be examined. In particular focus will be on
the underlying microscopic reasons for the existence of the quasicrystalline
state, the role role of multicenter interactions at the confluence of the metal-
insulator and liquid-vapor transition, on possible new pairing mechanisms in
both itinerant and localized electron systems, and on some new approaaches to
the heavy- electron problem. It also seeks to examine the physics of highly
correlated metallic fluids, to address the classical inverse problem in which
structure is directly used to extract fundamental interactions, to pursue
through the theory of inhomogeneous systems the nature of liquid surfaces and
interfaces, and to study complex fluids and states of partial order.
