This action funds Alexander Blair Cook of The University of Texas at Dallas to
conduct a research project, entitled "Connecting stacked solar cells with carbon
nanotube electrodes" during the summer of 2012 at Shimane University in Matsue,
Shimane, Japan. The host scientist is Ichiro Hiromitsu.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to better understand the
physics of multi-junction solar cells as well to develop more effective
techniques to incorporate carbon nanotubes into organic devices.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce. This research promises to advance progress toward cost
effective, light-weight and high efficiency solar energy for both consumer and
industrial applications.
