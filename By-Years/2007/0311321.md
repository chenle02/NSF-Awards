Algorithmic issues concerning several problems in Computational Biology will be
investigated. Problems on Gene Networks, DNA Sequence Assembly and DNA Sequence
Analysis will be emphasized. A Gene Network tries to explain the observed
lethality of a cell due to pairwise deletion of genes in its genome. In the DNA
Sequence Assembly area, we propose development of algorithms for a better
utilization of mate pairs data. The proposed problems in the DNA Sequence
Analysis deal with the construction of space efficient dynamic data structures
for performing fast approximate match queries.
