This research will examine a suite of cores from the Peten Lakes District in
Guatemala to examine the pre-Holocene record of climate change in tropical lakes
that did not dry out in the last glacial. The sediments of these lakes contain
the potential for preserving a unique and full record of rapid climate change
from an area of the world with few continuous climate records.
