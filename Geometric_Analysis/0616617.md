A joint US-Germany workshop ``Algebraic structures in Symplectic Field Theory
(SFT) and Applications" will take place in Leipzig, Germany in the period August
5--August 11, 2006. The workshop is oriented both towards researchers in
Symplectic Topology, as well as graduate students, postdocs, and mathematicians
interested in exploring a new emerging area of research. The workshop will
consists of several intensive lecture series given by specialists, and of
exercise sessions run by graduate students and postdocs studying the new theory.
The planned lectures series will cover the following subjects: new algebraic
structures arising in SFT, the relation between SFT and string topology; the
relation between SFT and the theory of quantum integrable systems; applications
of SFT in symplectic topology and beyond.

Symplectic Field Theory is a new emerging subject which proved to be relevant to
Algebraic and Symplectic Geometries, Low-Dimensional Topology, Theory of
Integrable Systems in Mathematics, as well as to String Theory in Theoretical
Physics. One of the goals of the workshop is to help graduate students, postdocs
and young researchers to enter the new area, as well as to help coordinating the
international effort in the development of the new theory. The NSF funding will
be used exclusively for travel expenses of US-based graduate students and
postdocs. More information can be found on the conrefence web-page
