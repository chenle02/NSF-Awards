This project will examine the framework for supporting cybersecurity research.
It will consider where and how important topics are covered (building on past
work, which has identified many important and often enduring topics), the
distribution of research effort among actors (with emphasis on universities, in
part to address the link between the conduct of researchers and the education
and training of cyber security experts to ensure that there are enough
researchers to perform the needed work), and the distribution and range of
support programs among federal funding organizations. The project will examine
issues regarding and options for improving coordination and efficacy in the
national pursuit of cybersecurity research. A brief report with recommendations
will be developed.
