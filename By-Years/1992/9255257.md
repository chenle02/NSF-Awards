The Core-Plus Mathematics Project will develop, field-test, evaluate and, in
cooperation with a publisher, nationally dissemiate a complete three-year high
school mathematics curriculum for all students. Each year the curriculum will
feature multiple stands of algebra/functions, geometry/trigonommetry,
statistics/probability, and discrete mathematics connected locally by common
topics and globally by the fundamental themes of data, representation, shape,
and change. The curriculum will emphasize mathematical modeling and will featue
full use of graphics calculators. The project willcreate a curriculum consisting
of a common core of mathematical experiences for all students together with
differentiated applications and extensions of core topics. The project is a
joint undertaking of development teams at Ohio state University, the University
of Iowa, the University of Maryland, the University of Michigan, and Western
Michigan University. //
