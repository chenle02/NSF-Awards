Many important systems in science, engineering, and industry are modeled by
dynamical systems with solutions that are highly oscillatory relative to the
overall time scale. Molecular dynamics computations for materials science and
biology are of this form and so is simulation of neural processes. Such systems
pose severe challenges to numerical simulations. In direct simulations each
oscillation must be resolved over the full time interval, which is highly
computationally costly. This research project aims to develop new computational
methods that are well suited to simulation of such systems. An example of the
infinite-dimensional systems that will be considered is high frequency wave
propagation. One goal is improving the quality of seismic imaging. Earlier
contributions have successfully handled cases with strong separation of large
and small scales in the solutions by only applying microscale simulations
locally. The current work aims at reducing this requirement by adaptively
monitoring the solution and exploiting parallel-in-time computations.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will go one step further than the typical
analytical or numerical averaging and homogenization approaches to deal with
more challenging multiscale problems where there is no clear scale separation.
The research will start to establish a new multiscale framework, which will
support adaptive application of microscale models in small parts of the
computational domain. The computational efficiency will result partially from
parallelization in time. The theoretical goal is to establish a mathematical
link between averaging theories to existing parallel-in-time computational
frameworks and filtering techniques. The practical goal is to prepare the study
of seismic wave propagation where the microscale model describes detailed
diffraction and the effective macroscales are represented by geometrical optics
type models.
