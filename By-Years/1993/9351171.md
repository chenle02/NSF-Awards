This project will integrate across the curriculum the concepts, practice, and
specialized uses of gas chromatography instrumentation coupled with mass
selective detection (GC/MS). Chemistry, biology, and pre-professional majors at
all levels will see and/or learn how to utilize the power of this analysis tool
for identification and quantitation of unknown materials. New experiments that
take advantage of the identification and structure elucidation capability of
GC/MS will be incorporated in General Chemistry, Organic, Advanced Organic, and
Advanced Inorganic courses. The GC/MS will be an essential cornerstone
instrument for the laboratory component of Environmental Chemistry, a new upper
division course that will be offered for the first time in 1993. In addition, a
proposed middle- and high-school teacher education and outreach program that
involves environmental science will be enhanced.
