Large scale electric power systems pose immense problems of stability and
control. Historically, stability has been achieved by means of sizeable
operating margins. But increasing financial, environmental, and other incentives
are driving the operation of these systems closer to their operational limits.
This study will attempt to develop a methodology for stochastic security control
of such systems. This is a methodology for assessing the vulnerability of a
system to various potential disturbances and determining the appropriate control
action to constrain vulnerability to an acceptably low value. The work proposed
is unique in building upon new theories of system operation to add the realism
of the stocastic nature of the system, and it would yield results of
considerable value to electric energy systems operation.
