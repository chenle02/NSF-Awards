The 1993 Southeast Regional Developmental Biology Conference will be held at
the University of Georgia on May 14-16, 1993. The organizers of the meeting are
Robert Ivarie and Lawrence J. Shimkets. The conference is composed of six
sessions: 1) Microbial Development; 2) Early Steps in Development; 3) Plant
Development; 4) Cell Determination and Pattern Formation; 5) Regulation of Gene
Expression; and 6) Growth Factors and Development. To add additional interest we
have invited two nationally prominent developmental biologists to give keynote
addresses, Dr. P. O'Farrell from the University of California, San Francisco,
and Dr. W. Timberlake from the University of Georgia. In addition, all
participants will have the opportunity to present posters. This meeting will
provide an excellent opportunity for scientists and their students from Alabama,
Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina,
South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia to meet and exchange
ideas and information on developmental biology. Based on the attendance of
recent meetings, 120-150 participants are expected. Partial support is requested
from NSF to help defray room and board expenses for graduate students attending
the conference.
