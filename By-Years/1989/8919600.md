The great British ornithologist David Lack proposed a hypothesis to explain the
evolution of the number and the size of eggs laid in a clutch by a female bird.
He proposed that evolution will favor females that lay intermediate sized eggs
and clutches. Females that lay many small eggs will start with more offspring,
but these offspring will be small and may have a low chance of survival. Females
that lay few large eggs increase survival chances of their offspring, but start
with fewer of them. Thus females that lay an intermediate number and size of
eggs are likely to have the most surviving offspring. The investigators have
developed the first experimental test of Lack's Hypothesis as it applies to egg
size in lizards. They will release hatchlings from clutches with large versus
small eggs, and then monitor their survivorship and age to first reproduction.
Using novel techniques, they can produce "giant" and "miniaturized" hatchlings
that enable them to control hatchling size independent of genotype. Thus, they
will determine actual patterns of selection on egg size. These studies not only
test a fundamental issue in evolutionary ecology, but also have important
practical implications as well. Captive breeding programs (salmon, trout, sea
turtles) have ignored the importance of egg size on future survivorship. These
experiments will show whether that is wise and whether those breeding protocols
require revision.
