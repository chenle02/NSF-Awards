The molecular mechanisms of early development in the sea urchin must be
interpreted in terms of the embryonic cell lineage. The purpose of this
investigation is to further explore the role of cell lineage relationships in
the development of sea urchin embryos and larvae. A multiple approach is taken:
1) Building on the existing, partially completed database, some studies will
address unsolved problems in the lineage of the S. purpuratus embryo by further
defining the lineage and specification within the definitive vegetal plate, by
determining more completely the fate of the eight small micromeres, and by
describing the origins of the neuroblasts; 2) To describe lineage changes in
regulative development, a group of experiments will compare normal lineage
patterns with the lineage of cells in isolated animal caps treated with LiCl or
fused with micromeres and will compare normal lineage patterns with those of
meridional quarter embryos, and 3) To provide descriptions of lineage and
specification in the morphogenesis of the juvenile echinoderm, the expression of
histospecific marker genes in the rudiment of S. purpuratus larvae will be
investigated by in situ hybridization. %%% A fundamental problem in
developmental biology is how the various cell types found in an adult are
derived from a single fertilized egg. This study will trace the cell fates of
founder cells from very early divisions after fertilization to their ultimate
form in a larvae. It will also explore the factors which determine the fate of
those cells.
