Innovations in the manufacture of a very widely used electronic component, the
circuit board, are considered. In particular, fast photographic systems which
would promote the use of computer-controlled direct-write laser techniques are
introduced. The project concerns two advancements in direct-write circuit board
fabrication. The first advancement involves the use of techniques developed for
integrated circuit microlithograhpy to achieve increased photo-resist speed and
a wider spectral range of the laser direct-write exposure sources. The second
advancement seeks to do away with photo-resist step by using a direct-write
conducting wiring board pattern, followed by chemical and physical development
and copper plating. The research will evaluate the feasibility of the concepts.
Successful implementation of the concepts would enable mask- free direct-writing
of circuit boards at high throughput rates, typically five square feet per
minute with five micron resolution. The potential impact on small batch and
prototype board markets is high.
