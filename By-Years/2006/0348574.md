In this U.S.-Venezuela dissertation enhancement project funded by the Americas
Program of the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Animal
Behavior Program of the Division of Integrative Biology and Neuroscience,
Zuleyma Tang-Martinez and Elizabeth Condon of the University of Missouri, Saint
Louis will pursue a program of research with Emilio Herrera of Universidad Simon
Bolivar in Caracas, Venezuela. The research will focus on the natal dispersal
and new group formation of the world's largest rodent, the capybara
(Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris). This project has three main goals: 1) to define the
behavioral aspects of capybara dispersal, including the variables that might
trigger it; 2) to define the spatial aspects of their dispersal; and 3) to
relate the dispersal patterns to the genetic structure of the population.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This investigation focuses on a topic of considerable
importance to understanding the evolution of mammalian social systems. It also
is of general interest to those studying dispersal and social dynamics of
mammals. The results are expected to have considerable conservation impact as
well as implications for sustainable management of this important South American
rodent. The collaboration with the Venezuelan scientist will enhance the
research efforts of both teams. The project will also provide an international
research experience for a US student.&lt;br/&gt;
