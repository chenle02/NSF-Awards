9451894 Poskozim The project will purchase a Differential Scanning Calorimeter
(TA-2000 DSC 912 Dual Sample System) and build or assemble a non-commercial
thermogravimetric unit. The two instruments will share computers. Both
instruments will be rapidly phased into existing chemistry lab courses,
significantly upgrading experiments and creating new ones. It is expected that
knowledge gained in constructing the sophisticated thermal gravimetric
instrument from available, rather inexpensive parts, will inspire others to
build similar instruments, thereby expanding participation in the field. The
project, begun in Spring of 1994, should be completed by the end of that year.
Over their projected lifetimes, both instruments will be used directly by
numerous students and faculty. Hands on experience and expertise gained by
students should further their scientific careers. A goal of the project is to
design new experiments related to thermal analysis for labs in advanced
inorganic, physical chemistry, instrumental analysis, analytical, and even
general chemistry. Another project goal is the compilation of a library of
standard thermograms insofar as possible for distribution to the scientific
community.
