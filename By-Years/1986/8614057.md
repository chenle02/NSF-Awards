The two primary research objectives of this project are: (1) to integrate recent
algorithmic advances in network optimization and nonlinear programming, and (2)
to design efficient solution strategies for an important problem-class falling
between these two areas. The focus of attention is on nonlinear networks with
generalized arcs (losses/gains) and non-separable convex objectives. This model
is capable of representing numerous significant real-world problems, including
electrical power generation, stochastic networks, air-traffic routing, financial
cashflow, matrix balancing and stratified sampling. These and other algorithm
strategies should provide sufficient efficiencies so that larger problems ( 2000
nodes, 40,000 arcs) will be solvable in a reasonable computer budget. A
comparison with previous algorithms, truncated-Newton and simplicial
decomposition, is being conducted on a battery of real-world examples. In
addition, the successive QP algorithm is specialized for solving network
problems with nonlinear multipliers.
