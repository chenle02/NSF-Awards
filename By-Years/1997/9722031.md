9722031 Giordano The process through which a piano generates musical tones will
be investigated using a combination of experimental measurements and theoretical
analysis. One goal will be to develop a theoretical model which describes the
vibrations of the piano soundboard throughout the musically important frequency
range (~ 50 - 104 Hz). Previous work on vibrating strings will be extended and
then combined with our soundboard model to produce a theoretical picture of the
string-soundboard combination. Due to the complexity of the geometry and the
nonlinearities involved, these models will be largely numerical. They will be
tested and refined by comparison with detailed experimental studies of real
piano soundboards and strings, and these measurements will also be carried out
as part of this project. In the final stage of this work they will extend the
modeling to calculate the sound produced by their numerical piano. ***
