Nonlinear elliptic equations describe problems as varied as the design of lenses
and reflectors, mapping the subsurface of the earth, interpretation of medical
images, and modelling complex weather phenomena. However, existing tools for
solving these equations are practical only in very simple settings, and can fail
when faced with realistic data. This project will introduce a new class of
methods for solving nonlinear elliptic equations when the data is unstructured
and non-smooth. The new mathematical and computational techniques developed in
this project will lead to fast, reliable methods for solving equations in the
realistic settings required for further progress in current
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will introduce a new class of
meshfree finite difference methods for solving nonlinear degenerate elliptic
equations in two- and three-dimensions. Whereas existing convergent methods for
fully nonlinear equations often require computations to be performed on a
uniform grid in a rectangular domain, this framework will allow equations to be
posed on unstructured point clouds. Methods will rely on unusually large search
neighborhoods in order to construct approximations that align with the structure
of the underlying PDE operator. The resulting schemes will correctly approximate
weak (viscosity) solutions, while allowing for adaptivity and complicated
geometries. This project will also introduce new formulations of several non-
classical boundary conditions, which will be used to produce meshfree
implementations. Fast solution techniques for the resulting algebraic systems
will be developed.
