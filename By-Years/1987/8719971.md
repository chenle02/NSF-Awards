This project is aimed at establishing the relationship between Laramide
magmatic activity and mineralization in southeastern and northwestern Arizona
where there are differences in the nature and age of underlying crustal basement
rocks. In addition, geochemical characteristics of mineralized and non-
mineralized igneous bodies will be compared. These data will help determine why
mineralization occurs where it does. The results will prove useful to
conceptualization of mineral exploration models and to what extent the
underlying crust serves as the ultimate source of metals.
