The reaction between atomic hydrogen and ozone in the upper mesosphere produces
vibrationally excited hydroxyl, resulting in two important consequences. First,
excited hydroxyl radiative decay produces the hydroxyl nighttime airglow layer,
used extensively in proving the hydroxyl chemical production rate and in
studying wave phenomena. Second, the collisional relaxation of highly excited
hydroxyl is key to nocturnal heating in the upper mesosphere. Mesospheric energy
budget models rely on accurate understanding of hydroxyl product distribution
and its collisional and radiative decay. Despite the importance of this process,
a significant fraction of the reaction exothermicity is not accounted for in
existing measurements. Thus, the investigator is conducting an in-depth study of
the atomic hydrogen and ozone reaction, where all possible hydroxyl nascent
product state populations are detected and quantified. His measurements are
reducing the uncertainly in necessary input parameters to mesospheric energy
budget models.
