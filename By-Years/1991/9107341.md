The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that plant species
diversity in young agricultural old-fields is maximal at moderately low levels
of available soil nitrogen, a growth-limiting resource, under conditions of
moderate and fine-grained disturbance to the plants in the field. This
hypothesis will be tested by creating a nitrogen availability gradient in the
old-field by enhancing availability with nitrogen fertilizer and by reducing
availability by adding sugar to microbially immobilize nitrogen. This approach
represents the first experimental reduction of nitrogen availability to look for
a peak plant species diversity response. Many studies have shown that nitrogen
fertilization of natural ecosystems leads to reductions in biological diversity.
The research should be of interest because it tries to examine the lower levels
of nitrogen availability which may allow for maximal biological diversity. These
results should be of interest to land managers trying to conserve existing
biological diversity and restorationists trying to create new species- diverse
ecosystems.
