Dr. Tytler and his team will make new high accuracy measurements, using quasar
absorption lines, of the primordial ratio of Deuterium to Hydrogen with the goal
of finding new physics beyond the standard model of particle physics. Using a
baryon density derived from the WMAP satellite, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN)
for the first time predicts the D/H ratio with no free parameters. This program
will test whether the D/H measurements agree with this prediction, either
validating our current understanding of BBN, or uncovering new physics. The D/H
measurements could reveal a wide variety of new physics, including new types of
particles (sterile neutrinos), a difference in the numbers of neutrinos and
antineutrinos, long lived decaying particles and deviations from general
relativity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary broader impact of this proposal is
training of undergraduate students in research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
