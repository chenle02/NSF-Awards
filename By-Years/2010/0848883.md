Professor Francis P. Zamborini of the University of Louisville is supported by
the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to
study the electrochemical reactivity and oxidation potential of silver and gold
nanostructures as a function of size, shape, and surface chemistry. A second
thrust of this supported research is to electrochemically synthesize Silver
nanowires for sensing and molecular electronics applications. The proposed
nanostructures will be characterized by spectroscopic, electrochemical and
microscopic techniques. This research will lead to a better understanding of the
effect of the size and shape of chemically and electrochemically synthesized
nanostructures on the oxidation potential and the mechanisms of electron
transfer at these nanoscale dimensions, which will push the field forward
towards technological applications in miniaturized electronics, chemical
sensing, and catalysis. Graduate and undergraduate students will participate in
all aspects of the proposed research, and high school students will participate
through outreach activities.
