This U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science award will support the collaboration of
Larry Mitchell of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University and J.
Roberto F. Arruda of the Universidade Estadual de Campinas in Brazil. The
project aims to investigate the use of spatially dense experimental response
data to update the finite element (FE) model describing that same structure. The
researchers will use a unique scanning Laser Doppler Velocimeter (LDV) to
measure a response image at up to over 65,000 points on the structure, in order
to develop spatial- domain techniques for LDV data reduction and modal parameter
extraction. These methods will be used to update the FE model so that its
predictions more closely match the measured data. This work will, for the first
time, allow spatially detailed experimental data to help define defects in the
FE models and provide a basis for spatial-intensive data to be used to extract
experimentally based modal parameters. The U.S. side has a laser facility and
experimental measurement expertise in a modal test scenario. The Brazil group
has capabilities in applying FE methods to dynamic structural modeling and
experimental modal testing experience. ***//
