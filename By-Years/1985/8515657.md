The objectives of the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Cell
Regulation are to conduct basic research in the area of cell regulation, bring
diverse entities of UTHSCSA together for the purpose of designing research
projects of interest to industry, encourage a functional interaction between the
scientists and the research laboratories of industry and the university,
interact with regional civilian and military organizations involved in applied
research to strengthen the research potential of the center, and enhance
technology transfer with the assistance to the Texas Research and Technology
Foundation and the Texas Research Park. The research agenda of the Center for
Cell Regulation includes 50 projects divided into 5 major areas: cell biology;
immunologic regulation; skeletal tissue; microbial pathogenesis; and mediators.
Fifty scientists from three of the five schools of UTHSCSA are involved,
representing 10 separate departments.
