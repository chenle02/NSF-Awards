This project will focus on a three-week workshop in the biology and ecology of
corals and coral reefs for undergraduate faculty in the biological sciences. The
workshop will provide experiences in concepts and investigative
methods(spectroscopy, calorimetry,elctrophoresis) that will enhance the
backgrounds of these faculty as well as their approaches to undergraduate
instruction in the biological sciences.
