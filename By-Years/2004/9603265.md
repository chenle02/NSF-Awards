This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in plant genetics
involves Craig S. Pikaard of Washington University and Manual Echeverria of the
University of Perpignan in Perpignan, France. The award provides travel support
and subsistence to Dr. Pikaard, his postdoctoral researcher, and graduate
student. The objective of the research is to analyze the role of purified
factors in transcription and processing of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in the
nucleolus. They will test the hypothesis that rRNA gene transcription and
processing in plants are coordinately regulated. The project takes advantage of
the French laboratory's expertise in in vitro analysis of rRNA transcription in
plants.
