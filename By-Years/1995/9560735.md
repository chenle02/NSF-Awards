This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
new, electronically tunable laser source, capable of emitting narrowband
emission in the mid-infrared (IR) region - from 2 microns to approximately 4
microns. Purely electronic tuning and high efficiency of difference frequency
generation in a nonlinear crystal will be achieved by use of a specially
designed acousto-optic tunable filter. The filter serves two purposes: selecting
two lasing wavelengths simultaneously generated inside the cavity and
controlling the cavity gain for each of those wavelengths. The gain control will
ensure optimum pulse energies and pulse synchronization for efficient generation
of mid-IR emission in a nonlinear KTiOPO4 (KTP) crystal. Development of this
tunable laser for the mid-IR spectral region will enlarge the areas of
application of laser spectroscopy and greatly increase the ability of
differential absorption lidar techniques to detect atmospheric contaminants.
Such applications include, but are not limited to, remote atmospheric sensing
and other environmental monitoring.
