Proposal Number 0136098&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bower /
Lozier&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will collect RAFOS float data,
hydrographic data and altimetry to pursue a greater understanding of the
pathways of waters exiting the subpolar regions. Sequentially released,
acoustically-tracked, RAFOS floats will be deployed at the Labrador Sea Water
level in the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) along the western boundary of
the Labrador Sea. The floats will be released on a seasonal basis for three
years and they will be tracked as they transit through the junction in pathways
near Flemish Cap. These observations will also be used to address an apparent
contradiction between existing theory of the export of newly ventilated waters
from the sub-polar regions via the DWBC and recent drifter tracks that show the
profiling floats turning eastward along the subpolar-subtropical gyre boundary.
The new data will also be used to address hypothesis related to the structure of
the narrow DWBC path, the temporal variability and intermittency in Labrador Sea
Water pathways, the extent to which the deep ocean is ventilated, and the time
scale of that ventilation.&lt;br/&gt;
