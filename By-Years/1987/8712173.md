An integrated urban activity model developed by Alan Wilson is widely used in
regional analysis and has made major contributions to our understanding of
relationships between transportation and land use in metropolitan regions.
Professor Kim will devise and test modifications of the Wilson model that will
increase its efficacy as a predictor of land use and land use changes. The
algorithm will be tested using data from the Chicago region.
