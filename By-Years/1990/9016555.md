This award will support Professor Rodolfo Rosales of MIT in a research
collaboration with Professor Pablo M. Jacovkis of the University of Buenos
Aires, Argentina. The researchers intend to carry out research in the stability
theory of square wave detonations. The problem of propagation of reacting shocks
in a gaseous combustible media (detonation waves) has interested researchers
since the end of the last century. The first models for such propagation were
proposed at the beginning of the century but it was soon realized that they were
too simple and did not take into account the very rich structure of detonation
waves. Since the early 1950's researchers have attempted to understand the
theory by investigating the stability of plane detonations. In particular, the
Square Wave Model allows for a linearized stability analysis that is relatively
simple but leads to contradictory results and "catastrophic instabilities". The
researchers intend, through a combination of numerical and analytical studies,
to investigate the reasons for such badly believed stability for this model. The
project will combine the experience of Prof. Rosales in analytical techniques
with the computational background of Prof. Jacovkis.
