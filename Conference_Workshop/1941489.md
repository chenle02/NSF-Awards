A 6-month research-intensive program titled "Dispersive hydrodynamics:
mathematics, simulations and experiments, with applications in nonlinear waves"
will be held at the Isaac Newton Institute, University of Cambridge, UK from
July 6?December 18, 2020. Dispersive hydrodynamics is an emergent mathematical
field of research focusing on dynamic and stochastic, multiscale wave phenomena
described by nonlinear partial differential equations that physically encompass
the complex interplay between long-scale, hydrodynamic, and short-scale,
dispersive, effects. Building upon at least six dedicated workshops and numerous
conference minisymposia on the subject since 2012, this will be the first
extended program on dispersive hydrodynamics. It will attract at least 25 long-
term, residential visitors at any given time and 40 or more participants in each
of 5 week-long workshops. The diverse, international roster of participants
includes leading researchers in the applied mathematical sciences. This National
Science Foundation award provides travel support for early career applied
mathematicians from the United States to participate in the workshops and the
long-term program. Traditionally underrepresented groups in applied mathematics
will be encouraged to apply. This support enables sustained opportunities to
interact with leading researchers from across the world. Such interactions and
contacts are invaluable to beginning researchers, both to inspire research, and
for professional development, thereby helping to cultivate the very best young
researchers. These researchers will be the next generation of applied
mathematicians who advance this and other applied mathematical fields of
research. Dispersive hydrodynamics has emerged as a unified mathematical
framework for the description of multiscale nonlinear wave phenomena in
dispersive media, encompassing both dynamic and stochastic aspects of wave
propagation. Theoretical and experimental developments have spawned new areas of
applied mathematical research. The mathematical program weaves together research
topics on integrable and nonintegrable dispersive PDEs, convex and nonconvex
dispersive hydrodynamic systems, multidimensional waves, asymptotic analysis,
numerical analysis, randomness and turbulence in nonlinear dispersive waves.
Applications include fluid mechanics and go well beyond, to nonlinear optics,
superfluids (Bose-Einstein condensates), condensed matter, and granular
crystals. The program website can be found at http://www.newton.ac.uk/event/hyd,
with links to the workshops and other activities.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
