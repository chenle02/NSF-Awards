This award will enable Dr. Edward W. Kolb of the Fermi National Accelerator
Laboratory and other members of the Fermilab Astrophysics Group to collaborate
with Prof. Katsuhiko Sato of the University of Tokyo, Japan, and other Japanese
scientists over a period of two years. They will perform a systematic study of
the expanding universe model and its space-time structures, including aspects of
the universe's creation and evolution. The purpose of this research is to study
the cosmological effects of the breaking of the natural symmetry which, it is
assumed, was manifest in the very earliest stages of the existence of the
universe. At high energies the laws of physics have a higher degree of symmetry
than is achieved at present in nature; therefore experience gained in high-
energy physics is relevant to this research. This experience of the Fermilab
researchers and their Japanese co-workers will be applied to theoretical studies
of dynamical systems with extra dimensions, which may describe the universe in
its early stages; of cosmic strings, and their influence on the creation of
particles; of anisotropic universes and quantum cosmology; of quark-hadron
transitions in the early universe; and of the failure of conservation of baryon
numbers. Close U.S.-Japanese cooperation made possible in this program will
facilitate the completion of many of these projects, which are too comprehensive
to be tackled by any single group.
