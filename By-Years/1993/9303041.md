This project will use nuclear theory to probe issues of contemporary importance
in astrophysics and particle physics. Nuclear effects that affect experiments to
determine neutrino masses and oscillation parameters and experiments to detect
and identify the dark matter that is believed composes most of the universe will
be calculated. An accurate treatment of beta-decay from the neutron-rich nuclei
that play an important role in r-process nucleosynthesis will be developed, and
the long-standing puzzle of nuclear structure physics with regard to the extreme
hindrance of beta-plus transitions in the region of neutron numbers near 82 will
be studied. Studies of quark effects in nuclear systems will be pursued.
