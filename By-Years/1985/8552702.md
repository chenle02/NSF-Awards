This award supports research in the area of interaction between flight vehicles
and the atmospheric environment. This research area involves aerodynamic
degradation of aircraft due to environment effects such as rain and icing and
contamination due to insect debris. The interdisciplinary research includes
meterology, physics, aerodynamics, and a knowledge of flight operations. Early
research has led to the development of an ultrasonic sensor to measure ice
thickness. Research is planned on qualifying cloud-droplet size distribution and
its effect on icing and on aerodynamic degradation due to surface wetting of
wing surfaces.
