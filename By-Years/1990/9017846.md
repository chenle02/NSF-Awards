The Marclaren Glacier metamorphic belt represents a deep- seated megashear
between Alaska and the Wrangellia superterrane. Prior work has shown that melt
was intruded into the megashear while in a compressive regime. This renewal will
incorporate cooling dates into a comprehensive cooling and exhumation model of
the area, and refine metamorphic reactions. Results will provide insight into
the factors which control strain in the lower crust during continental
convergence and accretion.
