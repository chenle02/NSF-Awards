This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
and the Instrument Development for Biological Research Program of the Division
of Biological Instrumentation and Resources will help the Department of
Chemistry at Columbia University acquire a 400 MHz Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
spectrometer for solids investigations, which will be used in the following
research projects: (1) hydrogen bonding and proton diffusion in hydrogen bonded
systems; (2) catalysis using enzyme-transition state analog complexes and
trapped catalytic intermediates; (3) the photochemistry, dynamics and chemical
details of the binding modes in complexes of photoactive organic molecules on
porous solids such as zeolites; (4) the molecular mechanism of the activatimn of
rhodopsin by light; and (5) characterization of the interaction between the
glutamate receptor and a highly specific inhibitor. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool for the elucidation of the
structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize
specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
interactions between molecules
