Recently-developed theoretical insights and numerical methods will be used to
generate and solve new mathematical models for interpreting measured spatial and
temporal distributions of waves and associated particle velocity distributions
in the magnetosphere and heliosphere. Emphasis will be on the evolution of beam-
excited waves, wave-accelerated particles, and beam relaxation, using kinetic,
fluid and hybrid models. Innovative higher dimensional two-time-scale fluid
codes designed to mimic linear and nonlinear kinetic effects will be developed
and solved on the NCAR supercomputers, with lower dimensional versions tested
against Vlasov codes. In collaboration with experiments from the Berkeley Space
Sciences Laboratory, theoretical models will be constructed and numerically
analyzed, and the results compared with in-situ rocket and satellite
measurements of electrons, ions, magnetized- electron-plasma waves and lower-
hybrid wave structures in the magnetosphere. Relevant magnetospheric wave and
particle data will come from the Alaska-88, Bidarca and Alaska-95 rockets, the
imminent Fast Explorer and satellite, the Swedish satellite Freja, and the
Cornell Topaz rocket campaigns. We will construct and numerically analyze
closely related mathematical models, which describe similar fundamental
underlying processes common to beam- driven Langmuir wave turbulence found in
the electron foreshock of Earth's bow shock and in the solar wind, during solar
radio emissions, and postulated as the source of the heliospheric emission
measured by Voyager 1 and 2. Theoretical predictions will be compared with high-
time resolution data on particle distributions and Langmuir waves in the
electron foreshock and in the solar wind expected from the WIND satellite, to be
launched in November of 1994.
