This request is for the purchase of a SQUID magnetometer capable of providing
standard magnetic measurements over a wide range of temperature, from 2 to 800
Kelvins. The SQUID magnetometer is needed in fundamental studies of problems in
materials science and engineering, solid state chemistry, and condensed matter
physics. Studies which will make use of the magnetometer include: investigations
of the critical cross-over energies and redox energies in mixed-metal oxides;
magnetic interaction in covalent systems such as chalcogenides and pnictides,
crystal chemistry and properties of metal oxides; permanent magnet alloys, and
solid freeform fabrication; powder and gas-phase laser processing and nanometer
powder processing. An available magnetometer will allow the training of graduate
and undergraduate students in a technique important for materials synthesis,
characterization, and processing. This magnetometer will be housed in the Center
for Materials Science and Engineering, used primarily by six faculty members and
four other members of the center. Maintenance and operation will be provided by
the PI and CO-PI through their current and pending NSF support. The instrument
willl be shared by the PI/CO-PI (70% use) with three other groups (30% use).
About 22 grad students, 7 post-docs, and 4 undergraduate students will have
access to this instrument.
