This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY
2011, Broadening Participation. The fellowship supports a research and training
plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden
participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this
fellowship to Loralyn Cozy is "Connecting cell division and development in
Anabaena." The host institution is University of Hawaii and the sponsoring
scientist is Dr. Sean Callahan.

Multicellular organisms that develop distinct cell types must tightly regulate
the transition between growing and differentiated cells. The multicellular
cyanobacterium Anabaena provides a simple, tractable model for studying the
genetic and molecular mechanisms of growth inhibition during development. Under
nutrient replete conditions, Anabaena grows as long multicellular filaments of
actively dividing cells. However, when fixed nitrogen becomes limiting,
approximately every tenth cell of the filament terminally differentiates into a
non-dividing specialized cell called a heterocyst, which is capable of nitrogen
fixation. This research explores the regulation of cell division in dividing and
differentiated heterocyst cells. This will determine the stage at which cell
division is inhibited and identify regulators of the proliferating to non-
proliferating transition. Further, it uses techniques of cytology, genetics, and
biochemistry to characterize the role of a protein known as the heterocyst
patterning protein. Although pattern formation and heterocyst biochemistry have
been studied in detail, no one has yet examined the cessation of growth during
differentiation in a thorough, systematic fashion.

Training objectives include learning genetic and microscopic techniques to study
this simple and evolutionarily ancient developmental system. The work broadly
impacts scientific areas as diverse as developmental biology, cell division,
nitrogen metabolism, and biofuel production. In addition, the host institution
affords a special opportunity to include undergraduates from groups that are
underrepresented in science, especially those of Pacific Island descent.
