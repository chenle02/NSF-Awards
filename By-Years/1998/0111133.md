Professor Bruce C. Gibb in the Department of Chemistry at the University of New
Orleans is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program for his
studies on the synthesis of resorcinol-based cavitands, determination of binding
constants with various small "guest" substrates, incorporation of a Zn(2+)
catalytic site into the cavitand, and evaluation of these supramolecular hosts'
ability to catalyze the hydrolysis of ester substrates. The regioselective
hydrolysis of diester guests based on the characteristics of the binding site
will also be explored.

With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor
Gibb will prepare a series of large, cyclic organic compounds which have the
capacity to bind to various smaller substrates. A catalytic active site similar
to that found in the enzyme, carbonic anhydrase, will then be attached to the
cyclic host compound. These enzyme mimics will be evaluated for their ability to
catalyze a similar reaction to that of the natural enzyme. By varying the
characteristics of the cyclic host's binding cavity, different substrates will
be bound to the hosts with varying affinities. This in turn will affect the
catalytic rate of these compounds with various substrates.
