This grant supports the research of Professor Roger Baker in analytic number
theory. Professor Baker will study a broad class of problems in Diophantine
inequalities around Weyl sums. He will also study exponential sums via the
values of Dirichlet polynomials and sieves. The field of analytic number theory
applies to the discrete realm of the whole numbers the techniques of analysis,
dependent on the notions of continuity and limit, originating in calculus. The
idea of using continuous methods to investigate the discrete is two centuries
old, but with the work of the modern analytic number theorists, the field has
had a new rebirth.
