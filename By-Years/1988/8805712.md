This project is mathematical research in the representation theory of Lie
groups. A suitable example of the latter is the group of rotations of a sphere.
Groups like this are important because they occur in many areas of mathematics (
e.g. geometry, differential equations, algebraic number theory, mathematical
physics ) as groups of symmetries. Representation theory allows one to take
advantage of symmetries in solving problems. More specifically, Professor Penney
will explore how representation theory impinges on fundamental questions in
complex analysis and geometry. One such question concerns the realization of
representations in square integrable cohomology spaces. This is related to the
structure theory of unbounded homogeneous domains in complex n-space. Other
questions to be investigated include the relation of the spectrum of the Laplace
- Beltrami operator of a Koszul domain to the geometry of the domain, the
solvability properties of such operators, and the boundary theory of harmonic
functions on such domains.
