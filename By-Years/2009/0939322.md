This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program
entitled, "NUE: Building bridges between the engineering classroom and the
research laboratory: Nanoscience at Union College", at Union College under the
direction of Dr. Palmyra Catravas, will support course development in several
areas of applied nanoscience with key emphases in nanoscale characterization and
visualization of nanostructure/property phenomena in order to build bridges
between the engineering classroom and the research laboratory.

Proposed activities include developing an advanced undergraduate course on
nanomaterials characterization and visualization with a capstone project on
materials characterization, teaching the design of an AFM through senior thesis,
and developing outreach programs to underrepresented groups and K-12 students
which will include workshops and art-science shows featuring nanoscale
characterization and fabrication using material derived from the proposed course
development.
