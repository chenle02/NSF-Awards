This project is directed toward the development of an engineering research
experience for undergraduates in the College of Engineering at Texas A&amp;M
University and associated universities for 10 women and minority students. The
program is built on the existing Undergraduate Summer Research Program sponsored
by the Texas Engineering Experiment Station, the Minority Engineering Program,
and the Summer Enrichment Experience in Engineering. The support provides an
opportunity for qualified students to participate in timely on-going research
programs, between their junior and senior years, and permit them to develop as
researchers. Participation in the program encourages more students to develop a
firm understanding of the fundamentals of research. The support benefits not
only the student participants, but also the colleges because the faculty would
become even more attuned to minority student interests and thereby become better
teachers and research advisors.
