9322368 Herr This award provides funds to continue a successful REU Site at Cold
Spring Harbor Laboratory. The program annually sponsors between ten to twenty
undergraduates from throughout the United States for an intensive ten-week long
summer research experience. The students are housed on grounds and each one is
assigned to a permanent Laboratory staff member to perform an independent
research project in the mentor's field of expertise. Each student begins his or
her project with the advisor's close guidance and is subsequently encouraged to
work independently. This allows students to develop to their full potential and
to sample first hand the excitement of experimental science. During the program
the students present two series of seminars: one in which the students describe
their proposed research and a final series in which the results of each project
are summarized. There is also a series of seminars specifically for the
undergraduates in addition to daily lectures given as part of the Laboratory
series of post-graduate biology courses. This undergraduate research program is
very oversubscribed and, therefore, focuses on selection of individuals who,
with proper direction, are likely to make a contribution to science in their
ensuing careers. Strong emphasis is placed on recruiting women, underrepresented
minorities, and students who attend undergraduate institutions where research
opportunities are not easily available, and on encouraging these individuals to
pursue research careers. The success of the program is evidenced by the number
of past participants who go on to excellent graduate schools and have become
eminent scientists. ***
