This project will examine the hypothesis that the principal spring biomass peak
of the copepod, Acartia hudsonica, is not an immediate response to the winter-
spring phytoplankton bloom, but instead reflects processes controlling
zooplankton population dynamics prior to the bloom, and interannual variation in
winter and spring temperatures. Thus the spring biomass peaks of phytoplankton
and zooplankton are not closely coupled in spite of their temporal association.
Model predictions suggest that small variations in temperature significantly
affect rates of copepod development and maturation, and the timing and size of
the spring zooplankton population peak. This in turn influences the degree of
coupling with phytoplankton and higher trophic levels late in the bloom. The
project combines field and laboratory studies to determine the influence of
seasonally important factors controlling the population dynamics of the copepod,
Acartia hudsonica, and its coupling to other trophic levels in Narragansett Bay,
R.I. The effect of interannual variation in temperature conditions will be
examined in large outdoor mesocosms. The mesocosm work will be coordinated with
a NOAA/Sea Grant funded study of the effect of temperature on growth and
survival of larval winter flounder, Pseudopleuronects americanus.
