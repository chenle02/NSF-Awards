The PI proposes to work collaboratively with a scientist, in a continuation of a
long-term publishing collaboration by the two, to produce an illustrated book
that will combine popular art and science in an exploration of similarities
between volcanic features in Antarctica, specifically those in and around Mt.
Erebus, with similar features on other planets in our solar system, including
Jupiter's moon, Europa, and Saturn's moon Enceladus. The work will draw
parallels between the disparate landscapes to draw the reader into an
understanding of Antarctica's unique features as well as encouraging an
appreciation of the Earth as a part of a larger planetary system.
