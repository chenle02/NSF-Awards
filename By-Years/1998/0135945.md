&lt;br/&gt;Advances in engineering and scientific knowledge have generated a
shift to "performance" codes, in which the building design is expected to
satisfy broad social safety goals, rather than comply with "prescriptive"
requirements. This project addresses conflict of interest that arises when
performance codes address intrinsic hazards such as fire instead of extrinsic
hazards such as earthquakes. In designing for intrinsic hazards, the same
professional is both defining the hazard and designing the solution. Because
these hazards are factually and technically very complex, there is no easy way
to make sure that the social safety goals will be maintained. The regulatory
systems adopted in fire engineering aggravate the problem by providing for
piecemeal regulation of design objectives instead of an overall evaluation by
regulators of the safety of the project. The multi disciplinary project proposes
a careful examination of methods used in structural engineering to mitigate
conflicts of interest and the evaluation of such methods for use in fire
engineering. The methodology to be used is Regulatory Effectiveness analysis, a
qualitative technique for comparing the Public policy, legal structure and
technical tools in a technical regulatory program. Candidates for dealing with
the conflict include regulatory responses; technological responses; sensitivity
analysis and model verification; limiting analysis to technological factors;
required Publication and disclosure or the utilization of other disciplines.
