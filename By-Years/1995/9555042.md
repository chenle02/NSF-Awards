Expert observers of the software industry agree that it is woefully inadequate
to meet the needs of the information age (e. g., Gibbs, 1994, p. 86).
Simultaneously, the education we provide students continues to be in the
scientific/mathematical tradition of computer science, which assumes that the
foundations provided therein are sufficiently mature and robust to support the
emergent, and/or existing, commercial practices. Both the problems in the
software industry and evidence about how students learn indicate that current
computer science curricula are inadequate to prepare practitioners. Software
process issues need to be taught explicitly and woven into a curriculum that
delivers the fundamentals of good practice integrated with the substance of good
science. The purpose of this project is to develop laboratories for a subset of
the five course software sequence of the computer science major. These
laboratories will use a skills-based approach to help students identify and
reflect upon the efficacy of their practices. The development of the
laboratories will proceed by user-based design principles in which prototypes
will be tried and evaluated formatively. The resulting laboratories will be
evaluated within and across courses, resulting in a test both of individual
laboratories and the cumulative effect of the entire curriculum. The project
will produce an on-line system that allows students to build portfolios of their
work and an on-line system for faculty that will record the types of problems
being used in the curriculum. Materials to support the use of these systems will
also be developed.
