This is a two.year collaborative research project between Drs. Jeffrey Wilkes,
Jere Lord, and Thompson Burnett University of Washington and Professor Zheng
Puying Institute of High Energy Physics, Academia Sinica, to study heavy ion
using the highest beam emergies and masses. The emulsion technique is important
in the study of elementary particle physics. It allows one to probe aspects of
elementary particle collision not easily studied using other techniques. The
U.S. P.I.s are among the best in this country in heavy ion emulsion
>experiments. Emulsion technique is well developed by the collaborative
scientists in China. This collaboration can provide useful data in heavy ion.
