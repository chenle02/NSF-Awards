The Framework for Transformative Geoscience Education Research project is a one-
year effort to engage the geoscience education research community in setting
ambitious goals for geoscience education research that will be achievable within
ten years and will have significant impact on geoscience education teaching and
learning. The objectives of the proposed project are: (1) to identify themes
that span multiple geoscience education research (GER) topical areas to define
the spectrum in which GER operates and has the potential to impact; (2) to
articulate and prioritize "grand challenges" in GER for each of the themes that
are of high interest to the geoscience education researcher and practitioner
community; and (3) to develop strategies to address the prioritized grand
challenges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Activities of the proposed project include:
(a) a survey of the GER community to determine what members see as important
research questions to address in GER in the next 10 years; (b) a workshop and
oral session at the 2017 Earth Educators' Rendezvous (EER) for researchers to
discuss and prioritize the grand challenges that emerge from the survey and to
propose strategies to address the grand challenges; (c) continued online GER
Toolbox development to support researchers as they address grand challenges in
GER; (d) a GSA town hall and a second survey to share the workshop-proposed GER
priorities and strategies with the broader community for their review and
comment; and (e) a white paper about the synthesized findings of the project to
share broadly the community's proposed research agenda for GER.
