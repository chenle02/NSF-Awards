This investigation addresses the role played by winds, electric fields, and
ionospheric plasma layers in the 100-200 km altitude regime focusing on the
determination of plasma layer distributions. This region is regularly populated
by "sporadic," "intermediate," "descending," and/or "sequential" layers, with
sufficiently high plasma content to play an important role in E- and F-region
coupling processes and to influence the global-scale electrodynamic circuit.
There is no global model of these layers, nor is there an empirical baseline to
define their global distributions and their diurnal, seasonal, and solar-cycle
controls. This void will be addressed by organizing and analyzing the
international SUNDIAL database, and employing the SUNDIAL suite of ground-based
diagnostic techniques, with emphasis on a new low cost analysis procedure. We
will compare the data with the predictions of the NCAR/TIGCM provided by Dr. R.
Roble. This will provide important tests of the uniqueness and validity of the
code's input conditions; and it will make possible a self-consistent
investigation into the contributing roles of meridional and zonal wind-shear
forces, electric fields, and ion composition.
