The proposal requests funding for partial support for U.S. scientists to attend
either of two sequential high energy physics conferences in Les Arcs, Savoie,
France. The first conference (March 15-22, 2003) addresses Electroweak
Interactions and Unified Theories. The subjects are CP violation in B and K
systems, particle astrophysics, neutrino physics, tests of the Standard Model,
searches for new particles and theories beyond the Standard Model.

The second conference (March 23-29, 2003) concerns Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)
and High Energy Hadronic Interactions. The topics to be covered include heavy
flavor physics, structure functions, diffractive phenomena, low-x physics and
saturation, tests of perturbative QCD, heavy ion collisions, the search for new
phenomena and physics at future accelerators.
