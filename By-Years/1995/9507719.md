The research described spans two classes of problems which involve different
methods, but which are unified by the common roots in general relativity,
Einstein's theory of gravitation. One set of problems is centered on
astrophysical facets of general relativity, especially black holes and
gravitational waves, and much of it is motivated by the problem of determining
the gravitational wave signal produced by black hole interactions. The approach
will involve numerical and symbolic computation, but will not directly involve
solving the full set of Einstein equations on supercomputers. Rather, analytic
and approximation methods will be used to find and understand gravitational wave
outputs. Another set of problems aims at understanding the canonical
quantization of Einstein's theory. Black holes are again at the center of
attention, now at the submicroscopic scale. Semiclassically, they evaporate by
Hawking radiation. To go beyond the semiclassical description, midisuperspace
quantization will be applied to a number of spherically symmetric models. It is
expected that the reconstruction of privileged spacetime coordinates from the
canonical data will simplify the quantum theory both at the conceptual and
technical levels. A study of these models should clarify such questions as what
happens to the horizon and curvature singularities in quantum theory.
