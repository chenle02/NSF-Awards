This project intends to explore generic data models for provenance metadata. The
first stages of the work involves investigating the provenance requirements of
different applications domains.. The next stage attempts to generalize these
data requirements into a single generic model for that group of applications.
The generic model then is used as a basis for investigating issues on effective
management of the metadata. Domain experts can express issues about their
requirements without considering the details of the system implementation. If
successful, the project will explore the efficiency of the provenance management
within specific applications areas. The proposal will also explore optimization
strategies and opportunities provenance metadata management which would include
optimizations of storage requirements and operations, such as recursive queries.
