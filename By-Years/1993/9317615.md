9317615 Merchant This project provides partial funding for an advanced
industrial research workshop. This workshop is in an area of vital interest to
both United States industry and academe. The German American Forum on
Manufacturing Technology features two days of presentations on current
production engineering research at the Aachen Institute, one of the leading
Fraunhofer Institutes in Germany. It is the only forum outside Germany where the
Directors and Chief Engineers at the Institute appear together. It represents a
unique opportunities for the United States industry academe to meet these
leading industrial researchers face-to-face. In addition, there are
presentations by two distinguished members of the National Academy of
Engineering. THis will be a high quality forum (including ample opportunity for
individual discussions) that will provide an unusual insight into current
manufacturing research issues in German industry.
