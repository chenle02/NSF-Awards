Information Flow: Modeling Channels and Defaults in Domain Theory This work is
an attempt to use techniques used in the semantics of programming languages to
unify some concepts in intelligent systems modeling. More specifically, it
studies the flow of information which admits errors but still allows useful
information to be transmitted. In previous work, a theory of such information
flow, called default model theory , grounded in domain theory, has been
developed. Default model theory allows information used at one point in a
computation to be overwritten when new "strict" information becomes available,
providing a means of understanding default and nonmonotonic reasoning from the
perspective of information channels. This work will also investigate
applications to natural language processing, logic programming, and database
handling.
