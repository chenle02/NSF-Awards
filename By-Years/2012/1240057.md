Boston University is conducting a Phase 2: Research and Evaluation project to
analyze the outcomes of two Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship programs in
mathematics, one running from 2007 to 2012 and the other from 2009 to 2015 in
collaboration with Math for America Boston. The 48 graduates of the programs are
the subjects of a mixed-methods longitudinal study that examines the
effectiveness and quality of their teaching and their retention in the high-need
schools where they are initially assigned. Effectiveness is analyzed from
samples of instructional materials and student work, focusing on the cognitive
demands of the assigned tasks. Comparison groups include alumni from BU's other
mathematics education programs; members of the Teach for America Boston corps,
who take several education courses at BU and are granted expedited licensure;
and mathematics teachers trained in other programs who are teaching in the same
schools as the Noyce Scholars. This evaluation effort is totally external to the
Noyce Scholarship programs themselves and so offers an unbiased view of their
effectiveness. The study design includes faculty from the School of Education
and a biostatistician from the School of Public Health. The results, to be
widely disseminated, are of interest not only to education researchers but to
policy makers and the teacher education community.
