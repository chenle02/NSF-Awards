A pivotal issue in developmental neuroscience is how nerve cells choose the
appropriate target. This issue will be investigated in a culture system of
Merkel cells, the mechanosensory cells of the rat snout. These cells are
normally innervated by sensory neurons of the trigeminal ganglion. The
investigator has observed that, in culture, sensory neurons selectively grow
onto islands of Merkel cells and establish territories that exclude neurites
from other sensory neurons, while sympathetic neurons actively avoid Merkel
cells. Studies will be done to examine the hypothesis that sensory neurons
specifically recognize and respond to molecules on the surface of Merkel cells,
and that sympathetic neurons actively avoid Merkel cells as the result of
molecules on the surface of Merkel cells that induce neurite retraction. Classes
of cell surface molecules involved in the interactions between Merkel cells and
neurons will be identified. Time lapse videomicroscopy will be used to
investigate the dynamic events involved in the formation of neuronal territories
on Merkel cells. The role of nerve growth factor in formation and maintenance of
neuronal territories on Merkel cells will be studied. These studies promise to
provide information on molecules important to the formation of neuronal
specificity.
