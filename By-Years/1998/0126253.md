Considerable interest and debate surround the problem of uplift and geomorphic
evolution of areas undergoing arc magmatism and arc accretion to continental
margins. The Sierra Nevada of California, a deeply eroded remnant of a late
Mesozoic magmatic arc, has conventionally been thought to have been uplifted in
late Cenozoic time, however this conclusion has been challenged by low
temperature geochronologic studies suggesting high relief as early as late
Mesozoic. This project will measure river incision rates in the Sierra Nevada by
comparing elevations of dated cave deposits with present day river elevations.
These data will be incorporated in a model of Sierra landscape evolution in
order to provide a test of the competing mutually exclusive hypotheses. Results
will be of considerable regional importance and have clear implications on
broader issues.
