This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explanations for why CO2 varies on
glacial timescales and why the ice core records are out of sync on millennial-
centennial timescales most likely reside in the deep ocean. To learn why we must
first know how this reservoir changes under different climate states and across
rapid climate transitions. Toward this objective the PIs outline a plan for
using deep-sea corals to measure the past deep ocean temperatures and Ä14C. They
will measure past Ä14C using combined U-series and 14C ages in a now well-
established deep-sea coral technique. They hope to measure past temperatures to
±1°C or better using the newly established ?clumpy isotope? thermometer. As this
technique depends on the relative ordering of 13C and 18O atoms in CaCO3 bonds,
it is independent of the water ä18O value. Samples are already in
hand.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include the support of the PhD work of an
Indian-American scientist at Caltech.&lt;br/&gt;
