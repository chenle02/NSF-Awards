With National Science Foundation support, Drs. Carolyn J. MacKay and Frank R.
Trechsel will conduct three years of linguistic research on Pisaflores Tepehua,
an undocumented and endangered Totonacan language spoken in and around
Pisaflores, Veracruz, in Mexico. Fieldwork will emphasize recording and
analyzing grammatical, lexical, and text material. The PIs will work with native
speakers to produce a grammatical description of Pisaflores Tepehua, a
trilingual Tepehua/Spanish/English lexicon, and a collection of personal
histories, narratives, conversations, and other discourse genres recorded in
digital audio and video formats. The project will thus produce a comprehensive
description of the language and document its use as an expression of social and
cultural identity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This documentation will: a) provide the
first and perhaps only grammatical description of this typologically interesting
and undocumented language; b) yield data essential to the reconstruction of
Proto-Totonacan, the ancestor language from which all the Totonacan languages
are descended; c) help determine the historical relationship of Pisaflores
Tepehua to other Totonacan languages and to other indigenous languages in
Mesoamerica; and d) provide speakers of the language with a practical
orthography and other materials for use in literacy and language maintenance
projects. Tepehua is currently the principal means of communication in
Pisaflores, and it is still being acquired by children. But it is rapidly being
replaced by Spanish. Without documentation and revitalization, Tepehua may be
abandoned within a generation. Tepehua materials resulting from this project
will be valuable to the native speakers in Pisaflores, who are struggling to
maintain their language for future generations, and to linguists and other
scientists interested in native American languages and
cultures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
