This is a proposal to provide travel support for ten U.S. based junior
researchers to attend the Workshop on Mathematical Biology and Nonlinear
Analysis, which will be held at the Coral Gables campus of the University of
Miami, December 19-21, 2014.

The Workshop will focus on the applications of mathematical methods for studying
nonlinear equations that model biological processes, especially in ecology,
epidemiology, and evolutionary theory. The conference will provide opportunities
for junior researchers to interact with leading researchers in these areas. The
workshop will feature plenary lectures by leading scientists and will hold
special topic sessions where researchers will present their ideas and results.
One of the aims of the conference is to broaden the education and stimulate the
research of junior researchers and those from underrepresented groups. NSF
funding is vital in achieving this goal.
