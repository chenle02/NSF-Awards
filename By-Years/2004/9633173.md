colleagues in Mexico and Chile to set up arrangements for monitoring of trace
metals (in particular Cd) as indicators of upwelling variations in coastal
waters. Local students will collect monthly samples of water from selected sites
along the coast and mail them to the PI's lab for analysis. Cd has been shown to
reflect the availability of nutrients, and is incorporated in the shells of
benthic foraminifera. The water samples will provide a baseline to determine the
seasonal and interannual cycle of upwelling-related production at each site;
dated sediment sample of the benthic foraminifera will then provide a record of
upwelling variability over the past few thousand years.
