This award will provide funds to a group from the University of Maryland, to
continue their study of Ultra High Energy (UHE) Phenomena Using Cosmic Rays and
the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. They will continue the search for UHE signals
from astrophysical point sources and investigate the muon content of the showers
from these signals, and will try to determine whether the anomalous muons which
have been seen in Hercules X-1 bursts is a universal phenomenon among UHE
sources. These studies are essential for our understanding of photon hadron
interactions at the center of mass energies in the 100 GeV to 1 TeV range.
