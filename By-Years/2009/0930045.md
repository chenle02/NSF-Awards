This grant supports upgrade of a continuous-GPS (CGPS) network on Sierra Negra
volcano in the Galapagos. The original network was funded through previous
NSF/EAR support. The upgrade will include acquisition and field deployment of
four new dual frequency GPS receivers and radio modems. The upgrade will
completely replace remaining single frequency receivers in the Sierra Negra
network with dual frequency receivers with greatly enhanced on board memory. The
upgraded CGPS network will allow for continued observations of one of the most
active basaltic volcanoes in the world. The dynamics of this volcanic system
allows for an extraordinary opportunity to learn more about the interplay
between magma intrusion and surface deformation. All of the GPS data collected
by the Sierra Negra network will continue to be freely accessible through the
UNAVCO data system in near real time.
