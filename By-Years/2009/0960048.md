With the steady increase of discovery of new anthropogenically generated
nanomaterials with novel properties and the increase in their use in consumer
products and manufacturing, periodic assessments of the state-of-the-art and the
impacts of these new materials on people and human health is essential. This
workshop responds to this need by bringing together stakeholders and experts
from academia, industry, the government, and non-profit consumer advocate groups
to discuss the state of the field. This workshop sheds light on the where we are
in terms of understanding how nanomaterials interact with cells in the human
body, on advances being made in the field of nano-toxicology and metrology, and
in identifying gaps in our present knowledge and looming challenges that need to
be addressed in the next decade. Broader impacts of the workshop include
engaging in dialog a diverse group of stakeholders that do not generally
communicate with each other. Broad participation by the public and other
interested parties is fostered via live broadcast of the meeting over the
Internet. Conveners have also been sensitive to diversity in terms of selecting
steering committee members and forum speakers.
