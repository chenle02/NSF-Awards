Despite much research regarding how animals and humans solve social problems,
few studies have utilized comparable procedures, outcomes, or measures, thus
little is known about the evolution of decision-making behavior. In this
project, the Principal Investigators will investigate how primates, including
humans, deal with problems that arise in interactions with other group members.
Understanding what outcomes are achieved, and how they vary across species, has
implications for theories of the evolution of sociality and our understanding of
social decision-making. The research will examine strategic decisions involving
costly conflict and trust, varying the cooperativeness or competitiveness of the
frame. The results will provide shed light on the evolution of human decision-
making behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will help to clarify the
similarities and differences between nonhuman primates and humans with respect
to social decision-making and will more properly place nonhuman behavior in
context with human behavior and to understand the roots from which human
economic decision making emerged. In addition to the theoretical merits, this
interdisciplinary research will be integrated into summer workshops for
graduate, undergraduate, and high school students at the Economic Science
Institute at Chapman University and disseminated to the general public through
partnerships with schools and Zoo Atlanta. It will also provide training for
multiple postdoctoral fellows, graduate and undergraduate students.
