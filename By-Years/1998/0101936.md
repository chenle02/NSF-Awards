This EDC project seeks to build a model program for the development and support
of middle grades mentor teachers and a replicable implementation strategy. It
will prepare 30 experienced teachers to serve as mentors for 60 novice teachers.
Project staff will work on content, pedagogy and mentoring skills with the 30
teachers in Massachusetts to improve their skills, knowledge and confidence so
they can work effectively with 60 novice science teacers. The goal of the
project is to decrease attrition of novice teachers and develop their capacity
to teach standards-based science. Key project components include summer
institutes on physical, life and eath science; on-site classroom observation and
conferencing; monthly study groups and engagement of 45 district administrators.
