9505059 Bott The proposed research covers various topics from differential
topology, algebraic geometry and number theory: the topics include knots, smooth
manifolds, and symplectic geometry. Differential topology deals with the
existence and uniqueness of differentiable structures on a (topological) space -
a differentiable structure on a space enables one to do calculus on the space.
Interestingly enough, recent advances in theoretical particle physics are
fueling much of the exciting developments in this area of pure mathematics.
