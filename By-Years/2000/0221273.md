This dissertation investigates the rise of racial profiling as a political
issue in the civil rights movement. The history is seen as an instance of how
groups use cultural tools in political conflict. The results will demonstrate
that politics are profoundly cultural and culture is often profoundly political.
The research analyzes the cultural framing process in public discourse through a
systematic content analysis of newspapers, TV news, legislation, legal
arguments, and judicial decisions. Interviews with key leaders will help reveal
how deliberate cultural strategies were developed to mobilize opposition to
racial profiling.
