Sacred Heart University will conduct a three-year science and mathematics staff
development program serving grades K-12 in fourteen districts in southwestern
Connecticut. The project combines the resources of the well established Project
NETWORK of the Fairfield County Public Schools and Sacred Heart's SMART Center.
The new title, "SMARTNET: A Teacher Enhancement Program for Precollege Science
and Mathematics Education" reflects this combination. The project will improve
science and mathematics education, revitalize maturing faculties, and help
prepare for desegregation. Content areas include biological sciences, physical
sciences, mathematics, and instructional technology. Sacred Heart University,
the Fairfield County Public Schools, and the participating districts have
contributed an amount equal to 87% of the National Science Foundation request.
