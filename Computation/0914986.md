This proposal centers on the introduction and analysis of a new class of spline
functions, the first such endeavor since the introduction of polynomial and
exponential box splines in the mid 1980's. Coined in the proposal "modulation
splines", the novel class represents a dramatic departure from all classical
spline paradigms: While modulation splines are "splines", i.e., smooth compactly
supported piecewise-analytic functions over polyhedral domains, they are new
even in one dimension. In the short term, it is proposed to develop the basic
theory and fundamental properties of modulation splines, with emphasis on 2D
constructions. In the longer term, it is envisioned that modulation splines will
serve as the backbone of a new hierarchical anisotropic multivariate data
representation methodology, representation that is different and complementary
to the prevailing Fourier and wavelet ones. As is the case with all spline
theories and constructions, the project lies at the interface between
mathematical analysis and computational science. The impetus for the project,
however, comes from a topic in non-commutative algebra known as Macdonald
polynomials, a topic that is related to Lie algebras, and to group
representations. As such, the project provides further evidence to the unlimited
potential in the intraconnectivity within mathematical science, and is
anticipated to provide a channel of cross-fertilization among analysis,
computation, and algebra.

The project's core strength vis-a-vis NSF's broader merit criteria is the
intrinsic significance of the research area: data representation in general, and
spline approximation in particular, are critical disciplines in science, and
progress in these areas may have a widespread multiplier effect in a broad range
of disciplines. In fact, the theory and practice of "spline functions" stands
out as one of the most significant contributions of the mathematical community
to science and technology. Splines have become indispensable tools in computer-
aided design and manufacturing of cars and airplanes, in the production of
printers' typesets, in automated cartography, in the production of movies, and
in many other areas, often concealed at the core of elaborate software packages.
In addition to their direct utility for the representation of curves and
surfaces, splines, in one as well as several variables, are the preferred
backbone for the wavelet representation, and are the prevailing choice for
smoothing subdivision algorithms in computer-aided geometric design. The
recognition of the impact of the mathematical research of splines culminated
earlier in this decade in the awarding of a Medal of Science to Carl de Boor by
the U.S. president.
