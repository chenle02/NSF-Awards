This is a three-year renewal of a U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project in
robotics between Rajko Tomovic of the Institute of Industrial Engineering in
Novi Sad and George A. Bekey of the University of Southern California's Robotics
Institute. Its objective is to develop a new approach to the design and control
of multifingered robot hands using biological principles. The previous grant
resulted in the development of a robotic hand. In the next phase the
investigators propose to develop a new, improved model emphasizing better sensor
development, the integration of vision and tactile control, and development of
theoretical models for grasping and control. This international collaboration
which joins two unique and complementary research groups has proved highly
successful over the last three years and has resulted in a significant list of
joint publications and two conferences. This project was approved by the
U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on Cooperation in Science and Technology and is
supported through a joint fund consisting of matching contributions from the
U.S. and Yugoslav governments. The U.S. contribution is provided annually by the
Department of State. No NSF funds are involved. The grants are composed
principally of Yugoslav dinars and made to the principal Yugoslav institute.
Grants include travel for U.S. scientists to Yugoslavia and a modest dollar
allowance for Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in the U.S.
