Intellectual Merit: The PIs propose a two-year project to map the distribution
of climate-sensitive landforms throughout Northern Victoria Land between the
Convoy Range and Cape Adare. This work will produce geospatial products to aid
their geomorphic work on ice sheet stability and landscape evolution.
Specifically, the PI will investigate the potential for extensive surface
melting and ice-sheet retreat with modest warming in areas north of the Convoy
Range in Northern Victoria Land. The hypothesis is that if key landform elements
of the Dry Valleys assemblage are lacking in NVL it suggests a major variation
in current climate conditions, and perhaps changes in climate evolution. The
proposed work will also benefit the broader research community, as it will
demonstrate the potential for using geospatial imagery in geomorphic research
and produce geospatial products that can be used by other researchers.

Broader impacts: This work will help the research community better leverage the
investment being made in the Polar Geospatial Center (PGC) and will help further
demonstrate the significance of satellite imagery for doing ?virtual? field work
in the Polar regions. More effective use of satellite imagery by field
scientists in Antarctica will help reduce the logistical footprint on the
Continent. The proposed research will support one graduate student at Boston
University who will be trained in image analysis, map production, Antarctic
geomorphology, and geospatial technologies. The proposed work will help to forge
stronger links between PGC and Boston University?s Digital Image Analyses Lab
(DIAL).
