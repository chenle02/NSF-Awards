9554517 Sameh This proposal outlines a plan for recruiting and training a set of
high-quality graduate students focusing on the important area of information
discovery on the information super-highway through human interface design for
access to computers and networked information. The plan builds upon faculty
excellence in this area to create a focused program of research that will make
Minnesota a leader in this emerging area. The plan also contains several
inlovative components that will ensure that we can recruit top- quality
students, including women and students of color, who are currently severely
underrepresented in computer science. And, it provides a complete graduate
experience for these students including industrial internships, training and
practice in teaching, and a supportive, mentored environment. At its completion,
this program will produce PhDs that are fully capable of becoming productive
faculty members at research universities and top- ranked colleges. In the
process, we hope to establish a pipeline bringing the best graduates from Howard
University and Vassar College to the University of Minnesota for graduate
degree.
