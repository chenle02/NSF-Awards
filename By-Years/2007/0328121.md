Roy Periana, University of Southern California, is supported by the Inorganic,
Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program for the development and study
of new catalysts. The focus of the proposed work is the rational design of
homogeneous catalysts for the conversion of hydrocarbons, such as methane and
benzene, to the corresponding alcohols with higher selectivities and lower
temperatures than existing processes. These homogeneous catalytic systems
involve transition metals, often platinum or iridium, supported by carefully
designed ligand systems that will stabilize the catalysts to the protic media
and redox as well as geometry changes inherent in hydrocarbon functionalization
catalysis to generate alcohol products. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is made
through the NSF-EPA Partnership for Environmental Research, Technology for a
Sustainable Environment Program (TSE). This research will advance the discovery,
development, and use of innovative technologies and approaches to avoid or
minimize the generation of pollutants at the source. Students trained by this
project will gain expertise in synthetic, mechanistic and
spectroscopic&lt;br/&gt;methods as well as an understanding of "green" chemical
manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;
