Numerical techniques in control and optimization will be developed. These
include algorithms for constrained optimization which combine conjugate
gradients, an augmented Lagrangian, and multiplier updates. In addition,
applications related to wave propagation in elastic materials and the simulation
of electric fields in a thunderstorm will be investigated.
