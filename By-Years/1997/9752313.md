The primary goal of the Student-Centered Activities for Large Enrollment
University Physics (SCALE-UP) Project is to determine the best way to establish
a highly collaborative, hands-on, computer-rich, interactive learning
environment in large-enrollment physics courses. We know from extensive
educational research that students should collaborate on interesting tasks and
be actively involved with the material they are learning. The physics department
at North Carolina State University has had tremendous success with this type of
course and would now like to "scale-up" the innovations so that students taking
the large enrollment engineering physics courses can benefit. The project folds
together lecture and lab with multiple instructors so that it should provide an
economical solution to the problem. The project involves the development,
evaluation, and dissemination of new curricular materials that will support this
type of learning. The SCALE-UP Project has the potential to radically change the
way physics is taught at large colleges and universities. The pedagogical
techniques should be general enough to encourage similar reforms in other large
science, engineering, and mathematics classes.
