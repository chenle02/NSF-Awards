This special award will give graduate student Eva Charfauros additional
flexibility in pursuing her graduate studies and research initiation in
sociology. The proposed research will undertake a comparative study of two
university programs designed for 'third world and minority students' (one at
Brown, the other at the University of California at San Diego). Through a
combination of site visits, informal interviews and retrieval of archival
materials, this PI will study the relationship between the organization and
administration of these programs and the relative achievement of their founding
goals -- to enhance the access of minorities to higher education and their
academic success in college. This is a timely topic closely related to the
Foundation's abiding concern for the increased recruitment of minorities in
science and engineering. This award grows out of a special directorate level
program to enhance the graduate education of previous applicants of minority
fellowship programs receiving honorable mention ratings. This award should
strengthen minority research participation in sociology.
