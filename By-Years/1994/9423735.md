The principal goal of this project is to design error control codes for "byte-
organized" systems using a new error control model. In a byte-organized system,
the hardware is partitioned such that each part produced a subset of hits in the
output. For example, a memory may be organized as one byte per card. In this
case, each card produces a byte in the memory word. For such systems, a new
error control model called the bit/byte bounded model is being developed.
Briefly, this model can be described using tow parameters, say t and u. The
codes designed using the bit/byte bounded model can tolerate up to t bit errors
confined to a must u bytes. Unlike the existing approaches, the bit/byte bounded
model can interpolate between the traditional bit and 1 byte error models. Also,
the proposed model can be used to reduce the number of checkbits by trading a
small amount of error control capability.
