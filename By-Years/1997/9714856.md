9714856 Dong This award is an activity under the US/PRC Earthquake Research
Protocol, Annex III. Two research programs have been recently conducted, one in
the US and the other in the People's Republic of China, on integrated earthquake
hazard mitigation strategies for metropolitan cities. The programs produced two
computer loss estimation software systems, HAZUS97 bu RMS, Inc., and P95-06 by
IEM of the State Seismological Bureau, respectively, which are similar in scope
but otherwise differ significantly in content. This reflects the differences in
natural and institutional focus. This project will involve a joint effort to
study the two software systems to understand their similarities and differences,
with a view towards improving both. In addition to joint activities of exchange
and cooperation, important tasks to be performed include assessing the extension
of HAZUS97 to other countries with different seismic, geologic and building
stock conditions. ***
