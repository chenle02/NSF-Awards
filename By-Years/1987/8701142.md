This is a proposal for partial support of a 4 day meeting on Eukaryotic
Chromosome Replication to be held in September, 1987 as part of an annual series
of symposia on cancer at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. The topics to be
covered include: replication of viral genomes, chromosome replication and gene
amplification, replication proteins, structure and function of telomeres and
centomeres, control of cell cycle progression, and related subjects. Drs.
Stillman and Kelly are well known for pioneering studies of the in vitro
replication of SV40 and adenovirus DNAs. They propose to hold a conference which
will cover a wide variety of basic research in the areas of DNA replication (in
vivo and in vitro), chromosome structure, and the regulation of the number of
copies of particular genes that are in the chromosome (gene amplification).
These are important problems of current interest to many investigators. The Cold
Spring Harbor Laboratory provides an efficient but informal environment that
stimulates discussion. The meeting should be timely and successful.
