In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms
(CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Arthur G. Suits of
Wayne State University and his graduate student, undergraduate student and post-
doctoral researcher colleagues are investigating the physical and chemical
properties of important small molecules. The ultimate goal of the work by
Professor Suits and his group is to develop a better understanding of the
reactivity of atmospherically important or chemically interesting molecules. The
young researchers working on this project will receive training in state-of-the
art methods from a leader in the field of physical
chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prof. Suits and his research group will use
imaging of spin-polarized hydrogen atoms produced from excited polyatomic
molecules to unravel the details of the photochemistry of important molecules,
including water and methane. The results from work like this will help
scientists understand the photochemistry of planetary atmospheres. In further
experiments, the Suits Group will use a chirped-pulse, uniform flow spectrometer
to study the reaction kinetics of unstable chemical intermediates, including
exotic species like HOONO. The goal of this study is to understand the important
role that these fleeting intermediates play in complex, real-world reacting
systems.
