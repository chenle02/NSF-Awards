The National Conference on Undergraduate Research provides increased national
awareness of the importance of research experiences in the education of
undergraduate students. The first conference, held in April, 1987, demonstrated,
through the attendance of more than 450 students, faculty and administrators
from over a hundred different colleges and universities located in 30 states
together with the enthusiasm of the participants, the need for this conference
as an annual event. With funding provided by the National Science Foundation,
future conferences will attract additional participants, especially
underrepresented groups, who have the ability to advance the development of
research with undergraduate students in their institutional environment and
nationally.
