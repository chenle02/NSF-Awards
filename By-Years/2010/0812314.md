This proposal addresses novel ways of indexing large music databases
programmatically. It proposes to use melody, rhythm, and to some extent lyrics
to index musical databases. The PI proposes to build a search engine for music
that takes sung examples as input for searching relevant songs. The search
engine adapts to individual needs through feedback and ongoing personalization
to improve the search results. Finding ways to automatically index, label, and
access multimedia content (such as music documents) is a research question that
is increasing in importance as multimedia databases proliferate and
grow.&lt;br/&gt;
