This project will investigate the properties of a new semantics for (possibly)
unstratified logic programs and knowledge bases, called the well-founded
semantics. Certain concepts have a natural expression using "unstratified" rules
in a knowledge base, but have no formulation using "stratified" rules. The
recently formulated well-founded semantics is defined for both "stratified" and
"unstratified" logic programs and knowledge bases. Initially, the investigation
will address theoretical issues that have a bearing on the usability and
implementability of the semantics. These issues include the relative expressive
power of the semantics, algorithms for recognizing programs (sets of rules) that
can be implemented "efficiently", and algorithms for executing such programs,
particularly over unstratified knowledge bases. The latter part of the project
will begin implementation of prototype analyzers and translators, based on
algorithms developed in the beginning of the project. Additional goals of the
project will be to develop useful guidelines for logic program design and
knowledge base design that ensure that all valid queries have a well-defined
answer in the well-founded semantics, to explore extensions to the rule language
to allow guards and set formation, and to study related issues of parallel
computation.
