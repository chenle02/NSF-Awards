This IT Security workshop will focus on bringing Innovation to market in the IT
Security sector. One objective is to provide connections to the academic and
small business community that is working in this area. Speakers from the venture
industry as well as technology officers from potential strategic partners will
convey "lessons learned" and best practices to increase commercialization
success. After the workshop is complete, leaders from the community will be more
experienced with the NSF SBIR/STTR program and companies will walk away with
rich contacts with future business development potential.

The NSF's SBIR/STTR program makes approximately $110mm in grants on an annual
basis and maintaining and improving commercialization of these efforts through
public-private partnerships is considered a strategic thrust for the effort.
Supporting workshops specifically-targeted to areas such as IT security is one
way that NSF can as a catalyst to establish more effective public-private
partnerships and thus increase the commercialization impact of the program.
