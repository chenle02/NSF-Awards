Conceptual change has been a significant component of all major changes of
theory in science. Attempts by philosophers and historians of science to
characterize conceptual change have led to two main views: conceptual change is
continuous and cumulative and conceptual change is discontinuous and abrupt. Dr.
Nersessian has found, however, that fine-structure analyses of transition
periods between theories show both characterizations to be inadequate.
Conceptual change is continuous but not simply cumulative. Providing an
explanatory account for the historical data requires an investigation into the
dynamics of how conceptual structures change. With the support of this grant,
Dr. Nersessian will examine actual conceptual changes in science in light of
cognitive theories of heuristic reasoning, conceptualization and categorization,
and conceptual change. The extent of fit between these theories and three major
conceptual changes will be investigated. The historical transitions she will be
examining as case studies for her project are the move from medieval to
Newtonian theories of motion, the subsequent move from Newtonian theories of
motion to the special and general theories of relativity, and the move from
Newtonian mechanics to quantum mechanics. Her analysis should deepen our
understanding of how conceptual structures emerge and are adopted by scientific
communities, and should also open up new areas of investigation in the cognitive
sciences.
