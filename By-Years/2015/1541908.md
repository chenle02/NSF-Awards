PI: Shah, Sameer &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1541908 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
PI proposes to develop advanced evaluation criteria for peripheral nerve
electrodes, which may alter nerve structure, biomechanics and physiological
function, using non-invasive imaging modalities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Micro-CT
and ultra short echo time MRI (UTE) will be used to study the structure-function
effects of cuff electrodes (CEs) and Utah Slanted Electrode Arrays (USEAs)
placed on the sciatic nerve between the hip and the knee (mid thigh) of rats.
The training received by the graduate student and undergraduate student working
on the project at the FDA will be excellent. Each research Objective describes
experimental methods involved that would be appropriate for high school students
as well as undergraduate and graduate students.
