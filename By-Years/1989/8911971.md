This project will support the Southeastern-Atlantic Differential Equations
Conference to be held October 13-14, 1989 at the University of North Carolina at
Charlotte. The conference will cover topics in ordinary and partial differential
equations, integral equations, functional differential equations, and related
areas in mathematical physics and numerical analysis. The purpose of the
conference is to encourage and enhance research in differential equations by
providing an opportunity for researchers and students in this field at
institutions in the Southeast to develop interactions and exchange ideas and
information. There will be three invited one-hour talks by Professor Shui-Nee
Chow, Paul Fife, and Gary Sod, as well as a number of twenty-minute contributed
papers.
