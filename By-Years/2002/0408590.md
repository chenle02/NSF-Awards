The study will be performed by the National Academy of Sciences, and will
provide guidance to help design an Arctic land, atmosphere, and ocean observing
network. The study committee will provide thoughts on the overarching philosophy
and conceptual foundation for such an international network and, where possible,
provide concrete advice to move the concept toward implementation. The committee
will identify key variables, briefly review the purposes and extent of existing
and planned global observing systems and platforms, highlighting critical
spatial,&lt;br/&gt;temporal or disciplinary gaps of importance to the Arctic,
and describe the infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;needed to create a comprehensive
Arctic observing network. The committee will comment on&lt;br/&gt;how to ensure
sound data management and recommend a technical strategy to
ensure&lt;br/&gt;efficient, coordinated implementation and operation of an
Arctic observing network in an&lt;br/&gt;international
setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
