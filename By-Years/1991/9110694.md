Frogs are vertebrates with two distinct auditory organs, rather than the single
cochlea of mammals. A great deal is known about frog calling communication
behavior, and about the physiology of frog auditory systems. However, unlike the
case in mammals, the anatomical details and ultrastructure of how the sensory
hair cells are innervated is poorly known. Such details are important in forming
hypotheses about mechanisms for the observed frequency selectivity and
physiology of frog hearing. This work will use light and electron microscopy to
assess how the receptor cells are innervated by the auditory nerve in both these
organs, and then to study the detailed architecture of the functional contancts,
the synapses, of single nerve fibers in selected regions where function is
known. The results will be important not only to comparative aspects of auditory
function including physiology and behavior among species, but also to general
principles of frequency coding mechanisms which are crucial to auditory
neuroscience.
