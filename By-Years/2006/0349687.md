0349687&lt;br/&gt;Farquharson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This
Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop two prototype
anthrax detector systems designed to screen mail entering a postal facility
and/or to identify and to stop distribution of anthrax containing mail as it
passes through a sorter. These systems will be able to detect 2 micrograms of
spores captured from a letter containing as little as 100 micrograms, as well as
similar concentrations on contaminated surfaces. The Phase I project
demonstrated feasibility by successfully developing a vacuum/filter collection
system that captured Bacillus cereus spores from an envelope passing through a
mail sorter, which were detected by Raman spectroscopy. Some 23 micrograms of B.
cereus spores were measured in 9 seconds using 1064 nm excitation, with an
estimated limit of detection of 10 micrograms or 1 million spores in 10 seconds.
The Phase II project will complete the design of the anthrax detector system,
with improved sensitivity nd selectivity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
impact of this project will be on the safety and security of mail handling and
delivery across the United States.&lt;br/&gt;
