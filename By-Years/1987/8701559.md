Knight is continuing her work in recursive model theory. Over the past two
years, she has obtained several results on degrees of models realizing
prescribed sets of bounded complexity types (finitary or infinitary). The
problem of characterizing the degrees of isomorphic copies of a given model now
seems approachable. Knight and Slaman have a characterization for models of
finite Scott height. The characterization is unpleasantly complicated, and they
hope to simplify it. The recent results use a powerful method of Harrington. In
addition to using the method to obtain further results, Knight hopes to come to
a better understanding of the method itself. Ash developed a related method and
proved a theorem giving general conditions under which his method works. Ash and
Knight have begun trying to compare the two methods. All of these investigations
shed further light on the theoretical limits of computing power, a matter that
becomes increasingly relevant and fascinating as the actual limits of computing
power expand with each generation of new machines.
