Abstract Stephenson This award is to partially support a workshop to be held in
Knoxville, Tennessee, June 8 thought June 12, 1998. It will bring together a
group of researchers and students in what can loosely be characterized as
discrete conformal geometry - a mixture of topology, analysis, and
combinatorics.
