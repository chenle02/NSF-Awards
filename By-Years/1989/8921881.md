Boston University will host a Workshop on Computer Aids for the Physically
Handicapped (BU-CAPH) on October 2-3, 1989 under the coordination of Dr. Bryant
York of the Computer Science Department of Boston University. The workshop is
sponsored by the Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE)
Directorate of the National Science Foundation (NSF). Approximately twenty-five
participants will assist CISE in assessing the needs and planning programmatic
activities involving the use of computers to aid the physically handicapped in
education and research. The participants will be separated into three or four
small working groups and develop recommendations for the NSF/CISE Directorate.
