This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will create a
sustainable film to keep food fresh in flexible packaging. This project advances
the use of abundant woody biomass residue, typically drawn from residue from
forestry, agriculture, or building demolition, for a new plastic film This
bioplastic film will address global demand for lightweight, fresh food packaging
that is environmentally sound. Vapor barrier, flexible packaging is a $30B/yr
global market, and the US produces 1B tons/yr of woody biomass - ample to supply
the global demand for high barrier packaging. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
makes renewable, high barrier packaging from cellulose by deconstructing it to
the sugar levoglucosan and then precisely re-polymerizing a nanostructured film
with intrinsic strength, flexibility, temperature resistance, and vapor barrier
properties. The innovation is biobased, poly(2,3)Glucose thermoplastic with
intrinsic vapor barrier properties. Without laminations, crosslinks, or
additives poly(2,3)Glucose biodegradable thermoplastic can be continuously
recycled or decomposed in the environment. A recent breakthrough in the cost of
pyrolyzing lignocellulose to levoglucosan makes levoglucosan cost competitive
with fossil fuel feed stocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
