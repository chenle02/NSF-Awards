This award will support a residential doctoral and postdoctoral fellowship and
mentoring program at the American Bar Foundation (ABF). Over the three-year
grant period, the ABF will award two two-year doctoral fellows and one three-
year postdoctoral fellow to young scholars studying interdisciplinary topics at
the intersection of law and inequality. This program offers the mentoring,
networking, and professional development activities necessary to help young
scholars excel in their respective career paths. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
fellowship and mentoring program will cultivate cutting edge research on law and
inequality and will support the training and mentoring of emerging scholars in
interdisciplinary and disciplinary departments studying law and inequality. It
is designed to address the financial burdens of graduate education and the need
for mentoring and networking that are crucial for junior scholar success, and
that can be so elusive in interdisciplinary fields. The fellowship and mentoring
program will enhance the diversity of research and researchers and enrich the
scientific study and knowledge of law and inequality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
