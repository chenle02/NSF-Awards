This award supports cooperative research between Brian Glenister, University of
Iowa, and Zhou Zuren, Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology, Chinese
Academy of Sciences, on the Permian period, a time of profound physical and
biotic change. Biostratigraphy is a fundamental base for much of the basic and
applied work in geology, and this proposal promises to contribute to
establishing a Permian global stratotype. Through ongoing investigation of the
Permian systems and its ammonoids, valuable collections available in China and
the US can be documented and correlated under this collaboration.
