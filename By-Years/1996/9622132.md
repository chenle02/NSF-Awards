Twomey 9622132 This research planning grant centers on investigation into the
analysis and maximization of large complex industrial systems through Advanced
Distributed Simulation (ADS). ADS technology provides an interactive, time-
consistent synthetic environment for geographically distributed simulations. It
is a combination of live, virtual and constructive simulation. This research
focuses on ADS as a tool for the analysis and maximization of large complex
manufacturing systems. ADS provides the capability for enterprise-wide modeling
(within the enterprise: design and manufacturing processes; and outside the
enterprise: vendors and small supporting manufacturers) through a fully
integrated system of individual simulations, where the ultimate goal is the
maximization of the entire system. The outcome of the proposed research will (1)
highlight the advantages and potential benefits of fully integrated systems for
the analysis and maximization of an entire industrial system, and (2) contribute
to the advancement of simulation aggregation specifically addressing issues
related to ADS. A planning grant is necessary so that: (1) a complete
understanding of ADS may be gained, (2) opportunities for an ADS application to
a targeted local manufacturer may be investigated, (3) a simple but
representative prototype may be developed with at least one neural network
aggregation model, and (4) a full-scale NSF proposal can be written.
