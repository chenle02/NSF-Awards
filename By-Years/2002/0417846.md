Economists have developed a wide variety of models to predict how economic
agents will interact strategically over time. However, many of these models
suffer from a lack of predictive power because multiple equilibria are predicted
by the standard equilibrium definitions used in game theory. Recent research
shows that in some special classes of games, adding a richer set of possible
behavior to the game allows reputations to form that dictate a single outcome.
This project will apply these ideas to a large and important class of games,
those that model bargaining behavior. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will
place particular emphasis on understanding what happens when bargainers are not
fully informed about some of the opponent's goals or payoffs. The goal is to
develop stronger and more robust predictions in this central area of economic
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader implications include the ability to conduct
much stronger empirical tests of economic models. Once tested, the models will
allow economists to give much better advice to policy-makers and others who use
bargaining to reach agreements between nations, interest groups, firms, and
individuals.
