Many important technologies share two features: they are embodied in durable
goods and training, and they are subject to network externalities where each
user's benefit from using the system increases with the number of other users
adopting compatible systems. Often, it is not easy to introduce new, improved
technology while retaining full compatibility with the installed base without
compromising performance. Frequently, at issue is when should society switch
from an established technology to an incompatible, but superior alternative; and
how if it all, should the transition be managed. Examples of such transitions
include the shift from LPs to compact disks, the change from DOS to OS/2 or Unix
in personal computers, the change from black and white to color TV, and the
impending transition to high definition TV. The purpose of this research is to
analyze the transition from one generation of technology to the next in markets
where network externalities make it desirable or essential for users to
coordinate and adopt products that are compatible. The research focuses on the
problems faced in making a centralized choice of a new technology. Such
centralized choice may be made by government or a voluntary standard-setting
organization, as is frequently the case. For a given mew technology, the
investigators will analyze the path of consumer adoption following standard-
setting, the effects of granting strong or weak intellectual property
protection, and the timing of standard-setting and technology introduction. In
addition, the principles involved in choosing among competing systems will be
analyzed in light of uncertainty about improvements likely to be achieved over
time and the ultimate cost of rival systems.
