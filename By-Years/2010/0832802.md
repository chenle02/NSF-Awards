The Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center (NSEC) at the University of
Pennsylvania, the Nano/Bio Interface Center (NBIC), designs and controls
molecular functionality, quantifies behavior of individual molecules and
interactions at organic/inorganic interfaces to establish the foundation for
understanding the interface of physical and biological systems. The NSEC unites
investigators from five schools (the School of Engineering and Applied Science,
the School of Medicine, the School of Arts and Sciences, Wharton Business
School, and the Graduate School of Education) to provide, not only new
directions for the life sciences but also for engineering, in a two-way flow
essential to fully realizing the benefits of the intersection of biology with
nanotechnology. A comprehensive program uses fundamental research enterprises as
a platform for curriculum development, pre-college educational programs, out
reach to the community, and commercialization.

Two multi disciplinary research teams are focused on: optoelectronic function in
synthetic biomolecules and mechanical motion of molecules from physiological
systems. In each area physical interfaces probe, control, or influence the
outcome. A cross-cutting initiative brings together investigators who develop
nanoscale measurement tools to produce the next wave of innovation in probes of
molecular function and enables research in both teams. To enable these advances
the NBIC has established the Nano/Bio Probe Facility. The Nano/Bio Probe
Innovation Facility assembles a comprehensive set of enabling research tools to
support research interactions that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to
sustain. The Facility is unique to Penn, where the newest advances in probing
single molecule and nanostructure behavior are made available to the research
community. The facility opened in 2005 and now has over 80 users.

The NBIC established and leads a large portfolio of educational programs. An
undergraduate minor in Nanotechnology now serves 70 students from 3 schools and
with representation from all engineering departments. The graduate certificate
in Nanotechnology has an enrolment of 20 students. An annual summer high school
academy offers a residential program on Nanotechnology that obtains enrollment
of ~25 students/year. A strong theme of NBIC outreach addresses professional
development of pre-college teachers in the Philadelphia region. A highlight is
the Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) program that is a collaboration with
Drexel University. A partnership with Alabama State University has established
programs to impact the pipeline of future scientists and engineers. A variety of
community outreach activities are highlighted at the annual NanoDay@Penn.
