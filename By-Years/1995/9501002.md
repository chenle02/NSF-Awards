PI: Vaninsky DMS-9501002 Three problems of statistical mechanics of one
dimensional systems will be investigated. The first is a construction of
dynamics for the nonlinear Schrodinger and modified Korteveg-de Vries type
equations on the entire line for rough initial data from the support of
translation-invariant Gibbsian distribution. The second is construction of the
action-angle variables for integrable equations on the entire line for such
initial data. The third is the soliton gas conjecture. Nonequilibrium
statistical mechanics studies properties of dynamical systems describing big or
infinite systems of interacting particles. The Hamiltonian structure of the
equations of motion allows one to define in the phase space the so-called
Gibbsian measures, invariant under the dynamics. These measures are usually
constructed form the basic Hamiltonian and other classical conserved quantities
such as the number of particles, integrals of momentum and angular momentum.
Statistical mechanics is based on Gibb's postulate which states that this finite
parameter family of measures exhausts the class of all translation invariant
measures with weak long-range dependence.
