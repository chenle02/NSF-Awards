Recently one has witnessed tremendous developments in research in geometry and
topology, which are two central areas in mathematics. In particular, major
progresses have been made in important questions in subjects such as geometric
analysis, Riemannian geometry, topological field theory, and Gromov-Witten
theory. The Great Lakes Geometry Conference 2011, to be held in Ohio State
University, will bring together experts who work in the areas related to
topological field theory, Gromov- Witten theory, and geometric analysis to
discuss exciting recent developments and to provide a common ground where
mathematicians share ideas and visions towards the goal of further our
understanding of these subjects.

The Great Lakes Geometry Conference (GLGC) is a well-established conference of
geometry and topology held in the Great Lakes region. The year 2011 conference
is its 12-th anniversary and will be held in the Ohio State University in
Columbus. The two main themes of the GLGC 2011 are Gromov-Witten theory and
geometric analysis. In this conference, the PIs draw the speakers from a diverse
spectrum of active research areas in geometry and mathematical physics.
Gathering the experts of various aspects of the main themes will provide a
common ground where mathematicians share ideas and visions and will encourage
collaborations between researchers in the areas. An important goal of this
conference is to expose graduate students and early career mathematicians in the
related fields to some recent exciting new developments in this active area of
geometry and physics. The conference will benefot the students and the early
career mathematicians at the Ohio State University and other Midwestern
universities, encourage interaction between the universities in the Midwestern
region and beyond, and help graduate students and post-docs to work in these
exciting areas. Conference website: http://www.math.osu.edu/hhtseng/glgc11
