Numerical simulations of the interactions of fast flowing plasma with non-
magnetized bodies are used to isolate the ionospheric phenomena unique to those
conditions - and to compare that ionospheric response with ionospheric
conditions characteristic of plasma flow past magnetized bodies. In this way,
ionospheric morphology and its solar wind or magnetospheric drivers are better
understood for both types of ionospheres. The Magneto-Hydrodynamic (MHD) model
simulator features spherically symmetric, multi-species capability, and achieves
10 km spatial resolution in the ionospheric regions. The numerical code is
developed for Space Weather research purposes, and its application in this
research demonstrates the mutually beneficial synergy between the fields of
computational fluid dynamics, aerospace engineering, planetary atmospheres, and
aeronomy.&lt;br/&gt;
