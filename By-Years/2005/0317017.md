Professor Peter Wolynes, of the University of California San Diego, is supported
by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to perform investigations
on the energy landscapes of glasses, liquids and solutions. The work deals with
extending the PI's earlier random first-order transition theory of glasses
(RFOT) so that a more quantitative understanding of the glassy state results.
The research focuses on several aspects. First, relevant experimental
observations and computational tests are identified which directly test the RFOT
and supply useful information for extensions of the RFOT. In addition the use of
long-lived glassy states for representing "basis sets" or possible
configurations for the simulation of the dynamics of liquids is being
quantified. A third aspect is in identifying how chemical reactions occurring
within the glass lead to aging and degradation of the materials. The fourth
problem area deals with extensions of the quantum theory of glasses that will
make the theory amenable to very low temperature investigations. The work
requires significant computational resources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work
addresses theoretical and computational issues related to the prediction of the
properties of glasses. Glasses, especially those composed of silicon, represent
a very cheap source of material. Different variations of glasses have proved to
be useful in many applications such as fiber optics, insulators, semiconductors
and solar-energy harvesting. Computationally aided understanding and prediction
of glass properties can lead to more inexpensive and environmentally friendly
materials. Examples of technologies that may be positively impacted by these
studies include communications, photovoltaic cells, optoelectronic materials,
lightweight insulated buildings and better plastics. The ability to develop
materials from glasses has positive environmental implications since the
requisite natural resources are plentiful and the processing is
clean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
