This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in the
general area of materials chemistry and in the subfields of organic synthesis
and physical organic chemistry. Although the number of uses for infrared (IR)
radiation is constantly growing, the technology needed for high-speed modulation
of IR radiation is still in a state of infancy. Most IR modulators are
mechanical in nature, although some work has been done using inherently slow
nematic liquid crystal optical valves. Dr. Thurmes will develop ferroelectric
liquid crystals for use in non-mechanical electro- optic shutters. The liquid
crystals which are developed will be suitable for use in an IR radiation valve
which, depending on the configuration used, will have high throughput (up to
90%), wide spectral-band operation (e.g., 3-5 or 8-l4 um), high switching speeds
(50us), and low power consumption (l0uJ/cm2/switching).
