As the number of cores in high performance computing (HPC) systems continues to
grow, the mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) for large HPC systems is becoming shorter
than the execution time of many HPC applications. Fault tolerance is becoming
one of the critical techniques for the effective use of large HPC
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops highly efficient algorithmic
fault tolerance techniques for selected linear algebra computations to tolerate
both fail-stop and fail-continue failures. &lt;br/&gt;Fail-stop failures, where
the failed computation crashes, are often tolerated by checkpoint. This project
removes checkpoint from fault tolerance for selected linear algebra computations
so that neither checkpoint nor rollback is necessary for the protection of these
computations. Fail-continue failures, where the corrupted computation continues
to make progress but the computation results cannot be trusted any more, are
usually tolerated offline by checking the computation results after the
computation finishes. This project designs novel online fault tolerance
techniques to detect fail-continue failures in the middle of the computation so
that better efficiency can be achieved by stopping the corrupted computations in
the middle of the computation in a timely manner.
