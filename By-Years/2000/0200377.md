This planning grant award is the first step toward the setting up of the Center
for Experimental Research in Computer Systems (CERCS) seeks to address complex
communication/computation systems by bringing together researchers with
knowledge of the key technologies underlying these systems, and thereby, create
research teams that can address future systems and applications in a fashion
that is integrated across multiple technologies and heterogeneous system
components. The mission of CERCS is to develop new hardware and software
technologies, to create technological advances, and to take advantage of these
advances to remove technological barriers faced by complex, integrated systems.

The CERCS approach is experimental and fosters research in which new
technologies are evaluated experimentally, with large-scale applications and on
systems of substantial size or complexity. The aim is to understand the
challenging application requirements that cause novel system-level research,
where insights at the system level motivate changes in how certain applications
are implemented, and where new system technologies enable new classes of
applications. The Center will work with external partners to comprehend their
needs and requirements, and to experiment with alternative solutions and
approaches.
