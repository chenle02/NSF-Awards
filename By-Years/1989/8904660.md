The PI will develop dynamically self-consistent simulations of the plate/mantle
system. In these simulations, non-subducting continental masses will interact
with ridges, subducting slabs, and long wavelength temperature anomalies in the
interior of the fluid. The dynamic topography will be computed on the top
surface of the fluid, from which eustatic sea level fluctuations will be
computed for the continental masses. The resulting simulations will be compared
to the history of oceanic ridge spreading over the last 150 my, the history of
subduction, the history of eustatic sea-level over the last 500 my
paleogeographic positions of the continents, and present day seismic tomography
and geoid. Through comparison of the numerical experiments with geophysical and
geological observations, one will obtain an unprecedented view of the physics of
sea level change.
