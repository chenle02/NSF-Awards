This award provides support for participation in the conference "p-adic Methods
in Number Theory" held at the University of California, Berkeley on May 26-30,
2015. Since their conception by Kurt Hensel around 1900, p-adic numbers have
played a central role in number theory; for example, they are used in a crucial
way in the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. To a number theorist, p-adic numbers
are just as "real" -- and just as important -- as real numbers. Both are ways of
"filling in the gaps" left by considering just rational numbers. In their book
"Number Theory I: Fermat's Dream," Kato, Kurokawa, and Saito write poetically,
"In the long history of mathematics a number meant a real number, and it is only
relatively recently that we realized that there is a world of p-adic numbers. It
is as if those who had seen the sky only during the day are marveling at the
night sky. [ ] Just as we can see space objects better at night, we begin to see
the profound mathematical universe through the p-adic numbers." This conference
will bring together experts in the many different facets of p-adic numbers and
their applications, will promote a cross-fertilization of ideas between number
theorists of all stripes, will expose graduate students and postdocs to state-
of-the-art techniques and results, and will promote participation by
underrepresented minorities and women in high-level number theory research.

A conference on p-adic methods in number theory is timely and important, as many
spectacular recent number-theoretic advances have made use of deep p-adic
methods. We mention, for example, recent work establishing special cases of the
p-adic local Langlands correspondence; the proof that most hyperelliptic curves
of odd degree have just one rational point; developments on non-abelian Coleman
integration and integral points on curves; work on the fundamental curve of
p-adic Hodge theory; and recent results on perfectoid spaces. More Information
