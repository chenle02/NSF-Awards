Intellectual merit. Most human protein-coding genes contain the primary protein-
coding regions (exons) interrupted by non-coding regions (introns). In the
process of precursor-mRNA splicing, the introns must be excised and the exons
spliced together to generate an mRNA transcript suitable for translation into
protein. Precursor-mRNA splicing is catalyzed by a remarkably large and highly
dynamic "machine", the spliceosome. The spliceosome is formed by the assembly
onto a precursor-mRNA transcript of five RNA-protein complexes or U snRNPs. We
lack a clear understanding of how the U snRNPs initiate spliceosome assembly and
organize the spliceosome for catalysis. This gap in knowledge is due in large
part to experimental challenges posed by the spliceosome's large size, dynamic
properties, and necessity to use crude cell extract for its study. The aim of
this project is to elucidate how the initial events in the assembly of the U
snRNPs onto a precursor-mRNA transcript contribute to formation of an active
spliceosome that exhibits high fidelity. To accomplish this long-term goal, this
project will utilize new and innovative methods designed to "trap" the
spliceosome at early intermediate states of its reaction cycle and to aid the
visualization of its structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact. A long-term
goal of this project is to lay the foundation for an educational initiative
aimed at motivating students to engage in science and be exposed to how
understanding structure provides insight into function. Using new media, this
project aims to create an educational outreach that will engage high school
students in the sciences and provide their science teachers with training and
professional development on integration of new media and macromolecular
structures into their classrooms.
