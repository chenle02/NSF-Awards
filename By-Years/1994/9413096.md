9413096 Storm This proposal requests funds to support the attendance of advanced
U.S. graduate students at the 1994 Gordon Research Conference on the Chemistry
and Physics of Micostructure Fabrication. The conference, to be held June
26-July 1, 1994 at Brewster Academy in Wolfeboro, NH, is being organized by
Donald M. Tennant of AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories (Chairman) and Margaret B. Stern
of MIT Lincoln Laboratory (Chairman-Elect). The science of microstructure
fabrication is vital not only to today's information revolution but to the
fields of imaging and manipulation of chemical and biological structures. Future
progress in all these disciplines in paced by advances in the science and
technology of nanofabrication that will be discussed at this conference. The
conference format-a week of continuous interaction with experts in interrelated
fields in a casual setting-provides a particularly rewarding opportunity for
graduate students to exchange ideas with and to learn from this gathering of
leading researchers. ***
