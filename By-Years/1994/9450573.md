9450573 Swenson Proposal to Develop WINSM Consortium Infrastructure Seven
universities from Wyoming, Idaho, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Montana
propose to work together on an intensive one- year program to build the
foundation for the WINSM Consortium. The WINSM Consortium, for the first time,
brings together five EPSCoR states which have much in common, including low
population density, similar geographic and climatic conditions and natural
resource-based economies which are currently in transition. The Consortium
enables the five states to collectively pursue opportunities in science,
technology, and economic development which might otherwise be beyond their
individual capabilities or available resources, with the overall goal of
improving the quality and effectiveness of the five state's science and
technology infrastructure. During the funding period of this one-year proposal
to NSF EPSCoR, WINSM plans to establish the foundation necessary for the five
states to more effectively build on common strengths, address common problems,
and explore common opportunities in science, technology, and industrial
interaction. To this end, this proposal will provide the start-up funding needed
to: (1) provide technical assistance to both faculty research teams and small
businesses throughout the region to develop and pursue funding for research and
technology transfer programs; and (2) initiate working relationships with the
Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL), other government facilities, and
with industry to help the Consortium meet its goals. It is envisioned that at
the end of this one-year funding period, two to three major research initiatives
will be developed by the WINSM Consortium, including one which will develop
regionally appropriate environmental technologies involving the Idaho National
Engineering Laboratory, and another which will address rural manufacturing
development. A number of smaller inter-and intra-state research programs ar e
also anticipated as a result of this start-up activity. In addition, the
administrative framework needed to sustain long-term collaboration between the
five states will be in place.
