9617379 Marchand This is a collaborative project between researchers at the
Univ. of Pittsburgh, and the Univ. of California at San Diego (UCSD). The goal
of the project is to produce design analysis and virtual prototyping tools for
mixed technology free space optoelectronic information processing systems. The
design tools will be based on current work in modeling and simulation of
optoelectronic signals and devices at the Univ. of Pittsburgh, and device
fabrication, modeling and testing at UCSD. These efforts will be expanded to
include functional, physical and parametric models for devices and
interconnections using a framework that will support the composition of these
models into complete systems. The resulting optoelectronic system prototyping
tool suite will be made available to the academic community, and is expected to
accelerate the insertion of photonics technology in traditionally
microelectronic applications. ***
