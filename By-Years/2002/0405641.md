The PIs will conduct a deep-probing magnetotelluric (MT) Experiment across the
Mariana arc, to quantify the electrical conductivity across the subduction
system, from oceanic lithosphere, into the trench, across the island-arc and
through the back-arc, to address issues of water release into the mantle wedge
and melting processes resulting from hydration and back-arc spreading. This
study is in collaboration with Japanese colleagues; the US instruments will be
placed on the Pacific plate to the east of the Mariana, in the fore-arc basin
and across the West Mariana Ridge. This seafloor transect will be in the middle
of the system where deep structure should be maximally two-dimensional. The
study will measure a 2-D electrical resistivity section across the system from
depths of about 20km to 200km below the seafloor. The transect will be
coincident with that of the independently funded and mobilized seismic
experiment, collecting wide-angle reflection and refraction data, as well as
local and teleseismic earthquake arrivals to constrain crust and mantle velocity
and attenuation structure beneath the system
