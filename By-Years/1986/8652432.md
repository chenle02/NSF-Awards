The University of Puerto Rico Resource Center for Science and Engineering will
conduct four summer workshops for elementary, intermediate, and secondary
teachers. Each workshop will provide instruction for forty teachers. The
workshops to be conducted are: I. Teaching Science in the Elementary School II.
Teaching Mathematics in the Elementary School III. Teaching Science at the
Intermediate School Level IV. Teaching Mathematics for Intermediate and High
School Teachers There will be 8 follow-up sessions on Saturdays during the
academic year for each workshop. The workshops will be conducted in two
locations simultaneously: Rio Piedras and Mayaguez campuses. Half of the
participants will be instructed on each campus during the summer and academic
year phase of the program. The primary goals of this project are to provide
teachers with new content, methodology, and a more effectives instructional
program for their students. Emphasis will be placed on the interdisciplinary
nature of bodies of knowledge. Teachers who are participants in this project
will be encouraged to share their new knowledge with other teachers in their
