Abstract

Knowledge about the spread of diseases is vitally important to health,
agriculture, and to natural communities of organisms. We propose to experiment
with an insect disease that offers great potential for learning general
principles of spread. We will work with entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) that
kill caterpillars that eat the roots of plants. These nematodes can protect the
plants by killing root feeding caterpillars. Our preliminary mathematical models
lead us to propose that the EPN population is caught between the point of
extinction due to overexploitation and a the point of extinction due to
underexploitation Finding the biological factors that create the area between
over exploitation and underexploitation is the major objective of this project.
The spread and dispersal of the EPN among lupine bushes is central to the area
of over and underexploitation biology. Immigrants can rescue EPN populations
that have or are headed for extinction. The field experiments are designed to
answer questions about the conditions that lead to stability of the EPN
population EPNs are among the most important natural enemies of root feeding
insects in both cultivated and natural settings and are of substantial interest
to agriculture and management
