This engineering education research award to San Jos√© State University would
integrate sustainability in engineering education using a novel "co-instruction"
model based on team teaching from engineering, business, and humanities faculty.
A senior project involving sustainability topics named "zero-emissions house"
would be piloted during the 2010-2011 academic year. The project would be co-
taught by five faculty from Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering,
Organization/Management, Industrial Design, and Political Science. The
hypothesis is that with effective co-instruction and planning, the benefits of
multidisciplinary project-based learning can be realized without the resource
intensiveness which often is cited as a barrier to implementation. The
multidisciplinary project-based learning approach synergizes with effective
education in sustainability. This work is expected to be a model for similar
institutions and have broad impact on the incorporation of multidisciplinary
sustainability education into the engineering curriculum.
