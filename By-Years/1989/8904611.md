The focus of this research is the development of formal methods of nonmonotonic
reasoning to express commonsense knowledge and reasoning. Additional
epistemological problems will be investigated, including formalization of the
notions of context and mental situation. It is intended that this work will make
it possible to develop a general purpose database of commonsense facts. Work
will also proceed on the formal expression of heuristics. Specific topics
include introspective circumscription, the ramification problem, the description
of creating and destroying objects in the situation calculus, and ontologies of
time and action.
