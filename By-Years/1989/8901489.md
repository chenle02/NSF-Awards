This research will investigate both in theory and practice the implementation of
a family of logic programming languages that have been semantically
characterized with the help of the algebraic notion of bilattice, via a uniform
family of algorithms. These algorithms can be either tableaux or resolution
based. The resulting languages will provide machinery for manipulating the
'information' content of statements, as well as their "truth" content.
