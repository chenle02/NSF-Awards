This project continues and expands the research in the design, development, and
implementation of techniques for enhancing the power and performance of
equational systems. The three key areas for this research effort are rewrite
operations, equational programming, and equational deduction, though the results
will likely also be applicable to other areas such as (constraint) logic
programming. Research on rewrite operations will focus on variants of pattern
matching algorithms that are specifically tailored to lazy evaluation strategies
for functional programming and to build the semantics of certain functions into
the matching algorithms for equational deduction. The investigations in
equational deduction will center on the PI's recently proposed basic completion
method, in which no inferences are applied at those subexpressions in formulas
that are built up from substitutions generated in previous inference steps. The
equational programming component of the proposal will focus on the further
development of Equals --- a fast parallel implementation of a lazy language and
the Integral system which uses symbolic constraint solving techniques to glue
together program analyses across different paradigms. ***
