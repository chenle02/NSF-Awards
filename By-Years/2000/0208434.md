This project is to develop enabling techniques for a large-
scale&lt;br/&gt;metasearch engine that aims at covering a much larger portion of
the&lt;br/&gt;Web and at the same time retrieving more up-to-date and more
useful&lt;br/&gt;documents than existing search engines and metasearch engines.
A&lt;br/&gt;metasearch engine is a system that supports unified access to
multiple&lt;br/&gt;existing search engines. It is estimated that there are
hundreds of&lt;br/&gt;thousands of search engines on the Web (including deep
Web). The&lt;br/&gt;proposed metasearch engine (WebScales) will attempt to
connect to&lt;br/&gt;as many of these search engines as possible. The focus of
the research&lt;br/&gt;is on advancing highly scalable distributed information
retrieval&lt;br/&gt;technology and the research issues to be investigated in
this project &lt;br/&gt;include (1) how to discover these search engines
automatically, (2) &lt;br/&gt;how to incorporate them into the proposed
metasearch engine automatically, (3) how to identify potentially useful search
engines to use for any given user query submitted to the metasearch engine, and
(4) how to achieve high retrieval effectiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
