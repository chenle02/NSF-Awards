This project develops the first-year courses in computer science centered around
program derivation methodology in the believe that formal mathematical methods,
such as program derivation methodology, provide part of the solution to the
problem of software reliability. The derivation methodology provides techniques
for "calculating" programs which probably satisfy their specifications. This
project will adapt, extend, and improve the methodology so that it is taught
effectively to freshmen. Skills acquired by students in these first-year courses
will make possible a higher level of instruction and student work in advanced
courses. The new first-year courses are the foundation for a revised computing
curriculum at Southwestern University demonstrating the feasibility and
desirability of an undergraduate computing curriculum based on formal
mathematical methods.
