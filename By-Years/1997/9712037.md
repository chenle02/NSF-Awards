9712037 Edwards This grant provides $100,000 as two-years partial salary support
for two technicians at the University of Minnesota to oversee operations and
maintenance and train new users in geochemical separations and mass
spectrometric techniques utilizing the five mass spectrometers (gas, ICP-sector
and thermal ionization) in the Minnesota Isotope Laboratory. This is a Phase II
grant for technical support under the IF/EAR program. With the recent addition
of three new mass spectrometers to this facility as the result of an ARI award
(EAR-9512334), this laboratory is one of the largest and well equipped mass
spectrometry facilities in the U.S. The continuation of adequate technical
support will enable these PI's to fully utilize the capabilities of the state-
of-the- art mass spectrometers employed at Minnesota for studies utilizing high-
resolution isotopic records recorded in marine and lacustrine carbonates for
interpretation of global and regional climate change and paleoenvironmental
conditions. Other studies will further contribute to the refinement of the
Quaternary chronology of global sea level changes related to
glaciation/deglaciation events. ***
