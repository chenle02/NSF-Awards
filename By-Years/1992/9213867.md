This grant investigates fundamentals of hydrogen atom interactions with defects
in metals. Experimental techniques employed are small angle neutron scattering
(SANS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), large angle neutron scattering,
and gamma ray diffraction. Recently it has been demonstrated that SANS can
reveal directly the spatial profiles of the hydrogen isotope, deuterium, trapped
at dislocations and grain boundaries in palladium. The dependency of the
trapping strength on deuterium concentration, defect concentration, and
temperature is examined using SANS. Determining the associated effects of
impurity segregation, such as carbon and sulphur, at dislocations and grain
boundaries is an integral part of this program. %%% This research adds to the
knowledge base related to solute-defect interactions, important to mechanical
and physical properties of metals and alloys.
