The purpose of this research is to develop semi-parametric methods for the
estimation of sample selection models. These methods will allow for the
simultaneous estimation of choice equations and outcome equations. In addition
to the estimation of the two equations sample-selection models, the estimation
of more complicated sample-selection models will also be considered. All of
these models have certain features in common, but they also have structures of
their own. Such structures impose specific identification restrictions on the
models. This project will develop semi-parametric estimation methods which
explore the systematic structures of the models. Some of the systematic
estimation methods to be investigated are the semi-parametric likelihood
methods. Monte Carlo experiments will be performed to investigate the small
sample performance of the proposed estimators. This research is important
because sample-selection models have many important applications, such as in the
analysis of job-search behavior, and the methods to be developed will permit for
better estimating these and other models.
