In this project the investigators will use a thermochemical numerical convection
code to investigate the trace and major element evolution of Earth's mantle. The
model self-consistently integrates the processes of convection, plate tectonics,
and melting-induced trace-and major-element defferentiation and mixing. The
investigators will focus particularly on testing various hypotheses that have
been proposed by members both of the geophysical and primordial reservoirs, the
necessity or otherwise of having a deep, thick, enriched layer, and several
other topics. The focus will be on high-resolution 2D calculations in order to
minimize discretization 'noise' when calculating isotope ratios, but
complemented by a small number of 3D calculations. The results should be to
closely constrain the viability of competing hypotheses for Earth's trace
element structure and evolution.
