9510040 Elmore This award provides partial funding for the operation and
maintenance of the Purdue Rare Isotope Measurement Laboratory, a multi-user
national facility supported by NSF to provide accelerator-based mass
spectrometry (AMS) capabilities in measuring the cosmogenic radionuclides 10Be,
14C, 26Al, 36Cl, and 129I. The scientific goals of the facility are to develop
and calibrate methods for applying the analysis of very low concentrations of
cosmogenic radionuclides, a unique capability of the AMS method, to the study of
the geologic history of rocks, soils, and ground water, and extraterrestrial
materials. ***
