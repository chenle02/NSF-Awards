In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, Mark Watson of the University of Kentucky
will explore the role of side chain structure in the assembly and conducting
properties of conjugated polymers. The approach is to prepare three classes of
donor-acceptor copolymers possessing unique repeat units: (1) donor monomers
carrying alkoxy side chains with increasingly bulky branches placed at the
alpha- and beta-positions from the polymer backbone; (2) donor monomers carrying
alkynyl side chains with increasingly bulky branches placed at the 3- and
4-positions; (3) acceptor monomers with side chains positioned perpendicular to
the polymer backbone. Structure-property relationships in the synthesized
polymers will be delineated using a series of characterization methods. The
broader impacts involve training undergraduate and graduate students in an
interdisciplinary environment, broadening participation of underrepresented
groups in chemical sciences via visits to regional institutions to present
hands-on science demonstrations and participation in week-long "Summer Science
Camps" and a local children's museum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plastics are long
chain organic molecules and are found in many facets of everyday life, including
food packaging, structural materials for automotive and aerospace
transportation, and lightweight electronic devices. Electrically conducting
carbon-based (organic) molecules and polymers hold enormous promise for
realizing highly efficient, affordable, and broadly available electronic and
optical devices. This research explores how the structure of the polymer affects
its assembly which, in turn, impacts its properties and performance in
electronic devices. Ultimately, such work could lead to the development of
organic electronic materials, low cost solar cells, light emitting displays, and
chemical and biological sensors.
