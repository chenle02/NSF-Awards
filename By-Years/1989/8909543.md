The goals of this research are to mathematically model and measure mass
transport in two immobilized cell systems: a hollow fiber bioreactor and a
porous matrix (bead and slab configurations). This entails separate
investigations of the behavior of diffusion and convection in packed cell beds,
measurement of convective velocities in unpopulated (no cells) hollow fiber and
porous bead systems using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and MRI measurement
of fluid transport in the populated (with mammalian cells) systems. It is
intended that this information will provide answers to questions of relevance to
bioreactor design, operation, and scale-up.
