This award supports Professor Nancy Kleckner of Harvard College and her
graduate student, Ruth Padmore, M.D., to collaborate in molecular biology
research with Professor Christa Heyting and others of the Department of Genetics
of the Agricultural University of Wageningen, The Netherlands. Both of these
laboratories are interested in understanding the mechanisms of and relationships
between chromosome pairing and recombination during meiosis. However the two
laboratories have used very different approaches and very different organisms
for their analysis, yeast and rats. The overall scientific goal of the
collaboration is a comparative analysis of the processes of interest in the two
organisms. The complementary skills of the two research groups in yeast
molecular genetics and mammalian cell biology and cytogenetics should accelerate
progress in both laboratories. Meiosis is essential for sexual reproduction. One
of the most important aspects of meiosis is the pairing of and recombination
between homologous chromosomes. The general goal of this collaboration is a
functional comparison of these processes in yeast and higher eukaryotes. Most
work on the genetics of meiosis has been done with yeast, while most work on the
cytology of meiosis is done with mammals. It is important but difficult to
relate the two lines of research.
