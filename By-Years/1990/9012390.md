Nitrogen assimilation is a key event in the life of green plants, and nitrate
reductase is a key enzyme in this assimilation. This proposal is directed toward
elucidating the regulatory aspects of the activity and amount of this enzyme in
the alga Chlorella; the results of the research should contribute to increasing
agricultural productivity and more efficient utilization of N by plants. //
