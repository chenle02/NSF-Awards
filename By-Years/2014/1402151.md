PI: Narayanan, Ranga Proposal Number: CBET - 1402151 Institution: University of
Florida Title: Travel Grant for the Seventh International Conference and
Workshop on Interfacial Fluids and Transport Phenomena Processes, Vienna,
Austria, June 23-26, 2014

Building on past conferences in Italy, Israel and other countries, this
conference will promote the rapid dissemination of the latest research results
and encourage research collaborations from around the world in the cross-
disciplinary areas of interfacial fluids and transport processes. In addition to
the personal contacts that the U.S. participants will make with people from the
other countries, it will be beneficial to U.S. interests to foster exchanges of
research and teaching ideas and of personnel, and establish research
collaborations between chemical engineers from the U.S. and chemical engineers
from the international community. The use of the travel grants for young faculty
and researchers will ensure that the connections and collaborations made at the
conference will have a long-lasting effect.

This year?s conference focuses on areas such as materials processing in bio-
transport and environmental applications, interfacial nano-structures, drug
delivery, and fundamental transport issues of interfacial bubble and drop
stabilities.
