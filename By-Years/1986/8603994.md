This research seeks an improved understanding of the underlying processes
important for the filtration of submicron-size particles in high-gradient
magnetic separators. The submicron regime, where diffusion is the dominant
transport mechanisms, is a relatively unexplored area of magnetic filtration. A
cimbined experimental/theoretical program is proposed to advance the
understanding of the basic physical principles at work in this regime.
