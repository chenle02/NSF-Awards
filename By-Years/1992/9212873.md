Belowground carbon allocation in forests is poorly understood. Biomass
production, root respiration and carbohydrate storage have often been quantified
in recent years, but the factors controlling these processes remain unclear.
This project will do a comprehensive examination of control and fertilized red
pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) root systems, in order to determine how climate and
nutrients influence belowground carbon allocation By combining information on
changes in in situ root respiration, total soil respiration, root starch and N
concentrations, root growth and climate factors over time, they will construct
yearly belowground carbon budgets for control and fertilized red pine in
northern Wisconsin. They study will complement a similar study of slash pine in
Florida and will be compared to predictions from total soil respiration and
ecosystem process models.
