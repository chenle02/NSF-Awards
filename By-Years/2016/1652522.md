The team will study why stars form so slowly and inefficiently in galaxies. They
will model key "feedback" effects, like how young stars blast their surroundings
with intense light. The team will add the models to new simulations of how stars
form. These simulations will have much more realism than prior ones. Senior team
members will mentor junior members. The latter will include undergraduates from
universities in Puerto Rico and Hispanic-serving universities in California. The
team will showcase their research at science museums in Puerto Rico and in high
school classrooms in the Chicago area.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The team will
investigate how stellar feedback operates and how it regulates star formation in
galaxies. Their goals are to (1) reveal how interstellar turbulence and galactic
winds are generated; (2) investigate the effects of time-dependent molecular
chemistry on the interstellar medium, star formation, and outflows; (3) quantify
the effects of self-consistent radiation-hydrodynamics on radiative feedback and
observational tracers; (4) study the effects of magnetic fields and cosmic rays
on the interstellar medium and galactic winds; (5) synthesize the results into a
generalized analytic theory of star formation regulation and outflows; (6)
develop new, more predictive sub-grid models to capture these processes in fully
cosmological galaxy evolution models; and (7) release mock data products for
comparison with current and future observations.
