The research on this grant concerns the global structure theory for arbitrary
infinite semigroups. Applications will be given to formal languages, infinite
group theory and decision problems. The mathematical development will consist of
the following: general machinery, the kernel of a morphism between semigroups,
expansions, the prime decomposition theorem for arbitrary semigroups and
applications. This research is in the area of semigroups, one of the simplest of
the abstract mathematical structures, consisting of a set with one associative
operation on it. The structure of these very general objects will be
investigated. Applications will be given to various areas of mathematics and
computer science.
