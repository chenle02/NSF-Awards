9318243 McBee Villa Julie College requests support from NSF for connection of
their campus networks to SURAnet. SURAnet is the midlevel network located in the
southeastern United States. It will provide operations management and
information services and it will give Villa Julie College a 9.6 thousand bits
per second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per
second) National Backbone network. Students and faculty research will benefit
from the link. By linking to the mid-level and national networks, Villa Julie
faculty and academics will maintain a position of leadership in research and
educational innovation by profiting from remote access to super computer
centers, data bases and information services, high speed communications, file
transfer and remote login, and access to library resources. This is also a
unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative educational resources.
