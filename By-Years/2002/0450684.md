In this project the PIs will document regional differences of short-term
numerical forecast skill and frequency of large forecast errors for the North
American continent and the surrounding ocean areas, and will appraise the
differences in skill among several international operational numerical models.
The relationship between forecast skill and large-scale flow regime will also be
examined. Furthermore, for individual events that experienced major forecast
failures, the PIs will explore the effects of model errors in terms of model
physics on forecast errors, and the effects of initial condition error by using
a multi-analysis ensemble approach. This study will address the questions of
whether particular operational forecast models experience fewer forecast
failures, whether particular regions experience larger forecast errors, whether
there are particular regions that suffer frequent and/or large forecast failure
events, and if these large forecast failure events are associated with obvious,
large initial condition errors. Graduate students will participate in the
research.
