This project is to enhance the senior engineering design project laboratory with
a software development station. It is an extension of the existing undergraduate
laboratory instruction which is based the Motorola Educational Computer Board
and using the MC68000 assembly language. The station reflects the latest in
microprocessor emulation, and will be based on the IBM PC/AT with a 68000 co-
processor module. Using emulators for the 68000, 6809, and 68HC11, a variety of
design projects can be supported in the area of digital signal processing and
control.
