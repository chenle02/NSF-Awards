This is a proposal for support for a Gordon Research Conference on Taste and
Smell to be held July 13-17, 1987. The Gordon Conference on this topic is held
every third year. The focus of the conference will be on development and
plasticity in chemosensory systems, topics of particular current significance
not only in chemical senses but in broad aspects of neurobiology. Among the
strengths of the proposal is the highly interactive format of Gordon Conferences
(ample discussion time; small number of conferees; all conferees living and
eating together for the week; all discussion "off the record"). The involvement
of industrial as well as academic scientists is another noteworthy feature; this
facilitates rapid transfer of technology from the research laboratory to the
private sector, where economic impact is maximized. The conference should have
considerable impact on chemosensory research and on neurobiology in general. The
budget is reasonable, and NSF's contribution provides partial support for this
valuable activity.
