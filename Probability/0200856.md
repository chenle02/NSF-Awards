The project addresses problems covering a rather broad spectrum of discrete
mathematics (DM), some drawn from related areas such as statistical mechanics
(SM), probability, and theoretical computer science (TCS). A common thread in
many of these problems is:one is given a probability distribution on some large
discrete space (e.g. independent sets in, or proper colorings of, a graph), and
wants to know whether behavior in one part of the system can significantly
affect behavior in other, distant parts. The loose term ``long range effects"
(LRE's) is used for such interactions. Both strong and weak LRE's are of
interest: For SM what's wanted is, more often than not, strong LRE's, usually
under the name ``phase transition" (PT). In very recent work, the investigator
and his student David Galvin used mainly combinatorial ideas to settle one much-
studied question in this area (concerning PT's in the ``hard-core lattice gas
model"), and a particular hope at present is that ideas from this work, and,
more generally, the investigator's combinatorial perspective, will lead to
progress on various more or less related questions. From the perspectives of DM
and TCS, on the other hand, weak LRE's are often desirable, e.g. because of
their connections with rapid mixing of Markov chains (a topic of major interest
in TCS), and because in combinatorial applications of probability, systems with
sufficiently weak LRE's can sometimes substitute for probability spaces based on
purely independent choices. (This again involves the hard-core model, which
arises in surprisingly diverse mathematical contexts.)

Speaking very generally, the (main part of the) project aims at understanding
the degree of order or disorder in various large random systems, for instance
the extent to which the global structure of a physical system can be predicted
from knowledge about interactions between neighboring particles. In recent
years, random systems similar to those used to model physical reality have
played increasingly important roles in TCS and DM, partly because they can be
helpful in analyzing (algorithmically and/or theoretically) even non-random
problems in these areas; and there has been an increasing realization of the
degree to which the issues arising in these three disciplines are related. One
major theme of the present project is an interest in applying ideas and methods
across mathematical boundaries: especially in using ideas from the
investigator's core area (DM) to attack problems in SM and TCS, but also in
bringing an increasing familiarity with techniques from the latter areas to bear
on several problems of longstanding interest in DM.
