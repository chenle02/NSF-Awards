The principal investigator will conduct research in the area of nonlinear
conservation laws and shock waves, continuing the study of elementary waves and
the Riemann problem in resonant nonlinear systems as well as the convergence
properties of numerical methods utilizing this construction. Shock waves are the
observed in many "flow" situations. The presence of steep gradients leads to
serious difficulties in both theoretical and numerical methods for obtaining
solutions. The qualitative and quatitative analysis of nonlinear waves is of
significant scientific interest in view of the wide spread occurrence of such
phenomena in real world situations.
