This Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers is made to Dr. Sue
Leurgans of the Department of Statistics, Ohio State University. Dr Leurgans
will continue her work on the development of statistical methodology. In
particular she will work on multilinear models and multivariate responses. Her
work is collaborative with scientists and engineers, and the work will be highly
computational. The NSF Faculty Award for Women recognizes the high quality of
the awardee's record in teaching and scholarship as well as potential for
continued significant contributions to scientific research, the academic
profession, and the education of future scientists. Dr. Leurgans will continue
her work on the development of statistical methodology to answer questions in
science and engineering. Particularly noteworthy are her effort to increase the
size and quality of the graduate program in her department and her leadership as
a role model to the other women faculty in her department.
