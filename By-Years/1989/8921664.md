This award from the Office of Special Projects of the Division of Chemistry
provides funds for the partial support of a study by the Board on Chemical
Sciences and Technology (BCST) of the Commission on Physical Sciences,
Mathematics, and Resources of the National Academy of Sciences that will
identify research frontiers in catalysis science and technology. In recent
years, United States leadership in the catalysis science and technology has been
increasingly challenged by researchers in Japan and Western Europe. During this
period, there has been a growing perception among U.S. scientists and engineers
that research opportunities in catalysis are becoming less timely and
interesting. It is widely acknowledged that the size and vigor of the general
U.S. effort in catalysis research is not at the level needed to effectively meet
future national needs and international challenges. The BCST believes that the
scientific basis for further advances in catalysis is strong, and that a high-
visibility report offering a substantive discussion of research frontiers could
do much to focus attention on new directions in the field and to serve as a
brief guide to promising research areas for a broad national audience. This
project, which is jointly supported by the Division of Chemistry and the
Division of Chemical and Thermal Systems of the NSF, the U.S. Army Research
Office, the U.S. Department of Energy, and other sources, will bring together
some eight distinguished academic and industrial researchers to draw input from
the chemistry, biochemistry, chemical engineering, molecular biology, solid
state physics, and materials science communities, assimilate that input, and
craft a forty-page report that will be widely publicized and distributed to
academic and industrial researchers.
