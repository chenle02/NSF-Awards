Farley-Buneman (FB) wave instability is triggered in a partially ionized plasma
when a cross-field drift of electrons relative to ions exceeds a critical
threshold value. This phenomenon substantially modifies current flows, and thus
affects the response of the entire Magnetosphere-Ionosphere (MI) system,
primarily during storm-time. FB waves also produce strong radar echoes, and
these allow monitoring of the MI system. The original theory of FB waves is
based on linear, local fluid theory that does not account for many observed
aspects of the waves. The results of the work would improve understanding of MI
coupling not only though the modification of models of this coupling, but also
through the diagnostic use of the radar echoes produced by FB waves. The project
will fund a graduate student and engage Master's and undergraduate students in
space research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigators (PIs) will
synthesize improved theory, nonlinear numerical simulation, and numerous
disparate observations, including measurements from the High Frequency Active
Auroral Research Program (HAARP) heater. The project will implement a new
approach to radar imaging using "compressive sensing." This technique has been
transformative in other fields, and is seen as potentially beneficial to the
Coupling, Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions (CEDAR) radio science
community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
