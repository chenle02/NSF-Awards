Abstract 9729443 J. Kornfield, California Institute of Technology The micro-
rheology and flow-induced microstructure of AB diblock and ABC-type copolymers
will be investigated using a rheo-optic method developed by the principal
investigator, as well as X-ray spectroscopy and transmission electron
microscopy. The emphasis of this study is on the relationship between the flow
alignment characteristics of block copolymers in simple shear and their
properties. A second objective is identification of new microstructural
phenomena by changing the group of tested copolymers and including newly
synthesized diblock and triblock copolymers for testing. Synthesis of the
copolymers will be performed in collaboration with The Procter &amp; Gamble
Company. Discovery of the range of flow behavior of block copolymers and
establishment of predictive capabilities to guide design of materials for
processability and function will provide the scientific basis for rational
design of molecular architecture that optimize the materials properties of
nanostructured polymers. ***
