Technical Narrative: This proposed conference, organized by the University of
Central Florida and Cairo University, is scheduled for December 1993 in Cairo,
Egypt. The purpose of the conference is to report on some of the latest
developments in the areas of classical and applied analysis that relate to
signal processing and wavelets. This combination of topics brings together
expertise from many countries, especially some mathematicians with contacts and
ties with Middle East. This proposal supports the participation of approximately
15 U.S. mathematicians. Conference participants will present papers that will be
compiled and published as a conference volume. This conference in mathematical
sciences fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by
enabling leading experts in the United States, Egypt and elsewhere to combine
complementary talents and present research results in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence. This conference has the potential for generating new
scientific activity and new international linkages.
