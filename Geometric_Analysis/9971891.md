Abstract

Award: DMS-9971891 Principal Investigator: Bennett Chow

The objective of the project is to investigate analytic and geometric aspects of
Hamilton's Ricci flow of Riemannian metrics, and related topics. This flow has
been successful in topologically classifying Riemannian manifolds satisfying
positive curvature conditions. Hamilton's program for the Ricci flow on
3-dimensional manifolds is an approach to understanding Thurston's
Geometrization Conjecture, which subsumes the Poincare Conjecture. The main
topics considered in the project include the search for new Harnack inequalities
for the Ricci flow, furthering the geometric understanding of the existing
Harnack inequalities, and investigations in the behavior of the Ricci flow for
collapsing solutions. Harnack inequalities are fundamental to the area of
partial differential equations and they have been pioneered for parabolic
equations in differential geometry by the work of Li, Yau, and Hamilton.
Hamilton's matrix Harnack inequality is especially important in the analysis of
singularities that arise under the Ricci flow. Understanding these singularities
has had a major impact on the study of other evolution equations such as the
mean curvature flow, and depends upon tools such as a compactness theorem
related to injectivity radius estimates. We shall consider aspects of the Ricci
flow in the absence of such estimates, where solutions collapse.

Many phenomena are modeled by evolutionary equations, such as the transfer of
heat and the evolution of interfaces between molten and solid forms of metal.
The study of evolution equations in geometry has grown tremendously in the last
several years. In many cases geometric evolution equations deform an initial
geometric structure to an improved one, but in other cases the structures
develop singularities. It is of fundamental importance to analyze these
singularities. Such a study has been carried out to a large extent for the Ricci
flow, which is an evolution equation deforming geometric structures on
manifolds, the locally Euclidean spaces arising in Einstein's Theory of
Relativity and most major branches of mathematics and theoretical physics. For
example, space-time is a 4-dimensional manifold and the universe we live in is a
3-dimensional manifold. It is widely believed by mathematicians that any
3-dimensional manifold may be decomposed into pieces which admit canonical
geometric structures. Since the Ricci flow deforms geometric structures, and all
manifolds admit geometric structures, it may be used as an approach to the above
question if it can be shown that the flow deforms geometric structures to
canonical geometric structures.
