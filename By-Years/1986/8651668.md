In the current elementary school curriculum, little attention is devoted to
developing students' geometric problem solving abilities, spatial thinking, or
ability to analyze and reconceptualize substantive geometric ideas. Use of the
Logo computer language has the potential of transforming both the content and
method of the elementary school geometry curriculum. This project will develop a
new geometry curriculum for use in elementary schools and will create a set of
Logo based classroom activities that promote the objectives of the curriculum.
Expected outcomes will include a set of instructional materials, a book for
teachers, recommendations for teacher training, and a videotaped program that
will include exemplary lessons taught by teachers involved in the field test.
