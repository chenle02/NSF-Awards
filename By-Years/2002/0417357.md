A high-resolution, physical map of the soybean cv. Williams 82 genome is
currently under construction. However, this effort is hampered by the size,
complexity, and limited knowledge of the structure of the soybean genome. This
Small Grant for Exploratory Research project will address the urgent need for
BAC-end sequences and a public repeat sequence database to aid in map assembly
and annotation. The sequence resources to be developed will provide a better
estimate of the gene and repeat content of the soybean genome. The BAC-end
sequences will be integrated into the physical map, as well as used to anchor
genes and genetic markers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific goals of the
project are to 1] generate a repeat sequence database by single-pass sequencing
of 25,000 randomly generated plasmid clones, 2] sequence 20,000 BAC-ends, 3]
annotate the sequence, and 4] incorporate the data into the Fingerprint Contig
(FPC) database for community access (http://www.genome.arizona.edu/). Sequence
data will be released to the GSS division of GenBank
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbGSS/) on a weekly basis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A
robust map of the soybean genome will facilitate the development of a wide range
of functional genomics tools for soybean. An additional outcome will be the
recruitment of young scientists who will see soybean as an exciting research
system on which they can build their careers. This increase in critical mass
will have many tangible benefits, including preserving the viability of soybean
as an agriculture crop and contributing to homeland security by insuring a safe
and available food supply. &lt;br/&gt;
