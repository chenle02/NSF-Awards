In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, Harry Gibson of the Virginia Polytechnic
Institute and State University will synthesize and study macromolecules in which
branch points, crosslinks or repeat units are mechanical connections in the form
of rotaxanes or catenanes. A variety of polymerization techniques (e. g.,
anionic, atom transfer radical, nitroxide mediated, classical free radical and
ring opening metathesis) will be employed to prepare well-defined macromolecules
with terminal, central or multiple host and guest functionalities. These
polymers will then be self-assembled into a variety of topologies (star,
H-branched, poly[2]rotaxane, bottle brush, etc.) in both homopolymeric and
copolymeric forms, all involving rotaxane linkages, some topologies not readily
accessible otherwise. These supramolecular rotaxane polymers are expected to
exhibit enhanced properties relative to covalent polymers because of the
restoring force between the cyclic and linear components present in the rotaxane
units. Morphological, rheological, thermal and mechanical studies will elucidate
the novel properties and responses of these systems that distinguish them from
normal covalently linked macromolecules, providing new insights into the
ultimate properties that are achievable through supramolecular science. The
broader impacts involve training undergraduate and graduate students as well as
postdoctoral researchers, an ongoing commitment to training students from groups
underrepresented in the chemical sciences, and disseminating research results
through publications in journals and presentations at
conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will enhance our fundamental
understanding about polymers linked mechanically via interlocking loops and
chains and their physical behavior. Polymer chains are the fundamental units of
many plastic materials, and the development of new types of polymers could lead
to new applications in biomedical materials, coatings, and composites.
