Computer simulations will be extended to learn more about the processes of soil
movement and transport by a confused 3-D flow field affected by complex
boundaries, rotating cutterblades, variable flow rates and positioning of the
intake to the dredge pump. New dredge intake and cutterhead shielding techniques
will be tested and more extensive efforts made to evaluate cutterhead flow
processes, as well as to examine interphase mass transfer as affected by linear
and non-linear friction relationships. These studies will refine dredge cutters,
pipeline trenchers, and offshore mining techniques and later advance to analyses
of oil well drilling bits and tunneling machines. Additional hydraulic studies
using a 1:6 scale model will establish scaling relationships for subsequent
prototype tests.
