This project is in the area of computational topology, which is the application
of topological algorithms to problems traditionally in the domain of
computational geometry. The project will employ topological methods to develop
and implement algorithms for various applications in the areas of 1) geometric
modeling, 2) robot motion planning, and 3) computer graphics. Algorithms will be
coded on graphics workstations. Particular effort will be put on algorithms for
geometric objects that are modeled as simplicial complexes in low- dimensional
Euclidean space. Further, the underlying theory of computational topology will
be systematically investigated in the context of applications.
