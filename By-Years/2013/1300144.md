The research objective of this award is to tremendously enhance our
understanding of the fundamental limits of linear programs. This includes the
improvement of known lower bounding techniques for the size of extended
formulations, research of problem specific, alternative lower bounding
techniques as well as the investigation of the limits of approximating
combinatorial and nonlinear problems by LPs. Extended formulations are an
important tool in (mixed-integer) linear programming for obtaining small
descriptions for the feasible region of linear optimization problems. In many
cases, the use of extended formulations can lead to an exponential saving in
terms of the number of inequalities. In the context of lower bounding techniques
where communication complexity methods are of high relevance alternative methods
that rely more on the actual nature of polytopes will be explored. For
approximate extended formulations a generalization of known methods will be
required to capture the trade-off between combinatorial exactness and geometric
approximation. The main objects of study will be the matching polytope and the
max-cut polytope (and variants of those), both of which play a crucial role in
terms of complexity.

If successful, the insights gained from this project will lead to a
significantly improved understanding of the ultimate limits of linear
programming. It will also provide a new set of tools to analyze and lower bound
the extension complexity of families of polytopes while not solely relying on
combinatorial invariants. The primary goal of this work is to identify
conditions under which linear programs fail to provide sufficiently fine
formulations. Identifying these conditions will help in the design and
construction of new optimization paradigm that might be able to keep crucial
properties of linear programs (which made them so succesful) while still
surpassing the inherent limitations.
