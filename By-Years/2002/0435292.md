Proposal Number: 0435292&lt;br/&gt;PI: John Hartman&lt;br/&gt;Institution:
University of Arizona &lt;br/&gt;Title: Bootstrapping Broad-Coverage Network
Services &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal
explores the design and utility of two broad-coverage network services: (1) a
topology discovery service that overlay nodes use to locate itself with respect
to its peers and the endpoints it serves; and (2) an information service that
collects, stores, propagates, aggregates, analyzes, and reacts to the network's
changing conditions. The research challenge is to design these services to both
provide Internet-scale coverage, and meet the needs of a rich collection of
wide-area overlay networks and applications. We will deploy and demonstrate both
services on PlanetLab. The impact of this work is to provide "foundational"
services that can be leveraged to improve the robustness, security, performance,
and manageability of the Internet.&lt;br/&gt;
