This grant broadens the participation of the next generation of researchers in
operations research by providing funding for graduate and undergraduate students
interested in research from underrepresented groups in engineering to attend the
annual meeting of INFORMS (Institute for Operations Research and the Management
Sciences). The grant contributes to the prosperity and welfare of the nation,
since the participating students will comprise the next generation of operations
researchers capable of solving complex, large scale societal challenges. The
grant will support travel from the 2019 conference through the 2024
conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The INFORMS Annual Meeting is a leading North
American conference for academics and practitioners who are addressing the
challenges and opportunities in operations research. The conference draws widely
from researchers in different domains and using different methods, and from
primarily methods-driven research to primarily problem-driven research. As
participants, the graduate students will have a chance to present their work,
attend the presentations of other scholars, and network with leading researchers
in the field. The PI and governing committee will distribute the opportunity
widely and have a fair and transparent selection process to identify candidates
from underrepresented groups capable of high quality research who might not
otherwise be able to attend the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
