This grant will support three students for research in robotic exploratory
perception, robust multisensor fusion, and motion- based visual determination of
navigational obstacles. The studies will advance our understanding of complex
sensor-system design, spatial knowledge representation, and exploratory
procedures for learning unknown dynamic environments.
