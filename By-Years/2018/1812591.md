TECHNICAL AND NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Funds in the amount of $9,000 are
requested to support the registration costs for US-based participants, including
early career investigators, post docs and graduate students, in the 2018 Polymer
Physics Gordon Conference (GRC) and associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) to
be held on July 21-22 (GRS) and July 22-27(GRC) at Mount Holyoke College in
South Hadley MA. The GRC is an important venue for scientific exchange in this
interdisciplinary field and will focus on new experimental, simulation and
theoretical developments over a range of traditional and emerging topics
including polymer phase behavior, polymer nanocomposites, biopolymers, ion and
electron-conducting polymers and mechanochemistry in polymers. The associated
GRS provides a complementary venue for graduate students and postdoctoral
researchers to report on their research, interact with senior members and with
one another, and to cultivate scientific exchange and collaborations. Efforts at
diversity participation are emphasized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
