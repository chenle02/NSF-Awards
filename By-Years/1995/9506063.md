One of the fundamental goals of tectonic research is to age date the formation
of geologic structures and associated deformation fabrics. This project will
attempt to apply the argon dating technique to a mylonite, whose age is tightly
constrained by independent means. The work involves laser microprobe 40Ar/39Ar
age determinations and standard electron microprobe and TEM methods. Results are
expected to provide a better understanding of the way in which structural defect
development and recrystalization associated with mylonitization affects Argon
loss mechanisms in deformed rocks. Such information is required to develop a
reliable and useful geochronometric method for mylonite events.
