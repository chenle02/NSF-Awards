The study will investigate phylogenetic relationships within the genus Lopezia
(Onagraceae) using molecular techniques involving chloroplast and ribosomal DNA.
Particular emphasis will be on (1) the relationships of the morphologically
divergent sections within the genus, (2) the tempo, mode, and pattern of
molecular evolution, (3) the congruence of rates of morphological and molecular
evolution, (4) the origins of chromosome number changes in section Pelozia, and
(5) the comparative genetic variation within and among widespread and locally
endemic species. The study will integrate field and laboratory work, and will
help clarify the relationships between molecular studies and phylogenetic and
taxonomic studies based on morphology, cytology, anatomy, and biochemistry.
