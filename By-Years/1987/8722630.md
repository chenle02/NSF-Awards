This grant provides travel support for US invited speakers to attend the 6th
International Conference on Ultrafast Phenomena, Mt Hiei, Japan, 12.15 July
1988. The discussions and scientific interactions at this topical meeting will
provide a major opportunity for the development of new technology in the fields
of ultrafast electronics and optics as well as for the development of the
fundamental science underlying ultrafast optical sources, detectors, optical
circuit elements, optical computers, and the understanding of ultrafast
physical, chemical, and biological processes. This meeting is especially noted
for its interdisciplinary character and for the high caliber of its attendees
and scientific program. Since the meeting will be a showcase for advanced
Japanese technology, it is important to insure that distinguished US scientists
are well represented. NSF funding will be split among QEWB/ECS, Lightwave
Technology/EET, Solid State and Microstructures/ECS, Solid State Physics/DMR,
and Biophysics/DMB. Additional support has been requested by the conference
organizers from AFOSR and ONR.
