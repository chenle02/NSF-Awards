The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) will be a shared-use,
continental scale research platform for ecological research. The network will
consist of geographically distributed infrastructure deployed across the
continental US, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. The concept, design, and
selection of sites and instruments for the various NEON sites and activities
have evolved over many years, during which community consultation has been an
important activity. NEON is now entering an important phase of changes in
management structures, and consultation with the communities of site
owners/hosts, users of NEON Sites, and other stakeholders is necessary. The
Smithsonian Institution, along with other site owners/hosts, will host a
workshop to bring together these communities for interactions and to provide
input to the new NEON project management group. The proposed workshop will
improve the planning, implementation and long-term operations of NEON, thereby
enhancing the capabilities of this important research resource. This community
workshop will reinforce the network of institutions and researchers involved in
NEON and will improve their coordination and communication with NEON's
management entity.

NSF is in the process of reassigning NEON's management responsibilities, making
this an appropriate time to review and re-think the working relationships
between NEON-supported activities and those managed by the NEON site owners and
hosts. Participants in the workshop will engage in open discussion of issues and
opportunities, identify constructive approaches towards enhancing the utility of
NEON sites and data, and provide suggestions about how to best maintain
effective communications with site owners/hosts. Outcomes of the workshop
discussions will be made available to the new managing entity and distributed
through a white paper or other means.
