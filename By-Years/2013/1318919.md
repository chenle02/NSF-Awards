Cloud computing is growing at exponential rates due to its great benefits to
virtually all companies relying on IT systems. The biggest concern preventing
further cloud adoption is data security and privacy. The main security principle
in the design of cloud servers has been virtual isolation which ignores
information leakage through subtle channels shared by the processes running on
the same physical hardware. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to
explore side-channel leakage on virtualized machines that form the cloud. By
utilizing a cloud testbed, this project explores interactions of the underlying
hardware, virtualization platforms, and cryptographic software. A better
understanding of side-channel leakages is aiding the design of effective
countermeasures. To facilitate effective transition to practice the project is
taking a pragmatic approach by focusing on commonly used cryptographic software
libraries which lie at the heart of virtually any security solution. To address
identified weaknesses in existing crypto libraries, countermeasures in the form
of patches will be released, ensuring the security of cloud
servers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project resolves weaknesses in cryptographic
software by issuing updates with immediate benefits to virtually all cloud
customers. The impact is further amplified by the continuing rapid growth of
cloud adoption. By understanding the vulnerabilities in virtualized systems, the
project raises awareness in the software security community. By integration of
results into existing curricula, the project aids training future cybersecurity
experts at the undergraduate and graduate levels.
