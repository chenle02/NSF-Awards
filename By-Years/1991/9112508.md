Kreitzberg will study winter fronts and weather using data sets from special
observational programs (GALE, 1986; and STORMFEST, 1992) in comparison with
detailed numerical model solution fields. The goal is to determine the role of
fronts in producing clouds and precipitation in winter. The hypothesis is that
the role of strong fronts in producing these patterns is substantial, but that
it has been obscured until now by the lack of high resolution (mesoscale)
information on the structure of the phenomena. A key task will be to determine
how well models can reproduce frontal structures that can be resolved in the
special data sets. The research includes participation in the STORMFEST
experiment particularly in directing the research aircraft, the King Air, in its
surveys of these structures. Detailed, real-time model predictions will be used
to guide research aircraft deployment and interpretation of mesoscale
observations in these regions. This novel approach, if successful, will be a
breakthrough in the conduct of mesoscale field experiments. It has the potential
for much more economical and effective use of relatively expensive aircraft as
research platforms in already scheduled experimental components of the U.S.
Weather Research Program over the next decade.
