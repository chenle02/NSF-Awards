9761168 Hoang This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
will develop a rugged low-cost, reliable, general purpose data acquisition and
control system for autonomous remote platforms to collect and disseminate
meteorological and environmental data harsh environments. An objective is to
communicate with a variety of instruments and sensors at high data rates via
analog-to-digital converter board and digital input/output ports and at low data
rates via standard serial lines. The data acquisition design concept is to let
the scientific users adapt specific sensors to the system without modification
to the system hardware and software (plug-and-play-approach). The innovation of
this data acquisition system is to use advanced low-earth orbit satellites for
telecommand/control and data retrieval from remote sites through commercially
available electronic mail or the world-wide-web. Potential applications include
simplified communications for business professionals and reporters, for
television networks, construction engineers, geologists, people living in
thinly-populated areas, disaster relief operations, and in the shipping, air
transport and trucking industries.
