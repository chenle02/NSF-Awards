The available methods for reliability analysis of structural systems are
primarily based on the on the failure mode approach (FMA). Shortcomings of the
FMA limit its wider applications. To facilitate the implementation of
reliability theory to practical structures, alternative methods, based
particularly on the recently proposed stable configuration approach (SCA) will
be developed and extended. Approximations to the SCA that are necessary for
practical purposes will also be investigated and developed. The reliability of
continuous systems requires stochastic methods associated with discretized
systems (e.g., by finite elements); a Galerkin formulation and its extension to
stochastic finite elements will be examined for this purpose. Monte Carlo
algorithms for multi-processor supercomputers will be developed as a practical
tool for large-scale system reliability evaluations.
