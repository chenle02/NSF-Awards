The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project rests in the
advanced biomedical treatments that can be delivered using recombinant protein-
based materials. In current surgical procedures, hydrogel adhesives are limited
to applications as sealants in conjunction with sutures. In addition to the
unmatched strength of sutures, problems such as poor bonding on wet surfaces,
low strength, and high swelling limit the reproducibility, applicability, and
adoption of currently available adhesives and commercialization of other
advanced tissue regenerative materials. The goal is to bring to market an
adhesive platform that will overcome those limitations and introduce new
functionalities. Furthermore, the ability to use protein engineering to improve
material functionality will broaden the target market segments. The availability
of an effective hydrogel adhesive platform will empower patients and health care
providers with a next-generation tool that can replace sutures to achieve
cosmetically and functionally improved healing, decrease complications, and
increase patient comfort.

This I-Corps project is focused on the development of a protein-based adhesive
that can bond to soft tissues. An advantage of the bioinspired recombinant
protein in our core technology is that it can resist washout once applied
because it deswells (does not absorb water) at body temperature. Once cured, the
resulting hydrogel is flexible and can maintain its properties unlike other
hydrogel adhesives which absorb water and swell. Genetic engineering also allows
direct integration of functional peptide sequences. During development and
testing, the project will establish the design principles that will enable the
creation of next-generation adhesives with high bonding, flexibility, and bio-
interactive properties.
