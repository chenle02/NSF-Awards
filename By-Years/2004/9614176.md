Based on the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Rankine-Hugoniot relations, plasmas can
have six types of shocks: fast, slow, and four types of intermediate. Given the
significant role slow shocks play in the large scale structure of the
magnetotail, the investigators will examine their kinetic properties using a
combination of two-dimensional hybrid and two-dimensional full particle
simulations. Hybrid simulations will be used to address the structure of the
newly discovered anomalous slow shocks, and examine the type of slow shocks
possible in the fast Petscheck reconnection configuration. The full particle
simulations will explain some puzzling aspects of electron distributions
observed in the magnetotail. Next, the PI will examine the dynamic formation of
multiple boundaries and their interactions, similar to reconnection events at
both the Earth's magnetotail and magnetopause. By integrating these approaches
and using observations as a guide, the PI will enhance general understanding of
discontinuities in general, and their role in the magnetopause/magnetotail.
