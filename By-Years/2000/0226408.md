The goal of this project is to bring together young and experienced college
faculty to encourage scholarship in the teaching of computational linguistics.
This would take place in a workshop on "Effective Tools And Methodologies For
Teaching Natural Language Processing And Computational Linguistics" to be held
during the annual conference of the Association for Computational Linguistics on
July 7, 2002 in Philadelphia, PA. The workshop will enable new and prospective
computational linguistics faculty to learn from their peers and to share
resources related to teaching NLP and CL.
