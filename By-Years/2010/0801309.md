Radial basis functions (RBF) represent powerful mathematical techniques for
interpolation and smoothing in multidimensional data space. Their use in solving
time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) for modeling is to be
explored by a multidisciplinary group of mathematicians and geoscientists from
Arizona State (principal investigator later transferred to Boise State
University), University of Colorado Boulder, University of Michigan, and NCAR.
Attractive attributes of this new methodology for use in problems ranging from
climate science, to shallow water equations in spherical geometry to solar
corona dynamics include: i) the ability to achieve spectral accuracy and local
mesh refinement at arbitrary node locations including resolution in steep-
gradient events, ii) grid geometry independence allowing application to
irregular geometries, iii) algorithmic simplicity, and iv) higher accuracy than
competing spectral methods. Of interest to many geoscientists, applications of
RBFs in spherical coordinate systems will be investigated, with initial
applications to climate and solar modeling. Educational outreach will feature an
interactive web-site with instructional and applications modules.
