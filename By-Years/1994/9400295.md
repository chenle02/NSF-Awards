9400295 Gutkin The research covers topics related to the geometric twist maps
arising from the classical study of the 3-body problem. This will be studied in
relationship to the geometry of billiard configurations in dynamical systems.
The dual billiard problem will also be investigated. The research has potential
applications to Hamiltonian mechanics and statistical physics. ***
