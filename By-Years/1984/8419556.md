The purpose of the study is to monitor forces which are transmitted by a
prosthesis for below-knee amputations to the stump of the amputee, through the
patellar tendon (PT); to evaluate undesirable freedom between the socket and the
stump; to alter the share of the PT in the weight-bearing process by augmenting
the portion of the socket which supports it; to determine the limits of force
that can be applied to it; and to suggest modifications to the Patellar-Tendon-
Bearing socket which will produce optimal force distribution, taking into
account universal considerations and individual variables. A special biaxial
force transducer will be developed to measure two force components acting on the
PT during locomotion. Linear displacement gauges will monitor axial and
perpendicular freedom of the stump-socket. Fifteen amputees will be selected to
participate in laboratorial testing. Each amputee will be fitted with an
experimental prosthesis and will take part in three experimental sessions.
During the tests, systematic changes to the socket will be administered and the
influence of the recorded variables (during locomotion) will be observed.
