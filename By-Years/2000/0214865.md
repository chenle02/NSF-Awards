This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project proposes to demonstrate
the feasibility of developing a label-free biochip for applications in genomics,
proteomics, life sciences, and pharmaceutical research. Biochips are intended to
enable rapid, massively parallel analyses for such applications. However, the
typical biochip relies on the use of labels to detect the binding event. Labels
are expensive, especially for high-throughput screening (HTS), and can change
the chemistry of the ligand. The binding of a low-molecular weight ligand is
particularly difficult to detect by any current (or emerging) biochip
technology. During the Phase I project, experiments are planned to show(1) that
the proposed technology can be used to detect hormones, drugs, metabolites,
carbohydrates, and signal transduction molecules in the 100-500 Da size range
binding to enzymes, lectins, and DNA; (2) that this technology can differentiate
among cross-reactive ligands that bind to a given biomolecule; (3) that the
signal is specific to ligand binding and is not affected by artifacts that
affect other biochips; (4) that protein denaturation caused by carrier solvents
can be detected, and (5) that chip read-out will be exceptionally sensitive and
rapid.

The commercial applications of this project are likely to be in a number of
different areas. They include the markets for medical diagnostics, environmental
monitoring, food and beverage safety, proteomics, drug discovery and
development, biomolecule development, and ultra high-throughput screening.
