This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
Program. The study will examine the relations between attributions about
exchange partners and behavior in exchange relations. It ties together
attribution theory with social exchange theory in new and previously unexamined
ways. The research uses existing experimental data to test the effects of
structure and behavior on attributions and designs a fresh experiment to test
the effects of attributions on exchange behavior. %%% This research contributes
to the sociological understanding of social psychology by linking the subfields
of cognition, concerned with how people develop beliefs about behavior, with
social exchange, concerned with how people use resources to obtain the
behavioral outcomes they desire. In addition to the scientific gains to be
achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a highly promising
student in completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation. Thus it contributes
to the future scientific manpower of the nation and the thorough training of the
next generation of social scientists.
