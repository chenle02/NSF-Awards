The goal of this project is to increase the understanding of how the dynamics
of the bottom boundary layer affect coastal circulation on continental margins
containing a shelfbreak front. Data collected in the Mid-Atlantic Bight were
chosen for this study because the shelfbreak front in that region is a robust
and persistent feature. The major scientific goals of this project are: evaluate
the bottom boundary layer thickness, conduct an analysis of the circulation near
the shelfbreak front, and study the bottom flow on the slope. In addition, the
study of the bottom flow on the slope will test some scientific hypothesis
derived from the models of Lentz and Trowbridge (1991) and Gawarkiewicz and
Chapman (1992) which identify the dependence of the boundary layer thickness on
the stratification, alongshore flow, and steepness of bottom topography.
