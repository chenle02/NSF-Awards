In order to achieve success, newly trained biologists and health care
professionals need broad-based skills in addition to a solid understanding of
biology. These skills include independent and creative thinking, excellent
written and oral communication, computer proficiency and problem solving
ability. The goal of this project to design a cell biology course which will
incorporate the development of these skills. Students will first be introduced
to current concepts and experimental approaches in cell biology and then be
allowed to explore on their own. This will best be accomplished if students
culture and perform investigations on mammalian cells. Students will culture
mammalian cells and study various cell organelles and cell processes. While
learning in these areas, students will also acquire laboratory skills in
microscopy, spectroscopy, biochemical assays and electrophoresis. They will use
this knowledge and their toolbox of skills to perform a several week project of
their own design. Equipment to fully support such a teaching approach, such as
an inverted fluorescence microscope, a computer-linked UV/VIS spectrophotometer,
a dedicated CO2 incubator, a laminar flow hood and a high resolution video
system are either unavailable or inadequate. During the project students will be
expected to search the primary literature for background information, design
experiments, analyze data and present results to classmates via oral or poster
presentations. The course will prepare students for senior research projects,
the capstone course in molecular biology, graduate school, professional school
and careers as laboratory technicians. The course design and outcomes will be
put on internet newsgroups, presented at meetings and/or published in science
teaching journals. *
