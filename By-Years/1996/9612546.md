The Sun's magnetic field is created by dynamo action in the solar convection
zone, probably deep within that layer and in the overshoot region at the top of
the radiative interior. The dynamo mechanism is strongly affected by the
differential rotation within the convection zone, which itself is largely driven
by Reynolds stresses associated with the turbulence. The PI will develop a new
simulation of the solar dynamo and the differential rotation within the solar
convection zone. For this, he will further develop the turbulent transport
theory necessary to explain the mean fluxes of magnetic field, momentum and
entropy by the scales of turbulence that are unresolvable in global simulations.
To validate and complete the theory, he will perform numerical simulations of
convective magneto-turbulence in control volumes representing various depths and
latitudes of the solar interior. When a robust parameterization of the
turbulence has been obtained, he will use it in a global simulation of the
differential rotation and the mean solar magnetic field.
