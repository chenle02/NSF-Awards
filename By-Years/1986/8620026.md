This project continues research begun on DMR-8521485 concerning the
thermodynamics of solid crystalline materials subjected to general states of
stress. The work is divided into two phases: (1) development of a self-
consistent thermodynamics of crystalline solids and interfaces, including metals
and ceramics, that explicitly accounts for mass transport, elastic deformation
and the surface excess quantities associated with a curved interface between two
phases; and (2) examination of the effect of coherency strains in phase
equilibria in two-phase crystalline solids. The work is expected to provide a
set of thermodynamic bulk and interfacial conditions appropriate for the
continuum study of first-order phase transformations, phase equilibria and
microstructural evolution in solids.
