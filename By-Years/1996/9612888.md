Measurements of the dependence of the aerosol light scattering coefficient on
wavelength, scattering angle, particle size, and relative humidity during INDOEX

Abstract. Dr. Ogren and Sheridan's role in INDOEX is to measure the aerosol
light scattering coefficient and characterize its dependence on wavelength,
scattering angle, particle size, and relative humidity. The measurements will be
made from the NCAR C-130 using two integrating nephelometers operated in series,
and the results will be used in a number of closure experiments, as well as for
evaluating the direct radiative forcing. Specifically, the directly measured
values of the aerosol total scattering and hemispheric backscattering
coefficients, at 40% and 85% relative humidity, will be compared with values
calculated from measurements by other INDOEX researchers of the size
distributions of aerosol number concentration and chemical composition. The
nephelometer measurements, when combined with the measured light absorption
coefficient, will allow evaluation of the vertical profiles of aerosol light
scattering coefficient, asymmetry parameter (or upscatter fraction), and single-
scattering albedo; the total aerosol optical depth and aerosol radiative forcing
will be calculated from these vertical profiles and compared with the measured
values of these parameters.
