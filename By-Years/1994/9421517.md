9421517 Gibbs This is a renewal proposal for Lightwave Technology research on
semiconductor physics and photonics. The approach is to grow III-V semiconductor
heterostructures using a Riber MBE machine, where appropriate to fabricate them
into devices by photolithography and reactive ion etching, and to study their
optical properties by linear and nonlinear optical spectroscopies including
femtosecond dynamics and high magnetic fields. The proposal concentrates on
topics in four areas: vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSEL's);
nonlinear optical materials, nonlinear optical switches; and Er-doped
semiconductors. The first three areas are extensions of research under the
current grant, whereas the fourth is a new direction. ***
