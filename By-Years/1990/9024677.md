Professor Paul Barbara is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program and the Organic Dynamics Program to conduct a
Conference on Photoinduced Proton Transfer in Chemistry, Biology and Physics.
The conference, which will honor the many contributions of Michael Kasha, will
be held in Tallahassee, Florida on January 6-9, 1991. It is expected that over
100 participants will attend. Funds provided through this grant will primarily
be used to support travel grants for postdoctoral research associates and young
assistant professors.
