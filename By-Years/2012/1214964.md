This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop
a prototype of a frequency domain spectral induced polarization (SIP) borehole
tool that could be used to collect data in boreholes over a wide frequency range
with high accuracy/resolution. The SIP technique is an emerging geophysical
technology that offers unique information on the physical, chemical and
biogeochemical characteristics of porous media not provided by existing
geophysical logging tools. The need for such a tool is well recognized,
especially in the oil, mining and environmental industries, but technical
constraints and economical limitations have previously prevented the technology
from being commercialized. The company will design and test a borehole SIP tool
to overcome the perceived technical problems. Recent advances in
instrumentation, including size and power requirements of the needed
electronics, now allow for the construction of such a tool that can offer the
required capabilities at an affordable cost. This will be demonstrated by
determining the performance of the prototype tool in a laboratory setting by
making measurements on materials with known SIP characteristics and by
comparisons with bench-top SIP instruments. The tool will also be tested in an
experimental tank designed to simulate a borehole as per the perceived field
deployment.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be the
availability of new and more precise information on the variation of the
physical, chemical and biogeochemical properties of the subsurface to be
obtained from logging measurements in a borehole. This project is a response to
a recognized need in the exploration, water resources and environmental
industries for improved resolution of variations in the physicochemical
properties of the earth relative to that extractable from existing borehole
logging tools. The applications of this innovative tool will include the
characterization of new information parameters and the detection and monitoring
of geochemical and biogeochemical processes only characterized until now in
laboratory settings. The company, a qualifying small business, will broaden
their customer base, and both faculty and students at the partner academic
institution will be able to utilize the tool to enhance their capabilities for
environmental research. This new collaboration between a state university and a
local small business will strengthen efforts to promote collaborations between
industry and academia.
