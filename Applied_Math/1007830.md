The principal investigator and his colleagues study several second-gradient
problems of nonlinear elasticity, with applications to multi-phase structures
and solids -- especially lipid bilayer vesicles, shape-memory alloys and thin
structures. A common thread running through these problems is the following
mathematical structure: a non-convex potential energy in the first-gradient term
and an additive second-gradient regularization, often characterized by a small
positive parameter. The main goals of this work are: (1) to provide classes of
rational models -- particularly in the case of two-phase lipid bilayer vesicles
-- for understanding the often exotic behavior of such structures under
loadings; (2) to systematically find their equilibria corresponding to local
minima of the total potential energy (meta-stable solutions); (3) to obtain the
existence of global energy minima as weak equilibrium solutions of those models
and study their structure in the asymptotic limit as the small parameter
approaches zero. Goals (2) and (3) are inextricably linked to (1). We employ
rational continuum models, characterized by general constitutive functions, and
study thresholds of bifurcation and the structure of global energy minimizers to
compare with experiment. The proposed work is highly interdisciplinary,
requiring tools and perspectives from several fields, e.g., nonlinear analysis
and partial differential equations, bifurcation theory, calculus of variations,
nonlinear continuum mechanics, computational methods, symmetry ideas,
biophysics, and materials science.

The project focuses on fundamental modeling and predictive mathematical
analysis for the quantitative characterization of shape and deformation patterns
of certain micron-scale structures under applied loading, namely, lipid-bilayer
membrane vesicles, shape-memory alloys, and thin films. Each of these has direct
and important connections to basic science and technology -- in particular, to
problems associated with bio-molecular structures and advanced materials. For
example, lipid-bilayer membranes are ubiquitous in bio-molecular systems;
understanding and predicting their mechanical behavior is crucial for
understanding cell function. The project focuses on understanding the behavior
of pure, man-made membranes or liposomes under changes in osmotic pressure,
temperature, or composition. The future promise of liposome vesicles (closed
membranes) as vehicles for drug delivery demands a fundamental understanding of
their multi-phase mechanical behavior under loading. Likewise for phase
transitions in shape-memory alloys and wrinkling of thin films -- a fundamental
understanding and mathematical prediction of their behavior are important for
characterizing the mechanical properties of novel materials and for potential
sensing and actuation at the micron scale.
