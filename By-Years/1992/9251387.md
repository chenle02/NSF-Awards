The ease of sample and data handling, the sensitivity, and the speed of use of
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry will improve the general,
analytical, organic, instrumental, and physical chemistry laboratories. The
diffuse reflectance and attenuated total internal reflectance accessories will
allow the students to analyze films, powders, pastes, gels, and aqueous protein
solutions. The capability of analyzing this wide range of materials will make
FTIR a workhorse instrument for a new environmental program and for Senior
research projects. These improvements will affect an increasing number of
science majors who are training for careers in secondary education and in the
environmental fields, and a significant number of non-science majors who are
environmental science minors and who are going into business, law, and teaching
professions.
