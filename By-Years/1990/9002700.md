Inquiries into microclimatological patterns and processes have been inhibited
by difficulties in determining micro-scale variations in heat and moisture
transfers. Among the most important variables are transfers of water vapor
through evaporation and transpiration from ground surfaces and vegetation into
the air. Lysimeters have been developed to directly measure evapotranspiration,
but these machines are large, stationary, expensive, and capable only of
averaging readings over the area that they cover. This collaborative research
project will refine and test a set of minilysimeters to measure spatial
variations in the transfer of heat and moisture. Three continuously weighing,
portable minilysimeters will be designed and tested in a carefully controlled
experiment that will compare their measurements with records obtained using
three alternative microclimatological approaches. This project will determine
the extent to which small, portable minilysimeters can be used to accurately
measure evapotranspiration in a variety of different sites. These tests will
help ascertain the conditions in which these instruments will be useful and the
confidence with which the data that they collect can be used. Because of the
potential for using instruments of this type to provide heretofore unavailable
information about micro-scale spatial variability in heat and moisture transfer,
the project should contribute significantly toward advancement of
microclimatological research.
