The Interactive Ground-Water Tutorial Prototype Web
Site&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project constructs a prototype web-based ground-
water tutorial, a "hands-on" tool for teaching secondary Earth and Space Science
and Environmental Science students concepts related to ground-water flow and to
the human impacts on surface- and ground-water systems. Most of the work
performed in this two-year, proof-of-principle project focuses on developing the
interface that will enable the student to interact with the modules on the
prototype web site. The project encourages inquiry instruction by incorporating
role-play exercises and mathematical simulations of ground-water flow and
contaminant transport in a stream-aquifer system to solve environmental
problems. Role-play exercises could potentially include using simulation results
to help prevent: (1) a contaminant plume from reaching the stream and (2)
contamination of an aquifer by a spill that has been dumped into a nearby stream
where the aquifer is used for public water supply. A guidance module will
provide: (1) a framework to help guide role-play actions and (2) an orientation
for the student and (3) a means to update the student about the simulated
situation during the role-play. The project is a collaboration between the
Kansas Geological Survey, the University of Kansas Upward Bound Math Science
Center, Pathfinder Science, and Kansas StreamLink. Kansas City Kansas Community
College, the Lawrence, Kansas USD #497 will participate in field-
