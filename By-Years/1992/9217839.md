This grant from the Special Projects Office of the Chemistry Division provides
funds to enable Dr. Walter Benson to represent the International Organization
for Chemical Sciences in Development (IOCD) at the 5th International Conference
on Chemistry in Africa, which will occur July 27-31 in Gaborone, Botswana. The
IOCD encourages research in natural product chemistry in Africa, promoting
cooperation among the natural products chemists in Africa and with chemists in
the U.S. and other more developed nations. Dr. Benson will report to the
Foundation concerning the status of chemical research in Africa and the
opportunities for collaboration with U.S. scientists. African plants are a rich
source of unusual organic compounds, many of which have potential value as
natural insecticides, fungicides, or pharmaceuticals.
