This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Kurt Gramoll of
Memphis State University to conduct collaborative research with Dr. Junkoro
Onada for a period of one year at the Institute of Space and Astronautical
Science, University of Tokyo, Japan. They will investigate new design procedures
to increase the efficiency of upper stage rocket motors with casings made of
fiber reinforced plastic materials. These structures use reinforcing elements to
minimize radial strain in critical areas, and there is currently no widely
accepted analytical procedure to specify the size and placement of these
elements. Structural analysis tools such as anisotropic shell theory and finite-
element analysis will be used to develop a design procedure to minimize radial
strain and shear stresses. The results of this part of the program, and of
rocket motor tests performed to verify them, will be incorporated into an
overall design method for rocket motor cases. Dr. Onada's experience in rocket
motor design and application will complement Dr. Gramoll's facility with
analytical methods in this research effort.
