Publication of the "Hopcroft and Initiatives Reports", commissioned by the CCR
Advisory Committee, will provide valuable input to the CISE community on the
significant research accomplishments in computer science in the past two decades
and on some of the initiatives needed for further accomplishments. These reports
should help researchers place their research in perspective and plan viable
directions for future research. Broad distribution to the CISE community,
including both academic departments, research groups, and computer-related
organizations is planned.
