This grant provides funding to support 10 underrepresented minority graduate
students to attend the Institute for Operations Research and the Management
Sciences (INFORMS) annual meeting in Denver from October 24, 2004 to October 27,
2004. The students will give poster presentations at the welcoming reception of
the Minority Issues Forum of INFORMS and also attend the doctoral colloquium
conducted at conference. Thus, the students supported by this grant will acquire
necessary professional development skills to become an integral part of the
operations research profession and the opportunity to disseminate their research
to a broad audience in the profession.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will
assist in increasing the number and diversity of operations research
professionals. Also, the professional development gained from the experience
along with the interaction with role models in the field will positively affect
the students' persistence to a degree and practice in the
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
