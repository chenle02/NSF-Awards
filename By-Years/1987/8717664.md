While disease has been shown to be of enormous importance in agriculture, we
know very little about the importance of disease in regulating natural plant
populations. Most agricultural studies have investigated short-term impacts on
genetically uniform varieties; effects of disease on long-term population
fluctuations in nature are not understood. The present study will use the
anther-smut disease of white champion to investigate the effects of a particular
class of diseases (those transmitted by pollinators) on population regulation.
The research will combine computer simulation with the study of disease spread
in experimental populations, so as to understand the potential impact of the
disease on the plant populations.
