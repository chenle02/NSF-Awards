This award is for support of a program to reconstruct the record of atmospheric
carbon dioxide (and the carbon-13 isotopes of carbon dioxide) over several
intervals, including the Last Glacial Maximum-Holocene transition, interstadial
episodes, the mid-Holocene, the last 1000 years and the penultimate glacial
period, using ice from the Taylor Dome and Vostok ice cores. The major objective
of this study is to investigate the phase relationship between variations of the
greenhouse gases occluded in the ice cores and temperature changes (indicated by
oxygen and deuterium isotopes) during the last deglaciation. In addition, the
concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past 1000 years and during
the mid-Holocene will be determined in these cores.
