The objective of the research program is to investigate experimentally and semi-
theoretically nucleate boiling from a copper-graphite composite surface. The
composite (under development by SPARTA, Inc.) consists of ultra-high thermal
conductivity graphite fibers consolidated in a copper matrix. The composite has
a high thermal conductivity in the fiber direction which is several times those
in the other directions. Due to the size of the fiber, it could significantly
enhance the nucleation site activity. The proposed research will determine the
heat flux, site population density, bubble growth rate, bubble departure
frequency and bubble departure size. This project is a cooperative effort of the
University of Michigan and SPARTA, Inc. The Sparta's Copper/Graphite composite
has been used as the higher temperature material in the nose cone of the NASA
space shuttles. Due to its large number of very thin graphite fibers, the
composite is expected to remove a large amount of heat per unit area in the form
of nucleate boiling. If the concept is experimentally verified, then the use of
the composite in industry will be very broad, for example, in the cooling of
electronic units. This research is a proof-of-concept type study for the
verification of its boiling performance.
