9321164 Stuiver This award is for support to complete the oxygen isotope
determinations of the Greenland Ice Sheet Project Two (GISP2) ice core at 1.0
meter and 0.2 meter resolution. The relative importance of central Greenland
temperature change versus ocean source temperature change will be investigated
(in cooperation with J.W.C. White, University of Colorado, Boulder) by
calculating the deuterium excess of these samples. In addition, the phase
relationships between oxygen isotope patterns and changes in accumulation rate,
ice chemistry, dust content, and atmospheric trace gases will be determined. The
climatic and environmental significance of the ice core record will be assessed
and the spatial and temporal variability of the isotope record will determined.
