Dr. Thomas will study the effects of small scale turbulence on phytoplankton
using a series of laboratory devices designed to expose the algae to varying
levels of motion.He will then measure the growth rates and productivity of the
organisms as well as their pigment composition, cell sizes and behavior to
determine the impacts of the increased turbulence upon their physiology. It is
hypothesized that the growth inhibition of dinoflagellates by small scale
turbulence is the reason that red tides do not occur with moderate to strong
wind conditions. This will aid in the prediction of the occurrence of many of
the toxic outbreaks of red tides in the coastal regions.
