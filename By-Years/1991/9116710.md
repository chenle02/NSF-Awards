In terms of hardware capabilities, distributed/parallel computing is a technical
reality today. With modern workstations and networking, users can compute on
workstations on remote compute servers, or even on ensembles of computers,
running compute-intensive kernels in parallel by exploiting idle CPU cycles on
networks. However, substantial knowledge about networking and
parallel/distributed computing is required to achieve this. The goal of this
SBIR Phase II project is to build a state-of-the-art software package that will
bring this immense potential power to the user's own workstation, except they
will run many times faster. The package will be based on CLAM(R), a powerful,
interactive software environment for computation and visualization, designed,
developed and marketed by Scientific Computing Associates, Inc. The Phase I work
proved the feasibility of seamlessly accessing local external libraries and
demonstrated CLAMshell(TM), a Mac-like user- friendly front end for CLAM. The
phase II work will complete the research on two approaches: (1) parallelizing
the compute intensive kernals of CLAM's internal back end (2) enhancing CLAM's
foreign procedure interface to permit access to procedures which run on other
computers (including parallel supercomputers) or over a computer network in a
distributed/parallel fashion.
