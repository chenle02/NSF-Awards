Gas-assisted injection molding process has been claimed by its proponents as
the most important development for the injection molding process since the
invention of reciprocating-screw injection molding machine. This process
consists of a partial injection of polymer melt to the mold cavity followed by
an injection of compressed gas which penetrates and, in principle, hollows out a
network of pre-designed, thick-section gas channels until the cavity is filled.
When the process is well developed and understood, it can produce many injection
molded parts with light weight and high rigidity and will provide tremendous
flexibility in the design of plastic parts. The analysis of the process involves
flow of two drastically different materials in a geometrically complicated mold
cavity. This study is aimed at establishing the scientific basis and attaining
an engineering solution for characterizing this innovative process. Successful
results of this research would not only expedite the development and acceptance
of this process, but also may add a new dimension to the plastic part design.
