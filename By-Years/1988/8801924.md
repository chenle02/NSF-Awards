This is an ambitious project which includes organic synthesis of new donors and
acceptors, the formation of Langmuir-Blodgett films, and the characterization of
the electrical properties of donor/acceptor films. The idea is that only
undirectional current should flow in such films, i.e., in the direction donor
--> acceptor. The resultant devices would be of value due to their potential for
extreme miniaturization. Their application as chemical sensors would also be
possible with trivial modifications in the construction of the device.
