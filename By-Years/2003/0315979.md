Abstract - DEB 0315979&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A grant has been awarded to Dr. Rex
L. Lowe of Bowling Green State University and Dr. Jeffery Johansen of John
Carroll University to discover and document new species of algae in The Great
Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP). Lowe and Johansen, assisted by students
and teachers, will be conducting extensive and detailed surveys of rivers,
streams and waterfall spray-zones to better understand the patterns of
distribution of algae in the GSMNP and to discover and document new species of
algae.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algae comprise a diverse group of mostly microbial
photosynthetic organisms and constitute the beginnings of food chains in most
freshwater ecosystems yet little is currently known about what species of algae
are found in the park. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park comprises more
than half a million acres and is the largest contiguous preserve east of the
Rocky Mountains. The park serves as refuge for one of the richest and most
diverse collections of plants and animals in the temperate world, however, many
forms of life in the park are poorly known or entirely undiscovered. There is a
current effort underway by many scientists to document the biodiversity of this
important ecosystem. Lowe and Johansen will concentrate on two important groups
of algae, the diatoms and the cyanobacteria or blue green algae. These two
groups of algae appear to be the most diverse and wide-spread from initial
observations in the GSMNP. Initial surveys (the results of which can be viewed
on the World-wide Web) &lt;http://www.bgsu.edu/departments/biology/facilities/al
gae/smokeys/smokeys.html &gt; have already resulted in the discovery many new
species. The results of this research will provided a greater understanding of
the species richness and distribution patterns of algae within the GSMNP.
