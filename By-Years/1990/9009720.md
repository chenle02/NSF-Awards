The intent of this research is to develop explicit formal models for control of
flexible manufacturing cells. The models will add considerably to the
development of a science base for manufacturing, and towards addressing the
generic issues in control of manufacturing systems. A direct application of
these models would be in the development of automatic software generators for
cell control. This research presents a novel approach to control a flexible
manufacturing cell, where the control actions are executed as a by product of
grammar recognition. Each controller will be modeled as a layered parser capable
of recognizing a "manufacturing language", with the control actions embedded as
semantic actions within each control grammar. Specific activities include:
development of formal models of the physical and logical views of the
manufacturing cell, establishing equivalence of properties of the FMS cell to
context free grammars, defining the various semantic actions, and developing the
control grammars for various controllers in the system.
