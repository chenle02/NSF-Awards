Many of Earth's ecological systems face substantial future warming that could
cause loss of species, erode ecological functioning, and jeopardize
environmental services that support human livelihoods. Ecological theory
predicts that some species may be resilient to warming if individuals in warmer
parts of their distribution have already evolved greater tolerance of high
temperature and can migrate to cooler parts as they warm. Less clear is whether
these immigrants will be able to play the same functional roles as the former
residents; if not, ecological functions could still erode. To test this
question, this study will study populations of spider predators and insect prey
across a temperature gradient similar to the predicted change in global climate.
The thermal tolerances of spiders from north to south will be measured, spiders
and prey populations will be experimentally transplanted between parts of the
regions to mimic the mixing that might occur due to warming and migration, and
the differences in functioning between these experimentally mixed communities
and existing communities will be tested. The study will thus improve
understanding of the potential for evolution to confer the ability to tolerate
changes in climate and thereby increase the resiliency of species to
environmental change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will enhance
participation of women and minorities in STEM research in the context of
environmental problems. It will also help to train a globally diverse and
competitive STEM workforce through coursework and hands-on research experiences
in evidence-based, applied environmental science. The research infrastructure
will be leveraged to develop New Haven Public School STEM curricula on
environmental services, biodiversity, and effects of climate change.
