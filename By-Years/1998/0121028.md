The PIs will develop a flexible modeling environment that they will make broadly
available to the climate change community. This requires a radically new
approach to the organization, development, documentation and dissemination of
climate models. There is collaboration with Argonne National Laboratories for
development of the open source, providing an online textbook documenting its
use, and providing a system for collecting, testing, certifying and
disseminating modules developed elsewhere. The system will be developed within
the interpreted object-oriented Python language. This has been used successfully
for a range of other scientific applications. Work under this award will resolve
the grand-challenge mysteries facing climate science using coupled ocean-
atmosphere modeling. A confluence of developments of physical understanding,
numerical methods and computing power makes it feasible to address questions
related to different epochs in the paleoclimate record. The work is important
because it represents a testbed for novel software development approaches to
climate modeling. &lt;br/&gt;
