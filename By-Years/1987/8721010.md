Southeast Asia is a complex area of on-going convergence between the Asian,
Indian-Australian and Pacific plates. As such it forms a natural laboratory to
study the tectonic developments in an accretionary margin including the various
processes of backarc spreading, rifting, oblique subduction, transform motion
and collision. Paleomagnetic data is essential to following the various
translations and rotations of terranes accompanying these tectonic processes.
This project involves field sampling in several parts of the Philippines and
Malaysia to obtain paleomagnetic and age data to discriminate between the
various current models of the development of the area around the South China
Sea.
