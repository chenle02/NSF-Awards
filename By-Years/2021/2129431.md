This project will support an Alvin Science Verification Expedition to conduct
dives to abyssal depths, down to 6500m, in the Puerto Rico Trench and at the
Mid-Cayman Rise following completion of the major overhaul and
upgrade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The science verification expedition will test and
document the improved and new HOV Alvin systems and operations at increased
depths down to 6500m, made possible by the Alvin Upgrade. Science verification
activities will be guided by input from the community workshop (Summer 2020) on
priorities in abyssal research for the coming decade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project will offer early career scientists an opportunity to observe and
participate in an HOV Alvin expedition (most likely for the first time),
providing critical training to advance their research careers through the use of
this national asset.&lt;br/&gt;The project will engage with K-12 students and
researchers in nations and territories adjacent to work sites to ensure that
indigenous populations can participate in and benefit from the research
conducted. High-bandwidth ship-to-shore communications will be critical to this
effort as COVID restrictions will prevent in-person participation by these
scientists and students and will prevent the science party from being ashore in
these nations and territories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
