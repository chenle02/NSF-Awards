This study addresses the degree to which the water transport capacity of plants
limits their productivity. Specifically, we focus on the hydraulic properties of
tree stems and branches (the "xylem") in relation to the photosynthetic capacity
of the leaves. Our goal is to understand the physiological linkages between
vascular and photosynthetic capacity. We have chosen to address this fundamental
question by examining seasonally dry forest trees. Our rationale for this
reflects the important role that seasonal precipitation patterns play in
determining the longevity and productivity of leaves in these forests. We will
monitor the extent to which vascular tissues become damaged during periods of
low water availability (drought) and the effects that this has on the
productivity of leaves. Our study will be one of the first to examine directly
the link between vascular and photosynthetic capacity in trees. The results of
this work will increase our understanding of how plants copy with dramatic
changes in soil water availability, and will contribute to our knowledge of
factors influencing the productivity and ecology of seasonally dry tropical
forests.
