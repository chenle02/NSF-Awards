The objective of this research is to investigate, jointly with a researcher from
the University of Chihuahua, Mexico, the cause that led to a predominant type of
failure during the 1985 earthquake in Mexico City characterized by the collapse
of upper floors in reinforced concrete framed buildings. Based on the results of
the study, possible deficiencies in the Mexican and U.S. codes are identified
and alternative design recommendations are suggested.
