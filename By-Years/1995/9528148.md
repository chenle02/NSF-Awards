Abstract ATM-9528148 Stahle, David W. University of Arkansas Title: Select Tree-
ring Chronologies for Large-scale Paleoclimate Reconstruction Annual ring-width
chronologies derived from ancient trees present exactly-dated, strongly-
replicated archives of environmental history, and provide one of the premier
quantitative records of interannual to decadal climate variability during the
Holocene. Select tree-ring chronologies from northern Mexico and the southern
USA reflect both regional climate variations and changes in large- scale
atmospheric circulation. This award supports research designed to develop a
widely distributed array of long tree-ring chronologies in subtropical North
America that are sensitive to the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the
Pacific/North America (PNA) circulation pattern. Selected locations where the
most ENSO or PNA-sensitive chronologies occur will be revisited to sample
additional ancient trees, historic timbers in nearby buildings, or well-
preserved subfossil wood in order to compile the longest possible proxies of
past circulation. This project will also intensify the effort to develop the
first climate and ENSO- sensitive tree-ring chronologies in tropical East
Africa. The proposed ENSO and PNA reconstruction should provide unique insight
into the long-term variability of ENSO and/or its teleconnections; the possible
link between ENSO and global average temperature during the Medieval Warm
Period, Little Ice Age, and 20th century warming; and the possible
coupling/decoupling between ENSO and PNA in forcing climate anomalies over North
America.
