The primary objective of this U.S.-Czechoslovakia cooperative research project
between Dr. Kathryn A. McCarthy of Tufts University and Dr. Cestmir Barta of the
Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences' Institute of Physics is to study the
fundamental physical properties of mercurous halide crystals and lead halide
crystals. Since many properties of these materials exhibit anisotropy, they
offer extremely interesting media for examining the basic acoustic and optical
characteristics of such forms of condensed matter. New knowledge acquired may
clarify specific relationships among the measured physical properties and the
condition of growth and sample preparation as well as effects of external
conditions. This project in solid state physics research fulfills the program
objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United
States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research
resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
