This project analyzes communication in a class of games called sender-receiver
games. In such a game, a privately informed sender sends a message to a receiver
who then acts in response to the message. The sender and receiver obtain payoffs
that depend on the private information of the sender and the receiver's action,
and not on the message sent. Sender-receiver games are widely used to study
communication issues in accounting, finance, economics and political science
where the incentives of the sender and receiver are either perfectly or often
partially aligned. These games comprise a rich class of games extensively
outlined in theory because of their importance for understanding communication
in strategic situations. This project will derive a set of hypotheses concerning
the outcomes of these evolutionary games and experimental methods will be
employed to assess the performance of these hypotheses.
