Three research issues in high-performance VLSI system design are being
addressed: (1) how to relate the system performance function, characterized by
electrical parameters, to the geometrical parameters of the VLSI physical
design; (2) how to model performance driven VLSI physical designs based on given
technology and computational capability; and (3) how to characterize the
fundamental computational aspects of modeled problems and develop effective
algorithms for solving them. A distributed RLC circuit model for interconnects
is being designed. It considers: non-monotone circuit response, coupling effect
among the signal lines, and low energy consumption. Efficient computation
methods that solve time-varying Maxwell equations using the adaptive wavelet
collocation method (AWCM) are being devised. The algorithms and methods are
being included in a CAD system.
