This engineering education research project seeks to develop a proof-of-concept
peer review matching algorithm and demonstrate if it is a valuable and viable
methodology for conducting peer review. Peer review is a proven method that has
positive impact on student learning. The project will test the algorithm on
Model Eliciting Activities in the engineering classroom, and investigate how
changing peer review can affect student learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader significance and importance of this project is the transformative
potential of improving peer review processes, since peer review is used
throughout STEM and medical fields. Thus this preliminary investigation can
extend outside the realm of improving student learning. This project overlaps
with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of
an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise. Additionally NSF's
goal of innovating for society is enabled by supporting the development of
innovative learning systems.
