This proposal is for funds to partially defray expenses for domestic
transportation, subsistence, and proceedings publication for a Conference on
Particle Production Near Threshold. This conference is one in a series spanning
10 years held nearby Indiana University and McCormack State Park. The meeting
has direct importance to the planned research program at the Indiana University
Cyclotron Facility. This years conference deals with many forefront issues that
will be attacked by the newly operational IUCF cooled beam facility and by
facilities under construction abroad, as well as some of the existing nuclear
and particle facilities. Included among the subjects are threshold behavior of
pion, kaon, eta, and charmed meson production, as well as nucleon resonance and
hyperon production.
