Robert Wood from University of Delaware is supported by a grant from the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his experimental
thermodynamic research on aqueous solutions at high temperature. Wood will
measure electrical conductance of aqueous solutions of a variety of salts at
temperatures from 350 to 425 degrees Centigrade and pressures up to 28 MPa in
order to determine ionic association constants. In collaboration with scientists
at Oak Ridge National Lab Wood plans to construct an instrument capable of
extending these measurements to 650 degrees Centigrade and 300 MPa. The ionic
association constants thus measured, together with heat capacity and volumes of
a variety of salts and nonelectrolytes near the critical point, will be used to
construct accurate models for aqueous salt solutions near the critical point for
water. Wood will also use this data to develop model classical Hamiltonians for
use in performing simulations in extrapolated regions of temperature and
pressure. High temperature aqueous solutions play an important role in a wide
variety of industrial and natural processes. Examples of these processes are
mineral transport, deposition and alteration, hydrocarbon formation, migration
and accumulation, electric power boiler corrosion, and hydrothermal reservoir
utilization. There is also interest in using supercritical water as a reaction
medium for oxidative degradation of hazardous waste, conversion of coal to
gasoline, and as a reaction medium for organic synthesis to replace conventional
organic solvents. Wood's research will help to provide a basic understanding of
ionic solutions at high temperatures and pressures which is fundamentally
important to the efficient development of industrial uses of supercritical water
