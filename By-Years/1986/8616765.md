Boughn The objectives of this research are to bring new observational techniques
to bear on the problem of galaxy formation. How and when galaxies and other
large bound systems in the Universe form is not well understood. The detection
of primeval galaxies, galaxies forming their first generation of stars early in
the history of the Universe and hence at high redshift, would be a major step
forward. No such objects have yet been found despite more than a decade of
effort. Two new techniques will be used to investigate primeval galaxies. The
first is to look for the summed light from many primeval galaxies rather than
for individual objects. The Principal Investigators (PIs) will do so by
measuring the brightness of the night sky at near infrared wavelengths using a
balloon-borne, cooled telescope. The second is to make careful studies of
possible local analogs of primeval galaxies, nearby systems which are currently
undergoing massive bursts of star formation. The PIs will look for a
characteristic feature or "tag" of star formation which could then be used to
identify primeval galaxies at much greater distances. Radio frequency
observations will be made of a range of star-forming systems at low redshifts,
and also of the "blue galaxies" at redshifts 0.1-1.0, which may be at an
intermediate stage of evolution between local starburst galaxies and true
primeval galaxies. Drs. Partridge and Boughn will carry out collaborative
research with Italian scientists from the University of Bologna as part of their
research. The research will involve undergraduate students at Haverford College.
