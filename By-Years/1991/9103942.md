In vivo and in vitro investigations are proposed on non-B DNA structures
including intramolecular triplexes and other non-B right-handed conformations at
oligopurine.oligopyrimidine tracts. Studies will be conducted on naturally
occurring pur.pyr sequences to attempt to establish biological functions in
prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Also, systems will be investigated where
synthetic pur.pyr tracts are cloned specifically at certain loci to attempt to
elucidate biochemical behaviors. Biological systems include replication and
transcription. Direct determinations will be established to evaluate the
existence and properties in vivo of non-B DNA oligopurine.oligopyrimidine
structures in plasmids and chromosomes. Several probes will be utilized
including UV photofootprinting, KMnO4, and methylase expression systems. In
vitro emphases include: elucidation of other types (non- triplex) of non-B DNA
structures at pur.pyr tracts; conditions which stabilize these structures and
their mechanisms of formation; enzymes (such as methylases, restriction enzymes)
as conformational probes; the effect of flanking sequences on thermodynamics,
kinetics, and structures; the effect of methylation of C residues; and the
isolation and characterization of proteins that specifically bind these non-B
conformations. These studies should provide significant insight into the
biological and chemical properties of pur.pyr tracts which are found in a
variety of biologically important systems.
