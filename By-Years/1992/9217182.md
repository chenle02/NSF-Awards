The importance of Asian dust-Fe on phytoplankton species composition will be
examined and the Fe limitation hypothesis will be tested across a dust gradient
in the macronutrient rich water of the Subarctic Pacific from Kamchatka to
Station P. In situ changes in phytoplankton species composition will be
determined by HPLC pigment analyses and microscopy. In addition, the project
will determine the physiological status of diatoms and prokaryotic algae across
this high to low dust gradient in a relatively unstudied area of the Subarctic
Pacific Ocean.
