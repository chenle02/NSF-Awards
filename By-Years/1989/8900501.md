This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site project is in the areas
of chemistry and biochemistry. For a three-year period beginning in April 1989
eight (8) undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks engaged in
fundamental, "hands-on" research, under the direction of faculty members from
the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. The research projects offer a very
broad exposure to chemical research. A unique feature of the REU site activity
is the departmental commitment to funding of participants to attend a regional
ACS meeting, regardless of whether a paper is to be presented.of Chemistry and
Materials Science.
