Photosystem II catalyzes O2 evolution and provides electrons that are used for
sugar synthesis in photosynthesis. The O2-evolving reaction is catalyzed by 4 Mn
atoms and requires a key protein subunit, manganese stabilizing protein, that
controls Mn binding and rapid O2 evolution. This research project will
characterize how manganese stabilizing protein's structure allows it to perform
its role in O2 evolution. One set of experiments will identify amino acid
sequences at the N-terminus of the protein that are essential for photosystem II
binding, and that may also be required for Mn stability and rapid O2 production.
A second research objective will further characterize manganese stabilizing
protein's "natively unfolded" behavior in solution. The protein's unusual
thermostability will be exploited as a probe to extend the characterization of
its unusual solution structure and determine the extent to which the single
-S-S- bond can be shown to be necessary for the thermostability of manganese
stabilizing protein. Related experiments will determine whether solution
structure changes in some mutant types of manganese stabilizing protein can be
demonstrated to correlate with their assembly into photosystem II, and whether
the integrity of the enzyme's Mn cluster affects this process. A third research
project will explore the role of a highly conserved amino acid, arginine, that
appears to be essential for manganese stabilizing protein's ability to promote
the catalytic activity of the Mn cluster. These experiments will be coupled with
analyses of structure and function of manganese stabilizing protein to discover
why other changes in this amino acid residue produce unusual changes in
manganese stabilizing protein activity without apparent changes in the protein's
solution structure.
