Abstract CTS-0114190 N. Jensen, University of California - Davis

An International Conference on Computational Nanoscience is planned for the
period between March 18-21, 2001 in Hilton Head, South Carolina. Its main
purpose is to bring together experts from the fields of computational biology,
chemistry and material sciences in combination with their industrial end users.
It is to be run in parallel (space and time), with the fourth International
Conference on Modeling and Simulation of Microsystems. It is hoped that maximum
synergy will be obtained in this manner. In particular, emphasis will be given
to the recent advances in molecular dynamics and ab initio methods, and to their
applications to the design of semi-conductors, drugs and biodiagnostics. The
interaction of speakers, researchers, students and private sector representative
will result in the interchange of ideas and the stimulation and technical
innovation. The conference is co-funded by both the Division of Chemical and
Transport Systems and The Division of Materials Research.
