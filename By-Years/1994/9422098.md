In this project, which is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and
Organometallic Chemistry Program, Dr. Richard C. Holz of Utah State University
will undertake a study of the roles that the individual metal ions in
multinuclear hydrolytic enzymes play in their catalytic reactions. The initial
phase of the work will be built around studies of the dinuclear Zn(II)
aminopeptidase from Vibrio proteolytica, for which a plasmid is available that
can be used to overexpress the enzyme in E. coli. The approach will involve
substitution of individual zinc ions in the enzyme with spectroscopically active
Co(II), Ni(II) or Cu(II) ions, which have already been demonstrated to also show
enhanced enzymatic activity. Cadmium(II) will also be used for substitution in
some studies. Methods to be used include UV-VIS, NMR, EPR and EXAFS
spectroscopies, as well as steady state kinetics. Specific questions to be
considered include: 1) What is the nature and geometry of the ligands upon
substitution with other metal ions such that hyperactivity is obtained. 2) What
specific role does each metal center play in catalysis? 3) How do substrates
interact with the dinuclear active site? and 4) Does one or both metal ions
serve as a Lewis acid to bind and activate a water molecule for the hydrolysis
reaction? Hydrolytic enzymes that contain more than one metal ion (multinuclear
enzymes) have been demonstrated to exist only recently. The mechanisms by which
these enzymes effect catalysis are presently unknown. This research is designed
to determine the role that the individual metal ions play in the catalytic
reaction. The results may lead to the development of synthetic enzymes that can
be used in biotechnology.
