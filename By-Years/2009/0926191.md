This proposal will be awarded using funds made available by the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5), and meets the
requirements established in Section 2 of the White House Memorandum entitled,
Ensuring Responsible Spending of Recovery Act Funds, dated March 20,
2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will support the development
of middleware that will enable numerical models to be run on commercial compute
farms via cloud computing and exploited in ongoing and future classroom
educational activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this work
derives from two linked parts: (1) development of technology that would be
suitable for many educational scenarios, including providing access to parallel
computing resources in classrooms (K-12 on to university). Students and teachers
would be able to run and interact with numerical models developed by leading
researchers without the overhead of supporting software distributed to desktops
in a school or the logistical headache of maintaining a cluster resource.
Commercial compute farms would be exploited in which the technical `nitty-
gritty' is outsourced to these specialized providers. (2) showcasing the
technology in a `virtual fluid laboratory' that will be used in ongoing
undergraduate and graduate courses being offered at MIT and collaborating
universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad impacts arise as the software
technology that will be developed is very general and could be applied to make
computer models part of almost any course available in, for example, MIT's Open
Course Ware initiative. It can release the power of compute clusters to anyone
with a low cost laptop or `netbook' computer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
