The long-term goals of this project are to better understand how the vertebrate
kidney controls inorganic phosphate and sulfate. These are vital nutrients with
roles in almost every aspect of metabolism and growth. Both must be regulated;
relatively small changes in their plasma concentrations have large effects on
bone, cartilage, cellular metabolism, calcium availability, hepatic
detoxification, etc. Better understanding of the regulation of these anions can
be gained by understanding the differences as well as the similarities among
vertebrate groups. Dietary intake, intestinal absorption and renal excretion are
the sole determinants, aside from growth, of an animal's phosphate and sulfate
balance. The kidneys are the most important site of regulation of excretion of
these nutrients in the body. Likely mechanisms regulating phosphate and sulfate
transport in members of two vertebrate classes (winter flounder and chicken)
will be defined by the work proposed here. Methods are used which permit
characterization of control of excretion at tissue, cell and molecular levels.
The first objective is to determine the role of parathyroid hormone-related-
peptide in the renal regulation of phosphate by a marine teleost. Preliminary
data support a role in renal phosphate secretion, and we will further examine
the effect on the flounder's renal phosphate clearance, plasma hormone titer,
and renal receptor levels. The sec-ond objective is to assess the role of a
regulated, reversible association of the enzyme, carbonic anhydrase II, with the
kidney's mechanisms for the handling of inorganic sulfate. A regulatory role for
association of this enzyme with the sulfate excretion mechanisms is
hypothesized. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
