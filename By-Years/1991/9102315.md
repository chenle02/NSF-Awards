This proposal outlines plans to improve existing multiple etalon Fabry-Perot
instruments and to evaluate carefully the application of a new interferometric
technique, Spatial Heterodyne Spectroscopy, for problems within the CEDAR
initiative in upper atmosphere studies. Through this effort progress will be
made on the important class of research projects in optical aeronomy in which
extracting work signals from background noise is particularly difficult. These
projects include: 1) the study of work H-alpha emissions from the exosphere; and
2) the study of 6300 oxygen emission in the daytime thermosphere.***//
