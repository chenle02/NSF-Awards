Chemistry (12) This proof of concept project is addressing the revitalization of
the physical chemistry curriculum through the development of a cohesive set of
context-rich materials to supplement physical chemistry lecture courses. In the
form of modules, these materials interweave historical, biographical, and
technical perspectives on modern research areas related to physical chemistry.
They are designed to directly engage students with examples drawn from the
primary literature using a mix of conceptual questions and quantitative problems
and provide instructors with a resource that can be easily integrated into
either a traditional lecture course or an active learning environment at a wide
variety of institutions. The project is utilizing a cohort of adopters to both
assess and refine the materials. Tested modules along with supporting
documentation are being disseminated through a web site.
