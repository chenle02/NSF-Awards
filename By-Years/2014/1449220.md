Remarkable progress in the understanding of the brain in recent years is due in
part to the increasing role that theory and computational methods are playing in
the design of experiments and interpretation of data. The annual Computational
and Systems Neuroscience (Cosyne) conference promotes this process by providing
an inclusive forum for the exchange of experimental and
theoretical/computational approaches to problems in systems neuroscience. This
purpose of this project is to broaden participation at the Cosyne meeting to
include more individuals from under-represented groups through a continuing
travel grant program targeting early-career scientists, and a new program of
mentored travel awards for undergraduates. Both programs will be active for the
2015, 2016, and 2017 Cosyne meetings.
