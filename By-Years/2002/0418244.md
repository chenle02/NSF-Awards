This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop and validate zebrafish assays for testing of industrial chemicals for
developmental neurotoxicity with reduced cost and shorter turn around times
compared with available methods.

The commercial application of this project will be in the area of environmental
toxicology. The impact of neurotoxins on the development of fetuses and children
has been established for a few contaminants such as lead, but remains largely
unexplored for most contaminants. Therefore, the development of a proven animal
model will be both scientifically and commercially useful.
