Development of a Laser Laboratory at the University of Houston- Clear Lake
provides hands-on experience on electrooptics components and instruments for
majors in the Electro-Optics program. The laboratory uses a number of projects
using various kinds of lasers such as argon ion, CO21, dye, HeNe, and diode
lasers. Some of the projects involve the studies of resonator designs, beam
parameters, and frequency characteristics of these lasers. Others involve the
applications of these lasers in holography, optical data storage, image
processing, phase conjugation, harmonic generation, and self-focusing. Short
projects are used to form a formal course "Electro-Optics Laboratory II" and the
longer ones are used as "Independent Projects." In addition to the lasers
mentioned above, some diagnostic instruments such as a digital oscilloscope, a
personal computer, an spectrum analyzer, and a few detectors are used for the
projects. The developed Laser Laboratory serves as a "model" that can be ported
to other schools who emphasize or offer programs in optics or photonics.
