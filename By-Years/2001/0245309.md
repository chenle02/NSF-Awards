The objective of this research is to create and validate new methods of
controlling the flow of plastic melts in polymer processes such as extrusion and
injection molding. This research is motivated by lack
of&lt;br/&gt;controllability common in polymer processing, which prevents the
efficient and consistent production of high quality products. To overcome
existing constraints related to size and power consumption,
the&lt;br/&gt;research will investigate design approaches that are powered
predominantly by the polymer melt and require little or no control energy.
Furthermore, the size of the devices will be reduced until dominating mechanical
and rheological constraints are identified. The research will be conducted at
both theoretical and applied levels with close interaction with industry.
Theoretical models will be developed to simulate the polymer flow through the
melt control devices, thereby enabling the rapid development and optimization of
improved designs. At the the applied level, extensive industrial collaboration
is providing the opportunity to implement and validate the research relative to
industry requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide
fundamental advances towards improved characterization the polymer processes as
well as enabling technologies for improved manufacturing processes. Finally, the
research will enhance the existing educational infrastructure, and be
transferred to industry through improved undergraduate, graduate, and continuing
education courses.&lt;br/&gt;
