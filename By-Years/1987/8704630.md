The San Diego Natural History Museum houses one of the oldest and most diverse
collections of western North American amphibians and reptiles in the United
States. Dating from the late 1800's, the collection is recognized for its large
and comprehensive series of rattlesnakes and sceloporine lizards, among other
taxa from the far West, Baja California, and northern Mexico. Less well known
but increasing rapidly in size and significance is the collection of reptile and
amphibian skeletons. The approximately 31,000 reprints and books in the
Departmental and Klauber libraries are also regarded as an important resource by
the scientific community. Thus the San Diego Natural History Museum contains one
of the most important regional herpetological collections in North America.
During the past five years, the Department of Herpetology has undergone many
positive changes in policy and productivity with the aim of modernizing the
collections, stabilizing curatorial procedures and increasing the use and value
of the facilities. This project will continue that trajectory by implementing
computer management of the collection catalogue. Funding will provide
appropriate hardware, software, professional consultation and a half-time data
entry person. These improvements are directly related to increasing the use of
the collection and preserving its value to herpetology.
