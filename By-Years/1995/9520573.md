9520573 Magee This award is a collaborative three-year project to be studied
jointly at both the New Jersey Institute of Technology's Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center for Hazardous Waste Management and the Queen's
University Environmental Science and Technology Center (QUESTOR) at Belfast,
Northern Ireland, UK. The study is designed to improve the effectiveness and
efficiency of water processing facilities that use flocculation for
purification. The QUESTOR researchers have been funded by a consortium of local
industries to design, build and operate a pilot water treatment plant to devise
new approaches to the use of flocculation additives to extend the range and
efficiency of flocculative cleaning. The I/UCRC studies will focus on some
fundamental aspects of the fluid dynamics of flocculators. By determining the
spacial distribution of local velocity gradients in a number of flocculation
vessal configurations, the velocity gradient time integral for a generic floc
particle moving in the flocculator can be determined. This can be used to
accurately quantify the value of this key parameter for a number of flocculation
configurations to determine floc aggregation and breakage. The study should
elucidate the fundamental fluid dynamic aspects of flocculation for process
improvement in water purification.
