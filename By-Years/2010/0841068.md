Abstrast&lt;br/&gt;Gursky&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks funding for
the conference Nonlinear Geometric Analysis, to be held at Princeton University
from Thursday, October 30 to Sunday, November 2, 2008. The goal is to bring
together speakers from a broad cross-section of the discipline, and to
disseminate recent advances in a forum which includes established and junior
researchers. The speakers of the conference represent several important areas of
development in the field, for example conformal geometry, fully nonlinear and
higher order elliptic equations, and nonlinear evolution equations. This
conference is timed to coincide with a year long program titled Geometric
Partial Differential Equations at the Institute for Advanced Study, and the
conference will both complement and benefit from that program. It aims to
present young researchers with an accessible and detailed picture of the field,
including the historical context, recent highlights, connections to other areas,
important current results and open problems. Fully 63% of the proposed budget
will be devoted to the support of graduate students and postdoctoral
researchers.&lt;br/&gt;
