This research is concerned with fundamental studies of liquid crystal material
confined to small spherical and cylindrical cavities. Both experimental and
theoretical studies will be conducted. The ultimate aim is to obtain an
understanding of polymer dispersed liquid crystals used in displays, optical
processor, and electrooptic devices. Deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance and
optical birefringence are used to determine the nematic structure in cavities
(0.01 to 10 micrometer in diameter) and to measure certain surface elastic
constants such as the saddle-bend surface elastic constant for micro-confined
systems for the first time. Also, molecular anchoring strength will be measured
to gain better understanding of the chemical effects on surface anchoring.
