Scott M. LeGrand has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. LeGrand's doctoral degree was from the Pennsylvania State
University under the supervision of Professor Kenneth Merz. Dr. Le Grand will
continue research at UCLA under the sponsorship of Professor David Eisenberg.
Dr. LeGrand's postdoctoral training will provide him with the skills necessary
to develop innovative approaches to tertiary DNA structure prediction and
specifically algorithms for the protein folding problem. Longer term, he plans
to study the use of an evolutionary arms race to develop knowledge-based
potential functions for protein tertiary structure prediction. %%% The
Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important
infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new
Ph.D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical
research and teaching.
