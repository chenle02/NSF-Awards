ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collaboratory for Oceanographic Research
Instrumentation as On-line Laboratory Instruction Sources
(CORIOLIS)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is building and testing an on-line
instrumented collaboratory for use in college-level oceanography courses. The
goal is to test the educational merits of conducting laboratory exercises
online, relative to traditional hands-on access to instrumentation. Instrumented
systems that can be accessed via the Internet, and from which students will be
able to remotely control instruments, monitor data and sample collection, share
and analyze their data, and use links to on-line information sources are located
at teaching laboratories. For two consecutive semesters, laboratory sections of
the same oceanography course will be used as test groups (on-line laboratory
users) and as control groups (in-house labs). The project will be assessed for
both technical success (construction of a functioning collaboratory) and student
outcomes. The collaboratory also provides a proof-of-concept for sharing access
to expensive scientific instrumentation via the Internet (for education or
research). Sharing allows concentration of expensive resources at centralized
on-line facilities eliminates the prohibitive costs of purchasing and
maintaining instrumentation at thousands of educational institutions.&lt;br/&gt;
