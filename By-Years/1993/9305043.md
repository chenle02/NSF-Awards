The Department of Mathematics at the University of Rochester will purchase some
computer and software which will be dedicated to the support of research in the
mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for the following five
research projects: (1) Computational homotopy theory (Frederick R. Cohen and
Douglas C. Ravenel) (2) Simulations of stochastic processes (Michael Cranston
and Carl E. Mueller) (3) Evolution of curves and surfaces (Michael E. Cage) (4)
Inverse problems for partial differential equations (Adrian I. Nachman) (5)
Ramanujan graphs and number theory (Arnold K. Pizer) The Principal Investigators
are Arnold K. Pizer and Douglas C. Ravenel.
