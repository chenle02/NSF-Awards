This study of materials at ultralow temperatures will center on four areas. The
first, properties of Helium-3 at boundaries, studies questions about magnetism
and heat conduction of Helium-3 at interfaces where the bulk properties are
drastically modified. The second study, superfluid Helium-3, probes the
properties of flowing superfluid, zero sound, high field effects, and changes in
thermodynamic properties along the phase boundary. The third study, hot
electrons in two dimensional systems, examines the feasibility of studying
electron transport properties in the millidegree temperature range. The fouth
study is the development of ultrlow temperature techniques.
